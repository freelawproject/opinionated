On the trial, the defendants moved the court to instruct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>the iury, that if they believed from the evidence, that <em>J J. </em>. , the consideration of the covenant was one hundred and forty-two shares of the stock of the <em>Farmers ianlc of Vir- </em>^ ginia, lent by the plaintiffs\u2019 testator to <em>William Mitchell </em>the first named covenantor, for twelve months from the date of the said covenant, of the value, at the time of the loan, of one hundred dollars each share, and that the thirty shares, additional to the said 142 shares, were reserved and agreed to be paid in consideration of the forbearance of the said 142 shares for 12 months from the date of the covenant, and that the value of the 30 shares, so reserved and payable 12 months after date, was greatly more than six per <em>centum </em>on the value of the said 142 shares so lent, that the 30 shares were worth in fair market, if sold on the said 23d of March 1816, deliverable twelve months after date, at least 50 dollars per share, and that both parties so understood it, and intended to secure to the said <em>Harvey </em>for the loan aforesaid a compensation of the value aforesaid,-\u2014then, upon the third plea upon which issue was joined, the defendants were entitled <em>to </em>a verdict, and this without any reference to the question whether <em>Harvey </em>would gain or lose by the rise or fall of the market price of the 142 shares of stock so lent: which instruction the court refused to give, but instructed the jury, that if they should be satisfied from the evidence, that the whole of the consideration of the covenant, which passed from <em>Harvey to Mitchell </em>&amp;c. was 142 shares of bank stock, worth at the time 100 dollars each, and that the same was lent and received by the parties as and for 14,200 dollars, to be returned, at the day given, in stock of 142 shares, with the addition of 30 shares, the contract to give and receive the 30 shares aforesaid did not necessarily make the whole or any part of the contract between the parties corrupt or usurious, because the whole 172 shares to be returned at the day given might not be worth as much as, or more than, the whole of the 142 shares at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>the time they were delivered; but to make the covenant or contract corrupt or usurious, it must be proved to the satisfaction of the jury, that the parties agreed upon , , _ . n J . , <em>\\ . </em>,. , \\ the value or the shares lent, with their dividends or mterest, and for the premium to be paid by <em>Mitchell </em>&amp;c. for forbearance and giving day, which premium was more than six <em>per cent, </em>upon the value of the subject lent, and that, to secure such excessive premium, it was also agreed by and between the parties to give and receive the aforesaid 30 shares as an equivalent for such excessive premium; and further instructed the jury, that if they should believe from the evidence, that 142 shares of bank stock were either lent or sold by <em>Harvey </em>to <em>Mitchell </em>&amp;c. for 172 shares to be returned at a future day in kind, without stipulating as to the value of the shares, each speculating upon the greater or less value of stock at such future day, so that <em>Haney </em>might lose and <em>Mitchell </em>&amp;c. gain if the value or price of stock were less at such future day, the contract was not usurious in consequence of the fact that, at the day of payment, the value of the stock was such, that <em>Harvey </em>should receive, in 172 shares, more than the value of 142 shares with interest at the time he lent or sold them. To which opinion of the court the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-5\">The defendants holding the affirmative of the issues, their counsel claimed the right of opening and concluding the argument of the cause before the jury, and moved the court to permit him to open and conclude, but the court overruled the motion and allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to open and conclude.

And the defendants appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b533-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>The cause was argued here by <em>Johnson </em>for the appellants, and <em>C. Robinson </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJZ\">I. <em>Johnson </em>said, the third plea was intended to raise the question whether there might be usury where the loan was not of money but of some other thing to be returned <em>ejusdem generis. </em>The plea does not take the broad ground that a loan of 100 bushels of wheat in June 1835, with a covenant to return 120 in June 1836, is necessarily usurious. But it takes the ground that a loan of 100 bushels, with a covenant to return what the parties intend to be more in value than the 100 bushels with six <em>per cent, </em>interest, is usury. He referred to the statute 1 Rev. Code, ch. 102. $ 1. p. 373. which provides that \u201cno person shall, upon any contract, take directly or indirectly, for loan of any money, <em>wares or merchandize or other commodity, </em>above the value of six dollars for the forbearance of one hundred dollars for a year,\u201d and said that to reject this plea would be to strike words out of the act. It would be argued that ihe stock to be returned might at the end of a year be worth Jess than the stock received; but mere possibilities ought not to be looked to. The court should look to the probabilities on which parties negotiate. A reservation of that which is plainly and obviously at the time worth more than what interest would be, must be usury. If this were not so, he asked, how could there be usury in commodities? Suppose a sum of money be lent of which the interest would be 30 dollars, and in lieu of interest there be reserved the use of a valuable plantation or slave,'\u2014a plantation which has habitually rented, or a slave that has uniformly hired, for 100 dollars,\u2014ho enquired whether this would not be usury? The circumstance that, the thing reserved was variable in value, he admitted, would put it upon the party to shew the intent. Here, he said, the intent was averred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-f\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>The court also, he insisted, committed an error in refusing to give the instruction asked at the trial, and in ^e instruction which it did give.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A95\">II. <em>Johnson </em>contended, that the court erred in rejecting the fifth and sixth pleas. They presented the question whether it could be pleaded at law that some of the obligors were sureties, and that such dealing had taken place between the creditor and principal debtor as would discharge the sureties. That equity would give relief upon proof of the facts pleaded, he said was clear, and it seemed to him that when equity had established a rule giving relief in a particular state of facts, the law ought to conform. He cited <em>Moore </em>v. Bowmaker, 6 Taunt. 379. 1 Eng. C. L. R. 417. <em>Samuell </em>v. <em>Howarth, </em>3 Meriv. 272. <em>Pain </em>v. <em>Packard &amp;c. </em>13 Johns. 174. <em>King </em>v. <em>Baldwin, 2 </em>Johns. Ch. Rep. 554. <em>S. C. </em>17 Johns. 384. He compared a plea of this kind to a plea of usury, and did not see why the facts which went to discharge the obligors might not be pleaded in the one case as well as the other. The law should follow equity, as it had done in cases of penalties. Under the act in 1 Rev. Code, ch. 116. 6. p. 461. it had been decided that a surety might set up at law the discharge created by that act. <em>Wright\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Stockton, </em>5 Leigh 153. And he did not perceive how the relief, where it was against the whole'demand, could be had more effectually under a statute than under the doctrines of the common law. He adverted to the defence allowed in cases of fraud, and said, that modern legislation was in favour of allowing defences of this nature at law, and such legislation ought to have weight. Acts of 1830-31, ch. 11. \u00a7 62. p. 62. Supp. to Rev. Code, ch. 109. \u00a7 62. p. 157.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdK5\">III.

The statute might apply to loans of stock as iTi well as of money. Thus, if the owner o\u00ed stock shall authorize another to sell it and receive the proceeds, and take from the other a covenant to transfer back to the lender, at the expiration of a year, the same amount of stock, and to pay the lender the dividends in the mean time, and likewise take a,separate bond for the principal and interest, so that the lender, were it not for the statute, might enforce either the agreement to return the stock and pay the dividends, or the obligation to pay principal and interest, this would be usury. For neither principal nor interest would be at hazard. The creditor would at the end of a year have a certain claim to that extent, with a chance of getting more if there should be a rise in the price of stock. <em>White &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>3 Barn. &amp; Cress. 273. 10 Eng. C. L. Rep. 75. So if the obligation be that the borrower shall, at a future day, pay the lender his principal or transfer to him a given quantity of stock, at his election, and in the mean time pay interest, here, as the creditor is sure of having at least his principal with legal interest, and has the chance of an advantage if the stock shall rise, it has been held to be usury. <em>Barnard </em>v. <em>Young, </em>17 Ves. 44.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-8\">On the other hand, If a party lends stock, which the borrower sells, and gives bond to replace the stock at a given time, and in the mean time to pay lawful interest on the sum produced by the sale, this clearly is not usurious. <em>Forrest </em>v. <em>Elwes, </em>4 Ves. 492. In such case, If the stock were to rise, the lender might have more than principal and legal Interest. Yet on the other hand, if it should fall, he would have less. The same principle would apply, if, in lieu of interest in the mean lime, the dividends should be reserved by way of interest, for in this case, as in the last, the price of stock might fall and the borrower would then be a gainer. <em>Bailey, J. </em>in <em>White &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>10 Eng.

Where there is none, the law allows a loan of stock, to be replaced at a future day. Whether the quantity to be returned is the precise quantity lent, or be more or less, is immaterial. The shares stipulated to be returned, though more in number than those received, may turn out of no greater value at the time they are returned, than those received were at the time of receiving them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-10\">He referred to 1 Hawkins\u2019 P.

Most of these were cases in which the payment depended upon the return of a ship, or upon <em>the life or </em>death of a party; cases therefore, in which the time of payment might never arrive, and the lender, in consideration of this risk, had a chance of getting more than legal interest. The following cases were also referred to, corning within the same class. <em>Shapley </em>v. <em>Hurrel, </em>Cro.

The remaining class referred to was like the case before the court, where the time of payment would certainly arrive, but it would depend upon the value of the commodity at the time of payment, whether what was agreed to be paid would be more or less than principal and legal interest,\u2014cases in which the contingency justified the contract; a contingency of such a nature, that a portion, perhaps the whole, of the principal and interest might be lost. <em>Maddock </em>v. <em>Rumball &amp;c. </em>8 East 304. <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Wettings, </em>3 T. R. 531. <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Ledwell &amp;c. </em>5 Esp. N. P. Cas. 164. <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Tilden &amp;c. </em>5 Cow. 144. <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Wetmore, </em>5 Cow. 149. note. <em>Cumming </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>4 Wend. 679. <em>Hamlin </em>v. <em>Fitch, </em>cited 5 Cow. 149. The three first were cases of stock, the three next, cases for the return of cows and sheep, and the last a case of military certificates.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-12\">The court, he said, would understand that he did not contend, that where the form adopted was a shift to evade the statute, the contingency or risk would prevent the application of the statute. If there be a loan,\u2014 if there be a corrupt contract to take, directly or indirectly, above the value of six dollars for the <em>forbearance </em>of 100 dollars, then the contract is void, no matter what the shift or device. But these things, he contended, must be made out by the plea and the evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-13\">He stated the nature of the issues joined on the first and second pleas, and the finding on those issues, and said, that by the finding it was ascertained that there was no loan, at usurious interest, of money which the party originally had, nor of money proceeding from the sale of his stock; and that the covenant was not a shift or device to evade the laws against usury either of the one kind or the other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>- If the matter set forth in the third plea was usury, he said, every contract in <em>Virginia </em>for the hire of a slave was usurious. The slave, it was true, might die before the end of the year, and so the stock might become of no value. In the case of a slave hired, or a plantation rented, for more than six <em>per cent, </em>upon the value, the owner is deprived in the mean time of the privilege of selling, except subject to the tenancy. This is an injury for which he has a right to be compensated. In the case of stock, the injury is greater. During the year the stock might rise to a .very high price, far greater than that which the borrower might have agreed to pay. Yet the former owner of the stock, no longer having it to sell, would be unable to get this advanced price. In many of the joint stock companies, a borrower might often, for 142 shares obtained immediately, agree to pay 172 a year afterwards, and yet pay no more in value than he received. Even in relation to the stock of the bank of <em>Virginia, </em>or <em>Farmers </em>bank, it seemed at present highly probable that 172 shares of stock would not bring in the market, twelve months hence, more than 142 shares now, with the addition of the interest in the mean time. Such a bargain as was made by <em>Mitchell </em>might therefore at this moment be advantageous to a borrower.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-9\">The plea cannot be helped by the general allegation in the commencement, that it was corruptly and against the form of the act of assembly agreed &amp;c. The agreement actually set forth is not against the statute, nor is it alleged to have been a shift or device to evade the statute. That the parties intended to secure more than the value of the stock at the time of the loan, with six <em>per cent, </em>on its value, or that the covenant was devised with intent to secure more, is no where alleged in the third plea. It is the <em>fourth </em>plea which avers, that the value of the 30 shares was well known to the parties, and that they were agreed to be paid as a premium for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number><em>the </em>forbearance, with the intent of the parties to secure to the creditor upon the loan, more than the value of six dollars for one year for each 100 dollars. The court received this plea, and in receiving it has gone - far enough.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-4\">II. <em>Robinson </em>said, the matter relied on in the <em>fifth </em>and <em>sixth </em>pleas could not be made a ground of defence at law against a sealed obligation. <em>Moor </em>v. <em>Bowmaker </em>merely acknowledges the rule as to relieving bail. And <em>Pain </em>v. <em>Packard, King </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>and <em>Samuell </em>v. <em>Howarth, </em>are cases of instruments not under seal. Where a statute declares <em>that </em>certain facts shall make a contract void, it is clear that those facts may be pleaded and proved, whether the obligation be under seal or not. This is the case under the statute against usury. So if the consideration be illegal and the obligation void at common law, it may upon common law principles be enquired into. But if the obligation be under seal and valid at the time of its execution, it can, at common law, only be dissolved by being cancelled and surrendered, or by performance of the condition, or a release. Whether it appear on the face of the instrument that the party is a surety, or not, is immaterial. The cases of <em>Bulteel &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Jarrold, </em>8 Price 467. 3 Eng. Exch. Rep. 422. <em>Davey &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Prendergrass, 5 </em>Barn. &amp; Ald. 187. 7 Eng. C. L. Rep. 62. and <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>6 Munf. 6. shew conclusively that the defence set up by the 5th and 6th pleas can never be made at law against a sealed obligation. The statute may certainly authorize an obligation to be discharged by that which would not have discharged it before; and then it may be shewn to the court that such a case exists as comes within the statute. The act in 1 Rev. Code, ch. 116. \u00a7 6. p. 461. under which <em>Wright\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Stockton </em>was decided, is of this description. So under the statute, payment after the <em>day, </em>and before action brought, is equivalent to performance; and a judgment for a penalty, for relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>against which a party was formerly driven into equity, is now to be discharged at law by the principal and interest due. As to cases of fraud, the rule of <em>Tomlinson's adm'r </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>6 Rand. 169. is altered by the act of 1830-31, ch. 11. \u00a7 62. p. 62. But the cases to which that act applies are plainly specified, and the specification of them will prevent its being extended to others. The complaint is not that more effectual relief can be had at law when the party is entitled to it under a statute, than when he is entitled under the doctrines of the common law, but the real complaint is that the party cannot be relieved at common law, when his whole ground of relief rests upon the doctrines of courts of equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b540-7\">In this view of the subject, it was unnecessary to en-quire whether the creditor would have been stopped from proceeding against the principal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b540-8\">III. <em>Robinson </em>said, that in <em>criminal </em>cases the right of being heard by counsel is very uniformly secured to the accused, in this country, either by the constitution or statute; and if this right should be entirely withheld in opposition to the constitution or the law, he inclined to think that a verdict thus obtained ought to be set aside. But even in a criminal case, he should doubt whether an erroneous opinion as to the number of arguments would be ground to reverse a judgment. In a <em>civil </em>case, it was necessary not only that there should be error, but error which injures a party. He could not be injured unless the verdict rendered was against evidence. And if that had been the case, there would or might have been a motion for a new trial, and if it were overruled, then a bill of exceptions stating the facts. There is a material difference between a civil' and criminal case, in this, that the accused has a right to get a verdict if he can, in opposition to the opinion of the court, and the court cannot set it aside.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number><em>Johnson, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzJe\">mentioned the strong resemblance , <em>, , </em>, . , , between stock and money, as a thing to be lent; as strong, he said, as between the bank note and the silver dollar. It was dangerous to say that because stock might fall, usury could not be committed in it, when there was really a loan. He referred to Ord on Usury, pp. 1. 23. 25. 46. 66. 67. Cornyn on Usury, p. 104. <em>Atkinson </em>v. <em>Scott\u2019s ex\u2019ors, </em>1 Bay 307. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Battie, </em>Amb. 371. 2 Tho. Co.

Nothing, he said, was better settled than that the reservation need not be in money. Where it is in any thing else, averments may be made to bring in issue the fact constitutingusury. The cases cited from <em>New York, </em>in which the contracts were for cows and sheep, he argued, were held not to be usurious, because they were not loans but sales. He admitted that there is a mode of depreciation belonging to stock, which does not belong to money. The market price regulates its value, and stock also diminishes in value as the term of a charter drawls to an end. Where the transaction is a loan of stock, fluctuation in value need not be taken into view, because a parly, by lending instead of selling, shews it to be his purpose to keep it in kind, and doing so, must hazard the rise and fall. But the depreciation which arises from the <em>approaching </em>termination of a <em>charter </em>ought to be taken into the estimate. This however is trifling;\u2014generally nothing, if the institution be well managed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-9\">He mentioned and commented on the case of <em>Steel v.

Comyn on Usury p. <em>21. 1 </em>Atk. 340. In <em>Mastin </em>v. <em>Abdee, </em>1 Show. 8. the court say\u2014\u201c When there is a hazard that the plaintiff may have less than his principal, it is no usury.\u201d And in <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Fristoe, 1 </em>Call 81. judge <em>Pendleton says\u2014\u201cIf the </em>principal or any considerable part be put in risque, it is not usury.\u201d The restriction on the rule is, that where there is only a slight contingency, or the hazard is merely colourable, then the case is taken out of the statute. Comyn, p. 31. The same rules prevail as to the loan of any other commodity, as well as money. If any chattel be loaned, for the forbearance of which a greater sum or greater <em>value </em>be taken or reserved than the legal rate of interest, it is unlawful. But if the principal be hazarded, or if the commodity stipulated to be returned <em>may be </em>less in <em>value </em>than that loaned, although it is more in <em>quantity </em>and amount, such contract is not unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">The researches of the counsel for the appellees have brought before us several cases from a sister state, in which it has b.een decided that upon the loan of a certain number of animals, such as cows or sheep, and a promise to return double the number in three or four years, the loan is not obnoxious to the charge of usury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>on the ground that it is uncertain, at the time of the loan, what will be the <em>value </em>of the animals to be returned several years afterwards; and that although the lender might probably have made a profitable bargain, yet he <em>might, have lost </em>some part of the capital itself. <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Tilden, 5 </em>Cow. 144. <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Wetmore, </em>Id. 149. note. <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>4 Wend. 679. And in <em>Hamlin </em>v. <em>Fitch, </em>Kirby\u2019s Conn.

If the article be of a <em>fluctuating value, </em>it may not be at the <em>time, of repayment </em>worth more or so much.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">With respect <em>to </em>contracts for replacing stock at a future day according to the then state of the market, it seems to be now settled, that if the lender be not certain whether by the stock\u2019s being replaced at the given day he shall be a loser or a gainer, any gain which he may obtain by the replacing will not taint the agreement with <em>usury.

To which may be added the above case from Kirby\u2019s Conn. Rep. 260. But on the other hand, if the lender has so made the agreement that he is secure from loss and has a chance of gain, this, by taking away the contingency deprives the transaction of its legality. <em>Barnard </em>v. <em>Young, </em>17 Ves. 44.</p>\n<p id=\"ABj\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Tested by these principles, I think there can be no doubt that the third plea tendered by the defendants was properly rejected by the c.our-t. It does not aver that the contract to replace 142 shares then lent, by 172 at the expiration of a twelve month, was intended as a shift to evade the statute, nor that by the contract the lender was secured from any loss. The chief reliance of the pleader seems to have been that the 142 shares lent, and the additional 30 shares to be returned, were each of them of the value of 100 dollars at <em>the date of the loan; </em>whereas it is the uncertainty of the value of the stock <em>at the time of its replacement, </em>arising from the fluctuation in the price of the article, that is the turning point on which the question depends whether the loan be usurious or not. On the same principle, I am of opinion that in the instruction which wTas refused, and in that given, as set forth in the bill of exceptions, no error whatever was committed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">The appellants contend that the court erred in rejecting the fifth and sixth pleas. Those pleas aver that <em>Steptoe </em>was only surety for <em>Mitchell, </em>(thereby departing from the terms of the covenant, which on its face shews that the covenantors were all principals); and then aver that <em>Mitchell </em>the principal, at the time when the shares became due, made a new contract with the covenantee, by which he extended the time for replacing the said shares. This brings up for adjudication one of the questions decided in <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>6 Munf. 16. In that case, it appeared on the face of the obligation that <em>Ward </em>was surety for <em>Long </em>the principal obligor, and yet it was decided that the defence, that the obligee had given time to the principal by taking a confession of judgment with a stay, of execution, by which the surety was alleged to be discharged, was not one that could be made <em>at laxo, </em>however it might be in <em>equity, </em>and a plea setting forth such defence was overruled on demurrer. That decision is supported by the case of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number><em>Davey </em>v. <em>Prendergrass, 5 </em>Barn. &amp; Ald. 187. I think we should not disturb the decision of <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Johnson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AOAD\">The last exception taken to the opinion of the court x ... relates to the order of proceeding in the trial of causes before a jury. It is undoubtedly the practice in <em>England,, </em>that he who holds the affirmative shall open the case, and close the argument to the jury. 3 Blacks. Com. 366. In this state, the practice has varied. In some of the circuits the english rule prevails; but in the greater number the plaintiff in all cases (except in writs of right) is allowed to begin, and the general court has recommended that to be the rule in all the circuits. I have thought that the english rule was the best: but however that may be, 1 do not think that the adoption of the other rule is any ground for reversing a judgment which is otherwise correct. I am for affirming the judgment.</p>\n<author id=\"b545-8\">Caiik, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Azvn\">Our act declares \u201cthat no person shall, upon any contract, take directly or indirectly, for loan of any money, wares or merchandize, or other commodity, above the value of six dollars for the forbearance of 100 dollars for a year\u201d &amp;c. This statute being copied, in its definition of usury, from an act of parliament, we are in the constant habit of referring to englisb decisions, upon any question as to its meaning and construction. From these decisions we learn, that there are a good many cases in which more than the value of six <em>per cent, </em>is reserved on the money or other thing lent, which yet are not considered as within the mischief or the meaning of the statute ; cases, for instance, of bottomry or <em>respondentia, </em>and <em>post obit </em>securities ; all cases indeed, where the principal advanced is not to be repaid at all events, but is on a hazard or contingency, provided such hazard and contingency be real, and not colourable merely. <em>Ord, </em>in his treatise on usury, p. 46. has this remark: \u201cAs the price of stock is in continual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>fluctuation, the contingency respecting it has been held to exempt from the statutes of usury, agreements to transfer a specific amount at a specific future day, which, without such contingency, would be usurious.\u201d support of this position he cites several cases: and many others may be adduced. In <em>Maddock </em>v. <em>Rumball, </em>8 East 304. <em>Rumball </em>was indebted to <em>Maddock </em>a certain sum, for which he was sued ; but being unable to pay, and <em>Maddock </em>wishing to invest the money in three <em>per cent, </em>stock, it was agreed between them, in consideration of <em>Maddock's </em>forbearing his action and demand one year, that <em>Rumball </em>should transfer to him, at the end of the year, so much of that kind of stock as the sum due at the time of the agreement would purchase, and in the mean time should -pay <em>Maddock </em>the interest and dividends accruing on such stock; which it appeared upon calculation, produced more to <em>Maddock </em>than his debt and five <em>per cent, </em>interest. But all the court agreed that this was not usury, as the amount of the sum to be paid by <em>Rumball </em>depended upon a contingency; and if the stocks had fallen within the year, <em>Maddock </em>might have received less than his principal and legal interest would have amounted to. They considered this transaction as resting on the same footing with an agreement to replace stock lent; which, though once contended to be usury, if more than the principal and legal interest were thereby obtained, had been long settled to be legal. In <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Ledwell &amp;c. 5 </em>Esp. N. P. C. 164. M. wishing to advance his son, agreed, on the 5th May 1801, to dispose of \u00bfC400. stock to P. for <em>\u00a3 </em>160. to be transferred to him when his son should arrive at the age of 21 years, which would be on the 11th February 1804. The value of the stock when the agreement was made was proved to be <em>\u00a3 </em>240. It was contended on the part of M. that this agreement was usurious. P. had paid <em>\u00a3 </em>160. only, for stock worth <em>\u00a3 </em>240. He got <em>\u00a3 </em>80. by his bargain, and the dividends in the mean time. But lord <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number><em>EUenborovgk </em>said\u2014\u201c Whatever remedy M. may have in equity on the ground of this being a catching bargain, he has none at law : contingency in the thing purchased is \u2019 , <em>Jc </em>. . , . incompatible with the idea or usury, in which the pnncipal must always be certain. It is admitted that if the stock when transferred to P. would be worth but <em>\u00a3 </em>160. it would not be usury; that the stock would suffer that most extraordinary depreciation was very improbable, hot still it was within the reach of possibility. I cannot say that there was not <em>some </em>contingency in the transaction ; and therefore the contract was not usurious.\u201d I consider this case peculiarly strong and apt to the point before us. It shews first, that it is the uncertainty of the value of the stock at the time of delivery, rather than the value at the time of sale, which is to be considered ; and moreover, that where there is any real contingency, the contract is not usurious. The case of <em>Forrest </em>v. <em>Elwes, </em>4 Ves. 492. was <em>thus\u2014Forrest </em>applying to <em>Elwes </em>for a loan, he transferred to him stock, upon bond to return the stock six months after dale, and in the mean time to pay interest at <em>five per cent. </em>The stock not being replaced, and being depreciated, the court decreed that the obligee was entitled to the value of the stock at the time of the transfer, with interest to the date of the report. I notice this case, simply to explain the reference to it by the master of the rolls in <em>Barnard </em>v. <em>Young, </em>17 Ves. 44. This last was a contract for repayment of a debt with legal interest, or, <em>at the option of the creditor, </em>to transfer so much stock as it would have produced at the day it was payable. Sir <em>William Grant </em>observed\u2014\u201c I am of opinion that the contract is usurious; as it reserves the capital with legal interest upon it, and likewise a contingent advantage, without putting either capital or interest in any kind of risk. The case of <em>Forrest v. Elwes </em>differs from this in <em>the very </em>point in which 1 conceive the usury to consist. In that case, the objection\u201d (of usury) \u201c though at first made, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>was properly given up; as; though it is true, if the stock had risen, the lender might have had more than principal and legal interest, yet on the other hand, if it had fallen, he would have had less; as he had no option to have stock or money, but the borrower could have discharged himself by merely replacing the stock. Here' the lender is at his election to have his principal and interest, or to have a given quantity of stock transferred to him. His principal never was at any hazard, as he was at all events sure of having that, with legal interest, and had the chance of an advantage if stock rose. It was usurious to stipulate for that chance.\u201d Here we find this eminent judge declaring, that in contracts of this kind there is no usury where each party takes the hazard arising from fluctuation in price; and that the very point in which usury consists, is a provision by the lender against that fluctuation. In the case before us, there was no such provision; and surely every one mtfst say, that from the very nature of the subject it was liable \\ to the fluctuations of the market. The case of <em>White </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>3 Barn. &amp; Cres. 272. 10 Eng. C. L. Rep. 75. decides the same principle, on the same ground of the option reserved by the lender of the stock. In the matter of <em>Naish ex'x of Stewart, </em>7 Bingh. 150. 20 Eng. C. L. Rep. 81. <em>Stewart </em>and <em>Pelham, </em>in consideration of <em>\u00a3 </em>1000. paid to <em>Stewart, </em>granted to <em>Holland </em>an annuity of <em>\u00a3 </em>120. for four lives, and covenanted that in 30 <em>days </em>after the expiration of the third life, they would insure the \u00bf\u00a31000. to <em>Holland; </em>and the grantors executed a power of attorney to enter up judgment for \u00bf\u00a32000. but none was entered. A rule <em>nisi </em>was obtained to set aside the power of attorney, on the ground that it was void for usury. It was contended that this was not usury, because the principal was in hazard, as the two last lives might drop at once; or the last life might drop within the thirty days, and before the insurance was effected, and.in such case the covenant would be of no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>avail. And the court decided that it was not usury, because of the hazard. <em>Tindal, </em>C. J. said-\u201411 The question is whether an advance of money, under the circumstances now laid <em>before the </em>court, comes within the statute of <em>Anne, </em>as a loan of money on which a larger rate of interest than five <em>per cent, </em>has been reserved ? The general rule is, that there is no loan where the principal is placed in hazard, because a loan contemplates repayment of the money lent: and where there is no loan, it is matter of agreement between the parties, on what terms the money shall be advanced.\u201d The court also lay some stress on the fact that there was no affidavit imputing to the parlies the intention of a loan, or shewing that the principal had never been put in hazard. I will cite but one more case on this point. In the case of <em>Gilpin </em>v. <em>Enderhj, 5 </em>Barn. &amp; Aid, 954. 7 Eng. C. L. Rep. 314. a deed was executed between the parties, by which they covenanted to become partners in the business of army clothiers, for ten years, and that <em>Enderhj </em>should advance \u00bf\u00a320,000. as part of the capital for carrying on the business, and <em>Gilpin </em>should find a like sum ; that <em>Enderhj </em>should, during the continuance of the partnership, have out of the profits, if sufficient, or if not, out of the capital, \u00bf\u00a32000. yearly for his share of the profits. <em>Gilpin </em>then covenanted, that on the determination of the partnership by effluxion of time, the sum of \u00bf\u00a320,000. should be returned to <em>Enderhj, </em>and that <em>Gilpin </em>should guaranty all debts and pay all losses. At the end of the ten years <em>Enderhj </em>sued on this deed for the \u00bf\u00a320,000. and <em>Gilpin </em>pleaded the statute of usury,\u2014that the <em>\u00a3 </em>20,000. was a loan for ten years, at the premium of \u00bf\u00a32000. a year, and the deed a shift and device to evade the statute. Replication, that the deed was executed for good and lawful consideration, and not by way of shift <em>&amp;c. </em>Upon this replication issue was taken, and the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, thus negativing the corrupt agreement. A judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>was rendered on this verdict in the common pleas, and a writ of error taken to the king\u2019s bench, upon the ground that the deed manifestly exhibits a case of usury within the statute, and ought consequently to be pronounced void in law. <em>Abbott, </em>C. J. delivered the opinion of the court. He said\u2014\u201c By the execution of this 'deed, <em>Enderby </em>undoubtedly made himself answerable as a partner to all strangers, though he might not be answerable as between himself and <em>Gilpin. </em>And if the deed discloses the real facts and the intention of the parties to it, this is not a case of a loan by <em>Enderby </em>to <em>Gilpin, </em>but a contract of partnership between them of a peculiar kind. If the deed does not disclose the real facts and the intention of the parties, but was executed only as a contrivance to cover a loan of \u00bf620,000. for ten years, at ten <em>per cent, </em>the deed was undoubtedly void; but this is a fact that ought to have been found, affirmatively by a jury, to enable the court thereupon to declare the deed void. No such fact has been found, and in the absence of such finding, we must consider the deed as speaking the language of truth. And so considering it, we cannot pronounce it void.\u201d Now, if we compare the case presented by this third plea, with the cases cited shewing that the fluctuation in price, and hazard or contingency of other kinds, will take contracts and loans out of the statute, we must surely agree with the court that <em>that </em>plea presented no bar to the action: for it is a simple case of the loan of 142 shares of stock for twelve months, to have <em>172 </em>returned <em>for the </em>forbearance ; with no provision securing the lender against the fall of stock, and no averment that it was meant as a shift or device to evade the statute, the real intention being an usurious loan. The plea then was properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">On the trial, the defendants moved the court to instruct the jury, that if they believed the consideration of the covenant was the <em>142 </em>shares of stock lent by <em>Harvey </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>to <em>Mitchell </em>for twelve months, of the value of 100 dollars each at the date of the loan, and that the 30 shares additiona.1, agreed to be paid, were reserved in consideration of the loan and forbearance of the 142 shares, and that the value of the said 30 shares was, at the date of said loan, greatly above six <em>per cent, </em>on the value o\u00ed the 142 shares, to wit, of the value of 50 dollars per share, though deliverable twelve months after, and that both parties so understood it, and intended to secure to the lender a compensation of the value aforesaid,\u2014then, upon the third plea on which issue was joined, the defendants were entitled to a verdict; and this without any reference to the question whether the said <em>Harvey </em>might gain or lose, by the rise or fall of the stock. The court refused to give this instruction; and very properly, I think. For if the cases I have cited prove any thing, it is that the question of hazard, the consideration of the rise and fall of the stock, is <em>the very point </em>which takes the contract out of the statute. The court, I think, was, upon the same ground of reason and authority, equally correct in the instruction which it <em>did </em>give the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">I will turn now to another point in this complicated cause. A fifth and sixth pleas were tendered by the administrators of <em>Steptoe, </em>stating that their intestate executed the covenant as a surety merely, and that after-wards, without his knowledge or consent, a new contract was entered into between <em>Harvey </em>and <em>Mitchell </em>the principal debtor, by which, for a new consideration, further day of payment was <em>given, </em>and by which also the sureties were discharged. These pleas were objected to by the plaintiffs, as presenting no <em>legal </em>bar to their claim; and the court being of that opinion rejected them: to which the defendants excepted. It will be recollected that in the covenant declared on, no distinction of principal and surety is made: all are on its face principal obligors. In <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>1 Munf. 45. 6 Munf. 6. this very point was made; in the first place, by motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>to the court below. This court decided, that if the facts could avail the defendant at all <em>at law, </em>it must be by way of plea: and the cause was sent back. It came up again, with the plea regularly pleaded and demurred to, so as to present the naked point to the court. The cause was elaborately argued by <em>Mr. Wickham, </em>and <em>Mr. Wirt, </em>than whom we had no abler counsel: the cases of the discharge of sureties by such new contracts were cited: and the court decided unanimously, that this was no discharge at law, though it might be, and the majority seemed to think it would be, a discharge in equity. This decision was in 1817, and has never been questioned since, that I know of; and I am for standing by it. There is a later case upon this point\u2014an english <em>case\u2014Davey </em>v. <em>Prendergrass, </em>5 Barn. &amp; Ald. 187. 7 Eng. C. L. Rep. 62. There, upon debt on a surety bond executed by the defendants, conditioned to pay, within one month after demand, such balance not exceeding <em>\u00a3 </em>500. as upon settlement of accounts <em>S. P. </em>and <em>J. P. </em>should appear to owe the plaintiff, the defendants pleaded a parol agreement made without their privity, giving time to the principal debtors to pay by instalments &amp;c. To this plea there was a demurrer, which was sustained, upon the general rule of the common law, which requires that the obligation created by an instrument under seal shall be discharged by an instrument of equal validity. \u201c The operation of that rule\u201d (says <em>Abbott, </em>C. J.) \u201c is indeed sometimes such as to make it imperative upon a court of equity to interpose and grant relief; but it by no means follows that the rule of law is to be broken down, because a court, having jurisdiction of another kind, will interpose where there is a particular case in which the rule' of law may be found to operate harshly. There is great objection to a court of law taking upon itself to act as a court of equity; because they have not the means of doing that full and ample justice which the particular case may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>require.\u201d In another part of his opinion he shews the distinction between the case before him, and others in which the courts of law have taken notice of this defence of the surety. \u201c Bills of exchange\u201d (he says) \u201cstand upon a different footing: there the law merchant operates, and the courts of law decide upon them with reference to that law. Guaranties for the payment of debts are not, in general, instruments under seal, and there is no strict technical rule which, as to them, prevents a court of law from looking at the real justice of the case. The cases of bail and replevin bonds are provided for by acts of parliament, giving to the courts an authority over them. A recognizance of bail stands upon a different ground from bail bonds, as to the jurisdiction of the court. There the jurisdiction is not founded upon statute, but upon a general authority in the court to see that an improper use is not made of its own records.\u201d The court were right, then, in rejecting these pleas also. With respect to the last exception, taken to the decision of the court refusing to the counsel of the defendant the opening and conclusion of the argument to the jury: it is a question which can have no influence on the opinion of this court, in passing upon the final judgment of the court below. Suppose the defendant\u2019s counsel ought to have had the opening and conclusion: how can we ascertain the effect of the refusal? The verdict was either contrary to the evidence, or it was not: if it was, that would be a sufficient reason for a new trial: if it was not, ought a new trial to be granted because the defendant\u2019s counsel had <em>not the </em>opening and conclusion ? In the case before us, no new trial was asked, no objection taken to the verdict as being against evidence. It is not necessary then, in this cause, to give an opinion on this point; and I question whether it might not be better to leave the courts below and the general court to settle the practice as to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">I am for affirming the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"Al3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Brooke, <em>J. </em>I concur in affirming the judgment.</p>\n<author id=\"AHZ\">\u2022 Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AVJ\">The first question in this case is as to 1 the discharge of the surety by the contract for indulgence, and the competency of this defence in a court of law. That the arrangement set forth in the plea would be such as to tie up the hands of the creditor, and of course to exonerate the surety, I am inclined to think; but I am satisfied that the defence can only be made in equity. This has been decided both in our own courts and in <em>Westminster </em>hall; and if the question is to be settled by authority, it has been so settled. In <em>Ward v. Johnson, </em>6 Munf. 6. the surety to the bond pleaded that the creditor had taken a confession of judgment from the principal, with a stay of execution without his consent, to which plea the plaintiff demurred, and judgment was given in his favour. This court affirmed that judgment; admitting that the new contract entered into was a discharge in equity, but denying that it could be pleaded as a discharge at law. They declared that when an obligee covenants not to sue one of two joint and several obligors, and much more when he only covenants not to sue for <em>a limited time, </em>the covenant does not amount to a release, and the obligee may still sue the other obligor <em>at law. </em>In this case it is observable also, that the surety appeared to be such on the face of the bond. In the case of <em>Davey &amp; others </em>v. <em>Prendergrass, </em>5 Barn. &amp; Ald. 187. in debt on a surety bond conditioned to pay such balance as upon settlement should appear due from <em>Prendergrass </em>to the plaintiffs, the defendants pleaded that the plaintiffs had given time to the principal debtors to pay by instalments, without the sureties\u2019 assent. This plea was demurred to, and was adjudged bad; the court being clearly of opinion that the defence could not be made at law, but was only proper for a court of equity. The opinions of all the judges present were full to the point, and sustained by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>the strongest reasoning. I must content myself with referring to them, as they are too much in detail to be transcribed, here. They cite as a decisive authority, moreover, the case of <em>Bulteel </em>v. <em>Jarrold, </em>in the exchequer, not at that time reported, but now to be found in 8 Price 467. 3 Cond. Eng. Exch. Rep. 422. The question may then be considered as incontrovertibly settled in <em>England.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">At the last term of the <em>Lewisburg </em>court of appeals, the question how far this defence could be made at law, came under consideration in the case of <em>Steele </em>v. <em>Boyd.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>That however was the case of a delivery bond, and the court considered the party entitled to avail himself at law of the defence. I beg leave to read the opinion which was delivered on that occasion as containing my own views of the case, in which I understood my brethren as concurring. [Here the president read the opinion on this point, delivered in the case of Steele v. <em>Boyd.] </em>In this case, then, it seems to have been the opinion of the judges, though certainly not directly upon the point decided, that in debt upon bond the surety could not plead this equitable discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The case of <em>Wright\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. Stockton, 5 Leigh 153. affords, however, an exception to this position. In that case there were four sureties. Three of them had given the notice authorized by the act of assembly, requiring the creditor to proceed against the principal, and were discharged by his failure. The fourth pleaded this matter in his own discharge, and this court sustained the plea. I am satisfied that we did not err in that decision. A discharge by statute must of necessity be a <em>legal </em>defence, and is of course proper matter to be pleaded at law. It is equivalent, when it proceeds from the act of the creditor, to a release, and may therefore well be pleaded; and the court, considering the act which released three of the sureties as discharg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>ing the fourth also, sustained his plea of that discharge. That plea might even have been pleaded, had the action been brought against the principal as well as the surety; and judgment might have been rendered upon it for the surety without impeding the judgment against the principal, both upon general principles, <em>2 </em>Rand. 174. 1 Chitty 32. 1 Wms. Saund. 207. in note, and upon the express provision of the statute 1 Rev. Code, ch. 116. \u00a7 8. p. 462. which declares that the rights and <em>remedies </em>of the creditor against the principal debtor shall in no wise be <em>affected </em>by the act. But they certainly would be so affected, if the creditor was to be debarred of his judgment in the joint action against the principal, and compelled to commence another action against him alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-13\">I am not aware of any other decision bearing upon this question ; but those which have been- cited appear to leave no doubt upon the subject, as far as the matter can be settled by authority. They admit, that where the creditor has debarred himself from proceeding at law, by any act which, upon the principles of a <em>court of law, </em>arrests his right to go on, the matter may be pleaded at law. Such is the taking judgment with stay of execution, or the accepting a new contract in discharge of the judgment, 1 Call 18. or the release of the body after the execution has once been levied on the principal. They admit that the defence at law may be made in all actions of an equitable nature; and therefore in actions of <em>assumpsit; </em>in summary motions, in which the proceeding is always equitable; and even upon promissory notes and bills of exchange, which being simple contract debts, in which the party is permitted to go into the consideration, the question of discharge is always,. of course, vital and important in deciding the question of liability. They admit too, for the reasons given in <em>Davey </em>v. <em>Prendergrass </em>and <em>Steele </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>that the defence may be made in the cases of bail and forth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>coming bonds, since these constitute a part of the proceedings in the cause, over which the court must exercise its control in all its ramifications. And lastly they admit that where the surety has proceeded according to the statute, he may plead that matter in his discharge, because the statute declares that the creditor shall <em>forfeit </em>his rights against the surety, if he does not comply with the requisitions of the notice. But they do not admit that the surety may plead merely equitable matter to debt upon bond; or that in a court of law, in such an action, one obligor would be permitted to plead that he is but a surety, and that arrangements have been made by the creditor with the principal which would induce a court of equity to tie up his hands, although they would offer no bar to his proceeding according to the rules of a court of law. Thus a covenant, upon good consideration, not to sue for a given time, would be enforced in equity without doubt, and thus equity would tie up the creditor\u2019s hands. Yet it has been solemnly decided in <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>that a covenant not to sue cannot be pleaded at law, in bar of the action against the surety. Could it have been otherwise decided, without obliterating every barrier between the two jurisdictions ? And if this distinct, direct and definite <em>legal </em>contract could not be so pleaded, how could we admit a defence resting upon the loose and indefinite grounds which are often made the foundation of equitable jurisdiction ?</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">It is said indeed, that there is as much reason for admitting the defence in the action on the bond, as in the other cases above mentioned, and that no greater difficulties will arise in administering the principles of equity in the one than in the other. Be it so: yet the same thing may be said of the other distinctions in favour of bonds, which have been sustained by the legislature against every assault. It is enough for us to say what the established course of adjudication is, unlil the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>legislature chooses to change the law. It is not for us to change it. Least of all, should I be disposed to see it changed so as to set the courts of law to speculating upon what a court of equity would do in a given case. Thus the surety pleads a transaction which does not tie up the creditor\u2019s hands at law, according to the principles of the law tribunals, but alleges that a court of equity would tie them up. In deciding then upon this plea, the court of law must undertake to sa.y what a court of equity would do, and act accordingly. I cannot think that such a proceeding can either be sustained by authority or supported by reason, so long as we maintain the distinct characters of the two jurisdictions. Upon the whole therefore, I am of opinion that the fifth and sixth pleas of the defendant in this case were properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">We come next to consider the questions involving the inquiry whether the transaction was or was not usurious and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">The first question as to this matter refers itself to the rejection of the third plea. It was, I think, properly rejected. The statute of usury is a highly penal act, and it is therefore proper that whoever is brought within its <em>penalties, </em>should be brought also strictly within its <em>provisions. </em>Its terms are indeed very broad and comprehensive, and' it is therefore difficult to commit the offence without falling within its grasp : but for the same reason there is less ground for a <em>liberal </em>interpretation, since, even construed according to the letter, it is sufficiently sweeping to embrace every case where the object of the parties is shewn to be usurious, and the transaction is but a shift to evade the statute. The courts too, for a like reason, have always required that the defence of usury should be pleaded with t^ie greatest strictness, and the usurious contract set forth with certainty and precision. If the defendant succeeds, the lender loses his <em>whole debt, </em>whereas if he fails at law in his proofs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>he may still resort in equity to the lender\u2019s conscience, and obtain relief against the usurious gain. By this last proceeding, iustice is effected between the parties : the debtor is forced to pay what is due, and the lender disgorges his ill_gotten gains, or is disappointed of the victim around whom he had been artfully winding his toils. These considerations presented themselves very forcibly to our minds, in considering the case of <em>Crenshaw\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Clark and </em>others, 5 Leigh 65. and they are not inapplicable in this case, where the attempt is to get rid of a debt of between fifteen and twenty thousand dollars on the plea of usury. The defence, it is true, is on the part of the representatives of a surety, and does not therefore involve the moral obliquity of a complaint of extortion, preferred by a party who is willing to pocket ten times the amount of his adversary\u2019s money, if he can effectuate his purpose by the assistance of the law. But still it is a defence which is to deprive the plaintiff of what is justly his due, and what the surety guarantied to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">With these views, let ns proceed to consider the plea. We must confine ourselves to its face, without looking to any other part of the case to influence our opinions. By the statute it is declared \u201cthat no person shall, upon any contract, take directly or indirectly, for loan of any money, wares or merchandize, or <em>other commodity, </em>above the <em>value </em>of six dollars for the forbearance of one hundred dollars for a year,\u201d &amp;c. To constitute the offence then, under this act, the lender must receive, or contract to receive, above the <em>value </em>of six dollars for forbearance for a year. If he contracts to receive what at the end of the year <em>may not </em>be of the value of six dollars, he does not commit the offence. If I lend one hundred dollars when wheat is worth one dollar per bushel, upon contract to receive my money at the end of the year, with seven bushels of wheat for the forbearance, it would not necessarily be usury, because peradventure the se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>yen bushels when delivered may be worth less than six , <em>J </em>dollars, and therefore it cannot be truly said that I have contracted to receive above six dollars in value. No <em>court </em>therefore could pronounce such a contract to be usurious; though if it were set forth in the plea, with proper averments that it was a shift to evade the statute, a jury might find it usury. For before that tribunal facts might appear, which might clearly shew that the reservation of interest in wheat was but a contrivance; that the parties well knew that the seven bushels of wheat would be worth more than six dollars value at the time it was to be paid. This would be evident, indeed, where the reservation is of a great amount. Thus, if twenty bushels of wheat were reserved as the interest of 100 dollars, though the <em>court </em>could never pronounce it usury, because it cannot judicially know that at the end of twelve months it might not be worth less than six dollars, yet the jury, whose province it is to ascertain facts, may know and may decide, that according to all probabilities the twenty bushels of wheat would be worth more than six dollars, and that the contract, therefore, was but a shift to evade the statute. The distinction arises out of the theoretical incapacity of the <em>court </em>to ascertain <em>any </em>fact or to judge of any motive, and the power of the <em>jury </em>to ascertain <em>every </em>fact and ferret out <em>every </em>motive. A plea of usury therefore should, on its face, either present such facts, <em>\u201c </em>with certainty to every intent,\u201d as in themselves distinctly amount to an agreement to receive more than the value of six dollars for the loan of 100 for a year; or it must state the facts with such necessary averments of an intent to evade the statute, as that a jury, upon the trial, might decide that the agreement was in substance a contract for usurious interest, and a shift to evade the operation of the law. Now, the rejected plea in this case is defective in either view. Take it as professing to make out a complete case of usury from the facts themselves, and it is de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>fective; for it alleges \u201cthat the loan was of 142 shares, i . to be returned with 30 shares more, worth at the <em>time oj the contract </em>100 dollars.\u201d But <em>non constat </em>what they would be worth <em>when they were to he received; </em>therefore <em>non constat </em>that the lender would <em>receive more than six per centum. </em>The court cannot estimate the value, which is in its nature fluctuating; and without averments that the parties well knew that the shares would be worth more at the end of the year, and that they corruptly agreed upon that reservation as a shift to evade the statute, the court cannot see that the transaction amounted to usury. I consider the plea, therefore, essentially defective in wanting such an averment. It is averred, indeed, that the 30 shares were <em>then </em>worth 100 dollars. But as they were not <em>then </em>to be received, their value at that time was immaterial. If I lend 1000 dollars, and for the forbearance receive at once 100 bushels of wheat, when wheat is worth a dollar, or a horse worth 100 dollars, it is usury. But if I contract to receive 100 bushels of wheat, or the same horse, <em>a year hence, </em>as my premium for forbearance, I may get less than six <em>per cent, </em>for my money, as the wheat may fall in value, or the horse become worthless. It is then, to the time appointed for the receipt of the premium, and not to the date of the contract, that we must look to ascertain the value of the premium; and as in this plea the probable value of the 30 shares at the end of the year is not set <em>forth, together </em>with <em>the proper </em>averments of the shift and evasion, the plea is substantially defective, and was properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">The fourth plea corrects the defects of the third, by averring that the 30 shares, \u201c though to be delivered twelve months after, were then worth 90 dollars cash, that the value was well known to the parties, and they were agreed to be paid as a premium, with intent to secure usurious interest.\u201d This, I think, was a good plea; for though the price of the stock was fluctuating, yet if so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>much was reserved, as to render it morally certain that more than <em>shaper cent, </em>would be received, a jury would be justified in finding the usury. Were it otherwise, a loan of 100 shares of stock to be returned in a year, with. 100 more shares as a premium, could not be brought within the penalties of the statute. It would indeed be to repeal the statute, if this were so.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">It remains then to examine the instructions moved for and refused, and those given, upon this plea. I am of opinion that the instructions asked for were rightly refused. Without scanning them throughout, it is sufficient to advert to one point. The court is asked to instruct the jury, that if the 30 shares deliverable twelve months after date were worth at the date of the contract at least 50 dollars per share, the transaction was usurious. Now if those shares were worth only 50 dollars, the other 142 also could only have been worth 50 dollars. And thus <em>Harvey </em>would have lent 142 shares, <em>then </em>worth 14,200 dollars, to have 172 shares returned to him twelve months afterwards, worth at the same time only S600 dollars; thus losing near 6000 dollars, instead of securing usurious gain. The instruction asked for could not then have been proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Then, as to the instruction given. It is in substance, that the jury must be satisfied that there was an agreement for an excessive premium, and that to secure such excessive premium it was covenanted that the borrower should give the thirty shares of stock as an equivalent. The court further said, that if the jury believed that the loan was made without stipulation as to the value of the shares when they were to be returned, each party <em>speculating </em>upon the greater or less value of stock at that time, the transaction was not usurious. I can perceive no error in this instruction. The law does not forbid contracts of hazard, where that hazard is real and not merely colourable. Loans of articles of fluctuating value, to be returned in kind, are not usurious, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>though a greater <em>quantity </em>than six <em>per cent, </em>of the like property is to be paid for the use of the property for one year. Thus if I lend or sell 1000 bushels of wheat, or 100 barrels o\u00ed flour, to have 1100 bushels ot wheat or 110 barrels of Hour returned at the end of the year, there may be no usury. It may be a mere contract of hazard, which is not forbidden by law, and which is of daily occurrence in fair commercial transactions. But if the hazard is merely colourable,\u2014if it is alleged in the pleading, and appears satisfactorily to the jury, that in truth and in fact the property to be returned would, upon every reasonable calculation, greatly exceed the legal rate of interest, and that the arrangement was but a shift,\u2014the transaction would be held to be usurious. Thus if I lend 1000 bushels of wheat, to have 5000 a.t the end of the year, it must at once be obvious, that under any probable state of the market, the quantity returned must exceed the legal rate of interest. So too with stock. The loan of 100 shares, on the terms of 200 to be returned in twelve months, might fairly be <em>averred to be </em>a shift, and I should think a jury might fairly <em>infer </em>it to be so. Indeed, in this very case, the jury might have drawn such an inference; but it is by no means a necessary inference. Had a loan of 100 shares of <em>United States </em>bank stock been made in 18.18, for 140, shares to be returned in twelve months, each party merely speculating upon the probable rise or fall, the loan would neither have been usurious, nor profitable to the lender, since stock was then worth 150 dollars for 100, and fell in a single year, I think, to par.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In like manner a sale of certificates at the price of ten shillings in the pound, when the market price was two shillings and sixpence, would have been exorbitant, and might have been inferred to be usurious. Yet if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>sale had been made when there was a prospect of the assumption of the state debts, each party speculating upon the probability of that assumption and the consequent rise of certificates, and not intending a cover for usury, the transaction would have been s\u00fcstained, though the debt afterwards rose from two shillings and sixpence to more than twenty shillings in ihe pound. These cases all shew, that unless the gain is <em>certain, </em>it must appear that the hazard is merely colourable, or there is no usury. While, on the other hand, although the value of the commodity lent and to be returned be fluctuating, yet the transaction will be deemed usurious, if it appears that that fluctuation is a mere pretext and cover for usurious gain. And such, I think, is the fair interpretation of the several instructions of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">As to the last exception, it presents in <em>effect the </em>question whether, for the irregularity of denying the right of opening and concluding the argument, the verdict should be set aside and a new trial awarded. Considering the matter in this light, I am of opinion that the error set forth in the bill of exceptions is <em>not </em>sufficient to justify a reversal of the judgment and the award of a new trial. The rules as to the right of opening and concluding in the courts of <em>England, 2 </em>Tidd 908. are substantially the rules which have been held to prevail with us. Where the general issue is not pleaded, but issue is joined on a collateral fact, in which the affirmative is with the defendant and the proofs rest on him, he has the right to open and conclude. But where the' general issue is pleaded, or where by any part of the pleadings the affirmative is thrown upon the plaintiff, he must begin and have the reply, even though there may be <em>other </em>issues in which the affirmative is thrown on the defendant. But I do not think it follows that a new trial should be allowed, solely because of an error in this regard. New trials are refused, even where there have been much more serious irregularities in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>proceeding's ; as where the judge has permitted the jury to disperse, <em>2 </em>Barn. &amp; Aid. 462. or where a cause has been taken out of its turn and tried as an undefended cause, and there was no affidavit of merits. 5 Barn. &amp; Aid. 907. If the facts in this case had been spread upon the record, and a new trial moved for, and the case had appeared doubtful, the denial of his rights to the defendant might have turned the scale in his favour; but the defendant having acquiesced in the verdict, having by that acquiescence acknowledged that it is according to the evidence and the instructions of the court, and having rested his defence upon the supposed errors of the court, and not upon a false finding by the jury, 1 see no ground for setting aside the verdict: and upon the whole matter am of opinion to affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AOv\"> Reported 6 Leigh 547.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b563-6\"> <em>Note by the president. </em>I am not certain as to dates.
