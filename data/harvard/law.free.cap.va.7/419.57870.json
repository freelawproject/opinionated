Thompson, </em>contrary to the wish and intention of his deceased brother, and contrary to law, as the complainants were advised, applied for and obtained letters of administration with the will annexed, and having so obtained them, instead of selling the lands first devised to be sold for payment of debts, allowed the debts of the testator to be collected by execution and sale of the slaves bequeathed to the complainants, and without selling first the land around the several tracts of land conveyed and sold to different persons by the testator, proceeded to sell, not <em>apart the least in value </em>of the lands devised to the complainants, <em>but the </em>main <em>body, the very </em>lands intended for the complainants, to wit, the <em>Blue springs, Cherry tree fields </em>and <em>Slusse\u2019s lease, </em>and these he sold to <em>Joseph Meek, </em>who wmll knew the provisions of the testator\u2019s will, <em>the </em>state of his affairs, that the lands devised to be first sold had not been sold, and that no such sale as was made to him was necessary for the payment of the testator\u2019s debts, or authorized by his will; that the admi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>nistrator had applied the proceeds of the sale to his own use; and that he had, by multiplied acts of mismanagement and fraud, left the complainants without the means of subsistence. The bill therefore prayed, that the sale of the land to <em>Meelc </em>might be set aside; that the administrator might be required to shew what lands of the testator he had sold, to whom, and on what terms, and to exhibit an inventory of the testator\u2019s goods, chattels and credits, and a list of the debts due from him at the time of his decease, and to render an account of his transactions as administrator; and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-8\"><em>William P.

He stated that he had never seen the testator\u2019s will, and knew no more respecting its provisions than was set forth in the complainants\u2019 bill; but by the provisions therein set forth, he insisted that all the lands were subjected to sale, if necessary for the payment of debts, a.nd he said, he was informed by his codefendant, and believed, that the sale made to him was in fact necessary for that purpose. He farther insisted that his purchase was a fair one, and that the price given was the full value of the land. As to the other matters stated in the bill, he disclaimed all knowledge, and referred to the answer of his codefendant the administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-5\">The chancellor, by order made the 27th of May 1819, directed a commissioner to state and report an account of the defendant <em>Thompson's </em>administration of his testator\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Many depositions were taken and filed by tbe parties, in the progress of <em>the </em>long controversy which ensued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-8\">It appeared from'the evidence, that the testator, after the date of his will, had sold the whole of <em>Slusse\u2019s lease </em>and a considerable part of the other lands devised to the complainants, as well as a portion of the lands which by the will were directed to be first .sold for the payment of debts. But there was no evidence, that the testator had in his lifetime sold the slave Peter, as alleged in .the answer of the administrator <em>Thompson.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-9\">The only evidence tending to shew a renunciation by either of the executors named in the will, was the deposition of a witness, who stated, that on the day the will was admitted to record be heard <em>William Poston, </em>one of the executors therein named, mention his age and infirmities, and the embarrassed situation of <em>James P. Thompson\u2019s </em>estate, as \u201cthe reason why he refused to qualify.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-10\">. The\u2019appraisement of the testator\u2019s personal property, made in November 1814 under an order of the county court of <em>Tazewell, </em>included none of the slaves, and the articles comprised in it, which were chiefly furniture, were valued at outy 341 dollars. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-11\">The sale of the land to <em>Meelc </em>was made in December 1814. It was fully proved that the administrator was, at the time, individually indebted about 1000 dollars to <em>Meelc, </em>and about 2000 dollars to one <em>Smith, </em>for which last mentioned debt his own lands were mortgaged; that <em>Meek\u2019s </em>demand against the administrator was discounted from the purchase money; and that his notes for other portions of the purchase money, to the amount of the 2000 dollars due <em>Smith, </em>were assigned to <em>Smith </em>by the administrator in payment of that debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-12\">Pending the suit, a part of the lands which the will subjected .in the first instance to the payment of debts, was sold by the administrator, and the proceeds amounted to 67S dollars. The remaining quantity was va<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>riously estimated by different witnesses, at from 500 to 800 acres; but it appeared that the average value did not exceed 25 cents per acre.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Arp\">In March 1824, the commissioner made a report of the defendant <em>Thompson's </em>transactions as administrator, shewing a balance due from him to the estate, of 1072 dollars on the 1st day of January 1823. He also reported, specially, an alternative statement, which if adopted by the court would increase the balance in the administrator\u2019s hands to 1750 dollars. And he appended to the <em>report, at the instance of the </em>administrator, a statement of <em>unsatisfied claims </em>against the estate, amounting to more than 5400 dollars of principal money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-6\">Both the administrator and the complainants excepted to the report; the administrator insisting that he was entitled to additional credits for payments made, to the amount of 1656 dollars; and the complainants objecting that two credits, amounting to 786 dollars, had been improperly allowed by the commissioner, and that a debit of 500 dollars, which they insisted the administrator had actually received, had been improperly omitted in the account. The chancellor overruled the exceptions taken by the administrator, sustained those taken by the complainants, and recommitted the report to be reformed accordingly, without taking any notice of the <em>alternative statement </em>made by the commissioner. By the actual account upon which the chancellor thus acted (supposing it reformed, according to his directions), the debts due from the estate of the testator amounted to 8200 dollars, excluding <em>the unsatisfied claims </em>the statement of which was appended to the report. There was conflicting evidence relative to the contested items of the account; and on the whole, the state of the accounts between the administrator and the decedent\u2019s estate was so uncertain, that, as this court thought, it was impossible to determine with any pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>cisi\u00f3n whether the sale of the land to <em>Meek </em>was or was \u00ab not necessary for payment of -the testator\u2019s debts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A4S\">Nevertheless the chancellor, by his decree of the 5th June 1830, recommitting the report as stated above, and declaring that he perceived no good reason to interfere with the purchase made by Meek from his codefendant <em>Thompson </em>the administrator, adjudged that <em>Meek </em>be forever quieted in his possession and enjoyment of the land so purchased, and that as to him the bill of the plaintiffs be dismissed, but without costs. From this decree the plaintiffs appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b446-8\">The cause was argued here by <em>Johnson </em>for the appellants, and <em>Robinson </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-9\">1. <em>Johnson </em>treated this as a bill alleging the grant of administration to be void, and seeking to set it aside. He said it was clear that where executors are appointed, they must refuse the executorship before administration can be granted. Toller on Executors, 89. 1 Williams on Executors, 367. And he insisted 'that a grant of administration without such refusal was void. Here, he said, the record did not shew that the executors ever renounced, nor was there any proof of their refusal to undertake the executorship. If the grant of administration was void, it followed that the sale by the administrator 'was also void.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Agp\"><em>Robinson </em>answered,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhCt\">that if the validity of the administration had been put in issue, the renunciation of the exedutors might have been shewn by matter <em>in pais; </em>but the question was not presented by the pleadings. The plaintiffs supposing the sale to pass the title, had come into equity to set it aside. If, however, the court could consider the question, and were to hold the grant of administration to be void, the bill of the plaintiffs must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction ; for, no title passing by the sale and conveyance of the administrator, the remedy at law against the purchaser would be complete.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>2. <em>Johnson </em>contended, that the power which the tes4 _ 1 . tator had given his executors to sell a part, the least in value, of the tract which he had given his son and daughter, was not a power to sell the whole tract; and even though there might be a charge upon the whole of the testator\u2019s real estate, which a court of equity might enforce, that would notjustifyt.be administrator in selling the whole. But he insisted there was no such charge. The effect of the general direction in the beginning of the will, for the payment of debts, must, he said, be limited by the subsequent charge expressly made on a part of the land. The sale was not only without authority, but made by the administrator for the purpose of paying his own debts ; and the purchaser was entitled to no favour.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b447-5\"><em>Robinson </em>answered,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8Sd\">that the true construction of the power to sell was, that so much might be sold as was necessary, and if the whole was necessary, <em>then the </em>whole might be sold. But, at all events, there was a charge by the words in the commencement of the will, upon the whole estate. <em>Clarke and wife </em>v. <em>Buck, 1 </em>Leigh 487. <em>Trent </em>v. <em>Trent's ex'x &amp;c. </em>Gilm. 174. The latter case shewed that the charge upon the whole was not retracted by the subsequent appropriation of a particular part. If the case was one in which, had no sale been made by the administrator, a court of equity might and would now decree a sale, then it was useless to set aside the sale already made, provided a fair price had been obtained. The particular manner in which the funds were applied was unimportant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-6\">3. <em>Johnson </em>argued, that the sale which had been made was in fact not necessary to pay the testator\u2019s debts ; and <em>Peobinson, </em>tliat it was.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b447-7\">Ijrockexb i\u00ed.ough, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aut9\">It was contended by the appellants\u2019 counsel, that the grant of administration on the estate of <em>James P. Thompson </em>was merely void, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>it does not appear that the executors appointed by the will had ever renounced. I think the objection cannot prevail. The statute declares that \u201cif the executors named in any will shall refuse the executorship, or being required to give security shall all refuse or fail to give the same, in either case the court may grant a certificate for obtaining letters of administration with the will annexed.\u201d It must be recollected that the case is not now before a court of probat, which might revoke an administration improperly granted, and make a due and regular appointment. It is in a court of <em>equity, </em>which cannot in a collateral way set aside or disregard a grant of administration, any more than it can reverse a judgment of a court of law. Nor is the question as 'to the validity of this grant, made by the pleadings in the case. If such had been the issue, it might have been in the power of the appellee to shew that a renunciation of the executorship had been made, either on the record, (which, however, was not necessary; <em>Geddy &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Butler and wife, </em>3 Munf. 345. <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Carrington &amp;c. </em>4 Munf. 332.) <em>or by </em>declarations made <em>in pais, </em>or by circumstances leading to the same conclusion: or he might have shewn that the executors had refused or failed to give security, having been required to do so, which is tantamount to a renunciation, and justifies the court of probat in granting administration with the will annexed.</p>\n<p id=\"AuUM\">The next question is, whether the administrator with the will annexed had any power under this will to malee sale of the land in <em>Burk's garden </em>(which the testator devised to his two children) for the purpose of paying the debts of the deceased, and whether the sale made to <em>Meek </em>was conformable with the power conferred by the will. In the first clause of the will the testator desires his funeral expenses and <em>all </em>his <em>just debts </em>to be paid. This clause confers no power on the executors to sell any part of the land. It probably operated as a <em>charge </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>on the whole land, and the case of <em>Trent </em>v. <em>Trent\u2019s ex\u2019x &amp;c. </em>Gilm. 174. might render it questionable whether that charge is retracted by the subsequent selection of a part of the land to be sold for the purpose. It is not necessary, however, to advert to that clause for any other purpose than to shew that it was the primary wish of the testator that his debts should be paid, even though his land might be required to defray them. It is the proper construction of the second clause which is to determine the decision of the subject now under consideration. The testator, after directing that certain parcels of land, lying around <em>the </em>land which he had previously disposed of, should be sold by his executors, who should apply the proceeds thereof to the payment of his debts, and after devising the tract on which he lived, including the <em>Blue spring, Cherry tree field, </em>and <em>Slime\u2019s lease, </em>to his two children, and making other provisions for the same purpose, says,\u2014\u201cI further order, if the lands I now hold, the land and negro I have directed to be sold, be <em>not sufficient </em>for the payment of my debts, that there be a part the <em>least in value </em>of the tract 1 have bequeathed to my son and daughter, be sold <em>to fully satisfy and pay all my just debts.\u201d </em>The executor (or administrator with the will annexed) was bound In the first place to apply the whole of the personal estate to the payment of the testator\u2019s debts: if that should not be sufficient, he is <em>expressly </em>empowered by the will to sell certain parcels of land; and if they should not be sufficient, the last clause which I have quoted, by a necessary <em>implication, </em>gives him power to sell <em>the whole </em>of the land devised to his children. For although he did not expect that the whole would be necessary to pay his debts, and ho restricts the executor to the sale of the part the <em>least valuable, </em>yet it is to be sold so as <em>fully </em>to pay and satisfy <em>all </em>his just debts. The executor, then, is <em>expressly </em>empowered to sell all but the last most valuable acre or minute part of the land; and as he was fully to satisfy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>debts, he is by <em>implication </em>authorized to sell even that last acre-</p>\n<p id=\"ARm\">But the question recurs, has the administrator, in the present case, fairly and with disci'etion exercised the powers conferred on him ? I think he has not. He has failed to appropriate the whole of the personal assets to the payment of the debts ; he has failed to sell the parcels of land which were specifically appropriated for that purpose; and he has, with most indecent haste, sold, not a part only, and that the least valuable, of the <em>Blue spring </em>and <em>Cherry tree field, </em>but he has sold the whole of that land, within two or three months after he qualified as administrator, and before he could know that it was necessary to do so. He appears to have been stimulated to that sale for the purpose of paying off some of his own debts. A considerable part of the purchase money was appropriated to the discharge of a debt due from himself to <em>Francis Smith, </em>for which his own lands were bound; and it appears from the evidence of <em>Philip Greever, </em>that the appellee <em>Meek, </em>the purchaser, was the creditor of the administrator, to the extent of one thousand dollars,' one fourth of the purchase money, and that debt was applied to the payment of it. Thus the greater part, I think about three fourths, of the proceeds of the testator\u2019s land, was applied to the payment of the individual debts of the administrator. <em>Meek </em>the purchaser was not only apprized of the before mentioned restriction on the power of the executors to sell the whole land, but he was actually cognizant of, if he did not encourage, the breach of trust committed by the administrator. I am of opinion that the chancellor erred in dismissing the bill as to <em>Meek, </em>and in quieting his title to the land. But yet I am unwilling that this court should unconditionally direct the sale to be set aside. \u25a0 The case as to the administrator is yet in progress; the settlement of his accounts is not yet completed ; the chancellor has not yet decreed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>the parcels of land before mentioned shall be sold and brought into account. When these things are done, and the whole subject is before him, he will be better able to decide whether it was necessary to sell the whole, or any part, of the tract called the <em>Blue spring </em>and <em>Cherry tree field; </em>and if it was, whether, from the evidence taken or to be taken, it is best for the interest of the devisees that the sale already made shall be set aside, and a new sale directed either of a part or the whole, or to confirm and establish the sale already-made. I am for reversing the decree with costs, and remanding the cause for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">Cabell, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b451-10\">Care, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7p\">The first point contended for by the counsel for the appellants was, that the administration granted to <em>William P. Thompson </em>was wholly void, because the will having appointed executors, there was no proof in the record that they had renounced. In the first place, this is a question not raised by the bill; for that is predicated on the idea of an administration which, however irregularly granted, enabled the administrator to act. It is filed to set aside the sale of the lands, not because sold by one who was not administrator, but by an administrator who violated, his duty in the manner of the sale, and exceeded the power given by the will. It rests on the ground that the legal title has pa.ssed by the sale, which could not be, if the vendor was no administrator : and if the legal title did not pass, it is in the plaintiffs, who in that case can want no aid of equity. But is this a <em>void </em>administration ? Can wc so decide ? The court which appointed the administrator is the tribunal appointed by law for that purpose; the case was regularly before them, and their appointment has never been reversed, never appealed from. Again, in <em>Geddy &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Butler and wife, </em>3 Munf. 345. and <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Carrington </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number><em>8fc. </em>4 Munf. 332. we are told that the renunciation of executors need not be by matter of record, but may be proved by declarations <em>in pais, </em>or presumed from circumstances ; and in <em>Burnley's adm'r </em>v. <em>Duke &amp;c. </em>1 Rand. 108. it is decided that such renunciation may be presumed, from the facts of an'executor\u2019s failing to qualify, and joining another (who had qualified as administrator) in a sale of land directed by the will to be sold, such joining being not in his character of executor, but as heir of the testator. Must we not then take it for granted, that the court making this appointment had before them either such proofs of parol declarations as shewed the renunciation, or such circumstances as justified the presumption ? But these would not be spread upon the record, as there was no opposition, that we hear of, t\u00f3 the appointment. The next question argued was, whether the whole real estate of the testator was charged with <em>the </em>payment of his debts, and if so, whether it was a mere charge, or amounted to a power given to the executors to sell.? I think it was a charge upon the whole. The first clause in the will is, '\u201cI desire that m3' funeral expenses, and all my just debts be paid.\u201d This, in the commencement of a will, has often been decided to be a charge on the realty. <em>Trent </em>v. <em>Trent's ex'x &amp;c. </em>Gilm. 174. <em>Clarke and wife </em>v. <em>Buck, </em>1 Leigh 487. But the will does not stop here. The next clause directs, that the lands lying around the land he had sold to different persons, in <em>Burk's garden, </em>be sold by his executors to the best advantage, and the money arising therefrom to be appropriated to the payment of his debts. He then devises certain lands described, to his son and daughter and wife, and divides his slaves between them. But his debts still weighed upon his mind, and he adds, \u201c I order, if necessary for the payment of my debts, that <em>Deter </em>a negro boy &amp;c. be sold for that purpose. <em>Item, </em>I further order, that if the lands and negro I have directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>to be sold be not sufficient for the payment of my debts, that there be a part, the least in value, of the tract I have bequeathed to my son and daughter, sold, <em>to fully satisfy a,nd pay all my just debts.\u20191\u2019 </em>Here we see again emphalically declared his purpose to <em>fully pay and satisfy all his just debts; </em>and as a means of fulfilling this purpose, his executors are directed (in addition to the other lands and slave) to sell a part of the land devised <em>to </em>his children\u2014\u201c a part least in value\u201d\u2014by which I suppose he meant that so much as would be sufficient to pay the balance of his debts should be taken off, in such way as would take the land least valuable and least affect the value of the remaining land. This shews that he did not expect it would require a sale of the whole land to pay the debts. But that does not vary the main and fixed purpose of his mind, which was that <em>all his debts should be fully paid and satisfied, </em>and that so much of this land as would effect this purpose should be sold; and if it took the whole, it is clear to me that the whole should be sold, and that his executors had. under this clause a power to sell the whole, <em>they being the </em>agents named by him for such sale. It is equally clear, that this power devolved by our act upon the administrator. But yet I think that in making these sales, and especially in the order and succession of sale, the directions of the testator should have been strictly followed; that the administrator should have sold first the slips of land, then the slave, and if these did not suffice to discharge the debts, then so much of the other tracts as would. The administrator instead of this has sold at once the whole of the land devised by the testator to his children. This I think gave just cause to the devisees to file their bill, upon the ground that the state of the funds did not require a sale of the whole or of any <em>part; </em>and to call for a settlement of the administration in order to shew this: and if it is shewn, the sale I think should be set aside, as the purchaser was bound to know the power under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>which the administrator sold, and is therefore a parcha- ... r ser with full notice. The chancellor however has dismissed the bill as to this purchaser, and quieted his ti-tie: while the accounts (as those of my brethren who understand them better than I do, tell me) are still in such a state as to leave it quite uncertain whether the whole, or what portion, of the land need have been sold. Upon this ground I agree that the decree should be reversed, and the cause sent back, and reinstated as to <em>Meek, </em>to be proceeded in according to the principles declared.</p>\n<author id=\"b454-6\">Brooke, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A63\">I think the whole of the testator\u2019s land was subjected to the payment of his debts by his will, if necessary for that object, in the event that the personal estate and the particular portions of the land directed by the will first to be sold were inadequate; but before that was ascertained by a full account of the assets, and the application of the sales of these particular portions designated by the will, <em>it </em>was error to sell the whole. The bill therefore ought not to have been dismissed as to the appellee until these matters were inquired into, and it was found that the sale of the whole was necessary. As to the objection that the administration was void, it not appearing that the executors named in the will renounced it,\u2014if that be so, it was for another forum, and not a court of equity, to inquire into it. It was not necessary their renunciation should appear on the record of the court granting the administration, as has been decided by this <em>court; </em>and if it were, we could not reverse the decision of the court of probat by a bill in equity. The objection that the administrator was in his own right a debtor to <em>Meek </em>the purchaser of a portion of the land, is no objection to the sale of the land to him, if the sale was a beneficial sale to the estate; it may have enhanced the price; which ought to be inquired into before the sale is set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>aside, as it appears that the administrator is solvent, and a creditor of the estate. I concur, therefore, in the decree reversing the deei'ee of the chancellor.</p>\n<author id=\"b455-5\">Tuckeh, P.</author>\n<p id=\"AFrq\">I am of opinion that the bill in this case was erroneously dismissed as to the appellant <em>Meek, </em>and that the cause should go back for further proceedings, until, by a settlement of the administration account, and a thorough investigation of the transactions of the administrator, it shall be definitively ascertained whether any, and what part, of the property sold by him to the appellee was necessary to be disposed of for payment of the debts of the testator. While that settlement was only in progress, it could not have been proper to dismiss the bill as to <em>Meek. </em>The land he purchased was only chargeable in the event of the deficiency of the personal fund, and certain portions of real estate which were directed to be first sold for the payment of debts. The sale of that land to him was, therefore, only justifiable in case of such deficiency, and he ought not to have been quieted in his possession while the ascertainment of that fact was only <em>in fieri. </em>As the account in its present state is liable to be varied in its progress to final adjustment by the decree of the court, it could not properly be regarded as a sure foundation for the action of the court in relation to <em>Meek, </em>even if the presumptions it affords in support of the necessity of a sale of the whole of the lands of the infants, were stronger than they are. For my own part, from the examination I have been enabled to make of the confused mass of vouchers and depositions, and of the inconclusive report of the commissioner, I have been led to the conjecture that a sale of the whole land was not rendered necessary by the circumstances of the estate, and of course that the bill ought not to have been in all things dismissed as to <em>Meek. </em>The case should go back for further examination, and if the sale should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>prove to have been unnecessary, it should be set aside, unless it should appear to have been an advantageous in which case it should be at the option of the devisees to confirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">In giving this opinion, it is proper to remark that it rests in no degree on the alleged nullity of the grant of administration, nor on the supposition that there is no charge upon the lands of the children created by the will.</p>\n<p id=\"AaO\">With respect to the first, it is not to be denied that an administration granted where there is an <em>executor, </em>without a refusal of the executorship by him, is by the authorities declared to be void, or a nullity. But how, and before what tribunal, is it a nullity ? Before the court of probat indeed it is so completely void, that upon the production of the will, letters testamentary may be granted to the executor at once, without the repeal of the letters of administration. But the question here is, whether in this collateral way, and before another forum, this sentence of the <em>court </em>of probat can be assailed and pronounced to be a nullity. If so, it presents the anomaly, that the sentence^ of a court which stands unreversed may be set aside by a co-ordinate tribunal,\u2014not on the ground of matter extrinsic, but upon the ground of error in the proceeding of the court. In other words the co-ordinate tribunal would be converted into an appellate court, to review and reverse the decision of the court of probat. This surely never has been deemed even within the ample powers of a court of equity. For the grant of administration by the court of probat is a judicial act, and as such must be conclusive on all other courts, until reversed by appeal or revoked by that court itself. In the case of <em>Allen v. Dundas, </em>3 T. R. 125. where a debtor had made payments to\u2019 an executor who had obtained probat of a forged will, those payments were held to discharge him. And <em>Buller, </em>J. said, he was clearly of opinion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>granting probat was a judicial act; that it was conclusive until repealed, and that no court o\u00ed common law could admit evidence to impeach it. Yet the case of a forged will is one of those in which the probat is considered void <em>ah initio. </em>See also 1 Ld. Raym. 405. and Phil, on Evid. 245. 24G. where it is said that \u201cthe sentence of the ecclesiastical court, pronounced in the exercise of this their exclusive jurisdiction in the probat of wills and granting administrations, is so binding on the temporal courts as to be <em>conclusive </em>evidence of the right directly determined. It is conclusive of the same matter coming incidentally into question in a civil case in another court.\u201d With respect to the cases in our own courts, I content myself with referring to what has been said by my brother <em>Carr.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">With respect to the question of charge, I think it quite clear that there is an express charge upon the lands sold to <em>Meek, </em>in <em>case </em>of the deficiency of the other funds. Whether that charge would cover the whole or extend only to part of the tracts devised to the son and daughter, it might be premature to decide, as <em>it </em>may happen that less than the whole will suffice. I shall therefore give no opinion upon the point, but shall conclude with the remark, that as there is here an express authority to sell in case a sale should become necessary for payment of debts, the executor (and, as <em>he </em>did not qualify, the administrator under our statute,) was empowered to perform that duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">I am of opinion to reverse the decree, and send the cause back for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
