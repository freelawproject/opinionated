Brown </em>and <em>G. Mayse </em>against <em>W. Sitlington, A. Sitlington </em>and <em>A. Morris, </em>alleging, that <em>Morris </em>executed a deed of trust conveying four parcels of land to trustees, for the purpose of securing a debt of 291 dollars due to <em>Brown, </em>and another of 886 dollars due to <em>Mayse, </em>but this deed was not recorded; that sometime after the execution of this deed, <em>W. Sitlington </em>procured from <em>Morris </em>a deed of trust conveying a part of the same trust subject to <em>A. Sitlington, </em>trustee, to secure a debt due to <em>W. Sitlington, </em>and had the same duly recorded; that before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>and at the time of the execution of this last deed, both <em>TV. Sitlington </em>and <em>A. Sitlington, </em>the trustee, had full notice of the execution of the prior mortgage under which <em>Brown </em>and <em>Mayse </em>claimed; that, therefore, they were entitled to priority over <em>TV. Sitlington; </em>that <em>A. Sitlington, </em>however, had sold the trust subject mortgaged to secure the debt due to <em>W. Sitlington, </em>and <em>TV. Sitlington </em>became the purchaser thereof at that sale, but the bill charged, that that sale was an unfair one; and that <em>TV. Sitlington </em>had thus purchased the property at a price far below its value. The bill, therefore, prayed, that the sale should be set aside, and a new sale ordered ; and that the court should decree the proceeds of such sale to be paid to the plaintiffs, as the mortgagees entitled to priority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-3\">The trustee, <em>A. Sitlington, </em>put in his answer, denying that he had any notice of the mortgage under which the plaintiffs claimed; and denying too, the imputed unfairness in the sale made by him under the deed of trust executed by <em>Morris to </em>secure the debt due to <em>TV. Sitlington. </em>The trust subject mortgaged by that deed was sold, at the trustee\u2019s sale, to <em>W. Sitlington, </em>for 300 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AaJ\"><em>W. Sitlington </em>himself died pending the cause, having prepared an answer to the bill, in which he, in effect, acknowledged notice of the prior deed under which the plaintiffs claimed. The suit being revived against his. heirs, who were infants, an answer was put in for them by a guardian <em>ad litem; </em>in which, of course, nothing was admitted or denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-5\">The bill was taken <em>..pro confesso </em>as to the defendant <em>Morris. </em>But he died before the sale of the trust subject ordered by the court was made; and the suit was not revived against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-6\">The depositions of <em>Morris, </em>and of his wife, were taken and filed for the plaintiffs. They deposed, that <em>TV. Sitlington </em>had full notice of the prior mortgage to <em>Brown </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>and <em>Maysc, </em>before the mortgage to him was executed, <em>, , </em>, , \u2022 ,. , \u2022 and that he prevented the prior mortgage from being duly recorded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ART\">The answer which <em>W. Sitlington </em>had prepared before his death, and in which he acknowledged notice of the prior mortgage, was inserted in the record. It appeared, that it had been sworn to by him before <em>J. Mown; </em>but <em>Mown </em>did not style himself a justice of the peace, and there was no proof that he was a magistrate authorized to administer an oath. The clerk certified that this answer was filed in bis office, but was not filed in the cause on account of the defendant\u2019s death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-7\">The chancellor, declaring that <em>W. Sitlington </em>had notice of <em>the prior </em>mortgage <em>to the </em>plaintiffs when he procured the mortgage to himself, and that, therefore, the plaintiffs were entitled to priority, ordered a sale of the whole trust subject mortgaged by <em>Morris </em>to the plaintiffs. The sale was made accordingly; and that part of the trust subject which was mortgaged by both the deeds of trust, and which had been sold under the deed of trust for the benefit of <em>W. Sitlington, </em>for 300 dollars, was sold under the chancellor\u2019s decree for 544 dollars. The sales having been reported, and tbc proceeds of the whole subject falling far short of the debts due to the plaintiffs, the chancellor finally decreed, that the property should be conveyed to the purchaser at the sale, and that the heirs of <em>W. Sitlington </em>should release all claim of title to him ; giving them a day after their attainment to full age, to shew cause against the decree. And they appealed to. this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b293-11\">The cause was argued here, by <em>Johnson </em>for the appellants, and <em>Robinson </em>for the appellees, upon two points:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aoe\">1. Whether the depositions of <em>Morris </em>and his wife were competent evidence to prove, that <em>W. Sitlington </em>had notice of the prior mortgage to <em>Brown </em>and <em>Maysc </em>when he procured the mortgage to himself? 2. Whether the pa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>per called <em>W. Sitlington\u2019s </em>answer could properly be looked into, for evidence of such notice of the prior deed ? If either of these questions were resolved in the affirmative, there was proof of <em>W. Sitlington\u2019s </em>notice of the prior deed : if both were resolved in the negative, there was no proof of such notice, upon which the claim of <em>Brown </em>and <em>Mayse </em>to priority depended.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b294-3\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AIq\">I am inclined to think the death of <em>Morris </em>before the sale, ought to have been deemed a sufficient objection to proceeding to sell, until the case was revived against his representatives <em>\u2022, </em>but the point is unnecessary to be decided, as the decree is, in my . opinion, fatally defective in other respects. The gist of the case is the notice on the part of <em>W. Sitlington </em>of the prior deed of trust. This is not established by competent evidence. 1. The paper called the answer of <em>W. Sitlington </em>is not authenticated or proved, so as to make it evidence in the cause, nor does it even appear by whom it was placed among the papers. Moreover, it does not appear that the person who certified the affidavit was a justice of the peace; so that the evidence that the paper was sworn to by <em>Sitlington </em>is altogether' defective. 2. <em>Morris </em>was an interested witness. If this decree be affirmed, he will have paid off 544 dollars of his debt to <em>Brown </em>and <em>Mayse, </em>and he will be liable to <em>Sitlington </em>for 300 <em>dollars; </em>whereas, if it be reversed, he will be liable to <em>Brown </em>and <em>Mayse </em>for 544 dollars, while he is relieved as to <em>Sitlington </em>only to the value of 300 dollars. Thus, he is a gainer 244 dollars by a de-' cree founded upon his own evidence. He is, therefore, clearly interested and incompetent. If so, it is equally clear that his wife was incompetent. For <em>Morris </em>was party to the suit, and by her testimony he is made to gain 244 dollars. There is no precedent for admitting the testimony of a wife in favour of her husband, he being a party to the cause. In <em>Baring </em>v. <em>Reeder, </em>1 Hen. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>&amp; Munf. 154. the husband was no party. That case has no resemblance to this. Therefore, 1 am of opinion, that the <em>decree </em>should be reversed, and the cause sent back for further proceedings, that the parties may have an opportunity of authenticating, if it can be done, the answer of <em>Sitlington, </em>which, if genuine, must put an end to the cause. The court having considered the testimony produced by the plaintiffs as competent and sufficient, and this court deciding otherwise, justice requires that the cause should go back to enable the plaintiffs to supply the defect, as it seems very probable there is in existence conclusive evidence\" in support of their case. My opinion in the case of <em>Duff </em>v. <em>Duff\u2019s ex\u2019or, </em>3 Leigh 523. may be referred to, as containing nay views upon a subject strongly analogous. It is unnecessary to repeat them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Brooke and Cabell, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b295-5\">Brockenbro\u00fcgh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABez\">I am not satisfied that <em>Morris </em>was an interested witness; but as the rest of the court are of opinion that he is incompetent, I shall say nothing on the subject. 1 concur in the opinion, that the paper in the record called the answer of <em>W. Sitlington, </em>cannot be regarded either as an answer or as an exhibit in the cause.</p>\n<author id=\"b295-6\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AKq\">I feel no doubt from the facts in the record, that the decree is substantially right; and I lament, that for want of some little care in authenticating that which no doubt was taken for granted, this cause must be sent back. I do not object to the failure of reviving as to <em>Morris. </em>1 should not be for reversing, if that were the only defect. But the point is the defect of proof as to the paper purporting to be <em>Sitlington\u2019s </em>answer. If the clerk had certified that this paper was filed by <em>Sitlington </em>himself as his answer, or if the per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>son who certified that he swore to it, had signed him-sell a justice of the peace, or had been proved to be one; I should have taken the paper for either an answer or a sworn statement of <em>Sitlington; </em>and <em>that </em>proving full notice of the' prior deed (which is the only point in the cause), I should have had no hesitation in affirming the decree. But as none of this evidence is furnished, I must concur in reversing the decree, and sending the cause back, to give the plaintiffs an opportunity to furnish this proof. I do not think <em>Morris </em>or his wife were competent witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Decree reversed, and cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
