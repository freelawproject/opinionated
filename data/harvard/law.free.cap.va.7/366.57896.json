The plaintiff <em>Guerrant </em>married <em>Caroline, </em>the ward, in May 1828. He did not receive actual possession of the plantation and <em>the </em>property upon it; but <em>\u201cMoseley </em>continued to manage the plantation as agent;\u201d and after the marriage of his ward to the plaintiff, sold to the defendant <em>Hooker </em>670 bushels of wheat, the crop of the year 1828, as wheat of the plaintiff. The price was left open, but was afterwards, with <em>Moseley's </em>consent, fixed by the plaintiff and the defendant at <em>ninety cents the bushel. </em>The defendant\u2019s receipts for the wheat were taken in the plaintiff\u2019s name, by the overseer who delivered it, and he delivered the receipts to <em>Moseley, </em>by whom he had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>employed. <em>Mrs. Guerrant </em>died in August 1828, after the crop of wheat had been reaped, and before it was sold a.nd delivered to the defendant. The plaintiff, after the death of his wife, gave notice to <em>Moseley, </em>not to, receive the money due for the wheat, and to the defendant, not to pay it to <em>Moseley: </em>but the defendant, notwithstanding, paid <em>Moseley </em>the money due for the wheat. The guardian\u2019s bond given by <em>Moseley to </em>the county court, was shewn in evidence; which was in the usual form of the bond of a guardian appointed by authority of the court,\u2014the condition reciting, that <em>William Moseley </em>had been \u201c appointed guardian of <em>Caroline Moseley, </em>orphan of <em>Daniel Moseley </em>deceased, by the court of the county of Buckingham.\u201d And it was agreed, that there was a suit pending in chancery between <em>Guerrant </em>and <em>Moseley, </em>for the settlement of <em>Moseley\u2019s </em>guardianship transactions. And this was ah the evidence adduced at the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-5\">The court then gave judgment for the defendant upon the verdict; and the plaintiff appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b387-6\"><em>Robinson, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b387-7\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b387-8\">C\u00fcrr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A-W\">I entirely agree in the remark of the appellee\u2019s counsel, that to justify us in reversing this judgment, and sending the cause back for a new trial, we ought to be satisfied that the verdict is clearly wrong; that it is, as judge <em>Roane </em>expresses it, \u201c a plain deviation.\u201d And such I cannot but think it is. We must take <em>Moseley </em>to have been not a <em>testamentary </em>but a common law guardian. The condition of the bond describes him as having been \u201cappointed guardian of <em>Caroline Moseley </em>&amp;c. <em>by the court of the county of Buckingham.\u201d </em>Now, this could not have been truly said, if the appointment had been by will; for though, in such case, the bond is to be given to the court, yet the guar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>dian is first to appear in open court, and declare his acceptance of the trust, which is to be recorded, 1 Rev. Code, ,ch. 108. \u00a7 2. p. 406. and the bond would surely conform to this record. Taking him as a common law guardian, it is clear that his guardianship was terminated by the marriage of the ward. <em>Mendes </em>v. <em>Mendes, </em>1 Ves. sen. 91. How did the parties consider it <em>1 </em>Clearly in the same light; for, though it is stated that no actual delivery of the land was made to the husband (which, by the way, I do not consider necessary to give him the legal possession, there.being no adverse holding), yet it is a fact in the case, that after the marriage, <em>\u201cMoseley </em>continued to manage the plantation as <em>agent.\u201d </em>Why not as guardian ? because that office had ended by the marriage. As agent for whom ? Not for the infant <em>feme covert; </em>she was under a twofold disability to appoint such an agent: of necessity, then, as agent for the husband. The acts of <em>Moseley </em>shew that he understood it thus. When the wheat was severed from <em>the </em>land, it became, as I take it, the clear and <em>absolute </em>property of the husband; and <em>Moseley </em>sold it to the defendant as the wheat of <em>Guerrant, </em>thus shewing whose agent he considered himself. The receipts too, taken of the miller by the overseer, were in the name of <em>Guerrant; </em>he also fixed the price of the wheat, which had been left open; and to this <em>Moseley </em>assented, thereby again recognizing <em>Guerrant's </em>ownership. And if it had not been for the plaintiff\u2019s misfortune in losing his wife, we should never have heard of the pretension since set up : but this event could not divest a right already reduced to possession. Further, upon what safe ground could the defendant <em>Mocker </em>refuse to pay to the plaintiff, and pay to the agent, when expressly forbidden to do so ? He had acknowledged the ownership of the plaintiff, by giving the receipts as for <em>his wheat, </em>and by afterwards fixing the price with him. Under these circumstances I am of opinion that he paid in his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>back for a new trial.</p>\n<author id=\"b389-7\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"AAl\">I think it clear, that the property in the wheat sold to <em>HocJcer </em>was in the plaintiff <em>Guerrant. </em>He married <em>Moseley\u2019s </em>ward in May 1828, <em>Moseley </em>then holding possession of her land as guardian. What was the effect of that marriage upon the guardianship ? It determined it, <em>ipso facto. </em>Lord <em>Hardwicke, </em>indeed, in <em>Roach </em>v. <em>Garvan, </em>1 Ves. sen. 157. says, the court will not determine a guardianship because of a marriage of a ward of the court; and in <em>Mendes </em>v. <em>Mendes, </em>3 Atk. 625. he is represented as saying, that notwithstanding the marriage of the young earl of <em>Shaftsbury, </em>his guardianship did not determine by his marriage (which, by the way, was, I presume, beyond question); but in the report of that case in 1 Ves. sen. 91. he remarked in addition, that marriage determines the guardianship of <em>daughters, </em>though not of <em>sons. </em>And, truly, it seems impossible it should be otherwise. If the contract of marriage be valid, all the consequences or incidents of that contract must at once ensue. By the marriage the husband at once becomes invested with the right to the society and person of his wife, and her personalty in possession becomes instantly vested in him <em>jure mariti: </em>he is at once invested also, with the right and possession of all her real estate, in her right; and with her rights of action for whatever, whether of personalty or realty, she may be wrongfully deforced of. All her rights determine during the coverture, and are swallowed up in his ; and if the guardianship as to her properly were to continue, the guardian would from the date of the marriage be his guardian, not hers.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">If then, as I take it, the guardianship determined on the marriage, how did <em>Moseley </em>hold the land until <em>Mrs. Guerrant\u2019s </em>death ? The case proved states that he held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>it as <em>agent; </em>not <em>totidem verbis, </em>that he held as agent of <em>Guerrant, </em>but it is plain that that was meant. ' In the absence of a statement to the contrary, we must take it, that he held as agent of the person entitled: and that was <em>Guerrant. </em>Accordingly, when the crop was severed, he-sold it as <em>Guerrant\u2019s. </em>Holding, then, as <em>Guerrant\u2019s </em>agent, his possession was <em>Guerrant\u2019s </em>possession ; and when the wheat was severed, the possession of it by <em>Moseley </em>was <em>Guerrant\u2019s </em>possession. So far from his holding possession adversely, he actually sold it in <em>Guerrant\u2019s </em>name, and <em>took the </em>receipts to him, and not to himself, for the wheat that was delivered. Indeed, he could have had no other possession than as agent. He came in by right, and he who has gained a rightful possession, cannot without some tort convert it into one which is wrongful. He could not make that possession adverse, which he received as fiduciary. His possession, therefore, was the possession of <em>Guerrant </em>from the moment his powers determined. He, at most, could only be tenant by sufferance, whose possession is the possession of the landlord: but, in fact, he claimed no longer to hold but as agent, for it is found that after the marriage \u201c he continued to manage the farm as agent.\u201d The wheat, then, having been the absolute property of <em>Guerrant, </em>having been sold by <em>Moseley </em>to <em>Mocker </em>as <em>Guerrant\u2019s, Mocker </em>should have paid him, instead of paying the proceeds of sale over <em>to Moseley, </em>after notice not to do so. The action therefore was properly sustainable, and the verdict wrong. A single consideration will prove this. Had <em>Moseley </em>sued. <em>Mocker </em>for the wheat, which was <em>Guerrant\u2019s </em>property, he must have sued upon the special contract: <em>quantum valebat </em>would not have lain, because there was a sale for an agreed price. But the special contract on which the suit must have been brought, was not a contract with <em>Moseley. </em>It was a contract in which <em>Moseley </em>was expressly contracted with as the agent of <em>Guerrant, </em>and all the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>ceipts were m <em>Guerrant s </em>name. How, then, could , , <em>Moseley </em>have recovered r</p>\n<p id=\"An\">The other judges concurred. Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
