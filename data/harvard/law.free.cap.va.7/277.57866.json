The </em>debt <em>due from Holloway </em>to <em>Wilkinson Sf Co. </em>was not extinguished by the transaction between <em>Holloway </em>and <em>Glenn, </em>their attorney. Though payment to an attorney at law employed to collect a debt, especially if he has the evidence of debt in his possession, is good; <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>1 Wash. 10. <em>Branch </em>v. <em>Burnley, </em>1 Call 147. ^yet an attorney at law, without special instruction or assent of his client, has no authority to use the debt due to the client, for the discharge of his qwn debts, or to commute it with the debtor for other debts due to him. The point has been expressly decided by the general court; <em>Smock </em>v. <em>Dade,' 5 </em>Rand. 639. And the reason for the distinction, there given, is plain and irrefragable: when an attorney employed' to collect a debt due ,to his client receives the money, he acts under the authority derived from his client; but when he takes from the debtor an assignment of debts due to him in satisfaction of the debt due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>from him, and undertakes to collect the assigned debts, _ _ _ Ins authority is derived not from his client at ail, but from the debtor: he is, in truth, the debtor\u2019s -\u00bb*\u2022 *11 <em>1 </em>\u00ab 71 /f A like decision on the point has been made m <em>Massachusetts; Langdon </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>13 Mass. Rep. 319. and in <em>South Carolina; Commissioners of accounts </em>v. <em>Rose, 1 </em>Desaus. 461. Mere possession of the bond or other evidence of debt, confers on an attorney employed to collect it, no further authority than the general one of an attorney at law; authority, namely, to receive payment. If it did, the possession of the bond, however or by whomever obtained, would give the holder a. legal title to it; which cannot be pretended. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Rucker, </em>1 Call 500. An agent employed to collect, with the evidence of debt put into his possession, has no right to assign or to pawn it; <em>Tonkin </em>v. <em>Fuller, 3 </em>Rose. Doug. 300. 26 Eng. C. L. Rep. 117. If he cannot assign or pawn, how can he barter it ? A factor employed to sell goods, has no authority to barter them ; <em>Gucrreiro </em>v. <em>Peile, </em>3 Barn. &amp; Ald. 616. 5 Eng. C. L. Rep. 399. So, where an insurance broker was employed to receive payment from the underwriter, even a custom to set off the general balance due from the broker to the underwriter, was held illegal; <em>Todd </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>4 Barn. &amp; Ald. 210. 6 Eng. C. L. Rep. 404. For, \u201c the general rule of law is, that if a creditor employs an agent to receive money of a debtor, and the agent receives it, the debtor is discharged as against the principal, but if the agent, instead of receiving it, writes off money due from him to the debtor, the debtor is not discharged;\u201d <em>per Abbott, </em>C. J. in <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Bangley, </em>4 Barn. &amp; Ald. 395. 6 Eng. C. L. Rep. 460. Here it is not pretended, that <em>Wilkinson If Go. </em>gave any special authority to <em>Glenn, </em>their attorney at law for collection. And if it shall be argued, that they sanctioned <em>Glenn's </em>dealings with <em>Holloway, </em>by prosecuting a suit on the bond of <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Scott, </em>which <em>Glenn </em>received from him, and defraying the costs of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>suit; the answer is, that it is quite obvious, that <em>Glenn </em>instituted that suit of his own accord; and if <em>Wilkinson Sp Co. </em>were afterwards active in the prosecution of the suit, and bore the expense of it, this was, in truth, done for <em>Holloway\u2019s </em>benefit, and was fairly attributable to their willingness to get -their money from whomsoever and in whatever manner they honestly could, not to any intention to sanction the irregular conduct of their attorney. And the case of <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Bangley </em>will be found to be a direct authority in point. Then, 2. if the transaction between <em>Glenn </em>and <em>Holloway </em>did not extinguish the debt of <em>Holloway </em>to <em>Wilkinson Sp Co. it is </em>useless to examine the statutes of <em>North Carolina, </em>putting assigned bonds or notes upon the footing of inland bills of exchange, for the purpose of seeing whether <em>Holloway </em>was entitled to notice from <em>Wilkinson Sp Co. </em>of the non-payment of <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Scott\u2019s </em>bond. 3. As to the plea of the statute of limitations : <em>Wilkinson SpCo. </em>allege in their bill that <em>Holloway\u2019s </em>debt to them was \u201c bonded\u201d by <em>Ruffin </em>or by <em>Glenn: Holloway </em>in his answer says, he gave <em>Henry Wilkinson </em>his \u201c note\u201d for it. The words \u201cbond\u201d and \u201cnote,\u201d in the common parlance of-the country are often used convertibly; <em>Holloway </em>in his\u2019 answer so uses them; and if this was a <em>note, </em>not a <em>bond, Holloway, </em>pleading the statute of limitations, should and no doubt would have produced the instrument, for it was in his possession <em>; </em>but he did not produce <em>it. The </em>fair inference is, that it was a <em>bond, </em>and then the statute certainly presented no bar. But grant that it was a <em>note, </em>and take <em>Holloway\u2019s </em>account of it: he says he gave the note to <em>Henry Wilkinson, </em>Now he was a merchant and resident of <em>\u2018Petersburg, Virginia, </em>and the debt was contracted there. <em>Holloway\u2019s </em>note, then, was made there. But <em>Holloway </em>was a resident of <em>North Carolina. </em>And this brings the case within the proviso of the statute of limitations, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 128. \u00a7 14. p. 491. The act of limitations of <em>North Carolina, </em>could not be pleaded here; <em>Jones\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Hook, </em>2 Rand. 303.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbU\">1. The distinction between the authority of an attorney at law, employed to collect a debt, and having the bond or note for it put into his . r <em>. </em>. . possession lor collection, to receive payment m money, and to receive satisfaction in any other commutable, is an over-nice one. Had not <em>Glenn </em>authority to receive from <em>Holloway </em>a bill of exchange drawn in <em>North Carolina </em>on <em>Petersburg, </em>for the debt? or to receive bank notes in payment of it ? If so, then he had a right to commute the debt due from <em>Holloway to </em>his client for other debts ; for bank notes are only evidences of debt. It can make no difference what kind of debt is the commutable received by the attorney. But when a creditor employs an attorney to collect a debt for him, and puts the evidence of the debt in the attorney\u2019s possession, he docs give him and intends to give him authority to collect it in the best and easiest way he can. The attorney\u2019s authority to receive payment of the debt, is put by this court, in <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>on the ground of the custom of the country: and the custom of the country goes the length of warranting the attorney to commute the debt due his client for other debts. It is a rule of law, of equity, and of reason, that he who trusts most, shall suffer most,\u2014that he who trusts an agent with unlimited discretion, shall abide any loss from a breach of the trust. Here, the evidence of the debt was put into <em>Glenn\u2019s </em>possession; but for what purpose, was known only to <em>Glenn </em>and his clients. How could <em>Holloway </em>or any stranger know, that <em>Glenn </em>acquired the possession of the bond or note, only for the purpose of collection ? that it was not delivered to him by way of transfer ? If <em>Glenn </em>had sold and transferred the debt to a stranger for valuable consideration, without notice of his agency, he would have done what his clients put it in his power to do, and they ought to abide the loss, arising from their own indiscreet selection of their agent, and unlimited confidence reposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>in him. If <em>Glenn </em>had brought suit against <em>Holloway, </em>in the name of <em>Wilkinson &amp; Co. </em>for his own benefit, <em>Holloway </em>(having no notice of the breach of trust) might have set off a debt due to him from <em>Glenn; Winchester</em> <em>Hackley, </em>2 Cranch 342. and when judgment was recovered for the balance, he might have settled with Glenn, and discharged the debt in any way they could agree upon. Here, without any suit being brought, <em>Holloway </em>settled the debt with the holder of his note or bond, gave him a valuable consideration for it, and took in his bond. If <em>Glenn </em>committed a breach of trust, or an act of indiscretion, <em>Wilkinson,Sf Co. </em>who constituted him their agent, and gave him unlimited discretion, must bear the loss. But <em>Wilkinson &amp; Co. </em>sanctioned the act of their attorney. They prosecuted the suit on the bond assigned by <em>Holloway </em>to them, or to <em>Glenn </em>for them, against the obligors at their own costs. If they did not mean to sanction <em>Glenn\u2019s </em>conduct, they ought immediately to have.disclaimed all right to the assigned bond, and asserted their original claim against <em>Holloway. </em>They made no such disclaimer. They failed to get the money from the obligors in the assigned bond as early as 1821; yet they asserted no claim against Holloway, but commenced a new pursuit against <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Scott, </em>which proved unavailing in 1825; and it was not till 1828, that they asserted their original claim against <em>Holloway. </em>There could not be stronger circumstances to shew their acquiescence in and sanction of <em>Glenn\u2019s </em>conduct. 2. The statute of limitations was a bar. It was pleaded in <em>Holloway\u2019s </em>answer, and nothing was replied in avoidance of it: so that <em>Wilkinson 8f Co. </em>cannot here rely on the proviso of the 14th section of the statute, even if the case were within its meaning. <em>Holloway </em>says, he gave a <em>note </em>for his debt to <em>Henry Wilkinson </em>in person. If it was a <em>bond </em>and not a <em>note, </em>they should have proved it; they should, at least, have called on <em>Holloway </em>to produce the instrument: but, without do<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>ing cither, and without any replication to the answer, i -11 i -i \u2022 i i <em>r </em>which alleged that it was a <em>note, </em>they set the cause tor hearing. This court must take it, that the instrument was a <em>note, </em>not a <em>bond. </em>Then, where wa.s the note made ? at <em>Petersburg? </em>or in <em>North Carolina? Holloway </em>says, it was given to <em>Henry Wilkinson </em>in person; but it might have been given to him in <em>North Carolina, </em>as well as at <em>Petersburg; </em>and if so, the case was clearly not within the proviso of the 14th section of our statute of limitations. To say the least, the facts touching this point, do not appear in this record with sufficient certainty. But the 14th section of the statute has no application to the case. A citizen of <em>North Carolina, </em>residing at home, cannot, because he does not come to <em>Virginia, </em>be truly said <em>\u201cto </em>abscond or conceal himself, or by removal out of the country or county where he shall reside, obstruct or defeat\u201d his creditor in <em>Virginia </em>from bringing his action against him.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b305-9\">BnocKEsamoiJfiH, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Av7\">There is nothing in the record to shew, how far by the laws or established usages of <em>North Carolina, </em>an attorney at law who has possession of the specialty of a client, may bind him by a settlement of the debt with the debtor; nor does the answer of the defendant who had dealt with the plaintiffs in <em>Virginia, </em>suggest any difference between the law of that state and of this, in this respect. I shall therefore inquire, how the common law and our own law stand on this subject. The cases of <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>and <em>Branch v. Burnley, </em>establish the proposition, that an attorney at law who has possession of the evidence of debt, or has obtained a judgment for his client, may receive from the debtor payment of the debt, and that the creditor having confided in him not only to sue if necessary, hut also to collect and receive the money, is bound by the payment. They place the attorney at law on the footing of an agent delegated to receive money. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Now, such an agent cannot vary from his authority, by i'eceiving a bill or note, instead of money, or of that which according to the course of trade is current as money. Paley on Agency 220. <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Evans, 2 </em>Ld. Raym. 930. Salk. 442, S. C. Nor can even a general agent, without particular authority, commute the payment by receiving another thing, as a horse &amp;c. in discharge of the debt,'unless it be delivered over to the employer who agrees to it. Paley 221. This was also laid down by the general court in <em>Smock </em>v. <em>Dade; </em>where it is also said, that the attorney at law- who gave a receipt or acquittance for the money, represented the debtor and not the creditor. I do not quote this case as authority, but I consider it as a good decision. The modern case of <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Bangley </em>is a strong one to prove, that if the agent, instead of receiving money, gives to the debtor credit for money which he himself owes to the debtor (or, as it is expressed, \u201c writes off money due from him to the debtor\u201d), then the <em>debtor is </em>not discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"AZ0D\">If is admitted, however, that acquiescence on the part of the principal will be proof of consent on his part, and that will make the act of the agent the act of the principal. Salk. 442. Then the question is, whether, in this case, there was such acquiescence alleged and proved ? I think not. The plaintiffs have not admitted by their pleadings, nor is there any proof of, actual consent. But it has been inferred that there was such consent, from the circumstance that the plaintiffs paid' some of the costs incurred in ,the suit brought on the bond which <em>Glenn </em>the attorney took from <em>Holloway </em>in discharge of his bond. It is to be remarked, that the answer of <em>Holloway </em>does not put his defence on the ground of the acquiescence of the plaintiffs, but relies on the authority of the attorney to make the arrangement which he did make. I do not think that the court \u25a0ought to supply his deficiencies, and furnish him with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>a weapon which ho did not choose to wield. If he had thought proper to rely on acquiescence, the plaintiffs might have given circumstances in evidence, which would have led irresistibly to the conclusion, that they did not agree to take the bond of <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Scott </em>in satisfaction of <em>Holloway\u2019s </em>debt to them ; and that although they were willing to wait to see whether any thing could be made from the suit against those obligors, and for that purpose to pay the costs, yet that they did not ratify the act of <em>Glenn, </em>who in that matter acted rather as the agent and attorney of <em>Holloway, </em>than of themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">As to the statute of limitations, I think it will not apply to the present case. It seems sufficiently clear, that the paper which <em>Holloway </em>executed to the plaintiffs wa.s a sealed instrument. The bill says, that the plaintiffs sent to <em>llujjin </em>an open account claim against the defendant <em>Holloway, </em>and that <em>llujjin </em>put the claim into the hands of <em>Glenn </em>an attorney, that one of them <em>bonded </em>the account, and that <em>Glenn </em>held the <em>bond. </em>The defendant denies that the <em>account </em>was sent on to <em>Rvjjin, </em>and affirms that he himself executed to one of the plaintiffs the <em>note </em>in question, and that the <em>note, </em>instead of the <em>account, </em>was sent to <em>Rujjin. </em>The note in question ought to be understood to mean the <em>bond </em>which the plaintiffs mentioned in their bill; especially as the defendant had possession of the instrument, and if it was a mere <em>note </em>of hand, and not a sealed instrument, might have produced it, and shewn its real character. Again, the defendant describes the paper which he transferred to <em>Glenn </em>as being a <em>note ; </em>that paper happens to be in the record, and is clearly a sealed instrument. Hence, I infer, that the other was a sealed instrument likewise; and if so, the act of limitations does not apply. But if it was a note of hand, the 14th section of the statute of limitations will prevent that, statute from operating as a bar.</p>\n<p id=\"Adx\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>On the whole I am of opinion, that the decree of the superiour court of chancery should be reversed, and that of the county court affirmed. <em>J</em></p>\n<author id=\"Alk\">Carr, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJo\">In the view I take of this case, the statutes of <em>North Carolina, </em>putting bonds, notes, &amp;c. on the footing of inland bills of exchange, are wholly unimportant.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac4\">As to the statute of limitations, I question whether it would apply to the c\u00e1se, even between citizens of the commonwealth; since I incline to think, that we must take the debt from <em>Holloway </em>to <em>Wilkinson Co. to </em>have been? due by bond. It behooved the pleader of the statute, to make out a case to which it clearly applied: and I think no one could say he has done this, even if this was a case between residents. However, I have not much examined that point; because I think it clear, that the plea cannot be sustained, on another ground. If we may credit the defendant\u2019s answer, (as according to the rules of evidence, we must), the cause of action accrued in <em>Virginia. </em>He says, the plaintiffs did not send their <em>account </em>to <em>Ruffin, </em>but he executed the <em>note in question </em>to the plaintiff <em>Henry Wilkinson </em>in person, and that the note, instead of the account, <em>was sent to Ruffin. </em>This allegation, positive and responsive, and not contradicted, by any evidence, is decisive, that the note or bond (whichever it was) was executed here. If so, the proviso of the 14th section of the statute of limitations applied <em>a fortiori </em>to the defendant, who left <em>Virginia </em>as soon as he had executed the instrument, and resided in <em>North Carolina; </em>thereby -obstructing the plaintiffs\u2019 action. Neither could it have been brought when it was, but for the accidental circumstance of the defendant having debts due to him in <em>Virginia. </em>It surely does not lie with persons so situated, to avail themselves of the statute; especially in equity, where it is applied not as positive law binding the court, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>by analogy. It was said, that if the plaintiffs meant to t , . . . . . rely on the proviso of the 14th section, they ought to have replied the matter in avoidance, specially. But the counsel did not, at the moment, reflect, that special replications, with all their consequences, are now out of use, and the plaintiff is to be relieved according to the form of his bill, whatever new matters may have been introduced by the defendant\u2019s plea or answer; Mitf. Plead. 256. and that now, a decree in equity cannot be reversed for the entire want of a replication to the answer, by our statute of 1827-8. Supp. to Rev. Code, ch. 96. \u00a7 1. p. 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Then the question is, as to the arrangement made by <em>Glenn </em>with the defendant, taking in part discharge of <em>Hollowatfs </em>bond to the plaintiffs, a debt due from himself to Holloway, and for the balance, a, bond of <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Scott </em>to <em>Holloway. </em>Was this transaction binding on the plaintiffs ? 1 understood the appellee\u2019s counsel in his argument to take the position, that the possession of a bond does, of itself, empower the holder to discharge it by any contract he may choose to make with the obligor. Taken thus broadly, I should think the proposition plainly unsound and mischievous. Considering <em>Glenn, </em>first, as an agent to collect, had he power to bind his principal by the contract he made P The authorities are, to my mind, perfectly clear and decisive, that he had not. The cases of <em>Tonkin </em>v. <em>Fuller, Guerreiro v. Peile, </em>and <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Bangley, </em>cited at the bar, \u25a0were decided upon principles plainly applicable to the question. [Here, the learned judge stated the particular circumstances of those cases, and the points presented and decided.] To those authorities I shall add a reference to one or two of older date, which are to the same purpose. Thus, in Doct. &amp; Stud. Dial. 2. ch. 42. pp. 237, 8. it is laid down, that even a general agent cannot, without particular authority, commute the payment by receiving another thing, \u00e1s a horse &amp;c. in dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>charge of a debt j unless it be delivered over to the em- <em>.. </em>7 T . ployer, who agrees to it. bo, m <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>2 La. Raym. 930. 2 Salk. 442. <em>Ward </em>sent his servant with <em>a </em>note of <em>\u00a3 </em>50. to his debtor, to receive the money; the with the servant to <em>Evans\u2019s </em>shop, who indorsed off <em>\u00a3 </em>50. from a note of <em>\u00a3 </em>100. which he owed the debtor, and gave <em>Ward\u2019s </em>servant a note for <em>\u00a3 </em>50. upon one <em>Wallis, </em>a goldsmith, which was presented the next morning, but payment was refused, and <em>Wallis </em>broke that day; the note was returned to <em>Evans, </em>who refused to pay it, and this action was brought to <em>recover </em>it: the court held, that <em>Ward </em>was not bound by this conduct of his servant; lord <em>Holt </em>saying, that \u201c when a servant is sent to receive money on a bill, he cannot accept a note instead of money, without the particular directions of his master.\u201d All these authorities apply with double force to the case of an attorney at law. When a man has debts outstanding, his first object is to collect them in the quickest and cheapest mode; and he either applies himself, or employs some agent to go around to his debtors, to get the money or money\u2019s worth. If this effort fails, his last resort is to collect them by process of law; and then he goes to the lawyer, and deposits them with him\u2014for what? to commute them for land, or horses, or slaves, or other bonds, or to pay the lawyer\u2019s own debts ? No, so far from it, that the universal understanding is, I believe, that it is not a duty of the lawyer even to apply to the debtor; he may and often does do it, from a disposition to be civil; but very often also, he taires them to the clerk\u2019s office, and issues the writ at once. So much was he considered the mere instrument of the law to enforce the payment to the client, that the question in our early cases, was, whether he was authorized to receive the money himself, under any circumstances. But I have never seen a case, nor heard an opinion, that he was clothed with power to use the bond as if his own pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>perty, exchange it for other property, or pay his own % i \u2022 i \u2022 tvt x if <em>\u25a0 </em>, , , debt with it. JNor can I well conceive, how a debtor can, without actual fraud, deal in this way with an atlorney, whose only evidence of power is the possession of the bond. Look at the case of an executor: he is so far the representative of the testator, that he has the legal title to the personalty; yet, because he is a fiduciary, any individual creditor of his own, who receives in discharge of his debt, assets of the estate, knowing them to be such, or whoever deals with the executor for any of the assets, in any way which makes him a party to the breach of trust, must account for such assets to those who are entitled under the will. <em>Graff </em>v. <em>Castleman, 5 </em>Rand. 195. Here, the defendant in <em>his </em>answer, explicitly states his knowledge that the note was placed in the hands of <em>Glenn </em>for suit or collection : how then could he, without participating in the fraud of <em>Glenn, </em>assist him in abusing his trust so far as to apply a part of that note to the payment of his own debt to the defendant, and to receive from the defendant for the balance, a bond worth (so far as we can judge) not one cent ? I sa.y so, because upon a suit brought in good time and diligently prosecuted, the return was <em>no effects. </em>Observe too, how this bond was transferred: there was no assignment to the creditor, but a blank indorsement, to be filled up as the attorney pleased, and in fact filled up to one <em>Young. </em>The property in this bond, then, was never in the creditor. Can a debtor thus discharge an honest debt ? Can he, thus knowing, thus aiding, thus taking advantage of, this gross breach of trust, extinguish his obligation ? I answer, confidently, no\u2014unless the creditor has, by some unequivocal act, sanctioned the transaction; some act, shewing that with a full knowledge of the circumstances, he had assented to take in satisfaction of the debt due him from <em>Holloway, </em>the bond of <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Scott, </em>and <em>Glenn\u2019s </em>debt.</p>\n<p id=\"AQJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>What is the evidence of such assent ? The answer n . \u2022 , does not charge it, but, on the contrary, rests the matter wholly on the power which the possession of the note for suit, gave <em>Glenn </em>over it ,\u2022 adding, that if <em>he </em>has jmp0se(j on the plaintiffs, it is their misfortune to have trusted an unfaithful agent. There are no letters from the plaintiffs ; no proof of any communication between them and <em>Glenn </em>on the subject. The barter took place in 1819, and in February 1821 (not longer probably than 18 months after) there was a return on the execution for <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Scott's </em>debt, of <em>nulla bona. </em>Within this time, we do not know that the plaintiffs ever heard of the transaction; and being in another state, we may well suppose that they did not; especially as the bond was not assigned to them, but to one <em>Young, </em>and the suit in his name. If they had not heard of the exchange before, it is hardly imaginable that, after this return had ascertained the worthlessness of the bond, they would sanction it, unless (in ignorance of their right) they might believe they had no power to disavow it, and look still to their debtor. But it is said, that the plaintiffs have paid the costs of the suit on the assigned bond, and thereby ratified the exchange and given up their claim on <em>Holloway. </em>It is clear, that this act does not of itself amount to a release of <em>Holloway: </em>it is at best but a fact on which to found an inference. That the plaintiffs did not understand it to be a release, is very evident; for we find no trace of the fact except in their bill; and there it is brought forward as a ground of additional claim against <em>Holloway, </em>not a release of the old claim. But taken in itself, Ido not think the isolated fact authorizes the inference, especially when we are to draw it in favour of one who is confessedly a party to the fraud practised on the plaintiffs. But suppose it were in proof, that the plaintiffs had been informed of this unauthorized act of the attorney, and had so far acquiesced as to await the issue of the suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>on the bond: 1 bold, that even this would not have re- \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 leased the original debtor. For this I might cite several cases; but one will suffice; I mean <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Bangley, </em>beibre referred to. There, the underwriter settled the loss upon the policy to the broker\u2019s satisfaction, though not by the payment of actuaL money; the broker informed the assured of this settlement; and in the account sent, made himself debtor to the assured for the <em>\u00a3 </em>150. the amount of the loss; and the assured so far sanctioned this arrangement that he drew a bill of exchange on the broker at two months, which was accepted ; but as the broker failed, soon after it grew due, without paying it, the assured sued the underwriter: and, by the opinion of the whole court, recovered. The opinions shew the ground on which the judges placed this point. <em>Bayky </em>said\u2014\u201c The fact of the assured taking <em>Savenfs </em>(the broker) bill, was nothing more than an <em>agreement to </em>accept payment in <em>that </em>way, if it should be ultimately available. If the defendant had meant that the money should be paid by bill, he should have sent that bill to the assured, or he should have pledged his own credit in some respect.\u201d <em>Holroyd </em>said, \u201cIn this c\u00e1se, the policy having been placed in the hands of the broker, an account is made out, shewing how much was duo from the assured to the broker on one hand, and from the broker to the assured on the other; and in that account the broker slates the amount of the loss in question to be a sum due from him to the assured. It was, however, in fact, due from the underwriter. For the balance of that account, the assured drew a bill on the broker, which was accepted by the latter, but not paid in due course, and that without any default of the assured in endeavouring to obtain payment. This being so, I cannot distinguish this case from those in which it has been decided, that receiving a bill from a third person is not a satisfaction of a debt, in case the bill be not eventually paid, unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>there be some default in the holder.\u201d <em>Best </em>said, \u201cThe . , , . . . broker was <em>only </em>authorized to receive payment m money. The defendant has settled the loss with the broker; that is, the amount due to the plaintiff has been ascertaine(i between them, and the broker accepted a bill for the same. Before, however, the giving of a bill of exchange by a third person can discharge an original debtor, it must be shewn that the person taking that bill agreed to accept it in full satisfaction. There is no such agreement in\" this case.\u201d This case, I think, goes very far beyond that <em>before </em>us.</p>\n<p id=\"A88P\">I am of opinion that the decree of the superiour court of chancery be reversed, and that of the county court affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b314-6\">Cabell, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ALHU\">There is no difficulty nor doubt as to the principles of law applicable to this case. It is perfectly clear, on common law principles, that an attorney at law, as such, has no authority to set off a <em>debt </em>due from himself against a debt due to his client, nor to commute the bond of his client put into his hands for collection, for any other bond. And it would be a work of supererogation to attempt to enforce what has been already said on this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">But although the acts of the attorney in relation to the bond in question were not originally binding on the appellants, yet they may have become binding by their subsequent ratification. And the only question in this case is, whether there has been such ratification. This is a question of fact, to be determined by the evidence. I think there is no sufficient evidence to establish the fact. There is no positive proof whatever on the subject ; and the only circumstance, that can be relied upon as affording a presumption of the fact, is the payment by the appellants of the' costs of the <em>North Carolina </em>suit, on the bond which their attorney <em>Glenn </em>had taken, in lieu of\" the bond originally -entrusted to him. But al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>though we may fairly infer, from the payment of these costs, that the appellants were willing to make an effort to get payment of their debt by means of that suit; yet it would be unwarrantable to infer a total'abandonment of their claim against <em>Holloway, </em>in case that effort should fail. For, the evidence does not disclose one word, nor one act of omission or commission, on the part of the appellants, from which we can justly infer such an abandonment, except the fact of the payment of the costs: and that fact is satisfactorily accounted for by the consideration before mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">This view of the subject puts an end to the question as to the statute of limitations. For the claim of the appellants against the appellee is still for their original debt, due by bond, to which the statute is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">I concur in the opinion to reverse the decree of the chancellor and to affirm that of the county court.</p>\n<author id=\"b315-7\">Brooke, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Aso\">I also approve the decree of the county court. Glenn, the attorney, who derived his authority from <em>Ruffin, </em>and was unknown to the plaintiffs, had no other power but that of collecting the debt due them from <em>Holloway. Glenn </em>held the note (or bond) of <em>Holloway, </em>which <em>Holloway </em>acknowledges in his answer was the evidence of his debt to the plaintiffs, not their open account against him, as is stated in the bill. With them <em>Glenn </em>had no direct communication; and though, if he had received the money and paid it over to them, there would have been no objection to his agency, yet until that was done, they might acknowledge him as their agent or not, as suited their own interest. There is nothing to show any authority given to <em>Ruffin, </em>to whom the collection of the debt had been committed, <em>to </em>transfer the collection of it to <em>Glenn. </em>But if there had been, it was a fraud in <em>Glenn </em>to collect a part of it by the payment of his own debt to <em>Holloway, </em>and take the as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>signment of <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Scott's </em>bond for the balance. Upon principle, <em>Glenn </em>became <em>Holloway's </em>agent to collect that assigned debt, not the agent of the plaintiffs. Neither do I'think that the plaintiffs, by stating in their tpe procee(jingg to recover the assigned debt, and that they had defrayed the costs of that suit, ratified <em>Glenn's </em>acts, or even adopted him as their agent. They only waited to see whether their money could be got by the suit against <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Scott: </em>but they had no communication with <em>Holloway </em>on the subject, tending to shew their satisfaction with the arrangement he and <em>Glenn </em>had made. The setting off of <em>Glenn's </em>debt to <em>Holloway </em>against <em>Holloway's </em>debt to the plaintiffs, was a fraud in which <em>Holloway </em>participated. The patience of the plaintiffs, in waiting to see whether the money could be made by the suit against <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Scott, </em>cannot be held a ratification by the plaintiffs of <em>Glenn's </em>arrangement with <em>Holloway, </em>without denying the correctness of the decision in <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Bangley, </em>which, as my brother <em>Carr </em>has shewn, is a direct authority to the point, and a stronger case than this. As the debt of <em>Holloway </em>to the plaintiffs was contracted in <em>Virginia, </em>and he soon afterwards went or returned to <em>North Carolina, </em>and has resided there ever since, I cannot see how he can avail himself of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<author id=\"b316-5\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"A1E\">I cannot agree that the possession of a bond or other documentary evidence of debt, is such an evidence of property as will justify a payment to the holder, without an authority express or implied from the true owner. At common law, the property in these <em>choses in action </em>could not pass, even where they were actually assigned and delivered; an equity only was acquired by such assignment, and of course could never exist except where value was paid. By our law, assignments are permitted; and a transfer even without assignment, is held to pass the right of property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>But to such a transfer two things are necessary; 1. con- ... . \u201e . ,. ,. T . sidcration, and 2. the act o\u00ed transfer, it is not a more delivery of the possession without intent to pass the property, that constitutes the transfer. There must be an intent to transfer, and if there is no such intent, the holder has no right of property; he has no right to sell; nor has he a right to receive payment from the debtor, unless by authority express or implied. Every consideration that applies the principle of <em>caveat emptor </em>to the case <em>of </em>sales <em>of </em>property by one having possession without title, has additional force in the case of bonds and other <em>chases in action; </em>and, accordingly, the courts have uniformly decided, that as to them the rule <em>caveat emptor </em>applies. An exception, indeed, has been made in respect to money and bank notes, and even bills of exchange payable to bearer, acquired fairly in the course of business, which are universally treated as money, and which it is necessary for the purposes of commerce and the convenience of society should circulate freely and without obstruction. This distinction between money and documentary evidences of debt, is clearly stated in various cases. <em>Myers &amp; Son </em>v. <em>Friend, </em>1 Rand. 12. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Rucker, </em>1 Call 500. <em>Wookey </em>v. <em>Foie, </em>4 Barn. &amp; Ald. 1. 6 Eng. C. L. Rep. 323. If, then, the possession of a bond is not such an evidence of property as to make valid a sale by the holder, it is not perceived how a payment to him can be deemed valid, and a satisfaction of the demand, unless upon the express or implied authority of the agent to receive. If a suit be instituted upon a bond not assigned, it must be in the name of the obligee, and the judgment and execution follow the writ. When the sheriff makes the debt, he must pay it into court, unless he takes the responsibility of paying it to the creditor. If he pays to any other than the obligee, it is on his responsibility also; and if he pays it into court, it never would be ordered to be paid over to any other person than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>obligee himself, unless the court was satisfied of the title of such person to receive it. Neither is the mere possession of a bond sufficient evidence of authority to receive. It is a fact too equivocal in its character, to justify, any action upon the strength of it. He who pays to any other than his creditor, ought to be assured by some more unequivocal evidence that payment is authorized. The possession of a bond, by an attorney furnish.es, indeed, a strong presumption of authority to receive ; but that presumption may be contradicted, and if satisfactorily contradicted, the. payment will be void. If it was placed in his hands by the obligee for collection, the ordinary course of business, the common custom of the country, will justify a payment to him. But it justifies a payment only, not a transmutation of the debt for the payment and satisfaction of the attorney\u2019s own debts, or in exchange for property or other documentary evidences of debt. An authority to collect, is not equivalent to an authority to secure a debt in any way the agent may think fit. The former only authorizes the receipt of money, or of what is considered money. The latter will authorize the taking assigned bonds or other documentary evidences of debt in payment. Such, I am persuaded, has been generally deemed the principle applicable to transactions between attorneys and their clients, with us. The attorney who merely receives a bond for collection, does not consider himself as entitled to receive other paper in discharge of it, unless expressly authorized by his client. If, indeed, he perceives that such an arrangement is essential to his client\u2019s interest, he may enter into it, subject to his ratification or rejection; or he may even enter into it and take the chance of ratification, where the course is plainly and obviously for the client\u2019s advantage. Yet even then, his principal may repudiate his act.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">.1 have said thus much on these, topics, because I would be unwilling by silence to seem to accede to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>very broad and sweeping propositions advanced in the , argument. In my opinion the case itself does not require their aid. The agency of <em>Glenn </em>has been abundantly recognized and confirmed by the plaintiffs. In the first instance, <em>Glenn </em>converted the open account into a specialty; which, by the bye, was, I presume, within his agency. He then discounted a part of the demand, by a debt of his own to the defendant, and received a bond for the residue. Did the plaintiffs know of the arrangement ? Their bill proves they did; for they recognized the suit brought for their benefit, and paid off the fee bills which grew out of it; and that voluntarily, for the payment of those fee bills could not have been enforced. Did they suffer the transaction to remain ten years without knowing what had been done ? It is not credible. If they did know, did they at once announce to the defendant that they disclaimed the agency ? that they would look to him and he must take care of himself? It is not pretended. With what justice, then, can they now throw back upon him the bond which has been prosecuted as their own by their acknowledged attorney ? With what justice can they now disavow an arrangement, the benefit of which they would have taken, had it turned out successfully ? The agency of their attorney has been ratified by their acquiescence, even if unauthorized at first. For, though the agent exceed his authority, yet his act may be ratified subsequently, and that ratification may be presumed from acquiescence. 4 Bac. Abr. Master and Servant. K. p. 586. As, if a master sends a servant to receive money, and instead of money he receives a bill, the master may as soon as he knows of it dissent, and will not be bound by the payment; but acquiescence, or a small matter, will be proof of the master\u2019s assent, and that makes the act of the servant the act of the master; <em>per Holt, </em>C. J. in <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Evans, 2 </em>Salk. 442. <em>Thorold </em>v. <em>Smith, 11 </em>Mod. 87. 2 Stark. Law Ev. part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>4. p. 58. In- this case, I think the evidence of acquiescenpe and i'atification full and satisfactory, and, therefore, that the original debt was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"AmC\">Therefore, the only question now is, whether the defenciant liable as assignor ? And on this question, I am of opinion, that due diligence was used by the plaintiffs for the recovery of the amount of the assigned bond, and that upon the return of the execution <em>no effects, </em>a complete right of action accrued to them. Unluckily for them, however, the period at which their right accrued is so remote that their recovery is now barred by our statute of limitations, within none of the exceptions of which have the plaintiffs brought themselves. From the facts appearing in the record, it would seem that the defendant was indeed an inhabitant of <em>North Carolina; </em>but the cause of action arose in that state, and the defendant resided there, when it arose. Now the statute only saves the right of the plaintiff in an action in <em>our </em>courts, where <em>he himself </em>is a non-resident, and not where the defendant is ,\u2022 for the defendant ought to be sued where he resides. The only exception in the statute founded upon the locality of the defendant, is to be fouin^ in the 14th section. But that can have no application here, since there can be no pretence that the defendant has absconded or concealed himself, or defeated the plaintiffs\u2019 action, by removal, from the country. The defence of the statute, then, is unanswered.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">My own opinion is, that the decree of the superiour court of chancery ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">Decree of the superiour court of chancery reversed, and decree of the county court affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
