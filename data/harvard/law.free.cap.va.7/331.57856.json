Ho submitted, that interest ought to be allowed on <em>Claiborne\u2019s </em>judgment, upon the authority of <em>Beall </em>v.

Nicholas </em>and <em>Grattan </em>for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuiG\">made a strenuous effort to sustain the decree. I. They insisted, that the order of the chancellor to consolidate the two causes, without consent of parties, and even without the consent of the two plaintiffs, was irregular, and must be wholly disregarded by this court; and the chancellor himself, in fact, disregarded it in his final decree; for he dismissed the bills respectively, and the plaintiffs respectively appealed. <em>Wimbish </em>could not appeal from the decree dismissing his bill, nor could this court take jurisdiction <em>of his appeal; </em>because the amount of his claim was under 100 dollars, 1 Ilev. Code, ch. 64. \u00a7 2. p. 190. The decree in <em>Wimbish\u2019s </em>case was final, and whether right or wrong, irreversible. His appeal must be dismissed. II. As to <em>Claiborne\u2019s </em>case, they said, he had had the land of <em>Gross, </em>his debtor, extended, under his <em>elegit </em>as early as February 1817; be had a right to the moiety of the land extended, as tenant by <em>elegit; </em>the irregularity of the inquisition, if it was fatal, might have been corrected on the return of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>the process, by quashing it, and extending the land anew; but he chose, at the time, to abide by the title he had acquired; and he was, in fact, tenant by <em>elegit </em>at the time the conveyance from the debtor to his daughters was made. That conveyance being made (of course) subject to <em>Claiborne\u2019s </em>rights as tenant by <em>elegit, </em>was not and could not be fraudulent as to him. He could not afterwards, upon his own motion, quash his elegit, and the extent made under it, and thereby make a transaction fraudulent which otherwise would not have been fraudulent, and so overreach and avoid the previous conveyance of the debtor to his daughters, even supposing that conveyance merely voluntary. For, by abandoning his first <em>elegit </em>after it had been executed, which was a complete satisfaction, he extinguished his claim: because, though a tenant by <em>elegit, </em>if evicted by others, may have a new <em>elegit </em>or any other execution, yet, they said, he could not entitle himself to a new execution by an eviction arising from his own fault, much more procured by his own act alone. <em>2 </em>Wms. Saund. 68.c Co. Litt. 289.b 290.a But granting that the creditor here had a right to quash his own <em>elegit, </em>and the extent made upon it; then, either any new <em>elegit </em>he might sue out, would have relation back to the date of his'judgment, or, as against mesne purchasers, it would have no relation back whatever. If by quashing his <em>elegit, </em>the lien of his judgment from its date was renewed, there was no manner of necessity for him to resort to equity for relief; his remedy at law was complete, simple and unembarrassed; he might have sued out another <em>elegit, </em>and that would have overreached all mesne conveyances, whether voluntary, or founded on a good or on a valuable consideration: the conveyance from his debtor to his daughters would have been no hindrance to him: equity need not, and therefore ought not, to have interposed to remove a conveyance out of his way, which was not a hindrance to his remedies at law. If when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>he quashed his <em>elegit, </em>the relation of his lien back to his judgment could not be aJJowed so as to overreach fair mesne conveyances (as was held by this court in <em>Eppes </em>v. <em>Randolph, 2 </em>Call 103.); then the whole question was, Whether the conveyance in this case was merely voluntary, and so fraudulent in Jaw as against creditors, or was fraudulent in design and in fact ? They contended, 1. That this was not a voluntary conveyance. For the daughters assumed the debt which their father owed to <em>Smith, </em>and gave their own bonds for it, as well as a mortgage of the land to socui'e the payment: they bound themselves personally for that debt, whether they should derive any benefit from their father\u2019s conveyance of the land to them or not. They agreed too to apply the fruits of their own labour to the support of their aged parents during their lives; and the proof that the agreement was made, consisted in the fact that it was fulfilled on their part. And it was competent to the parties, to aver and prove any consideration other than that expressed in the deed, provided the consideration proved was of the same nature with that expressed; that is, both valuable considerations. <em>Duval </em>v. <em>Bibb, </em>4 Hen. &amp; Munf. 113. 121. <em>Eppes </em>v. <em>Randolph, 2 </em>Call 125. 152. Then, 2. As to the imputation of actual fraud,\u2014that was an imputation upon <em>Gross </em>alone. The fraudulent purpose of the grantor did not affect the grantees, unless they were parties to the fraud. <em>Garland </em>v. <em>Rives, </em>4 Rand. 282. 800. 301. And there was no proof of any actual fraud to which the purchasers were parties ; no proof of any actual fraud in the father, that could affect the rights of the daughters under the conveyance. The proof consisted wholly of declarations of the father after the conveyance was made; which, surely, were not evidence against the daughters.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b357-4\"><em>Johnson </em>replied,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AyV\">that <em>Wimbish </em>acquired by the service of his <em>ca. sa. </em>on <em>Gross, </em>and the debtor\u2019s discharge from custody under the statute for the relief of insolvent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>debtors, alien on the lands of the debtor, and therefore, ^ <em>Wimbish\u2019s </em>appeal should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction, and the decree as to <em>Claiborne </em>should be reversed, <em>Wimbish </em>must be made a party defendant to, <em>Claiborne\u2019s </em>bill. The inquisition on <em>Claiborne\u2019s elegit </em>of 1817 was void for uncertainty, because it did not set apart the moiety extended by metes and bounds; <em>2 </em>Wms. Saund. 69.a In modern practice the sheriff never delivered the moiety extended, to the creditor ; his remedy was to bring ejectment for it; but if the inquisition was void for\u2018uncertainty, the creditor could never obtain possession of the land under it; and therefore in this case, the court, on the motion of the creditor, properly vacated the <em>elegit; </em>Id. 69.c The creditor was then entitled to a new <em>elegit; </em>which would have related back to the date of his judgment, since he had previously made his election to take a moiety of his debtor\u2019s lands, and this process would have overreached mesne conveyances ; yet this did not preclude him from his resort to equity, to have the voluntary and fraudulent conveyance removed out of his way. And he maintained, upon the proofs in the cause, that the conveyance of <em>Gross </em>to his daughters was certainly voluntary, and so void against his creditors, if not fraudulent in design and in fact.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b358-7\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Azq\">Two judgments at law having been obtained by different persons against <em>Gross, </em>were transferred, one to <em>Claiborne, </em>and the other to <em>Wimbish; </em>and they filed separate bills against <em>Gross, </em>to set aside, as fraudulent, a deed made by him conveying his land to his daughters. After these bills had been separately \u2018 answered, and had been depending for some time, the chancellor ordered, that they be united and proceeded in as one cause. Knowing that these consolidation orders were sometimes made in the courts of common law, it did not strike me to inquire whether they were proper in chancery also, until my attention was turned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>to the question by my brother <em>Brooke, </em>and some cases referred to. On examining these, I find the attempt to introduce such a practice into the court of chancery in <em>England, </em>has been discouraged. And as this is the first time the question has come before us, it may not be amiss to quote a passage from the latest case I find in the english books, in which the vice chancellor reviews the different eases on the subject. It is the case of the <em>Warden and Fellows of Manchester College v. Isherwood, </em>decided in 1829. 2 Sim. 476. <em>2 </em>Cond. Eng. Ca. in Ch. 506. where the vice chancellor says\u2014\u201c The general rule is, that every plaintiff1 shall be at liberty to conduct each suit that he institutes, in what way he thinks best. At lav/ there is one exception; in the case of policies of assurance : and the question is, whether in courts of equity any such exception has been allowed ? In the case of <em>Pyke </em>v. <em>Brock, </em>3 Gwiil. 1345. in the year 1791, a motion was made to consolidate seven tithe suits. In that case, chief baron <em>Eyre </em>speaks of the practice as if it were common; but the reason assigned for making the order was, that no cause was shewn. In <em>Keighly </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>16 Ves. 344. in 1809, a motion was made, before answer, to consolidate tithe suits. Lord <em>Eldon </em>is represented as stating his opinion, that the court of exchequer did very freely consolidate cases of this description ; but it appears that he mentioned the point to baron <em>Thompson, </em>who had no idea that the order was of course in the court of exchequer, though sometimes made under special circumstances ; and lord <em>Eldon </em>refused to make any order. In 1819, in the case of <em>Forman </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>7 Price 654. a motion was made, after answer, to consolidate tithe causes. The chief baron <em>Richards sa</em>id\u2014 I never heard of an order, in the course of my experience, for consolidating causes in equity, nor can I conceive upon what principle It can be done. There are many reasons why it should not; and if it be the practice, it is extraordinary.\u2019 And upon refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>ring to the registrar, he said there was a case wherein 7 \u201c . a similar application had been made, about twenty-four years ago, in about 1795, when the court refused the application. In 1820, in <em>Forman v. Southwood, </em>8 Price 572. a motion was made to consolidate tithe suits, be-f\u00b0re answer Tand that was refused; and it is stated, (see page 575.) that a similar application had been made in the case of <em>Davies </em>v. <em>Mosely, </em>in May of the same year, and refused with costs. These are all the cases in print. But in a manuscript case of <em>Kynaston </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>before lord <em>Eldon </em>in February and March 1826, a motion was made to consolidate tithe suits, before answer, and refused. It is evident, therefore, that neither in this court, nor the court of exchequer, has the practice prevailed, of compelling the plaintiff to consolidate, his different suits against several defendants : and the present motion, being a mere experiment in opposition to practice, must be refused with costs.\u201d In the record before us, the cases seem to have been united on the motion of the plaintiff in the first cause. I think we must still consider them as distinct causes: and as that of <em>Wimbish </em>v. <em>Gross </em>is below the jurisdiction of this court, the appeal as to that must be dismissed; but, under the circumstances, without costs, the appellant being led to believe-by the\u2019 order of court, in which he seems to have had no agency, that his cause formed part of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">With respect to the case of <em>Claiborne, </em>I think the decree dismissing his bill must be reversed. I take much pleasure in saying that the argument for the appellees was such as would have done credit to much older counsel; yet it could not avail to cleanse of its stain the deed from G?vss to his daughters. I am compelled to believe it fraudulent and void as to creditors. It has all the badges about it. It was voluntary; the consideration expressed is disproved; and it is in full proof, that the grantor made it for the express purpose of avoiding the payment of <em>Claiborne's </em>judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>But it was contended, that this was not a case of which equity had jurisdiction, because the judgment of <em>Claiborne </em>was older than the deed, and because it had actually been satisfied by the levy of an <em>elegit. </em>With respect to the elegit, the court from which it issued quashed it; and we are compelled to conclude, properly; because the proceedings of a court having jurisdiction of the matter, cannot be questioned by a side wind. The execution being thus quashed, is as if it had never issued, and leaves the plaintiff free to pursue any remedy which was before open to him. But in the mean time, these deeds have intervened; the deed to the daughters, their deed to <em>Smith, </em>and their deed to <em>Hodges. </em>The case of <em>Eppes </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>deciding that judgments do not bind lands after twelve months, unless execution be taken out, or an <em>elegit </em>entered on the record,\u2014is considered the law of the land, however it may be doubted by one or two.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> This being so, will equity refuse to receive this plaintiff, and assist him in setting these deeds out of his way? I think not. But though these deeds will not be suffered to impede creditors, they are yet good between the parties ; and if by the fair exercise of its powers equity can, instead of cancelling them, make them the means of satisfying the claims of the creditors, I think such an administration will be best suited to its mild spirit. And this 1 believe may be done. The record tells us, that the deed made to secure <em>Smith\u2019s </em>money has been released, that debt being paid. But the deed conveying 150 acres of the land to <em>Hodges </em>is still in force, and he can have no cause of complaint provided his title is secure ; which wili, be effected by satisfying out of his purchase money, the debts due from <em>Gross </em>before he executed the deed to his daughters. He was to give 1050 dollars for the land: he paid the debt to <em>Smith </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>amounting to 271 dollars, and executed his bonds for \u00b0 the balance; three bonds for 260 dollars each, payable at distant dates; to secure which he has executed a deed of trust of the land. We hear of but two creditors \u00b0f <em>Gross, </em>namely, <em>Claiborne </em>and <em>Wimbish; </em>and the latter, though his appeal has been dismissed here for want of jurisdiction, has a just claim for the amount of his execution, and that claim will be available to him, by means of his <em>ca. sa. </em>under which <em>Gross </em>swore out; for upon that event, the law vested all his property, not pledged to prior liens, in the sheriff, for the benefit of the <em>ca. sa. </em>creditor. And <em>Wimbish </em>(I apprehend) may, under our insolvent law, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 134. \u00a7 34. p. 538. proceed by summons to get satisfaction of his debt; or as there may be difficulties in the way of such proceeding, it may be safer to direct, that when this cause goes back (as it must) he be made a party, and entitled to satisfaction after the judgment of <em>Claiborne, </em>prior in time, shall .be satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"AuEq\">It was contended that this judgment of <em>Claiborne's </em>must be taken to have been nearly half discharged, as his <em>elegit </em>had been levied many years before it was quashed. I question much, from the proofs in the record, whether he was ever in possession under it. We know that he did not receive possession from the sheriff, on the d\u00e1y the inquest was taken; and we know also, that the lines dividing the half intended for him were never completed, so as to set it out in severalty. This is a point, however, which need not be decided now, but may be inquired into when the cause goes back.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">Upon the whole my opinion is that the. decree in <em>Claiborne's </em>case be reversed, and the cause sent back, with directions to make <em>Wimbish </em>and <em>Hodges </em>parties; that an account be taken of the-judgment of <em>Claiborne, </em>charging him with the annual value of the moiety, as settled by the inquest, for such time as he shall have been in actual possession thereof; and that upon <em>Hodges's </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>receiving a good and sufficient title (if he has not alb . b , . . . . , , . : . . ,. , ready received it, for ins deed is not m this record), he be decreed to pay and satisfy out of the purchase money in his hands the judgment of <em>Claiborne, </em>the execution of <em>Wimbish Sec.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">Brockenb rough, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b363-9\">Tucker, <em>F.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ATo\">The first question which presents itself in these cases, is as to the order to consolidate the causes. Whether that order was <em>regular or not, is no </em>otherwise important here, than as it may affect the appeal of <em>Wimbish, </em>whose demand is not sufficient to give jurisdiction if his case stands by itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\"><em>Claiborne </em>and <em>Wimbish </em>are both seeking to set aside the same fraudulent deed, and to charge the same land, and, no doubt, might have united in the same bill for the purpose of recovering their demands. Nothing is more common, or more proper, than the joining of parties as plaintiffs, who have the same common object. It is on this principle that one creditor may institute a suit on behalf of himself and others who may come in, in the course of the cause, and prove their debts and their right to participate in a common fund. Whether, where several suits have already been instituted, they can be consolidated, may however be a different question. I do not distinctly perceive any good reason why those <em>who wight have </em>united in <em>commencing </em>a <em>joint suit, </em>may not afterwards unite their several suits, and consolidate them into a single cause. I recollect no particular instance of the kind, though we are all aware that where there are various demands, which are intimately connected with each other, and seek to charge the same fund, the several causes in which they are asserted are tried together, and one decree is made to embrace them all. Whether regular or not, this has become a common practice with us. But as to consolidating suits in equity, I am indebted to my brother <em>Brooke, </em>for a reference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>three recent cases in which the practice is denied and ^ disapproved; <em>Forman </em>v. <em>Blake, 7 </em>Price 654. <em>Forman </em>v. <em>Southwood, </em>8 Price 572. and <em>Manchester College v. Isherwood, 2 </em>Sim. 479. <em>2 </em>Cond. Eng. Ca. in Ch. 508. I have examined them, and incline to think they are not parallel\u2019 to the case at bar. The point, however, is not, I conceive, necessary to be decided in this case; for, notwithstanding the order, the cases are severed in the decree. The bills are dismissed respectively, and the parties respectively prayed an appeal. Here, then, is an appeal prayed by <em>Wimbish </em>separately from <em>Claiborne, </em>and so accordingly is it docketed. This appeal cannot be supported, for <em>Wimbish\u2019s </em>demand cannot give jurisdiction to this court. The appeal must therefore be dismissed, but without costs, as improvidently allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">As to <em>Claiborne\u2019s </em>case : I think there was no doubt of the justness of his demand; the fraudulent character of the alienation; or the jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">1. As to his demand. It is not pretended, that it has been paid. But it is said to have been satisfied by the <em>\u00bflegit. </em>This cannot be. The <em>elegit </em>having been quashed by a court of competent jurisdiction, the legality and justice of whose acts we cannot thus collaterally question, it must be considered as if it never had existence. My own impression is, that it was properly quashed, as the boundaries of the extended land were not set out so as to enable him to take possession. If, indeed, he has had possession, of which I am not satisfied, an account of the profits he has actually received must be taken, and those profits set off against the demand. -But I do not think he would be properly chargeable with speculative profits on an extent which was void, and has been quashed for uncertainty. His debt then is unsatisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\"><em>2. </em>As to the fraudulent character of the alienation, that is beyond question. The deed was made for a consideration different from that expressed upon its face, when, in truth and in fact, the principal conside<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>ration was a secret trust for the support of the grantor . <em>1 </em>1 and ms wife. If this be not void, both at common law and by the statute, I am at a loss to conceive what can <em>J </em>be SO.</p>\n<p id=\"AzUI\">3. As to jurisdiction. If <em>Eppes </em>v. <em>Randolph </em>be still considered as good law, then the attempt of <em>Claiborne to extend </em>the land by a second <em>elegii </em>after the first was quashed, would have been arrested by the intervening alienation to <em>Gross\u2019s </em>daughters, unless he can prove it to be fraudulent and void: and to do this,\u2014to remove that deed out of the way,'\u2014he had a right to resort to a court of equity, the two jurisdictions being concurrent as to this matter. And even if the existence of that deed did not of itself furnish a barrier to proceeding at law, the deed of trust to <em>Smith, </em>who is not proved to have had notice, would have been an insuperable one. Admitting that deed to be a good one, and not overreached by the new <em>elegii, Claiborne\u2019s </em>only remedy is in equity, where he may get paid out of the residue of the trust fund, after satisfying <em>Smith. </em>Since the suit brought, indeed, <em>Smith </em>has been paid by <em>Hodges, </em>and now <em>Claiborne </em>is entitled to payment out of the funds in the hands of <em>Hodges, </em>who certainly appears to have no reasonable title to a rescission of his contract. He, however, is no party to <em>Claiborne\u2019s </em>bill. The cause should, therefore, go back for further proceedings. <em>Hodges </em>should be made a party, and <em>Wimbish </em>also, as the insolvency under his <em>cu. sa. </em>gives him a right to such portion of the fund as is necessary to pay his debt, after <em>Claiborne </em>is satisfied, he having the preference according to the case of <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Rootes, </em>4 Leigh 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">In <em>Wimbish\u2019s </em>case, appeal dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">In <em>Claiborne\u2019s </em>case, decree reversed, and cause remanded for further proceedings, with directions that <em>Wimbish </em>and <em>Hodges </em>shall be made parties defendants &amp;c.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Note by reporter.
