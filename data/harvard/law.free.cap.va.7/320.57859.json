The bill, therefore, made the sons and daughters of the testator <em>Martin </em>(the executory legatees to whom the slaves in question were given by his will, in <em>the event </em>of the plaintiff\u2019s wife dying without leaving issue) defendants; and prayed, that the plaintiff might be quieted in his title to the slaves ; or, if that was <em>not proper, </em>that his testimony should <em>be </em>perpetuated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-3\">One only of the children of <em>Martin </em>answered, disclaiming all knowledge of the alleged <em>absolute gift </em>of the slaves, by <em>Martin </em>to the plaintiff\u2019s wife, in August 1821; and objecting, that even if the plaintiff should prove the <em>gift, </em>he was not entitled to the <em>relief </em>he prayed; namely, to be quieted in the absolute title he claimed. As to all the other defendants, the bill was taken <em>pro confesso.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-4\">The plaintiff took and filed the depositions of three witnesses, to prove the gift by <em>Martin </em>to his wife, in August 1821, under which he claimed the absolute title to the slaves.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-5\">The chancellor decreed, that the bib, so far as it sought relief, should be dismissed; and declaring, that so far as the bill sought to perpetuate testimony, it was proper to entertain it, but as the defendants had examined no witnesses on their part, the plaintiff must bear the whole costs of the proceedings, he decreed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>that the -testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s three witnesses should be perpetuated, as evidence in relation to the title claimed by the plaintiff in the <em>bill; </em>and that the plaintiff should pay the defendant who answered, his costs.

Here, the husband in possession of certain slaves, insists that they were given absolutely to his wife by her father. The father made a will, by which <em>he gave </em>the slaves to this daughter for life, but if she should die without leaving issue at her death, that they be sold and the money divided among his other children. The husband files thife bill (his wife being still alive), making her brothers and sisters defendants, and calling on them to discuss the question, whether these slaves passed by the alleged gift, or by the will ? Is not this calling on them to discuss a title which may never come <em>in esse ? </em>Suppose the wife should leave issue, <em>do </em>not all agree that the title of the husband will become perfect, and all interest in the remaindermen at an end ?</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">I have again examined the cases on which this court relied in the former <em>decision; </em>and they seem to me decisive. In <em>Devonsher </em>v. <em>Newenham, 2 </em>Scho. &amp; Lef. 197. lord <em>Redesdale </em>reviewed all the.cases, and shewed with great strength the reasons against entertaining such suits. After stating the circumstances of the case before him, and the purpose of the suit, he said\u2014\u201c Now, no such suit has ever been entertained as far as I can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>find; and it would be most dangerous to give the example of entertaining such a suit. Wherever one person claims title against another who is in possession, and the enjoyment of that person is disturbed, and he is put into a situation where he cannot have that enjoyment, as he ought in conscience to have it,\u2014these are cases, where, for the purpose of quieting the possession, a suit is entertained. For example, where several ejectments have been brought in succession, and a bill is filed to quiet the possession, a suit is entertained. But when the question is merely whether A. or B. is entitled to the property, and there has been no actual suit between them, there is no instance where a bill has been entertained.\u201d He cites <em>Pelham </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>3 Bro. P. C. 204. where lord <em>Northington </em>dismissed the bill, giving this as a reason, \u201c that they (the defendants) being remaindermen after the death of the duke of <em>Newcastle, </em>if he should die without issue, their claims were not within his cognizance to determine, and the plaintiff had no right to bring them into discussion in a court of equity.\u201d This decision was affirmed in parliament; that house agreeing with the chancellor (says lord <em>Pedesdale) </em>that a party has no right to bring remaindermen before the court to bind their rights &amp;c. merely to clear the plaintiff\u2019s title. And lord <em>Redesdale </em>proceeds\u2014\u201c I take this to be decisive authority; and if the books were searched, I have no doubt many other cases might be found, where bills have been dismissed on this ground. I apprehend the court is bound to see that the parties before it are parties whom it ought to bind by its decree : but on what ground could the court put the remainderman in this case to litigate his title ?\u2014The plaintiffs in this suit, have no right to make this defendant litigate a title with them, which may never be beneficial to him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">I am for affirming the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Brockewbeough and Cabell, <em>J, </em>concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"AfW\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AZU\">The case of <em>Randolph </em>v. <em>Randolph </em>is, I think, conclusive of this; and it was decided, not only Upon express authority, but in strict conformity with the general principles of the court of chancery, which disclaims any interference with legal titles. In this case, though the interest of the remaindermen is but contii}gent, yet their title, such as it is, is a legal title, and cannot be drawn in question in equity. The decision of that court upon the naked question of title, in a case where there is not, and never may be, a subsisting dispute with respect to the right of property, would indeed be an anomaly. If <em>Mrs. Bush </em>should leave a child, then her estate will be absolute, under the will, and her husband will be1 invested with her title; so that it is very possible, that the question, whether he is the owner of the property independently of the will, never may arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">I do not perceive that the case is materially different, because there is an executor of <em>Martin, </em>who might contest the claim set up by <em>Bush. </em>The question between <em>Bush </em>and <em>Martin\u2019s </em>estate is a purely legal question. <em>Martin\u2019s </em>executor may never choose to raise it. At any rate, he is not bound to submit to its decision in equity. It is no ground to come into equity to settle a land title, that there is another party claiming a legal title who holds back and will not sue. <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>2 Johns. Ch. Rep. 519. <em>Stuart\u2019s heirs </em>v. <em>Coalter, </em>4 Rand. 74. and <em>Lange </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>5 Leigh 192. Upon the principle of those cases, it is equally clear, that a party in possession of a slave cannot bring into equity an adverse claimant of the legal title, to have the question of title settled there. If a,n action of <em>detinue </em>cannot be sustained in equity, against the party in possession, it is not perceived upon what principle the party in possession can maintain a corresponding action to try the title against the party out of possession. The decree is to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
