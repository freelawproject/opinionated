Issue was joined on the plea of <em>non detinet. </em>Upon the trial of the cause, a bill of exceptions was filed, which stated that the plaintiff claimed the slaves in the declaration mentioned, as a gift from <em>Edmund Franklin, </em>under a deed in the following words : \u201c Know all men by these presents that I <em>Edmund Franklin </em>of the county of <em>Campbell, </em>for and in consideration of the natural love and affection which I bear to my son <em>William Franklin, </em>and for and in consideration of one dollar to me in hand paid by the said <em>William Franklin, </em>at or before the ensealing and delivery of these presents, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, at mine and my wife\u2019s death do give and grant, and by these presents do give and grant, unto the said <em>William Franklin, </em>his executors, administrators and assigns, one negro girl named <em>Sarah ; </em>to have and to hold the said negro girl <em>Sarah </em>to him the said <em>William Franklin, </em>his executors, administrators and assigns forever. And the said <em>Edmund Franklin, </em>for himself, his executors and administrators, the said negro girl <em>Sarah </em>unto the said <em>William Franklin, </em>his executors, administrators and assigns, against the claim of him the said <em>Edmund Franklin, </em>his executors and administrators, and against the claim or claims of all and every person or persons whatsoever, shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>and wall warrant and forever defend by these presents.

The defendant claimed as a purchaser at a sheriff\u2019\u2019s sale under an execution which issued in the year 1811 against the goods and chattels of <em>Edmund Franklin </em>the donor, in whose possession the slave <em>Sarah </em>had remained from the date of the deed of gift to the time of the sale aforesaid. After proving his purchase at the sheriff\u2019s sale aforesaid, the defendant introduced a witness, who proved that several of the children of <em>Sarah, </em>in the declaration mentioned, were born in the lifetime of <em>Edmund Franklin </em>the donor; and thereupon the defendant moved the court to instruct the jury, that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, under the deed aforesaid, the children of <em>Sarah </em>born in the lifetime of <em>Edmund Franklin, </em>subsequent to the date of the deed and before suit was brought: which instruction the court refused to give, and instead thereof instructed the jury that the plaintiff had a right to recover all the children of Sarah, whether born before or after the death of <em>Edmund Franklin. </em>To which opinion of the court the defendant excepted. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, upon which judgment was rendered; and to that judgment a <em>supersedeas </em>was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b611-11\"><em>Johnson, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b611-12\"><em>Robertson </em>and <em>Mayo, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b611-13\">Brooke, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWJ\">This case turns on the true construction of the deed in the record from <em>Edmund Franklin. </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>consideration in the deed is'love and affection, and one \" . , . . . dollar; the operative words are\u2014\u201cAt mine and my \"wife\u2019s death I do give and grant unto the said <em>William Franklin, </em>his executors, administrators and assigns, one negro girl named <em>Sarah; </em>to have and to hold,\u201d &amp;c. This grant, though irrevocable by the grantor, is testamentary in its character; the grantee takes nothing until the death of the grantor and his wife: and though nothing is said of increase, it is contended that under the rule <em>partus sequitur ventrem, </em>the increase passed to the grantee. That rule, by the civil law, was only applicable to the increase of animals, and is the rule of the common law by adoption, but has no application to slaves. The rule in this respect of the civil law, adopted by our statutes, is that the increase shall follow the condition of the mother, and'can seldom have any application where the question is a question of property, and not a question of liberty as in the case of <em>Maria &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Surbaugh, </em>2 Rand. 228. It would apply in a case in which the act of limitations applied to the claim to the mother, and the length of time was not enough to bar the right to the increase. It applies also (where nothing is said of increase in the will or deed) to the case where the grant or devise is of a life estate to one, remainder over to another. But in most cases, whether increase passes or not, depends on the construction of the deed or will. The case before us, then, depends entirely on the construction of the grant. That is silent as to issue, and the relation in which the parties stood to each other forbids the inference that increase was intended to be included in the grant. The death of the grantor and his wife might be v.ery remote, and unless increase had been expressly included in the grant, we cannot presume that the grantor intended to grant what in prospect might be of much greater value than the slave granted. It may be said (and it has some weight) that at the death of the grantor and his wife, <em>Sarah </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>might be dead or too old for service: but against this <em>. , </em>, .. it may be said that if increase is to pass, it might, after great expense in rearing it, be of ten times the value of the girl expressly granted. Upon the whole, I think the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The judgment of this court was, that, the judgment of the superiour court be reversed with costs, the verdict set aside, and the cause remanded for a new trial, on which the jury were to be instructed, if such instruction should be asked, that the deed set forth in the record had not the effect of passing the title of <em>Edmund FranMin </em>to the issue of <em>Sarah </em>born before the period at which <em>William Franklin </em>was by the deed to have title to the mother, and that they did not pass to him with the mother by accession.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
