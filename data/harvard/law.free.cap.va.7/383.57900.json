Plea, not guilty. Trial, and verdict for <em>Hill </em>for 400 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-5\"><em>Randolph </em>moved the court for a new trial, on the ground that the verdict was contrary to evidence. The court overruled the motion. <em>Randolph </em>excepted ; and the court certified the facts proved at the trial, as follows\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AOp\">It was proved by the testimony of two of <em>Randolph\u2019s </em>overseers at his coal pits, witnesses on <em>the part of </em>Hill\u2014 That the slave was hired by <em>Hill </em>to <em>Randolph, </em>to work in the pits, for one year. That it was discovered one evening, that there was foul air in the pit where this slave of <em>Hill </em>worked, and he and all the other labourers were therefore drawn out; and they were all, and particularly <em>Hill\u2019s </em>slave, told by one of the overseers present (who was one of the witnesses), not to stay in the pits, when they discovered foul air, <em>long </em>enough to <em>be </em>,made sick by it. That, the next morning, the overseer superintending that pit (who was one of the witnesses), supposing that the foul air in the pit on the preceding evening, had been caused by a rain which then fell, and that, the weather being now clear, the foul air had probably left the pit, sent down one of the negro labourers at the pit (who, it seems, was a slave belonging to <em>Randolph) </em>with a lamp, to <em>examine the </em>condition thereof, and to ascertain whether the foul air was gone, so that the labourers could be safely sent down; which was the usual course in such cases, though the overseers themselves sometimes went down. That the person sent down was the foreman, and one of the most experienced labourers at the -pits, perfectly competent to make such examination, and worthy of full confidence. That the foreman reported to the overseer, that the foul air was gone, and- that the labourers might go <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>down with safety. That the overseer, placing as much confidence in that report as he would have had in a personal inspection, and apprehending no danger, sent the labourers down, ten in number, including <em>Hill\u2019s </em>slave a,nd two of <em>Randolph\u2019s </em>own, none of whom were unwilling to go <em>down; but </em>after working there a,bout half an hour, they found that there was foul air in the pit, and became sick, some more and some less, and were drawn out as fast as it could be done, one or at most two at a time: no preference was given to <em>Randolph\u2019s </em>own slaves, one of whom was the last drawn up, sending before him the body of <em>Hill\u2019s </em>slave, who had fallen into some water in the pit, about eighteen inches deep: he appeared to have been drowned, and could not be revived: all the other labourers were made sick by the foul air, but none dangerously. That there was foul air frequently in the coal pits ; which was sometimes caused or driven down by rain, and after the rain, soon disappeared. That the shaft at this particular pit was about seventy feet deep, and a single shaft, which would admit of but one bucket to ascend at a time. That there were several apartments in the pit; the labourers did not all work in any one of them at the same time; and, occasionally, foul air was found in one and not in the others. That such foul air would and occasionally did cause death. And that much greater hire was paid for slaves to work in coal pits, than for ordinary service, the difference being about twenty-five or thirty per cent. And these being all the facts proved in <em>the </em>cause, the court was of opinion, that the jury might lawfully infer from the evidence as delivered by the witnesses,\u2014who might be expected to feel a desire to place their own conduct in the most favourable light,\u2014 that the examination made of the condition of the pits by <em>Randolph\u2019s </em>slave, was not so careful a one as ought to have been made by a prudent and discreet man, before he exposed so many slaves, most of them belong<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>ing to others, to such danger as was proved to have existed; and as the jury had deduced that inference from the facts proved, the court, thinking they had properly done so, overruled the motion for a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-3\">Judgment was then given for <em>Hill </em>upon the verdict; to which this court, upon <em>Randolph's </em>petition, allowed him a <em>supersedeas.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-4\"><em>Taylor </em>and <em>Johnson,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8CM\">for the plaintiff in error, admitted, that on an appeal from the judgment overruling a motion to set aside a verdict and direct a new trial, <em>on </em>the ground of the verdict being against evidence, it must appear to the appellate court, that the verdict was plainly against evidence. But, they said, this verdict was plainly so. There was no conflict in the testimony; it all came from the plaintiff\u2019s own witnesses; he could not have impeached their credit, and if he could, nothing was offered to discredit them. Neither the jury, nor the court, had a right to suppose that the facts were different, in any respect, <em>from </em>what <em>the testimony </em>repre- ' sented them to be\u2014that the witnesses concealed any fact, or gave a false colour to those they stated, in order to place their own conduct in a favourable light\u2014 in effect, that they did not tell the whole truth. Yet it was only upon that supposition, that this verdict could be approved; and this, in truth, was distinctly admitted by the circuit court itself. The verdict was not warranted by the evidence, but by facts inferred to exist, wihich were not proved, and not reconcileable with the facts that were proved. <em>Hill </em>had hired his slave to <em>Randolph </em>to work in his coal pits : there were dangers incident to such labour, from which ordinary labour was exempt; dangers arising from accidents which no human care could always avoid, and among others from foul and noxious air, with which the pits were occasionally infested; dangers not peculiar to <em>Randolph's </em>coal pits, but common to all coal pits, nor peculiar to slave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>labourers, but common to all labourers in coal pits, black or white, bond or free; dangers frequently incident to european coal pits, managed with the utmost skill and care, and having the most perfect fixtures and machinery to draw the labourers to the open air; dangers so well known, that labourers, or the owners of labourers, employed there, received higher wages, as a premium, in truth, for the risque incurred, upon the principle on which higher wages were always given for labour in a gunpowder mill. <em>Hill </em>had been paid for the risque to which his loss was owing. To impute the loss to the want of due care in <em>Randolph or </em>(which was the same thing) in his overseer, was to discredit the testimony, without the least ground for doing so. The circuit court thought that the jury was warranted in inferring from the evidence, that the examination made by <em>Randolph's </em>slave, to ascertain whether there was foul air remaining in the pits, Avas not so careful a one as ought to have been made by a prudent and discreet man, before he exposed the lives of the labourers, most of Avhom were the slaves of others, to such a danger. But the person who made the examination Avas the foreman, and the most experienced labourer at the pits; and he himself Avas to incur the danger of the foul air, and Avould, therefore, be very careful to ascertain its existence or absence. There was not the least reason to believe, that a negro man, experienced in the business, who must have often seen foul air in the pits, since it was frequently found in them, was not as capable of ascertaining its existence, as the overseer himself Avould or could ha.ve been. Besides, this was the usual course in such cases, though the overseer sometimes descended into the pit himself. The usual diligence and care, therefore, was employed to avoid the danger; and <em>Randolph </em>Avas only bound to bestow ordinary care and diligence. Usual care and diligence was proved by the plaintiff\u2019s own witnesses at the trial, but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>court thought that the iury was well warranted to dis- \u00b0 J <em>J </em>credh the testimony in that particular. If this was proper, they said, no verdict ever could be set aside for being contrary to evidence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b408-6\">\n<em>Scott, contra,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"An_\">said, that this verdict could not be disturbed, without wholly disregarding the principle stated by judge <em>Roane </em>in <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Overton, </em>3 Call 319. and so often since approved and acted on by this court. The whole amount of the opinion of the circuit court, which had been so much complained of, was, that the jury, considering the situation of the witnesses, were warranted to take their testimony most strongly for the plaintiff, and against the natural bias of their feelings : and this was true and just. An owner of coal mines ought not to have trusted an ignorant negro, however long he might have been accustomed to work in <em>them, to </em>ascertain whether foul and noxious air had got into them: it was his duty to have experienced colliers to superintend his pits, to impose the duty upon them to make the examination'proper in such cases, and to furnish them the proper means to make such examination. Justice as well as humanity required this at his hands. But they required more: as, in spite of all human care and skill, foul air might occasionally collect in all coal pits, it was utterly unsafe to rely on a single bucket, in which only one or at most two persons could be brought up at a time, to draw up labourers from a pit seventy feet deep. If there had been two buckets at this <em>pit, Hill\u2019s </em>slave would probably have been rescued from death. \u2022 This alone was sufficient to justify this verdict.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b408-7\"><em>Johnson </em>replied,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3g\">that it was remarkable, that the circuit court did not give the least weight to the circumstance of there being but a single shaft at this coal pit, and a single bucket worked in it. And the reason was plain enough; it was not shewn, that the circumstance was at all unusual in the working of coal pits, at least, our coal pits, so as to afford an inference of any want <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>of the usual care and diligence to provide against the danger.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b409-4\">Brockenbkottoh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5i\">In this case, the court not only certified the facts that were proved at the trial, but also the persons by whom they were proved. They were the overseers employed by the defendant in superintending the labourers at his coal pits. If there was any negligence in the case, they were the persons who were guilty of it. The plaintiff was, however, compelled to make them witnesses, or to lose his testimony altogether, since the labourers were slaves and not competent to give evidence. I agree with the judge of the circuit court, that it was perfectly natural that those witnesses should wish to place their own conduct in the most favourable point of view. They might not have been at all conscious that they were guilty of any neglect, and yet the facts proved by themselves might have been sufficient to convince a jury, composed of disinterested and intelligent men, that they were guilty of gross neglect. The jury might have been satisfied, that a single examination, even by a careful and trustworthy person, with a single lamp, to ascertain whether it would be extinguished by mephitic gas in a pit seventy feet deep, was not sufficient; that where human life was to be risked, repeated and successive experiments should have been made, with torches or lamps, at regular intervals, before the lungs of men should be required to inhale that air; or that other more complete experiments should have been made to ascertain the condition of that subterranean abode; that an hour or two would not be unprofitably thrown away, in determining the condition of the pit. The jury might reasonably have concluded, that to guard against the danger of mephitic gas, it was the duty of the defendant to provide a larger bucket and a stronger rope, to enable more than one or two persons, at a time, to ascend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>the shaft, and thus escape from death. The jury might fairly have inferred, from the evidence given, and allowjng it full credence, that the defendant and his agents were guilty of the negligence charged. They were the proper judges of this matter; the judge who tried the cause thought they had decided rightly; and I am sure I can see no ground on which to say that they were wrong. I am for affirming the judgment. -</p>\n<author id=\"b410-5\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Aao\">The principles that govern cases of this kind (of which we have had several lately) are well settled. It is agreed, on all hands, that when a court is applied to for a new trial because the verdict is contrary to evidence, \u201c the court ought to grant it, only in case of a plain deviation, and not in a doubtful one, merely because the judge, if on the jury, would have given a different verdict; since that would be to assume the province of the jury, whom the law has appointed the triers.\u201d Tbe difficulty lies in applying this law to the facts of the different cases brought <em>before </em>us. \u25a0 We ought, I think, to exercise the power given us with a jealous caution of ourselves ; for if we do not agree exactly with the jury, we are naturally too apt to overlook the distinction between a plain and a doubtful deviation ; and thus to invade the province of the jury. The facts before us present to my mind one of those doubtful cases. The defendant having hired the slave to work at his <em>coal </em>pits, which are known <em>to be subject </em>occasionally to the visitation of this foul air, and having given the additional hire which is laid on to meet this risk, ought not to be charged with the loss of the slave, \u2022unless he was in some default. If he has been negligent in ' any thing, it was either in sending the hands into the pits without a sufficient examination, or in failing to provide sufficient means of escape in the moment of danger. The hands had all been more or less sickened the evening before by foul air in the pit, and had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>taken out. The next morning they were sent down again, after an examination by a single person, and that person a negro slave, but experienced and confidential : was this taking sufficient precaution, where so many human lives depended on the issue ? Again: <em>the </em>pit was seventy feet deep, and there was but one shaft, allowing but one bucket to pass up and down: was this providing sufficient means of escape ? These, I confess, are doubtful points with me. Perhaps they might not be so, if I were better acquainted with the working of coal pits, the nature of this mephitic air, the customs and habits of the business, aad the precautions commonly used; but of these I am wholly ignorant. Here are twelve men, most of them probably citizens of the county, some perhaps from the neighbourhood of these pits, and well acquainted with all these facts; every one of them, I apprehend, a better judge of these matters than myself. They are, too, the appropriate triers of facts. With the witnesses before them, and no bias to mislead their judgments, they have found for the plaintiff. And the judge who heard the whole case has refused a new trial. Shall I undertake to say, that this is a finding against the evidence, so gross and palpable as to justify me in setting all aside, and sending the parties back ? I certainly cannot. Let me not be misunderstood: I do not mean to say, that the defendant has actually been negligent; that he has deserved the <em>verdict; but </em>that it is one of those cases where the jury\u2019s verdict is decisive with me; for I am free to declare that if, on the same facts, the case had come up with a verdict for the defendant, I should, as at present advised, have refused a new trial. 1 am for affirming the judgment.</p>\n<author id=\"b411-8\">Ttjckek, P.</author>\n<p id=\"ArK\">I am of opinion, that the verdict of the jury, upon the facts appearing before them, was clearly wrong; and unless it be conceded, that a court is never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>to grant a new trial in a case which is peculiarly ap- , , propnate for the decision of the jury, a new tnaL ought to be granted, in this. But, whatever the nature of the case, if the jury have plainly deviated from the conclusion to which the facts proved ought to have led them, the court ought to exercise its superintending power, by granting a new trial. Such I conceive to have been the case here. The verdict is altogether unsustained by the facts, and the court ought to have granted a new trial. In correcting this error, this court would not take upon itself to decide upon the weight of <em>evidence; </em>the facts proved, and not the evidence, having been certified by the circuit court. I have therefore no difficulty in saying, that the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Cabell, <em>J. </em>I concur in the opinion of the president.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">The judges of this court being equally divided in opinion,\u2014judgment of the circuit court affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
