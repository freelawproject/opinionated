That, after this contract between <em>Robert </em>and <em>Robina Scott, </em>the plaintiff <em>Garden </em>married <em>Robina. </em>That sometime after the marriage, <em>Robert Scott </em>applied to <em>Garden </em>to give him his own bond to be substituted for the bond of his wife executed before her marriage; to which <em>Garden </em>assented. That <em>Scott </em>then produced a bond which he had already written for <em>Garden to </em>sign, and <em>Garden, </em>believing that <em>Scott </em>was the obligee named therein, executed it; but afterwards the bond was produced by <em>Haden, </em>and it appeared that <em>Haden's </em>name was inserted therein as the obligee. That this bond had not been altered after execution; but <em>Garden </em>agreed and intended to give his bond to <em>Scott, </em>and executed the instrument in the full belief that <em>Scott </em>was the obligee named therein; and <em>Scott </em>fraudulently procured the execution of the bond to <em>Haden, </em>by concealing the fact that it was made payable to him. That <em>Haden </em>assigned the bond to <em>Beverley Scott, </em>who' brought a suit upon it, and <em>Garden </em>suffered judgment to be entered by default. That <em>Garden </em>and his wife had been wholly evicted of the land, the purchase money whereof was the consideration of the bond, the land having been sold under the mortgage of <em>John Scott, </em>for the debts thereby charged on it, and having proved insufficient to pay them. Therefore, the bill prayed an injunction to stay proceedings on the judgment at law, and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-9\">The injunction was awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-10\"><em>Robert Scott, </em>in his answer, admitted all the allegations of the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-11\"><em>Haden </em>answered, that before <em>Garden's </em>bond was delivered to him, he had a claim for debt against <em>Robert Scott, </em>for about 545 dollars, which he had prosecuted to an award of execution on a forthcoming bond against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number><em>Scott </em>and his sureties therein bound, and <em>Scott </em>had procured an injunction to stay further proceedings on that judgment. That, in this state of things, <em>Scott </em>agreed to procure <em>Garden\u2019s </em>bond executed to him <em>{Haden) </em>for 600 dollars, and he agreed to accept the same, in satisfaction of his judgment; the amount of the bond being somewhat less than the amount of the judgment with interest and costs. That <em>Scott </em>accordingly brought him <em>Garden\u2019s </em>bond executed to him <em>{Haden), </em>which he accepted, and released his claim on his judgment against <em>Scott </em>and his sureties. That under these circumstances, <em>Garden </em>had no equity as against him. That it was remarkable, that of the two bonds for 600 dollars each, executed by <em>Garden\u2019s </em>wife to <em>Scott </em>before her marriage, this bond to <em>Haden </em>was given for one, and the other was left in <em>Scott\u2019s </em>possession, and was by him assigned to another person, <em>Garden </em>himself being instrumental in enabling <em>Scott </em>to pass it off. And that, instead of a fraud having been practised by <em>Scott </em>upon <em>Garden, </em>to procure <em>Garden\u2019s </em>bond to <em>Haden, </em>the circumstances shewed that <em>Garden </em>and <em>Scott </em>had combined to practise a fraud upon him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-5\"><em>Beverley Scott </em>answered, that he was an assignee of the bond in question for valuable consideration paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-6\">During the pendency of the suit in the court of chancery, <em>Haden </em>paid the money to his assignee <em>Beverley Scott, </em>and the assignee\u2019s judgment against <em>Garden </em>was transferred to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-7\">The depositions of many witnesses were taken and filed by the plaintiff and the defendant <em>Haden; </em>but it is only necessary to state the substance of one of <em>them; </em>namely, that of the defendant <em>Robert Scott, </em>which was regularly taken for the plaintiff. His deposition sustained all the allegations of the bill. He deposed loo, that he had offered <em>Haden Mrs. Garden\u2019s </em>bond for 600 dollars, in satisfaction of <em>Haden\u2019s </em>judgment against him; which <em>Haden </em>refused to receive, but agreed to take <em>Gar</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number><em>den's </em>bond for that <em>amount; </em>and he gave the following account of the manner in which he procured the execution of <em>Garden's </em>bond to Haden\u2014that <em>Garden </em>having previously agreed to give <em>Scott </em>his own bond for 600 dollars in lieu of his wife\u2019s bond for that sum, the witness prepared two bonds written on paper of the same form, one payable to himself, and the other payable to <em>Haden; </em>that he shewed the first to <em>Garden, </em>who read it, and while he was preparing to sign it, he <em>(Scott) </em>slipped the other into its place, and <em>Garden, </em>ignorant of the change of the papers, executed that. It appeared, that <em>Scott </em>was, at that time, and still is, insolvent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-5\">The chancellor, being of opinion that the allegations of the bill were proved by the evidence, perpetuated the injunction, and gave <em>Haden </em>a decree against <em>Scott, </em>for the amount of the judgment against <em>Garden. </em>From which decree <em>Haden </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b180-6\"><em>Robinson, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b180-7\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b180-8\">Bkockenbeotjgh, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ANh\">Without going into the inquiry, whether or no the plaintiff <em>Garden </em>might have defended himself at law, on the ground on which he sought relief in equity, I am of opinion, that, upon the proofs in the cause, he has no right whatever to equitable relief, and that the decree should be reversed, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<author id=\"b180-9\">Cake, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A5Lv\">Upon the facts relied on by <em>Garden </em>in his bill, he had a perfect legal defence against the bond executed by him to <em>Haden. </em>For, surely, if he meant to execute it to <em>Scott; </em>if a bond drawn payable to <em>Scott </em>was read to him as that which he was to execute, and, at the moment of execution, a bond to <em>Haden </em>was substituted for it, and executed by him without knowing the change; a plea of <em>non est factum </em>might have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>supported. No excuse has been stated, for the failure \u2022 to make the defence at law. If it be said, that the courts of law and equity have concurrent jurisdiction in such matters of fraud, that is true; but it is equally true, that in all such cases, the court which first gets possession of the cause, will make an end of it; and any defence which a party according to the rules of that tribunal can make, must be made there. This is a settled rule; and I apply it the more willingly to this case, because I think the facts of the case, and the situation of the parties, present grounds for suspicion of combination and collusion between these brothers in law.</p>\n<author id=\"b181-5\">Cabell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2c\">I am of opinion, that the decree ought to be reversed, on the ground, that the plaintiff in equity might have defendecl himself at law, and has assigned no reason for his failure to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Brooke, J. concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b181-7\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AmV\">I am of opinion, that the injunction awarded the plaintiff ought never to have been granted, that it should have been dissolved on the hearing, and that the bill should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">As little tenacious as I may seem to be on the subject of jurisdiction, yet I am decidedly of opinion, that where a party has a full, perfect and unembarrassed defence at law, of which he fails to avail himself, without even the pretence of an apology, he cannot be relieved in equity. Such was certainly <em>Garden's </em>case. If the statements in his bill, and in the depositions of his own witnesses are true, the instrument upon which he was sued was not his bond; and he might have pleaded the plea of <em>non est factum </em>with a safe conscience, and sustained it beyond contradiction. For, besides the fraud, which of itself avoided the deed at law, delivery, either to the obligee or to some one for him, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>essential to constitute the instrument a valid bond. But so far from being the case, is directly the reverse of the fact, as proved by the subscribing^ witness, and by <em>Robert Scott </em>himself. ' 1 think, therefore, he. had a full defence at law, and it would seem he was full handed with evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Nor does the consideration that equity has concurrent jurisdiction, make any difference. The jurisdiction of equity to relieve against a fraud, is no excuse for the omission to make the defence, when the party is already before a court having full cognizance of it, in a case depending before that court. <em>Garden </em>was sued at law, and might there have had redress. Shall he, without even a pretext, multiply litigation by instituting this second suit in equity ? Shall he be permitted to shrink from the jury trial, which must have decided the case at law, and bring his adversary into equity, where he may escape, and actually has escaped, that ordeal ? I think not, and am therefore of opinion he was not entitled to any relief.</p>\n<p id=\"A1qu\">But if this objection be waived, then parties are before us upon their respective equities. In a comparison of these, I am of opinion that those of <em>Haden </em>must prevail. <em>Garden </em>or <em>Haden </em>must lose. On whom should the loss fall ? On him who has enabled <em>Scott </em>to deceive the other. Was neither <em>Garden </em>nor <em>Haden </em>to blame ? Was <em>Scott </em>the only perpetrator of the fraud? Then their equity is equal, and <em>Haden </em>must be left to the benefit of his judgment. Is <em>Garden, </em>however, censurable for <em>laches </em>and carelessness? Then it is most clear, that he must be the sufferer, as he has enabled <em>Scott </em>to cheat <em>Haden; </em>to compromise and discharge <em>Haden\u2019s </em>just demands, by the delivery of a bond of <em>Garden </em>to him, carrying on its face every appearance of fairness, and unquestionably genuine as to signature. What are the circumstances ? <em>Scott </em>wished to pass <em>Mrs. Garden's </em>bond to <em>Haden. </em>This <em>Haden </em>declined to receive; but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>he agreed to take <em>Garden\u2019s </em>bond made payable to him- .. , , self, lor the same amount. <em>Scott </em>applied to <em>Garden, </em>got a new bond of <em>Garden </em>to <em>Haden, </em>delivered it to <em>Haden, </em>and discharged thereby his debt to him. The paper is genuine as to signature, and there is moreover a subscribing witness. What doubt could <em>Haden </em>have about its fairness ? What negligence or want of caution can be fairly imputed to him ? None whatever. Is it' so with Garden? <em>Scott </em>applied to him to give his own bond to <em>him. </em>Unless he either designed to fix <em>Garden\u2019s </em>liability, whatever might be the event as to the land, or unless he wished to pass off the new bond to more advantage, I know not what motives he could have had; and if these were his motives, <em>Garden </em>cannot complain of being held liable. But, in truth, there is that in the transaction, which goes to shew, either that <em>Garden knew </em>the change was made <em>for </em>the purpose of passing off this bond to some third person, or that he ought to have been put upon his guard by the very nature of the proposition. Why was it, that the other bond of <em>Mrs. Garden </em>was not also changed ? That was kept in its original form, and left to <em>Scott\u2019s </em>disposal, and it appears in proof, was in fact passed away by him. Why was this bond written by <em>Scott, </em>and brought to <em>Garden </em>to sign, instead of being written by <em>Garden </em>himself? There was enough <em>to have prompted </em>inquiry <em>on the </em>part of <em>Garden, </em>as to the bond in dispute, and as to <em>Scott\u2019s </em>motives for desiring the change as to one bond <em>only; </em>yet <em>Garden </em>was satisfied with <em>Scott\u2019s </em>explanation, which would have applied as well to the other bond as to this. I cannot think he has been duly cautious in this regard; nor can I readily acquit that man of a want of due care, who suffers such a trick to be played upon him, as is detailed in this cause. He must be content to sit down under the loss, rather than it should fall upon one who was altogether innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>If instead of executing a new bond, the old one had been about to be assigned to <em>Haden, </em>and in reply to an inquiry as to its validity, <em>Garden </em>had signed a note written by <em>Scott, </em>acknowledging its validity, and promising payment, he would have been bound beyond question, I presume, by whatever legerdemain of <em>Scott </em>he might have been deceived into doing so. The case at bar is, if possible, stronger; for here the old bond is given up, .and a new one executed in which <em>Haden </em>is made the obligee. And this too is written by <em>Scott, </em>instead of by <em>Garden </em>himself, as was the natural course of things ; and he executes it, permitting <em>Scott </em>(as the story is) to cheat him by substituting for the paper he had read, -another which he had not read. All these things lead to the belief, that the new bond was executed for <em>Scott\u2019s </em>accommodation, and excite strong doubts of the truth of the allegation, that <em>Garden </em>did not know what was to be done with the bond. But if this be not so, they shew, at least, a want of caution and prudence in <em>Garden, </em>which ought to place <em>the </em>loss upon him rather than upon <em>Haden.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Decree reversed, and bill dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
