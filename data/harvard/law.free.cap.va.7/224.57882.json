Y\u00e9t. a <em>subpoena </em>was sued out and served upon <em>Moseley, </em>to answer the bill; and he not appearing, it was followed by a <em>decree nisi, </em>which was also served upon him: and upon 'the hearing of the cause, the bill was taken pro <em>confesso </em>as to him, and a decree made (interlocutory as <em>Mosdey </em>contended, final as the plaintiffs in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>sisted) which affected <em>Moseley's </em>rights, as well as those of the children of <em>William Bentley </em>the elder, and <em>Coleman </em>and the other defendants, purchasers under the conveyances impugned by the bill. <em>William Bentley </em>the younger and <em>Coleman </em>appealed from the decree to this court; which reversed the decree so far as it affected the rights of <em>Coleman, </em>and in all things else affirmed it. The case is reported by the name of <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Coche, </em>6 Rand. 618.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-6\">After the cause went back to the court of chancery, the plaintiffs commenced supplemental proceedings against sundry persons holding the lands conveyed by <em>William Bentley </em>the elder to his children under purchases from them, who were not defendants to the original bill, and not mentioned in the proceedings or in the decree upon it. Still, <em>Moseley </em>was not named in the pleadings; the plaintiffs claiming under the original decree by default against <em>him. </em>While these new proceedings were pending, <em>Moseley </em>presented an answer to the original bill, controverting the claim of the plaintiffs to relief against him, and asked leave to file it; and he filed affidavits to explain the reason why he had not appeared and put in an answer earlier. The chancellor refused to give him leave to file his answer, because the decree by default, against him had been affirmed by the court of appeals, and because his reasons for not having answered earlier were insufficient. <em>Moseley </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b245-7\"><em>Bolinson, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b245-8\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b244-12\">He was prevented by sickness, from sitting in this and several following cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b245-9\">Tucker, <em>F.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AM6\">delivered the opinion of the court. There is no error in the refusal to permit the appellant <em>Moseley </em>to file his answer in this case. No person has a right to file an answer in any suit in which he was not a party. The question then is, was <em>Moseley </em>a party here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>or not ? It cannot be fairly questioned, that the <em>subpoena , </em>, . , , . . and conditional decree were both served upon him. But he is not named in the bill; there is no allegation any where in it, which bears upon, or in any manner refers to him, nor is any decree prayed against him, either in terms, or in the usual language praying a decree, \u201c against all persons unknown, and who may be hereafter discovered claiming under or combining with the defendants.\u201d It is a distinct charge against other persons, and it prays distinctly a decree against them for certain lands. <em>Moseley, </em>therefore, seems to me not to be a defendant, in any fair sense of the term. No process is prayed against him by the bill; and, therefore, according to the authorities, he was not a defendant; and there being no charge against him and no decree prayed, he had nothing to defend. The bill, it was true, was taken for confessed against him. But, as it charged nothing, nothing was confessed, and therefore nothing could be decreed. In short, a decree against one not named in the bill, and nowise comprehended in its general allegations, is a nullity. He is not bound by it, and has, therefore, no necessity to contest it, or answer to it. If he has been improperly named in the process, the plaintiff may indeed be subject to his action for vexing him by that service, when he was in fact not a party; but he cannot file his answer where nothing is demanded of him. It is a solecism to speak of his answering a bill, in which he is not named, and in which he does not even by inference appear to have an interest or concern. The court is of opinion, therefore, that the order be affirmed; stating, however, as the ground of affirmance, that the appellant was not a party to the suit, and was not bound by the decree, and therefore was under no necessity to answer the bill, and had no right to insist on filing his answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">Decree for that cause affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
