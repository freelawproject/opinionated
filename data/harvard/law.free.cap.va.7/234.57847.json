The defendant, to support, the issue on his part, offered in evidence an office copy of the last will and testament of <em>Elijah Cason, </em>and a copy also of the probat thereof in the county court of pleas and quarter sessions of <em>Currituck, North Carolina; </em>with a certificate of the clerk of the court subjoined, in these words\u2014\u201c State of <em>N. Carolina, Currituck </em>county: I, <em>S. Hall, </em>clerk of the county court of pleas and quarter sessions for the county and state aforesaid, do certify the above to be a true copy of the last will and testament of <em>Elijah Cason </em>deceased, and of the probat of the same. Given under my hand and seal <em>of office, </em>at &amp;c.\u201d (Signed) <em>\u201c S. Hall, C. C. C.\u201d </em>with the seal annexed. And a certificate of the presiding justice in <em>North Carolina, </em>in the following words\u2014\u201cState of <em>N. Carolina, Currituck </em>county: I, <em>C. Etheridge, </em>chairman and presiding justice of the county court of pleas and quarter sessions for the county and state aforesaid, do certify that <em>S. Hall </em>is now, and was at the time of signing the above, clerk of the aforesaid court, and that his <em>certificate </em>&amp;c. records &amp;c. are in due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>form, and due faith should be given to his official acts. Given under my hand &amp;c.\u201d (Signed) \u201c <em>C. Etheridge, </em>chairman.\u201d Whereupon, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected to the admission of the evidence, \u201c on the ground of the record not being duly authenticated according to the laws of congress;\u201d and the court sustained the objection ; to which the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-4\">2. The plaintiff, in order to shew in what character he took certain slaves (of whom the slave in question was one), offered in evidence the record of a judicial proceeding in the county court of pleas and quarter sessions of the same county of <em>Currituck, </em>upon a petition of the plaintiff <em>Bonney </em>and <em>Ahiah </em>bis wife, who was the relict of the testator <em>Cason, </em>stating that she had renounced her husband\u2019s will, and praying the court to order a jury to lay off her distributive share of her deceased husband\u2019s estate; upon which the coui't ordered the jury; the jury reported, <em>inter alia, </em>that <em>Bonney and wife </em>should receive a slave named <em>Charles, </em>being part of a legacy bequeathed by the testator <em>Cason </em>to his daughter <em>Ann; </em>and the court confirmed the report. To this was subjoined a certificate of <em>S. Hall, </em>the clerk of the court, under his hand and seal of office, in the same form, <em>muta.tis mutandis, </em>with his certificate authenticating <em>Cason's </em>will, stated in the first bill of exceptions; and a certificate of <em>C. Etheridge, </em>chairman and presiding justice, also in the same form with his certificate authenticating the will, with this single difference, that in this he certified that the clerk\u2019s <em>attestation </em>was in due form, whereas in the other, he certified that the clerk\u2019s <em>certificate </em>was in due form. To the admission of this evidence the defendant objected, because the record was not duly authenticated, and it was moreover <em>res inter alios acta: </em>but the court overruled the objection, and admitted the evidence, instructing the jury, that it wTas no evidence of title in the plaintiff; but that it was a fact or circumstance entitled to their consideration, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>ascertaining the character of the plaintiff\u2019s possession, that is, whether he had taken the property awarded by the jury to his wife in character of her husband, or in character of guardian of the defendant\u2019s wife, and that the record was evidence for no other purpose. To this opinion also the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-4\">There was a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff; to which this court upon the petition of the defendant allowed him a <em>supersedeas.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b256-5\"><em>Robinson, for </em>the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIl\">Comparing the authentications of the two documents,- one of which was rejected and the other admitted in evidence, the only difference is, that the presiding justice certified, in the last instance, that the, clerk\u2019s <em>attestation, </em>and in the first, that his <em>certificate, </em>was in due form. The act of congress of May 1790, 2 Bior. L. U. S. ch. 38. p. 102. does indeed require, that the presiding justice shall certify, that the clerk\u2019s \u201cattestation\u201d is in due form. But here the clerk\u2019s <em>certificate </em>was exactly the act of <em>attestation </em>meant by the act of congress.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b256-6\">\n<em>Johnson, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqtY\">1. The clerk gives the certificate under <em>his seal of office; non constat, </em>that this was the <em>seal of the court, </em>which the statute requires. 2. The clerk does not certify that the will was recorded, and that his copy was a copy of the recorded will, but only that it was a copy of the will and of the probat in his keeping ; so that it nowise appears, that this was a judicial proceeding of <em>N. </em>Carolina,\u2014that the will and probat was a record appertaining to a court. Therefore, the authentication should have been according (not to the act of congress of May 1790, but) to the act of March 1804; 3 Bior. L. U. S. ch. 409. p. 621. And then, certainly, the authentication was not regular, for the character of the presiding justice is nowise verified, In this too, the court will see the main difference between the \u2022authentication of the one document, which was ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>proved, and that of the other, which was disapproved, * . by the circuit court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Af-\"><em>Robinson, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUkl\">As to the seal annexed to the clerk\u2019s certificate, the presiding justice certified that the clerk\u2019s certificate was <em>in due form; </em>of course, that the proper seal was annexed. Besides, the clerk\u2019s seal of office must bo intended to be the seal of the court. With regard to the other objection, here is a copy of a will, and of a sentence of probat in usual judicial form. The probat of a will is, in its nature, a judicial proceeding, and the will proved is part of that proceeding.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b257-8\">Per curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"A4u\">The circuit court erred in refusing to let the copy of <em>Cason\u2019s </em>will go in evidence to the jury. It was sufficiently authenticated. Judgment reversed, and cause sent back for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
