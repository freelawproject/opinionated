Whereupon <em>Nicholls </em>brought a suit against <em>Davis </em>and <em>Turner, </em>upon their joint contract of assignment, and recovered judgment against them both for the amount of the assigned bond; which judgment was discharged by <em>Turner. </em>And then <em>Turner </em>made a motion against <em>Davis, </em>for the money so paid by him in discharge of <em>Nicholls's </em>judgment, as money paid by him as <em>Davis's </em>surety. This motion was first continued at <em>Davis's </em>costs, and then continued for four successive terms of the county court; and at the sixth term, the court, considering <em>Davis </em>and <em>Turner </em>as both principals in the assignment to <em>Nicholls, </em>gave <em>Tur</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number><em>ner </em>a judgment against <em>Davis </em>for half the sum that <em>Turner </em>had paid <em>to Nicholls. </em>Upon this judgment <em>Turner </em>sued out a <em>ca. sa. </em>against <em>Davis; </em>and <em>Davis </em>being taken in execution upon this process, the sheriff refused to permit him to go home, or to accompany him thither in order that he might deliver property in discharge of his body. In this state of things, <em>Turner </em>agreed, that if <em>Ferguson, </em>a friend of <em>Davis, </em>would give him his own bond for the amount of the debt, he would release <em>Davis </em>from custody. <em>Ferguson </em>gave <em>Turner </em>his bond accordingly, and <em>Davis </em>was released. <em>Ferguson </em>knew, at the time, that <em>Davis </em>denied the justice of <em>Turner's </em>claim; but he said, that if <em>Davis </em>did not pay the debt, he would. <em>Ferguson?s </em>bond was assigned by <em>Turner </em>to <em>Saunders Sf Co. </em>and by them to <em>Early, </em>who brought a suit on it, and recovered judgment against <em>Ferguson, </em>and then assigned the judgment to <em>Hale. </em>.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-4\">Whereupon <em>Da,vis </em>and <em>Ferguson </em>exhibited a bill against <em>Turner </em>and his assignees, in the superiour court of chancery of <em>Lynchburg, </em>setting forth the facts above detailed ; shewing that <em>Turner </em>had received the whole consideration paid by <em>Nicholls </em>for the assignment of <em>Johnson's </em>bond; that therefore he was in truth the principal in the contract of assignment of <em>Johnson's </em>bond to <em>Nicholls, </em>and had no right to call upon <em>Davis </em>for contrh bution; so that the judgment which <em>Turner </em>had recovered against <em>Davis, </em>and which was the sole consideration of <em>Ferguson's </em>bond <em>to Turner, </em>was unjust and oppressive ; that that judgment was recovered by <em>Turner </em>against <em>Davis </em>in consequence, as he supposed, of the absence of <em>Nicholls, </em>by whom it could have been proved that <em>Turner </em>received from him the whole consideration for the assignment of <em>Johnson's </em>bond : which evidence <em>Davis </em>was unable to obtain, as <em>Nicholls, </em>at the time of the judgment, and for some time before, was absent in some one of the northern states. Wherefore, the bill prayed an injunction to stay proceedings on the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>ment which <em>Early </em>assignee of <em>Saunders </em>cV <em>Co. </em>assignees of <em>Turner, </em>had recovered against <em>Ferguson, </em>and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AoE\">The Injunction was awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-5\"><em>Turner, </em>in his answer, denied the principal allegation of the bill, namely, that he received from <em>Nicholls </em>the whole consideration for the assignment of <em>Johnson's </em>bond to <em>Nicholls, </em>and asserted that the money received from <em>Nicholls </em>was equally divided bdween <em>Davis </em>and himself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-6\">The defendants <em>Saunders Sf Co. Early </em>and <em>Hale </em>denied all notice of the plaintiffs\u2019 equity alleged in the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-8\">All the allegations of the bill were substantiated by incontrovertible proofs ; except that it was not proved that <em>Nicholls </em>was absent from the country at the time <em>Turner </em>recovered his judgment against <em>Da,vis, </em>though <em>Nicholls </em>was examined as a witness in this suit in chancery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-9\">The chancellor, upon a hearing, perpetuated the injunction, and proceeded to make a decree between the co-defendants, whereby <em>Turner </em>was made responsible to his assignees for the amount of the judgment which they had recovered against <em>Ferguson, </em>and from which <em>Ferguson </em>was relieved by the decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-10\"><em>Turner </em>applied by petition to this court, for an appeal from the decree; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b249-11\"><em>Johnson, for </em>the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b249-12\">No counsel for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b249-13\">T iJCKETt, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AnZ\">It is the settled rule of this court, that, where a party has been grossly inattentive and negligent of his defence at law, he shall have no relief in equity. Here it appears, that <em>Turner's </em>motion against <em>Davis </em>was first continued at the defendant\u2019s <em>costs; so </em>that he appeared to defend himself upon the motion; and it was continued, from month to month, for several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>successive terms afterwards. At length judgment was rendered, against him, because, as \u201che supposed,\u201d <em>Nicholls </em>was not present to testify. If he had cause for continuance for <em>Nicholls's </em>testimony, he ought to have applied for a continuance, and if it was refused, taken an exception. This he did not do; and then he comes into equity, alleging <em>Nicholls's </em>absence from the country at the time of the trial; but he does not prove it, though <em>Nicholls </em>himself was examined. It is impossible, without an entire overthrow of established rules, to sustain the bill in such a case. This I should much regret, as there seems every reason to suppose that <em>Turner </em>received the whole money from <em>Nicholls, </em>but that it is manifest to me, that while <em>Davis </em>held out the threat of contesting <em>Turner's </em>right of recovery, he was willing enough to avail himself of the arrangement made by <em>Ferguson, </em>by quitting the close custody in which he was. If he can be considered as assenting to the arrangement, then the case is one of compromise and adjustment of a subsisting dispute, and so ought to terminate the contest. If he did not assent, then <em>Ferguson </em>has introvened of his own accord, and has, for the consideration of his bond, obtained the discharge of <em>Turner's </em>debtor, with full knowledge of the debtor\u2019s denial of the <em>debt. </em>In this aspect of the case, he must be held responsible, whether he can have recourse to <em>Davis </em>or not. His responsibility is independent of <em>Davis\u2019s. </em>The consideration of his bond is the release <em>of Davis </em>from custody, not the debt due from <em>Davis; </em>and, accordingly, we find he gave the assurance at the time that he would pay whether <em>Davis </em>did or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The other judges concurred, bill dismissed.
