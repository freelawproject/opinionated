At that term the notice was proved; and, without calling the defendant, the motion was continued, not till July term, but till the next August term. From July term 1820 to March term 1821, both inclusive, there was a general order entered at each successive term, that all suits, attachments and motions, not otherwise disposed of, should be continued till the ensuing term. But at April term 1821, there was no such general order. Meantime, this motion of <em>Koger </em>against <em>Amis </em>was never put upon the docket: it was docketed for the first time, at May term 1821; when (but again without having the defendant called) a continuance of it to the next June term was entered on the <em>docket; </em>and <em>thenceforth to </em>April term 1826, inclusive, it was in like manner continued on the docket at each term to the next ensuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>term. . At May term 1826, <em>Roger </em>made his motion, and thereupon the county court (still without having the defendant called) gave judgment against <em>Amis </em>for 646 dollars with interest &amp;c. and costs. Upon this judgment <em>Roger </em>sued out a <em>ca. sa. </em>upon which <em>Amis </em>was taken in execution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-4\">In January 1829, <em>Amis </em>applied to the judge of the circuit court, in vacation, for a writ of error to the judgment, upon his giving security for costs only, so that the writ should not operate as a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment,'under the statute of 1824-6, Supp. to Rev. Code, ch. 98. p. 127. The judge allowed the writ of error. But at the September term' 1829, the circuit court dismissed it, as having been improvidently allowed. Whereupon, at the same term, <em>Amis </em>presented a petition to the court, praying the writ of error; which the court denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-5\">Afterwards, he applied to this court for a <em>supersedeas </em>to both the orders of the circuit court; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-6\">The cause was argued here, by <em>Robinson </em>for the plaintiff in error, and <em>Johnson </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaS\">upon the following objections taken by the former: 1st, That the first step in the proceedings of the county court was irregular, in making any order on the motion without having the defendant called, he not having appeared then or ever'afterwards; <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Hendrick, 5 </em>Call 12. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Pitts, 1 </em>Hen. &amp; Munf. 4. 2nd, That there was a discontinuance of the motion, by the continuance of-it at June term 1820 to the next August term, passing by the intermediate July term; and thei\u2019e were divers discontinuances afterwards, since the general order for the continuance from term to term of business undisposed of, was not applicable to a summary motion like this, especially while that motion was not docketed; in consequence of which discontinuances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>the motion at length made at May term 1826, was, in effect, a motion without notice. And 3d, that though the writ of error allowed by the judge of the circuit court in vacation was improvidently allowed, since the statute only authorized the circuit court in term time to allow the writ in such cases, yet the circuit court erred in denying the writ upon the petition presented to the court in term.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b243-4\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AMj\">delivered the resolution of the court. We are told, in several of our cases, that these summary proceedings on motion, being a departure from the course of the common law, are to be taken strictly. But there needs no strictness to pronounce, that this proceeding of the county court is full of error. In the first place, there was no power in the court, without consent, to continue the case from June till August term 1820, passing by entirely the July term. If the court could thus pass over one term, it might twenty. This was a clear discontinuance, and the motion out of court. But it was discontinued several times after; if that could be discontinued, which was no longer in court. And six years after, without appearance, or any subsequent notice, the motion was made, and judgment entered. Nothing could be better calculated to entrap the defendant, and deprive him of all chance of defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">The order of the circuit court, dismissing the writ of error allowed by the judge in vacation, was right; but the circuit court erred in denying the writ of error prayed in the petition presented to the court at the same term.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">The judgment of the circuit court is to be reversed, and the cause sent back with directions to allow the writ of error to the judgment of the county court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
