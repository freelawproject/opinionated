The declaration was in the name of <em>Barnes Beckwith </em>executor of the last will and testament of <em>Absalom Bailey </em>deceased, complaining of <em>John A. Bailey </em>and <em>George V. Lewis, </em>of a plea that they render to him the sum of one hundred and five dollars and 30 cents, <em>which from him they unjustly detain; </em>that is to say, not in the <em>debet </em>and <em>detinet, </em>but in the <em>detinet </em>only. The defendant <em>Bailey, </em>after craving <em>oyer </em>of the obligation, demurred specially to the declaration, assigning for cause that it was in the <em>detinet </em>only. This demurrer was overruled, and the defendant <em>Lewis </em>making-default, a joint judgment was entered against both defendants. To this judgment a <em>supersedeas </em>was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b625-17\"><em>Fisher, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Alr\"><em>Summers, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b625-18\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AzOa\">I am of opinion that this judgment should be affirmed. There can be no doubt, indeed, that the action having been brought upon a bond taken to the plaintiff, was an action in his own right, although he is styled executor in the bond; and therefore it is equally true that technically the declaration should have been in the <em>debet </em>as well as the <em>detinet. </em>Whether the omission to declare in the <em>debet, </em>however, be even a sufficient cause of special demurrer, is not so clear. Upon the examination of the authorities (as far as they are in our possession) cited by counsel here, and also in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>the case of <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Hobday, </em>4 Maule &amp; Selw. 120. I have found no case in which judgment has been given against the plaintiff for such an error, even upon special demurrer. In Gilbert on the action of debt 401. indeed, the omission is considered fatal in the action against the <em>heir: </em>but this may rest upon the peculiar character of the action, in which the plaintiff seeks to charge the heir with the debt of his ancestor by reason of assets descended, and is therefore held strictly to set forth his indebtedness. Be this as it may, as there is no case which is <em>ad idem, </em>I feel not at all disposed to extend these unsubstantial objections farther than I am compelled by authority to sustain them. The spirit of our legislation is against them, and the courts should imbibe that spirit. Happily, we are sustained on the present occasion by the decision of the courts of <em>Westminster of </em>a recent date, which we are in the.habit of respecting, if we do not look upon them as binding authority. In the case of <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Hobday, </em>just cited, the declaration was oh a bond from the defendant to the assignors of the plaintiff, and was in the <em>detinet </em>only. The defendant demurred specially, and lord <em>Ellenborough </em>gave judgment for the plaintiff. He took a very just distinction between declaring in the <em>debet </em>and <em>detinet, </em>where the party ought to have declared in the <em>detinet </em>only, and declaring in the <em>detinet </em>only, where he ought to have declared in the <em>debet </em>and <em>detinet. </em>In the former case he <em>extends </em>his demand, which he has no right to do. In the latter he <em>abridges </em>it, which he has a right to do. Thus in <em>devastavit </em>against an executor, the plaintiff may declare in the <em>debet </em>and <em>detinet </em>both; yet if he declares in the <em>detinet </em>only, it is not bad, but he shall only have judgment <em>de bonis testatoris. Spotswood </em>v. <em>Price, </em>3 Hen. &amp; Munf. 123. For if the plaintiff <em>may </em>charge the executor in the <em>debet, </em>so as to make him liable <em>de bonis propriis, </em>surely (say the court in <em>Hope </em>v. <em>Bague, </em>3 East 2.) he may waive part of his right, and charge him in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number><em>detinet </em>only, so as to entitle himself to the lesser judgment <em>de bonis lestatoris. </em>And of this opinion the court had been in the very early case of <em>Royston </em>v. <em>Cordrye, </em>All. 42. cited by <em>Lawrence, </em>J. in 3 East 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">\u25a0 It may be said, perhaps, that in this case there is nothing waived by the plaintiff, since, if he gets a judgment at all, be must have the same judgment as if he had declared in the <em>debet </em>as well as the <em>detinet. </em>But so was the case of <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Hobday, </em>and yet the plaintiff had judgment. Indeed the very objection furnishes its own answer; for if, from the nature of the case, the plaintiff waives no part of his demand by omitting to declare in the <em>debet, </em>it only proves that he sufficiently and fully sets forth his own right and the defendant\u2019s wrong, by declaring in the <em>detinet </em>only, and charging him with <em>unjustly detaining </em>the sum which he demands that he shall render to him. I am of opinion to affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">The other judges concurring, judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
