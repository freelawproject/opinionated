That the money was lent to the firm of <em>Galt, Bulloch fy Co. </em>upon the credit of all the partners of the firm, was credited upon the books of the firm, and was used for the benefit of the firm; and plaintiff was advised, that though <em>at </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number><em>law </em>the said bond, being a sealed instrument, and being p . signed, sealed and delivered, bound only the said <em>John Bullock, </em>vet, as the money was lent to the firm, and was placed to the credit of the said <em>Elizabeth Calland on </em>the books of the firm, and used for the benefit of the firm, <em>in equity </em>each member of the firm was bound for the payment of the sum so lent. That the members of the said firm, at the time of the said loan and the execution of the bond, were <em>William Galt, John Bullock </em>and <em>James Bullock. </em>That the said <em>William Galt </em>was since dead, and <em>John Allan </em>and <em>William Galt </em>were his executors. That <em>John </em>and <em>James Bullock </em>and the said executors of <em>William Galt </em>had conveyed and assigned all the effects belonging and debts due to the said firm, to <em>Chiswell Dabney, </em>in trust for the payment of the debts due from the said firm. That <em>John Bullock </em>had lately become embarrassed in his circumstances, and plaintiff believed him unable to pay the amount of said bond. That the said <em>Elizabeth Calland </em>had died, having made her will and appointed the plaintiff executor thereof, who had qualified as such. That the aforesaid sum of money had never been paid, either to <em>Elizabeth Calland </em>in her lifetime, or to the plaintiff since her death, and with the interest thereon was still in arrear. Wherefore the bill prayed that the said <em>John Bullock </em>and <em>James Bullock, </em>the said <em>John Allan </em>and <em>William Galt </em>executors of <em>William Galt </em>deceased, and the said <em>Chiswell Dabney </em>might be made defendants, and answer the bill on oath : that the said debt and interest might be paid to the plaintiff by <em>John Bullock, James Bullock </em>and the executors of <em>William Galt: </em>that the plaintiff might participate, if need were, with the other creditors of <em>Galt, Bullock f Co. </em>in the funds which might come to the hands of the said <em>Chiswell Dabney: </em>and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-5\">The bond referred to in <em>the </em>bill was exhibited therewith.

That neither their testator, nor the respondents as his executors, were bound by that speci\u00e1lty.

That 'they did not admit, but denied, that <em>Elizabeth Calland </em>lent to the firm of <em>Galt, Bullock Sf Co. </em>any sum of money at any time, and particularly the sum of <em>\u00a3 </em>1547. 9. 4. on the first of January 1817, as alleged in the bill: on the contrary, they believed that if the said specialty was executed in consideration of money lent, the same was lent to and borrowed by <em>John Bullock </em>for his private and separate benefit and use, out of the course of the trade of said firm, upon a corrupt and usurious agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number><em>John Bulloch, James Bulloch </em>and <em>Chiswell Dabney </em>never answered the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A6hq\">Four witnesses were examined, and their depositions filed in the cause; all of them on behalf of the plaintiff, as it seemed. 1. <em>W. Bailey </em>deposed, that he lived with <em>Gall, Bulloch Sf Co. </em>as a clerk in their store, from the early part of 1817 till the latter part of 1818, and again from the early part of 1821 until the dissolution of the partnership : that there was a large balance standing on the books of the firm, to the credit of <em>Elizabeth Calland, </em>commencing in 1817, and regularly continued until the dissolution of the partnership: that <em>William Galt </em>was in the habit of visiting <em>Lynchburg </em>once or oftener every year during the existence of the firm, and always carefully examined the books of the concern, at every such visit; and in one or two instances he particularly noticed the balance standing to the credit of <em>Elizabeth Cal-land, </em>observing that there was a pretty heavy balance due her: that deponent was not privy to the contract between said <em>Elizabeth Calland </em>and <em>John Bulloch, </em>and did not know whether the whole or any part of the money claimed by the plaintiff was received by <em>Galt, Bulloch Sf Co. </em>or appropriated to their use, but he had no doubt that it was so appropriated : and that deponent knew nothing about the rate of interest paid or contracted to be paid to <em>Elizabeth Calland, </em>though, during the existence of the firm, he had never known more than six per cent, interest to be paid on any debt whatever, and many loans were refused at six per cent. 2. <em>8. Poindexter </em>junior deposed, that he commenced living in the store of <em>Galt Sf Bulloch </em>in March 1.823, a short time after the dissolution of <em>Galt, Bulloch Sf Co. </em>and continued with <em>Galt Sf Bulloch </em>until the spring of 1828, when the business was placed in the hands of <em>Chiswell Dabney; </em>during which period deponent generally wrote in the books of <em>Galt, Bulloch Sf Co. </em>That on those books there was a balance of some four or five thousand dol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>lars t^e credit of <em>Elizabeth Calland, </em>which sum had been regularly brought through several sets of books, and remained to the credit of <em>Elizabeth Calland </em>when the trust deed to <em>Chiswell Dabney </em>was made. That <em>William Galt </em>was in <em>Lynchburg </em>two or three times while deponent continued in the employment of <em>Galt Sf Bulloch, </em>and always examined the books of <em>Galt, Bulloch \u00a7 Co. </em>and of <em>Galt Sf Bulloch, </em>and took with him, when he returned to <em>Richmond, </em>a list of debts due to and from the concerns. That as to the receipt or appropriation of the money claimed by the plaintiff, deponent knew nothing, but had always understood from <em>John Bulloch </em>that the amount was justly due to <em>Elizabeth Calland </em>from <em>Galt, Bulloch Sf Co. </em>And that deponent knew nothing as to the rate of interest agreed to be paid on the said amount, or whether any interest had been paid. 8. <em>John S. Blair </em>deposed, that he was the clerk of <em>Ckiswcll Dabney, </em>trustee of <em>Galt, Bulloch Sf Co. </em>and <em>Galt Sf Bulloch, </em>and as such had free access to the books of said concerns. That on the books of <em>Galt, Bulloch Sf Go. </em>there was a balance to the credit of <em>Elizabeth Cal-land, </em>of between 5000 and 6000 dollars, first entered in 1816 or 1817, and continued through the books of that concern. That deponent had no knowledge whether the money was received by <em>Galt, Bulloch Sf Co. </em>or appropriated to their use, nor what interest was paid or agreed to be paid therefor. 4. <em>John Smith, </em>minor, deposed that about the year 1816 or 1817, he witnessed a bond executed to <em>Elizabeth Calland </em>by <em>John Bulloch, </em>for the firm of <em>Galt,, Bulloch Sf Co. </em>as he understood; but without referring to the bond, deponent could not say what was the amount or date of said bond. That the business was transacted by <em>John Bulloch, </em>and deponent had no recollection that any other member-of the firm was present at the time. That deponent had no-knowledge whether the money was received by <em>Galt, Bulloch Sf Co. </em>or appropriated to their use, nor what interest was paid or contracted to be paid therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>To the depositions of the three witnesses first mentioned, the defendants objected, so far as the witnesses spoke of entries in books which were not produced nor required to be produced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-4\">There was no proof in the record, that <em>John Bullock </em>was insolvent. The only evidence relating at all to this matter was contained in the deposition of <em>Poindexter, </em>the second of the witnesses before mentioned. This witness testified that <em>John Bullock </em>was <em>somewhat in debt </em>before he discontinued business in <em>Lynchburg, </em>which was early in 1828; that he also bought property to a considerable amount while witness lived with him and with <em>Galt Sf Bullock, </em>the greater portion since the dissolution of <em>Gall Sf Bullock: </em>but the witness did not know what his private and individual resources were. As to the solvency or insolvency of <em>James Bullock, </em>the record shewed no evidence whatever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-5\">The trust deed to <em>Chiswell Dabney, </em>mentioned in the bill, was no where contained in the record ; nor did it in any way appear what were the provisions theieof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-6\">At the hearing of the cause, on the 29th of October 1830, the chancellor,\u2014declaring that the suit was not brought upon the <em>assumpsit </em>of either or all of the members of the firm of <em>Galt, Bullock Sf Co. </em>but was founded on their penal bond dated the 1st of January 1817, which constitutes their joint and several obligation, binding them and their heirs to.the payment thereof; and that <em>Galt, Bullock Sf Co. were </em>as much bound to pay the obligation, as if it had been a promissory note\u2014 decreed, that <em>Johti Bullock </em>and <em>James Bullock, </em>out of their own estates, and the executors of <em>William Galt, </em>out of the estate of their testator in their hands, pay the plaintiff the sum of 5158 dollars 20 cents, with interest from the first da.y of January 1817 till payment, and his costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-7\">The executors of <em>Galt </em>applied by petition to this court for an appeal from the decree; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Aiy\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number><em>Stanard, </em>for appellants. 11</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ABP\"><em>Johnson, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AsR\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"A00g\">The first question in this case is as t0 ^e jurisdiction of the court of equity; the plaintiff being supposed to have a remedy at law under the act concerning joint rights and obligations. But it is a sufficient answer to the objection, that if the case was within the jurisdifction of a court of equity before the statute, it cannot be taken away by it. <em>Wynn </em>v. Bowles, 6 Munf. 23. 25. For, as there is nothing in the act excluding the cognizance of the court, it is construed to be cumulative, and to give only a concurrent remedy to the court of law.</p>\n<p id=\"AqdE\">Has the court of law, however, jurisdiction over this matter under the statute of joint rights and obligations <em>\u00a3 </em>I think notl The case of <em>Roane\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Drummond\u2019s adm\u2019rs, </em>6 Rand. 182. has extended the statute very properly to joint judgments, as being directly within the spirit of the act. But the case of simple contract debts due from a partnership stands on very different ground. They are confessedly not within the literal construction of the statute, and I am persuaded they are not within its meaning or intention. There are many strong reasons for confining the suability of a deceased partner to a court of equity. Look at the - character of the demand. It is a demand which ought in justice to be paid, if possible, out of the funds of the concern. Those funds are fenced in against the claims of the creditors of the individual partners until the partnership demands are satisfied, because they are deemed peculiarly chargeable with the payment of the debts by which the funds themselves have been created or increased. Now, by the death of a partner, the whole of the effects of the concern become vested in the surviving partner, who alone can demand and sue for the debts due to the partnership, and who is entitled to take possession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>the stock in trade and apply it as far as necessary to the payment of the debts. The executors of the deceased partner have no agency or control whatsoever over the choses in action ; and although they are either tenants in common, or joint tenants without survivor-ship, of the partnership effects, Gow on Partnership 47. yet they have only a right to a moiety of what remains after the payment of debts, and the amount of their interest is ascertained upon a final settlement of all the transactions of the firm. Thus situated, it is but reasonable that he who has the appropriate funds in his possession should be first chargeable. Hence a court of equity has always looked upon the representatives of a deceased partner in the light of a surety; as chargeable only in the event of the insolvency of the surviving obligor. Gow on Partnership 43C. <em>Linney's adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Dare\u2019s adm\u2019r &amp;c. 2 </em>Leigh 588. 594. <em>Hamersly </em>v. <em>Lambert Sped. 2 </em>Johns. Ch. Rep. 508. <em>Ex parte Kendal, </em>17 Ves. 514. <em>Sale </em>v. <em>Dishman\u2019s ex\u2019ors, </em>3 Leigh 548. 551. 557. I cannot think that the legislature intended to disturb this just and reasonable principle of a court of equity, and the rather, as there is no summary remedy afforded to the executors of the deceased against the surviving partner. I am therefore of opinion that there was no remedy at law for the appellee against <em>Galt\u2019s </em>estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">But it is said the appellee had a remedy at law* against the surviving partners, and cannot implead the executors of the deceased in equity until the insolvency of the survivors has been ascertained. I do not concur in either of these propositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">First, I think the appellee had no remedy at law against the surviving partners, other than <em>John Bullock, </em>who was liable upon the obligation as his own. The demand against them at <em>law </em>would have been deemed to be extinguished; for in a court of law it is held that if upon making a contract by A. with B. C. gives his bond for it, the debt by simple contract is extinguished, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>the obligation being made upon or in pursuance of the <em>\u00b0 </em>o r r contract. <em>3 </em>Bac. Abr. 107. <em>Tom </em>v. <em>Goodrich, </em>2 Johns. Rep. 213. Now here the bond is the bond of <em>John Builock </em>who signed it, and it was given for the demand of the plaintiff, and accepted as the documentary evidence of the demand, and as the bond of the firm. Now, although this was a mistake of the obligee, yet at law this mistake could not be corrected, and equity only can relieve against it. Indeed at law the appellee could not perhaps have been received to contradict the bond by evidence that the money was lent to the firm, when by the rigid construction of law the sealed instrument established that it was the debt of <em>John Bullock </em>in his individual character. I do not therefore think the appellee could have recovered at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">But if he could, still a court of equity would have had concurrent jurisdiction to correct the plain mistake that has been committed here. <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Church, </em>2 Ves. 101. <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Vaughan, 2 </em>Atk. 33. <em>Underhill </em>v. <em>Horwood, </em>10 Ves. 227.228. <em>Sale </em>v. <em>Dishman\u2019s ex\u2019ors, 3 </em>Leigh 548. I will go further. In equity, where the substance and not the form of things prevails, although the sealed instrument cannot and does not bind the partners as a deed would bind them, yet it does bind them as far as it would be binding if there was no seal. In the case of <em>Tompkins </em>v. <em>Murray </em>in the federal court, one of the partners made a transfer of the partnership effects, by deed of trust signed by the name of the firm. The chief justice sustained the transaction in equity, on the ground (if my memory does not deceive me) that as one partner could dispose of the goods by parol, his annexation of a seal could not make the act of transfer void, when it would have been undoubtedly good without it. It would indeed be anomalous if a court of equity, which habitually considers the seal as having no influence to overrule the real intent and meaning of a contract, should hold the seal affixed by a part-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>nor to release his copartners from the obligation of a contract made for their benefit a.nd enuring to their advantage. It was under these impressions that in <em>Sale </em>v. <em>Dishman\u2019s ex\u2019ors </em>I remarked that \u201cthe contract thus signed, and by mistake sealed also, was nevertheless binding in equity upon both partners. In equity the form of the thing is immaterial, if the substance of the contract was to bind both.\u201d If this view of the case be correct, there can be no question whatever as to the jurisdiction. But suppose the jurisdiction can only be sustained on the ground of the insolvency of the surviving partners, is it essential that that fact should be established by action at law, before the creditor can sue in equity ? I think not; <em>first, </em>because I have found no case which establishes such a principle. <em>Secondly, </em>because I think it inconvenient and unnecessary to encounter the delay and expense of two suits, when one will suffice. <em>Thirdly, </em>because the case is analogous to that of a surety seeking contribution, in which, although he has remedy at law, by motion here, or by action in <em>England, </em>it is not required that the principal\u2019s insolvency should be established by previous action at law. <em>M\u2019Cormick </em>v. <em>Obannon, </em>3 Munf. 484. 1 Cox\u2019s C. C. 275. <em>Fourthly, </em>the deed of trust having in this case vested the funds in trustees for the benefit of the creditors of the firm, the creditor had a right to come here in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Having said thus much on the subject of jurisdiction, which (unfortunately, I think) is too often the most prominent subject of discussion, I shall very shortly say that the merits seem to me clearly with the appellee, though the decree itself is grossly erroneous in charging the estate of <em>Galt </em>before the insolvency of the surviving partners and the deficiency of the trust subject had been established by the proper proceeding. As to the statute of limitations, I incline to believe it will be found, upon farther inquiry, to operate no bar here. The pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>ceedings shew that there has been a trust executed for payment of debts, which <em>prima facie </em>would seem to take the debt out of the statute. If the debts be scheduled and this be among them, or if the deed refer to the books and this debt be on the books, there can be no doubt that the statute does not bar. This will be ascertained -when the cause goes back. With these views of the case, I am of opinion to reverse the decree as premature against the executors, who cannot properly be chargeable until the deficiency of the trust fund and the insolvency of the surviving partners be established, and to send the cause back for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The other judges concurred. Decree reversed, and cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
