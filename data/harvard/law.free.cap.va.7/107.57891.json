And then the declaration assigned the breach, that, in fact, after a settlement of the partnership accounts, and after all the partnership effects had. been applied to the extinguishment of the demands against the house, the plaintiff had been made liable for a much larger sum than 195 dollars, more than his just proportion of the partnership debts, and also a much larger sum than 195 dollars was found due from the deceased partner <em>David Stephenson </em>to the partnership, as would appear by a decree of the county court of <em>Wood </em>in a suit there depending for the settlement of the partnership transactions, wherein <em>John Stephenson junior </em>was plaintiff, and <em>John Stephenson </em>(the plaintiff here) and others were defendants; and <em>Beeson </em>in his lifetime well knowing the premises, and the defendant his administrator since his death, did not keep his said covenant, though often thereto requested, but broke and altogether refused to perform the same &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-7\">The defendant pleaded covenants performed, on which air issue was made up; at the trial of which, the defendant filed three bills of exceptions to opinions of the court. \\</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>1.

If the suit in chancery in the county court of <em>Wood, </em>had resulted in a decree subjecting <em>John Stephenson </em>to the payment of money out of his own pocket, upon claims against <em>D. Stephenson Sf company, </em>beyond his own just proportion of the burden, the record of that suit might have been proper evidence in this. But there was no decree against <em>John Stephenson </em>personally, and nothing in the decree touching the present controversy, but a declaration that he had overpaid his just proportion ; a declaration not material or pertinent to the cause pending in the county court, and intended for no purpose but to prepare evidence to sustain the sclaim now asserted upon <em>Beeson\u2019s </em>bond; and as that declaration is not a decree, and as <em>Beeson </em>was not a party to those proceedings, the record was not proper evidence in this case. <em>2. </em>The testimony of the clerk proved, that the decree was not a decree founded on the judgment of the court, but a decree entered by the counsel of the parties ; that is, a decree by consent of the parties, by collusion between them. Such a decree could prove nothing against <em>Beeson; </em>and the record ought therefore to \"have been excluded. 3. The evidence stated in the third exception, which the court excluded, would have gone further, and proved, that the commissioner\u2019s settlement of the partnership accounts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>of <em>D. 8. Sf Co. </em>was founded in collusion between father and son; that the accounts were on the face of them <em>unjust; </em>that the proceedings, especially the report, and the decree were fraudulent, so far as they affected <em>Bee-son. </em>To reject such evidence was to take from <em>Beeson\u2019s </em>administrator all opportunity of defence against the iniquity of the proceedings in the county court; for as he was not a party to them, he could not defend himself there.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b131-4\">\n<em>Robinson, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALz\">1. The meaning of <em>Beeson\u2019s </em>covenant was to indemnify <em>Slephenso?i to </em>the extent of 195 dollars, in case he should be bound to pay so much, over and above his just proportion of the debts of <em>D. S. Sf Co. </em>and in case <em>B. S. </em>should be found indebted so much to the concern, after a full settlement of the accounts of the partnership, and after applying all the social effects to the payment of all demands against it. The covenant itself, then, called for a settlement of the partnership accounts, to which, in the nature of things, <em>Beeson </em>was not to be a party, nor did he stipulate that he should be made a party. The settlement could be nowise so properly made as by a suit in chancery. Of such a proceeding, <em>Beeson </em>had no right or reason to complain. But the conclusive answer to all the objections, is, that the proceedings and decree in the suit in the county court, were pleaded in the declaration, with a <em>prout patet per recordum; </em>and the only defence was the plea of covenants performed. Now, it seems impossible to doubt, that the plaintiff might shew in evidence the record, of which he had made <em>profer\u00ed, </em>and which the defendant in his pleadings did not impugn. If the declaration, with the x'ecord, was insufficient to sustain the plaintiff\u2019s demand, the defendant should have taken <em>oyer, </em>and demurred. If he meant to deny that there was such a record as that pleaded in the declaration, he should have pleaded <em>nul tiel record. </em>If he meant to impeach the proceedings and decree as collusive and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>fraudulent, he should have pleaded that matter; but not having pleaded it, he could not give it in evidence. Besides, the evidence he offered did not go to shew fraud in the settlement of the partnership accounts be-f\u00b0re the commissioner; the admissions of the parties there, might have been, and most probably were, founded on their knowledge of the justice of the items admitted. They were the proper parties to settle the accounts of the partnership.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b132-3\"><em>Johnson, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVtT\">The record of the suit in the county court, was not the foundation of this <em>action; </em>the action was founded on the bond; no such proceeding as that in the county court, was necessary to give or to sustain the action. Therefore, it was not necessary for the defendant to <em>plead </em>that the proceedings and decree were collusive and fraudulent, in order to be let into that defence at the trial.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b127-8\">He was prevented by sickness from sitting in this and several of the following cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b132-4\">Carr, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AxJ\">I think the objection to the admission of the record of the suit in the county court in evidence here, was very properly overruled. The record in that suit was counted upon in the declaration, and shewn to the court, and the defendant\u2019s only plea was covenants performed. The defendant covenanted to pay the plaintiff such sum, not exceeding 195 dollars, as he should be made liable to pay as partner of <em>J). Stephenson &amp;f Co. </em>or as <em>D. Stephenson </em>should be found indebted to that concern, on a full settlement of the partnership affairs. Surely, there could be no <em>better way </em>of ascertaining the facts, than by a settlement of the partnership affairs in a regular suit in chancery between the partners and their representatives. If the defendant could have impeached the proceedings and decree upon the ground of collusion and fraud, and had pleaded that matter, the case would have been different; but as the only issue was upon the plea of covenants performed, I think the opinions of the court were right upon all the points. I think the decree should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Brockenbrotjgh and Brooke, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b133-5\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ANv\">The true interpretation of this contract is, that <em>Beeson </em>would pay to <em>John Stephenson </em>any sum, not exceeding 195 dollars, for which <em>Stephenson </em>should be made liable as the partner of the firm of <em>David Stephenson Sf Co. </em>or which should be found due and owing to the company by <em>David Stephenson. </em>In a suit upon this bond, it behoved <em>Stephenson </em>to prove his liability for the sum demanded, or that such sum was duo and owing to the company from <em>David. </em>These facts might have been established by evidence of witnesses, and an investigation, in this case, of the partnership concerns. But they may be not less established by other means. Thus, the copy of a judgment against <em>Stephenson, </em>as surviving partner of the house, would not only have been proper evidence against <em>Beeson, </em>of the fact of his liability for the sum so recovered, but it would have been conclusive against him, unless he could have impeached it for fraud and collusion. It would have been similar, in principle, to <em>Buford </em>v. <em>Buford, </em>4 Munf. 241. where the plaintiff, being a co-surety in <em>Kentucky </em>with <em>Henry Buford </em>for <em>James Buford, </em>in a bond to <em>Talbott, </em>was permitted to introduce as evidence of his demand, the judgment upon the bond, rendered against himself in the courts of <em>Kentucky. </em>This court held the record of the judgment to be conclusive evidence of the amount recovered, and of the amount the plaintiff was compellable to pay; and most justly: for die question as between the parties, was not whether the amount was justly due to <em>Talbott, </em>but whether the surety had been compelled to pay it, without fraud and collusion on his <em>part; </em>because if he had been, he was entitled to recover from the principal, or in case of his insolvency, he was entitled to contribution from the co-surety. The like principle applies, I think, in reference to the construction of this contract that <em>Beeson </em>should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>pay such sum as should be <em>found </em>due and owing by <em>J)avid Stephenson. </em>How found ? If a suit instituted for the purpose of settling the partnership accounts, and eventuating in a decree against <em>David Stephenson </em>^01' the balance due from him to the firm, is not evidence and conclusive evidence (unless there was fraud and collusion) of what was really due, I am at a loss to conceive what would be satisfactory to the defendant. I am inclined to think, that a settlement <em>in pais, </em>if free from the suspicion of fraud and collusion, would have been evidence, since the condition of the bond obviously refers to a settlement of the partnership, on which settlement the balance due would be found. This settlement could only have been made between the partners, and when made would seem to have been all that was necessary or required by the bond of indemnity, for ascertaining <em>Beeson\u2019s </em>responsibility. But be this as it may, I cannot doubt that a decree of a court of equity ascertaining the balance due, is and ought to be conclusive evidence against <em>Beeson, </em>that the sum decreed was <em>found </em>due to the firm. It might indeed have been assailed for fraud or collusion, but not for any supposed errors, or because it was founded on the admissions of the parties, who cannot be presumed to have admitted more than was just.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">With respect to the second bill of exceptions, the opinion of the court was clearly right. And as to the third, a sufficient answer was given at the bar\u2014that the evidence did not go to establish fraud or <em>collusion; </em>and if it did, it was not admissible because there was no such allegation in the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
