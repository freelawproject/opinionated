Issue was joined on the plea of not guilty, and the jury on the 24th of September 1830, found a verdict for the plaintiff, and assessed his damages to two hundred dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>At the trial, the plaintiff gave in evidence an order of the county court of <em>Augusta </em>made on the 18th of June 1793, on the motion of <em>Anthony Aylor, </em>setting forth that he desired to build a water grist mill on his lands on <em>Naked creek, </em>and awarding him a writ of <em>ad quod damnum; </em>also the writ, with the return of the inquest, finding that <em>Aylor\u2019s </em>dam did no damage to any of the proprietors, that fish of passage and ordinary navigation were not obstructed, and that the health of the neighbours was not annoyed by the stagnation of the water; and the order of court made upon this return, granting leave to <em>Aylor </em>to build his mill agreeably thereto. The plaintiff farther gave in evidence a deed made the 27th of March 1809, from <em>Peter Fish-burn </em>one of the executors of <em>Anthony Aylor, </em>to <em>George Aylor, </em>conveying the testator\u2019s land on <em>Naked creek. </em>The plaintifi\u2019 also introduced the testimony of several witnesses. 1. Of <em>John F. Cankoff, </em>who proved, that he rented from the plaintiff about 20 acres of the land on which the mill in the declaration mentioned is situate, together with said mill, from the latter part of November 1827 until the latter part of November 1828, for the sum of 100 dollars; that he attended the said mill, and a saw mill near the same, on the said 20 acres, and enjoyed the proceeds under his lease; that during the lease the defendant repaired or rebuilt his dam on the same stream, below the said mills of the plaintiff; that after such repairing or rebuilding was completed, the witness found that his enjoyment of the plaintiff\u2019s mills aforesaid was impaired, in consequence of the water being backed in plaintiff\u2019s tail race more than it bad been previously; that the injury sustained by the witness was in consequence of not being able to run the grist mill and saw mill at the same time, so constantly as he could before, by reason of the back water aforesaid; that the grist mill could be run as constantly as before, but the saw mill could not be run as constantly, at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>same time; that he thought the grist mill ran somewhat slower than before; that he thought himself injured about 40 dollars by the diminution of sawing; and that he had no knowledge of the situation or condition of the dam and mills of the plaintiff, or of the dam and mill of the defendant, previous to his lease aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-4\">2. The testimony of <em>Marlin Orebough, </em>who proved, that on the 31st of August 1S29 he measured the depth of water over a sill in the stream, about 16 feet below the plaintiff\u2019s line, and about 160 yards below the plaintiff\u2019s mills, and found the depth upon said sill to be 20 inches; that on the 20th of August 1830 he again measured the depth of water on said sill, and found it to be 16 inches, and also measured the depth of water on the apron of plaintiff\u2019s mill wheel, and found it to be two inches; that he had no knowledge what was the depth of water on said sill and apron at the time this suit was instituted, but had not observed that it varied from what it was at the time of said measurement; that he had known the said mills and dam of the plaintiff about eight or nine years, but was unable to say whether the backing of the water from the defendant\u2019s dam had ever varied during his observation, except that at some times it was greater than at others, owing to the defendant\u2019s dam being full or otherwise; that at some times he could see a current over said sill, when the gates of the defendant\u2019s dam were drawn, and at other times, when said dam was full, it was dead water over said sill; and that the length of the apron aforesaid was about five feet. The sill spoken of by the witness is the <em>log </em>mentioned in the inquest of the jury found on the writ of <em>ad quod damnum </em>which issued on the application of <em>Hugh Donaghe. </em>[This inquest is recited after the statement of the evidence on the part of defendant\u2014where see it.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-5\">3. The testimony of <em>John Taylor, </em>who proved, that from the 1st of March to the last of October 1827 he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>attended the said mills of the plaintiff, as miller; that during that time, when the defendant\u2019s dam was full, the water was backed over the aforesaid sill into the plaintiff\u2019s tail race, in consequence of which the witness could not, without much trouble and difficulty, run both wheels (tiiat is to say, the wheels of <em>the </em>grist and saw mill) at the same time; that the backing of the water was often increased by the collection of trash at a water gate in the fence across the stream, some short distance above the sill aforesaid; and that the witness knew nothing of the plaintiff\u2019s mills and dam before he acted as miller aforesaid, or about the state of the water at the time of the institution of this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-4\">4. The testimony of <em>James </em>Campbell, who proved, that he removed to <em>Augusta </em>and the neighbourhood of the plaintiff\u2019s mills, in the year 1795, having visited the neighbourhood the previous year; that he lived in that neighbourhood, with the exception of four or five years, until 1812, when he left it, and resided in <em>Bath </em>county until about two years since, at which time he returned to <em>Augusta, </em>and had since resided near the plaintiff\u2019s land ; that when he first came to <em>Augusta </em>in 1794, the defendant\u2019s land belonged to <em>Hugh Donaghe ; </em>that there was then a dam upon the stream on Donaghe\u2019s land, about the same place where the defendant\u2019s dam is now, but the present dam is a few feet higher up the stream than the old dam was when he first saw it, at which time one end of the dam rested against an ash tree, but at present that end of the dam is a few feet above the ash tree, and is connected with it-by an offset which rests against said ash tree; that the other end of the dam crosses the stream at least five feet higher than the corresponding end of the old dam when first observed by the witness; that about thirty years ago, the dam then standing on defendant\u2019s land was washed away ; that the witness then assisted <em>John Donaghe </em>the son of <em>Hugh, </em>who at that time owned the said land, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>rebuilding the dam ; that the under logs or foundation being still standing, the dam was rebuilt thereon, of the same height, as the witness believes, with the old dam ; that he has since repeatedly assisted in stopping holes in the dam ; that the present dam is not higher than the old dam, and the witness believes does not back the water more\u2014the old dam, when full, backed the water to the plaintiff\u2019s mill wheel, and the present dam does the same, when full;\u2014that in the year 1794 the witness had a conversation with <em>Hugh Donaghe, </em>in which the latter stated that his dam backed the water under the plaintiff\u2019s mill wheel; that about two years ago the witness had a conversation with the plaintiff, in which the plaintiff complained that the defendant would not lower his dam, and that he had offered to arbitrate the dispute with the defendant, which he refused. The witness then stated to the plaintiff that the dam was not higher than it always had been, and stated also what <em>Hugh Donaghe </em>had told the witness as aforesaid ; to which the plaintiff replied that the dam had always been too high, and that he always complained of it to the said <em>Hugh </em>and the said <em>John Donaghe. </em>In said conversation between the plaintiff and the witness, the former did not allege that the dam was then higher or backed the water more than at any previous period.\u2014 Witness further testified, that when he first came to <em>Augusta, Hugh Donaghe's </em>saw mill had been built some years, where the defendant\u2019s saw mill now stands, and there was then no grist mill on <em>Donaghe's </em>land; that a few years after the witness came to <em>Augusta, John Donaghe </em>built a grist mill on the site of the defendant\u2019s present grist mill; that the said dam on the defendant\u2019s land has always been kept up, except when occasionally washed away, ever since the witness came to <em>Augusta, </em>and the water used, first for the saw mill, and after the erection of the <em>grist mill, </em>for both mills, until the present time, so far as the witness has observed or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>understood: that when the witness first came to <em>Augusta, </em>the plaintiff\u2019 had a dam and a grist mill on his land ; that said dam was used by the plaintiff until the witness removed to <em>Bath </em>in 1812, and is still standing, but after the witness\u2019s removal the plaintiff built a new dam for his mills, ten or fifteen feet below his old dam, which is higher than the old dam, and the space between filled up with stones and dirt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-4\">5. The testimony of <em>Henry Amon, </em>who proved, that some short time (perhaps between six and eighteen months) before the death of <em>John Donaghe, </em>which happened in September 1811, he heard a conversation between the plaintiff\u2019 and said <em>John, </em>in which the plaintiff\u2019 stated to <em>Donaghe, </em>that he was about to repair his mill, and that he wanted <em>Donaghe </em>to take his dam down ; to which <em>Donaghe </em>replied, he would not take it down,\u2014 that it had stood so long, and he had calculated his gears in his mill according to the height of the dam and the water; and he would not pull it down. At the time of this conversation, <em>Donaghe </em>had workmen engaged in repairing his mill. The said <em>Donaghe's </em>dam had then been standing a good many years. The defendant\u2019s present dam does not appear to the witness to be higher than the old dam was from the time the witness first knew it, about thirty years ago.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-5\">The defendant then introduced as evidence, an order of the county court of <em>Augusta </em>made on the application of <em>Hugh Donaghe </em>on the 16th of October 1792, as follows\u2014\u201c On the motion of <em>Hugh Donaghe, </em>who desires to build a water grist mill on his lands on <em>Naked creek </em>in this county, a writ of <em>ad quod damnum </em>is awarded him, to be directed to the sheriff\u2019, and to be executed on the first Monday in January next, pursuant\u201d &amp;c.\u2014also another order of said county court made on the 16th October 1793, in these words: \u201c The writ of <em>ad quod damnum </em>which was granted to <em>Hugh Donaghe </em>being returned, together with the inquest of the jurors thereto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>annexed, on the motion of the said <em>Donaghe </em>leave is granted him to build a mill agreeable to the report of the said jurors.\u201d The said defendant also adduced, 1. The testimony of <em>Hatch </em>Clarke, who proved, that he had known the dam and mills of the defendant about twelve or thirteen years; that he does not know whether the dam is higher or backs the water more than when he first knew it; that he has not perceived any difference in these respects; that the witness assisted in rebuilding the present dam about two years ago; that it is about the same place with the former dam, which was washed away, but a little higher up on the stream, to keep it from being washed away in consequence of the softness of the earth and the direction of the current: that the witness had a conversation with the plaintiff since the institution of this suit, in which the plaintiff stated, that he had applied to the defendant to arbitrate the controversy, which the defendant refused\u2014that he could not submit to the injury any longer\u2014that he had gone to <em>John Donaghe </em>in his lifetime and told him his dam was too high, to which he replied that he had made his calculations according to the height of his dam, and would make no alterations in it\u2014and that the plaintiff had told <em>Donaghe </em>he would sue him. The witness further testified that within a . few years; not exceeding three, the plaintiff has altered his saw mill from a gear mill to a flutter wheel with a patent shoot, which from the appearance of the current requires a good deal more water than formerly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-4\"><em>2. </em>The testimony of <em>John Comsey, </em>who proved, that about twelve or thirteen years ago, the dam on the defendant\u2019s land was washed away, and the witness assisted in rebuilding it; that it was not rebuilt higher than the former dam, and the witness did not perceive that it backed the water more; that the present dam was rebuilt about two years ago, about the same place as the dam which the witness assisted to rebuild, one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>end of the present dam resting against the ash tree aforesaid, and the other standing a few feet higher up the stream lhan the corresponding end of the former dam; that the present dam, the witness thinks, is not higher than the one he assisted to rebuild, and he does not know whether it backs the water more than it was formerly backed ; that he never examined how far the water was backed at any period; that the foundation of the dam which the witness assisted in building was a marl rock, the lower end of which being washed away by the current, the present foundation is in consequence a little higher up; and that the water is taken out of the dam about the same height as formerly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-4\">At the time the orders aforesaid of the county court were read in evidence by the defendant, the writ of <em>ad quod damnum </em>and the inquest of the jury, therein referred to, could not be found; but being afterwards found in the progress of the trial, they were given in evidence to the jury by the plaintiff The writ bears date the 27th of October 1792, and is in the usual form. The inquest of the jury is dated the 7th of January .1793. It finds that no mansion house or office, curtilage, garden, orchard or lands will bo overflowed, no fish of passage nor ordinary navigation be obstructed, nor the health of the neighbours be annoyed; and it directs that the water shall not be raised by the dam farther than a certain <em>log </em>in an old dam.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-6\">It was proved on the part of the plaintiff, that he has been in possession and enjoyment of the land on which his said mills and dam are situate, upwards of thirty years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-7\">On the part of the defendant it was proved that he purchased the land on which his said mills and dam are situate, from the heirs of <em>John Donaghe, </em>about eight years ago, about which time the same was conveyed to him; since which he has been in the possession and enjoyment thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ALr\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>And this being all the evidence introduced on the trial, after the same had been heard, the defendant\u2019s counsel moved the court to instruct the jury, that if , they believed that the alleged grievance in the declaration mentioned was the mere consequence of the defendant\u2019s use and enjoyment of the water of the stream in said declaration mentioned, by means of his dam for the propelling of his mills, and that said defendant, prior to said alleged grievance, had been in such use and enjoyment for more than twenty years, and that such use and enjoyment was exclusive and adversary for more than twenty years immediately before the alleged grievance,\u2014then, such exclusive and adversary use and enjoyment was to be regarded by the jury as conclusive evidence of the defendant\u2019s right to the use and enjoyment of the said water, to the extent of said exclusive and adversary use and enjoyment. But the court refused to give'the instruction asked, and in lieu thereof gave the following instruction, to wit: <em>\u201c </em>The inquest of the jury authorized <em>Hugh Donaghe </em>to raise a dam that would deepen or throw the water back in <em>Naked creek </em>to a sill a few feet below <em>Aylor's </em>line. No height is specified for the dam. ' On erecting his dam, if <em>Donaghe </em>found that the water would flow furlher up than the sill, and extend upon the lands of <em>Aylor, </em>he ought to have obtained a second writ of <em>ad quod damnum, </em>and asked the permission of the court to raise it to the height he wanted it. Those claiming under him now claim a right to keep the dam at its pr-esent height, from twenty years quiet possession, and ask the court to instruct the jury to the effect that twenty years quiet possession, acquiesced in and admitted by <em>Aylor, </em>would bar his action, because the law would presume that he had granted the right of flowing the water on his lands : [but the testimony which <em>Aylor </em>has produced respecting ( his complaints from time to time of the injury he sus1 tained from the refluent water, and the evidence by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>which he attempted to shew that the present dam of the defendant is higher than the former dam, and the present injury complained of is of more recent date than the time of erecting the dam, is proper evidence to rebut the presumption that <em>Ayior </em>ever did consent to raise the dam higher than was contemplated by the inquest of the jury in 1793.\u201d\u2014To the opinion of the court refusing the former and giving the latter instruction, the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-4\">The defendant then moved the court to instruct the jury, that if they should believe, from the evidence in the cause, that more than twenty years before the grievance complained of in the declaration, the defendant was in the use and enjoyment of the water of said stream, in the manner and for the purpose aforesaid, and that the plaintiff at that time complained to the then proprietor of the defendant\u2019s land, of such use and enjoyment, and threatened to sue him if the dam was not lowered, and he then refused to lower his dam, claiming the right to keep it at the height it then was; and that since such refusal the dam has been kept up to the same height, and the use and enjoyment of the water continued, with the knowledge and against the consent of the plaintiff, daring the whole time which has subsequently elapsed,\u2014then, such use and enjoyment must be regarded as adversary, and If exclusive for more than twenty years, is conclusive evidence of the defendant\u2019s right to the use and enjoyment of the water to the extent aforesaid: which instruction <em>the </em>court refused to give <em>; </em>and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-5\">After the verdict was rendered for the plaintiff as aforesaid, the defendant moved the court to grant him a new trial, on the ground that the verdict was contrary to evidence : which motion the court overruled, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-6\">From the judgment of the circuit court, the defendant prayed an appeal to this court, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AJeW\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ah2\">insisted that an adversary possession, in cases of this nature, for 20 years, rendered it unnecessary for the possessor to prove his right; that such a possession was conclusive, unless it had been resisted; and that it must be resisted not by mere claim or complaint, but by suit. The intervening complaint of <em>Ayior, </em>resisted, and not vindicated by suit, rather strengthened the possessor\u2019s right, because it proved the adversary character of the possession, and the knowledge of its being adversary. He cited <em>The Mayor of Hull </em>v. <em>Horner, </em>Cowp. 108. <em>Eldridge </em>v. <em>Knott &amp;c. </em>Id. 214. <em>Holcroft </em>v. <em>Heel, 1 </em>Bos. &amp; Pul. 400. <em>Campbell v. Wilson, </em>3 East 294. 2 Wms. Saund. 175a. <em>Bealey </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>6 East 208. <em>Coalter </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>4 Rand. 58.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AIXs\"><em>Robinson, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKLB\">contended that the flowing back of the water for 20 years was not conclusive evidence of right, but might be repelled by circumstances. In the case of <em>The Mayor of Hull </em>v. <em>Horner, </em>where the enjoj'ment was for 350 years, lord <em>Mansfield </em>takes the distinction between time as a bar, and time as evidence; treating the one as conclusive, the other not. The same distinction is again made in <em>Eldridge </em>v. <em>Knott &amp;c. </em>where there were 37 years after .demand and refusal. <em>Holcroft </em>v. <em>Heel, </em>as it is reported, was thought to go too far, as appears from <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Wilson. </em>In Saunders the possession is treated as only presumptive, not conclusive. 2 Wins. Saund. 175b. <em>Bealey </em>v. <em>Shaw </em>shews that if the enjoyment be contested, the contest will detract from its weight. The presumptive character of the evidence is noticed in <em>Coalter </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>4 Rand. 65. In accordance with this is 3 Starkie on Ev. 1214. 1217. 1671. He cited also <em>Fenwick </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>7 Eng. Com. Law Rep. <em>Livett </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>3 Bingh. 115. 11 Eng. Com. Law Rep. 57. and <em>Sumner </em>v. <em>Tileston &amp;c. </em>7 Pick. 198. There was no difficulty, he said, except that growing out of the opinion of lord <em>Ellenborough </em>in <em>Bealey </em>v. <em>Shawl </em>6 East 215-16. But that case may be explained. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>possession meant is one not disputed, and the right to enjoy, a right not contested. The rule, at most, would only be like the rule of fraud <em>per se. </em>Possession of chattels in the grantor inconsistent with the conveyance is <em>per se </em>fraudulent. Enjoyment for 20 years without interruption and without contest is <em>per se </em>evidence of a right to enjoy. But in the one case the possession may be explained and shewn not to be inconsistent. And so in the other it may be shewn that the right to enjoy was not acquiesced in, but contested, and thus the idea of a grant from the party contesting be excluded. In this case, the proof rebuts any presumption of a grant from <em>Aylor </em>to <em>Donaghe.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b577-4\"><em>Johnson, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AC7\">said, he supposed that in such cases the proof from time might be rebutted; but the question was, by what sort of evidence? If the presumptive proof be unanswered, it is conclusive. Here, he insisted, it was not answered. The record in <em>Donagh\u00e9s </em>case cannot, he admitted, protect those claiming under him, beyond the log; but if the record cannot aid, neither can it injure. And throwing this record out of the case, it rested upon the complaints of <em>Aylor. </em>What the plaintiff himself said of his former complaints, unless assented to by the defendant, was no proof, and complaint made after 20 years possession had given right, could not affect that right. It would seem strange if a mere claim of title, even within the 20 years, without any act in vindication of it, should be of weight; for the defendant being in possession could not sue, and was compelled to wait for the plaintiff to sue, to try the right. It was said, there must be acquiescence. But does not he acquiesce in my right, who, knowing that I hold claiming right, brings no action, and does no act to interrupt my possession ?</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b577-6\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AcyH\">This case turns upon several opinions of the court below. The first and second instructions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>asked of the court, I consider as essentially the same; to wit, to instruct the jury, that if it was proved to their satisfaction that the defendant, and those under whom he claimed, had been for more than <em>20 </em>years in the exclusive and adversary possession and exercise of the right of raising the water in <em>Naked creek </em>to the height at which it stood when the grievance complained of was inflicted, such exclusive and adversary enjoyment and use must be taken by them as <em>conclusive evidence </em>of the right of the defendant to raise the water to that height. The court refused to give this instruction, and I think, very properly. The difference between time as a bar, and time used as evidence, is very clearly shewn by lord <em>Mansfield, </em>in <em>The Mayor of Hull </em>v. Horner, Cowp. 108. and <em>Eldridge </em>v. <em>Knott &amp;c. </em>Id. 214. In the first he says\u2014\u201c There is a great difference between length of time which operates as a bar to a claim, and that which is only used by way of evidence. A jury is concluded by length of time that operates as a bar: as where the statute of limitations is pleaded in bar of a debt; though the jury is satisfied that the debt is due and unpaid, it is still a bar. But length of time used merely by way of evidence, may be left to the consideration of the jury, to be credited or not, and to draw their inference one way or the other according to the circumstances.\u201d In <em>Coalter </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>4 Rand. 58. the question was about a water right, and <em>Hunter </em>relied on the exclusive and uninterrupted use for more than twenty years; but though this was proved, it did not prevent the court from inquiring into the origin of the claim. They said, \u201c It is of the very nature of presumptive proof, that it yields to that which is positive.\u201d They examined the evidence, and finding it to establish the fact that <em>Hunter </em>first acquired and afterwards held the use of the water by permission merely, they ask, \u201c When a loan is positively proved, how can we presume a grant?\u201d Looking at the f nglish cases since lord <em>Mansfield's </em>time, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>find some seeming contrariety; but in the main, I think they clearly establish the same doctrine. In <em>Holcroft </em>v. <em>Heel, </em>1 Bos. &amp; Pul. 400. it would seem from the case as reported, that <em>Eyre, </em>C. J. decided the undisturbed possession of a market by the defendant for 23 years to be a clear bar to the plaintiff\u2019s right of action. But from an explanation given of this case four years after in <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>3 East 294. by <em>Le Blanc, J. </em>who had been of counsel in the cause, the facts appeared to be that the court <em>did disapprove </em>of the opinion given at <em>nisi prius, </em>that the time was a clear bar, and would have sent the case back; but they would have sent it with an intimation of their opinion, that if <em>it went to </em>trial <em>on </em>the same facts, it should be left to the jury to find for the defendants, upon the ground of the presumption of a grant after 20 years uninterrupted user of the market: and the plaintiff\u2019s counsel said, that if it were to be left to the jury in that manner, with the recommendation of the court in favour of such presumption, it would answer no purpose to go to trial again. And in this case of <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>lord <em>Ellenborough </em>says\u2014\u201cIt might indeed be too much to say, in the case of <em>Holcroft </em>v. <em>Heel, </em>that the adverse user of the neighbouring market for 20 years was a <em>bar </em>to the action by the grantee of the crown. In strictness it was not.\u201d And <em>Grose, </em>J. says, \u201cAs to the question of law, I agree with the case of <em>Holcroft </em>v. <em>Heel </em>as it has been explained by my brother <em>Le Blanc, but no </em>further.\u201d The case of <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>clearly overrules that of <em>Holcroft </em>v. <em>Heel, </em>taken as reported. There, a right of way was in contest, and an adverse exercise of that easement for more than 20 years, under a claim of right, was proved. The judge at <em>nisi prius </em>instructed the jury that if they wore satisfied that the enjoyment was adverse, and had continued 20 years and upwards before the action, it was a sufficient ground for their presuming the grant pleaded by the defendant: but that if they were satisfied from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>whole evidence, that the enjoyment had been only by leave and favour, or otherwise than under a claim or assertion of right, it would repel the presumption of a grant. It is clear that the judges thought this instruction a little too broadly given; yet as the evidence did not in their opinion take away the ground of presumption, they thought it best not to send the cause back. Thus lord <em>Ellenborough </em>says (after stating the facts,) \u201c There was therefore no reason why the jury should not make the presumption, as in other cases, that the defendant acted by right; and <em>that was in substance </em>the direction of the learned judge.\u201d <em>G-rosesajs, </em>\u201c It appears that the judge left the question to the jury upon the evidence, whether the enjoyment originated under a grant, or in any other manner ? and therefore I cannot say that upon this evidence the jury might not make the presumption which they have done; though had I been one of them, I do not know that I should have dared to do so.\u201d <em>Lawrence, J. </em>says, <em>\u201cNo </em>doubt but that adverse enjoyment of the right of way for 20 . years, <em>unexplained, </em>is evidence sufficient for the jury to found a presumption that it was a legal enjoyment; and such, in effect, was the opinion of the learned judge in his' direction to them.\u201d It is most clear, from all that is said in this case, that the court thought the 20 years possession <em>no bar, </em>but presumptive evidence only. I have stated this case the more fully, because of its bearing on the case of <em>Bealey </em>v. Shaw, 6 East 208. There the defendants had long possessed a mill, which was fed by water taken by a sluice from the river <em>Irwell, </em>leaving a considerable quantity still flowing in the channel of the river. In the year 1787 the plaintiff comes to a spot lower down the stream, and erects a weir, mill, and other works on his own land, and enjoys the rest of the water which the defendants had not been accustomed to divert. Four years after, the defendants so enlarged this sluice as to interfere materially with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number><em>the </em>operation of the works below; for which the action was brought. It will be seen from this statement, that the question of 20 years possession could not arise here, and that every remark on that subject must be extrajudicial. Yet great reliance has been placed on an observation of lord <em>Ellenborough. </em>He says, \u201cI take it, that 20 years exclusive enjoyment of the water, in any particular manner, affords a conclusive presumption of right in the party so enjoying it, derived from grant or act of parliament.\u201d In the first place, this is an <em>obiter dictum: </em>in the second, though the word <em>conclusive </em>is rather oddly joined wilh the word presumption (it being of the very essence of presumptive evidence, that it must yield to stronger proof) yet we must understand lord <em>Ellenborough </em>to mean, by a conclusive presumption, a presumption which, unexplained or uncontradicted, will conclusively authorize a jury to find the fact. This construction is necessary to reconcile lord <em>Ellenborough </em>to the whole course of decision,\u2014indeed to reconcile him with himself; for in the case last cited, of <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>decided only two years before this, lord <em>Ellenborough </em>and the whole court held that 20 years possession was simply presumptive evidence to be explained or rebutted like any oiher presumption. In <em>Livett </em>v. <em>Wilson, 3 </em>Bing. 115. 11 Eng. C. L. Rep. 57. upon a question of 20 years possession, <em>Best, </em>C. J. says, \u201c I do not dispute that if there bad been an uninterrupted usage for 20 years, the jury might be authorized to presume it originated in a deed; but even in such a case a judge would not be justified in telling a jury that they <em>must, </em>but that they <em>may, </em>presume a deed. If, however, there are circumstances inconsistent with the existence of a deed, the jury should be directed to consider them, and decide accordingly.\u201d And the rest of the court were of the same opinion. I think, then, the judge was correct in refusing to instruct the jury that the 20 years possession was conclusive evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>right. I think he was correct too in the instruction which he did give; that is, that the testimony in the case of <em>Aylor's </em>complaints from time to time of the injury he received from the refluent water, and the evidence by which he attempted to shew that the present dam of the defendant is higher than the former, and that the injury complained of is of more recent date than the time of erecting the dam, &amp;c. was proper to be considered by the jury as evidence to rebut the presumption. There are several cases in which complaints and claims are said to be sufficient to shew that the possession was not acquiesced in, <em>but </em>was a contested possession: <em>Bealey </em>v. <em>Shaw </em>is one of them. In the case before us, I am of opinion that the ground for presuming a deed is much weakened by considerations which do not apply to most of the'pnglish cases. No man undertakes to build a mill with us, until he has obtained leave of the court of the county in which the mill is situated. In order to get leave, he must have a writ of <em>ad quod damnum. </em>There must be an inquest of a jury, fixing the height of his dam, reporting what land will be overflowed, and several other matters. Upon consideration of the whole of these matters, the court, if they think it proper, give leave to erect the dam and mill. All this is of record, and under this record evidence the party proceeds to build his dam &amp;c. This was the case with <em>Donaghe. </em>The inquest did not ascertain the height of his dam, in any other way than by saying he should not throw the water further back than a sill near <em>Aylor's </em>line. Can there be a rational doubt, that it was under this inquest and leave of the court he built his dam, and, by mistake probably, built it so high as to throw the water further back than the sill ? If he had relied on any other authority (such as a grant from Aylor) would he not have alleged it when <em>Aylor </em>was threatening suit and complaining that his dam was too high ? In the record purporting to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>tain all the evidence, the defendant produces, as the foundation of his right to build his darn, the proceedings in the county court. When it is so obvious to refer the dam and its height to this proceeding, does it not weaken much the ground of presuming any other authority ? 1 think so. And there is a case <em>(Fenwick </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>5 Barn. &amp; Ald. 228.7 Eng. C. L. Rep. 79.) which seems to bear out the idea. There a creditor by judgment, in the year 1752, by agreement with his debtor, entered into possession of a tract of land belonging to the debtor, to hold till his debt should be paid. He, and those who claimed under him, held till 1801, when the family of the debtor filed a bill to have a settlement and a decree for the land; and in 1821 the vice chancellor directed this action of ejectment to be brought. The question was whether, after this holding of 49 years, a deed ought not to be presumed ? The judge at <em>nisi prim </em>told the jury that the real question for them to consider was, whether they believed that a conveyance had actually taken place ; observing, that the loss of a deed of conveyance was less likely to take place, than of a grant of a right of way. A new trial was moved for on the ground of misdirection. <em>Abbott, </em>C. J. said, \u201c I am clearly of opinion that the direction was according to law. In cases where the original possession cannot be accounted for, and would be unlawful unless there had been a grant, the rule may perhaps be different; and all the cases cited are of that description. Here the original possession is accounted for, and is considered with the fact of there being no conveyance.\u201d After some further remarks he concludes thus\u2014\u201cIn my opinion, presumptions of grants and conveyances have already gone to too great a length, and I am not disposed to extend them further.\u201d <em>Holroyd, </em>J. remarked\u2014\u201c The true question was presented to the jury. In cases of rights of way &amp;c. the original enjoyment cannot be accounted for, unless a grant has been made; and there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>fore it is, that from long enjoyment such grants are presumed. But even in these cases, evidence to rebut such a presumption would be admissible.\u201d I think 'this case illustrates strongly the difference between our mill cases, and the english cases of water rights, rights of way, &amp;c. Upon the motion for a new trial I shall only say, that I think the court was right in refusing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">I am for affirming the judgment, <em>in omnibus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Brockenbrougi-i, J. I concur in affirming the judgment.</p>\n<author id=\"b584-6\">Brooke, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A_z\">I think the instructions to the jury asked for by the counsel for the defendant were correctly refused by the judge, and that the instruction given by the judge was proper on the case made by the bill of exceptions. What was said by lord <em>Mansfield </em>in the case of <em>The Mayor of Hull </em>v. <em>Horner, </em>Cowp. 108. that though the jury did not believe there was a grant, yet public utility required, for the quieting of rights, that they should presume a grant under the circumstances of that case, did not forbid the introduction of opposing evidence to prove that the presumption was unfounded; and though there is a want of precision in the reporters or the judges, in the language used, there can now be no doubt such evidence may be introduced. In <em>Livett </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>3 Bing. 115. 11 Eng. C. L. Rep. 57. much is said by all the judges to that effect, which I will not repeat here. But this presumption of a grant after 20 years exclusive and adversary possession and enjoyment of the way or water, can only apply to cases in which the possession can in no other way be accounted for, than by a grant from the plaintiff or those under whom he claims. Where that is not the case, the presumption must fail, as in the case before us. The use of the water is clearly accounted for. The establish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>ment of mills is a matter <em>publici juris, </em>and without the r <em>J </em>. judgment of a court the defendant was not authorized to raise his dam so as to injure the plaintiff or any other person, nor could they grant him that right. To presume the grant of a thing which could not be granted by any individual, would carry the doctrine greatly beyond the reason of it; and in none of the cases has the presumption been relied on when the possession could be accounted for otherwise than by grant. I think the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b585-7\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AgGb\">I am of opinion that the instruction first asked for was properly refused. Whatever difficulty there may be in reconciling the various authorities, they all concur in making acquiescence or <em>uninterrupted </em>possession the foundation of the presumption. But here the defendant asks that the right should be presumed from exclusive and adversary possession alone, without making the freedom from interruption a term in his proposition. Again, notwithstanding some weighty opinions to the contrary, the preponderance of authority is clearly against the conclusiveness of the presumption. The court, therefore, ought not to have instructed the jury that it was conclusive, and the instruction which was given was altogether correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">The last instruction asked for is still more objectionable, for it not only requires that the presumption should be conclusive, but that it should be raised from mere continued adversary possession, not only without acquiescence, but with the knowledge and <em>against the con-' sent of Aylor. </em>Now, the presumption of right or of a grant arises from the long <em>acquiescence o\u00ed </em>the party, and does not arise where the enjoyment is contested. <em>Bealey </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>6 East 216. It would be strange indeed if a grant was to be presumed to have been made by him, though he w'as continually contesting the right; and accordingly in the case of <em>Livett </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>3 Bing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>115. 11 Eng. C. L. Rep. 57. it is distinctly made an , <em>f </em>, , , answer to <em>the </em>presumption, that the user \u201c had been almost always the subject of contest.\u201d It is also observable in that case, that no action had ever been brought asserting the rights of the party, and that his repeated complaints and denial of the title of his adversary were considered as sufficiently rebutting the presumption of a grant. I am therefore of opinion that this instruction was properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"AO34\">The motion for a new trial was also properly refused. If the evidence was not conclusive of the right, it was the province of the jury to decide upon its weight, and I see no reason for disturbing their decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-13\">I am of opinion to affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-14\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
