Jarrett, </em>in the circuit court of <em>Kanawha. </em>His declaration contained three counts. The <em>first </em>alleged, that <em>E. Jarrett, </em>in his lifetime, by his certain covenant in writing &amp;c. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>now here to the court shewn, acknowledged that he had received of the plaintiff, two obligations for collection, the one a note of <em>J. Huff </em>for 438 dollars, the other a note of <em>B. Reeder </em>for 150 dollars, which notes, <em>when colieCfe(i, he covenanted and promised to credit </em>on a bond of <em>J. Jarrett senior </em>for 1000 dollars held by the said <em>E. Jarrett; </em>and then assigned the breach,\u2014that <em>though the said E. Jarrett collected </em>the amount of both the said notes of <em>Huff </em>and <em>Reeder, </em>yet he in his lifetime, and the defendants since his death, did not and would not credit the amount thereof on <em>J. Jarrett senior's </em>said bond for 1000 dollars &amp;c. The <em>second </em>count set out the covenant and the effect of the engagement thereby incurred, as in the first count, but varied from it in assigning the breach; the breach alleged in this count being that <em>E. Jarrett </em>in his lifetime, and the defendants since his death, <em>did not and would not collect the said notes, and did not and would not endeavour to collect them, but </em>on the contrary, omitted to make timely application for the amount thereof, and to make any effort whatever for the recovery and collection thereof, and failed in any manner to account for the same. The third count, after setting out the covenant as in the two former, varied from them in stating the effect of it; this count alleging, that <em>E. Jarrett, </em>by his covenant, promised <em>to endeavour to collect </em>the amount of the two notes of <em>Huff </em>and <em>Reeder, </em>and to apply the same, when collected, to the credit of the bond of <em>J. Jarrett senior </em>for 1000 dollars &amp;c. and then it assigned the breach in the words of the assignment of breach in the <em>second </em>count.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-4\">The defendants took <em>oyer </em>of the covenant, and then demurred generally to the declaration, and pleaded <em>covenants performed, </em>and <em>non est factum.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-5\">The court overruled the demurrer. And upon the trial of the issues on the pleas, the defendants filed exceptions to an opinion of the court; from which it appeared, that the plaintiff offered the covenant in evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>dence (which was set out <em>in June verbal), </em>and that the .... defendants objected to the reading of it, because it did not agree with the covenant as laid in the declaration . \u201e . , . m any of its counts; but the court overruled the objection, and admitted the instrument as proper evidence under all of the counts; to which opinion the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-9\">Verdict for the plaintiff for 438 dollars on the <em>first </em>count, and for 150 on the <em>second </em>and <em>third </em>counts, with interest &amp;c. Judgment against the defendants, accordingly, <em>de bonis teslatoris: </em>from which the defendants appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b115-10\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellants, objected,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahn\">1. that the breach was not well assigned in the first count of the declaration ; because it was not positively averred, that <em>E. Jarrett </em>collected the money due on the notes, but only (by way of recital) that \u201cthough he had collected it,\u201d yet he did not credit it on the bond of <em>J. Jarrett senior </em>for 1000 dollars &amp;c. <em>2. </em>Neither was the breach well assigned in the <em>second </em>count; because the effect of the covenant was only that the covenantor should <em>use due diligence </em>in collecting the debts; and if the utmost diligence would have been unavailing to collect them,\u2014 if, for example, the debtors were, from the first, utterly and hopelessly insolvent,\u2014the duty of due diligence did not require him to incur the costs of a useless suit, or the trouble of a vain and idle effort to make the collection; yet the breach alleged, was, that he did not endeavour to collect the debts, or make timely application for them, or make any effort for the collection of them, without alleging that such endeavour, application or effort, would have been availing. 3. That the same objection applied to the <em>third </em>count; since it varied from the second only in interpreting the covenant to mean, that the covenantor would <em>endeavour to collect the money; </em>that is, that he would make the endeavour, whether it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>was likely to avail or no; whereas (he repeated) the covenant bound him only to the duty of due diligence to collect the debts, and that duty did not necessarily bind him to make any endeavour to collect. The <em>third </em>count at least ought to have been held bad, for it put a construction on the covenant different from its legal effect. 4. The objection to the admissibility of the covenant in evidence, presented the same _ objections raised on the demurrer, in another form. The court admitted it as proper evidence on all of the counts, and the verdict was rendered partly on <em>the Grst, </em>and <em>partly on </em>the other two; but, even supposing that the instrument corresponded with the description of it in the two first counts, it was variant from that contained in the last.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b116-10\">R. <em>C. Nicholas, contra,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAu\">premised, that the demurrer being to the whole declaration, if any count in it was good, the demurrer was properly overruled; 1 Chitt. Plead. 643. 1 Rob. Prac. 281. <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Crutchfield, </em>1 Hen. &amp; Munf. 361. And, he said, the first count was clearly good: the allegation, that though the defendant collected the money, yet he did not apply it according to the covenant, meant that he did collect and did not apply it.' But the other counts were good too. <em>The second </em>assigned the breach of the covenant understood according to its true legal effect; and the <em>third </em>set out the covenant according to its true meaning and effect. For, admitting that the covenant bound the party, not to 'collect the debts whether they could be collected or not, but only to use due diligence to collect them, the duty of due diligence was nothing more or less than the duty of making proper endeavour or effort to collect them; and if no diligence, no <em>effort or </em>endeavour, would have been availing,\u2014if the collection of the debts was impracticable,\u2014it was for the defendant to shew that matter in his defence. As to the admission of the covenant in evidence, he denied that there was any variance between the actual covenant and that de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>scribed in the declaration; but, even if there was a material variance, the plaintiff having made <em>profert </em>of the covenant, and the defendant having taken <em>oyer </em>of , _ _ it, and so made it part of the declaration, he could not object to it as evidence at the trial, on the ground of variance between it and the covenant stated in the declaration; <em>Armstrong </em>v. Armstrongs, 1 Leigh 491. <em>Snell </em>v. <em>Snell, </em>4 Barn. &amp; Cress. 741. 10 Eng. C. L. Rep. 453.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b117-10\"><em>Johnson, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Atyh\">questioned the accuracy of the doctrine in 1 Chitt. Plead. 643. that \u201cif there be several counts, or in covenant several breaches, some of which are sufficient and others not, the defendant should only demur to the latter, for if he were to demur to the w'hole declaration, the court would give judgment against him.\u201d There was some contrariety in the decisions on the point; but the true rule w'as, that, in such case, the plaintiff\u2019 should have judgment for so many of the counts as are good, or for those breaches which are well assigned ; 1 Wms. Saund. 286. n. 9. 2 Id. 380. n. 14. <em>Cooke v. Thornton, </em>6 Rand. 8. 12. 15.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b117-12\">Cabell, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AqCP\">delivered the opinion of the court\u2014That all the counts in the declaration were good, and consequently the demurrer was rightly overruled : and that the exception made by the appellant to the covenant as evidence, was also properly overruled. It was the very covenant of which <em>profert </em>was made by the plaintiff, and <em>oyer </em>craved by the defendant, and which, therefore, became a part of the declaration. There was no principle, then, on which it could be objected to as evidence in support of the declaration. The judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
