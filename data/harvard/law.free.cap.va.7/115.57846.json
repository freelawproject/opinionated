States, </em>for carrying the mail for a short term, on two several and distinct mail routes, once a week, for 988 dollars, agreed with the plaintiff <em>Jett, </em>that if he would execute one half of the contract, by carrying the mail on each route, alternately, every other week, the defendant would pay over to him one half of the stipulated compensation of 988 dollars, as soon as the defendant should receive the same from the post office department; and that the defendant, having before that contract had expired, made another contract with the post master general, whereby the department agreed to allow him, for carrying the mail, once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>a week, on the same two routes, for a term of four years from the expix'ation of the first contract, the sum of 1450 dollars <em>per annum, </em>payable quartei'ly, agreed likewise with the plaintiff, that if he would execute one half of this contract, by carrying the mail on each route, altei'nately, every other week, the defendant would pay over to him one half the last mentioned stipulated compensation of 1450 dollars <em>per annum, </em>as he should receive the same; and the plaintiff averred, that he executed these agreements on his part; and that the defexxdant received from the department, 988 dollars under the first contract, and 1450 dollars <em>per annum, </em>quarterly, under the second contract; by reason whereof the defendant became indebted to the plaintiff, one moiety of the sums of money so by him received from the department ; and being so indebted, in consideration thex'eof, assumed to pay him the same &amp;c. Plea, the general issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-5\">At the trial, the defendant filed two bills of exceptions to opinions of the court. 1. The plaintiff having offered evidence to prove the agreements between him and the defendant, alleged in the declaration, the defexrdant moved the court to instruct the jury, that those agreements coxxstituted a partnership between the parties, and that no action at law could be maintained by the one partner against the other; but the court refused to give the instruction, and instructed the jury, on the contrary, that the agreements did not coxistitute a partnership between them; to which the defendant excepted. 2. The defendant on his part, in oz'der to prove negligence and misconduct of the plaintiff, in carrying the mail, under his agreements with the defendant, offered in evidence a <em>letter </em>from the post master genex'al, and other evidence to prove such negligence and misconduct; whereupon the plaintiff, in order to prove that the complaints of irregularities in carryixig the mail on the routes, which had reached the department, arose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>from the defendant\u2019s own defaults in carrying the mail, at the times when he was bound to carry the same, offered in evidence a <em>certificate </em>of the post master general, under the seal of the department, setting forth those irregularities, and pointing out the times and places of their occurrence; to the admission of which <em>certificate </em>in evidence, the defendant objected; but the court permitted the <em>certificate </em>to be read to the jury, as evidence of the fact that complaints were made to the department, as stated in the <em>certificate; </em>and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-4\">Verdict and judgment for the plaintiff for 276 dollars with interest &amp;c. from which the defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b137-5\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXU\">admitted, that the circuit court was right in holding, that there was no partnership between the parties. But he objected, that the post master general\u2019s <em>certificate </em>was not competent evidence for any purpose, and it was error to admit it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b137-6\"><em>Taylor, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiFg\">said, that neither the post master general\u2019s <em>letter, </em>which was offered by the defen-, dant and admitted as evidence on his part, nor the <em>certificate </em>from the department, offered in evidence for the plaintiff, were proper evidence. But after the <em>letter </em>had been admitted as evidence for the defendant, it might have been proper enough to admit the <em>certificate </em>as evidence for the plaintiff; since, for aught that appeared, the <em>certificate </em>might have been, and most probably was, only explanatory of the letter.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b137-7\">Purr curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AF-\">The circuit court erred in admitting the certificate of the post master general mentioned in the second exception, as evidence on the trial. The <em>letter </em>of that officer, mentioned in the same exception, was inadmissible as evidence for the defendant, except by the plaintiff\u2019s consent: but his having consented that the <em>letter </em>should be read in evidence for the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>was no sufficient reason for admitting the <em>certificate </em>as evidence for the plaintiff, without the defendant\u2019s consent, since it was not legal evidence. Therefore, judgment reversed, and cause sent back for a new trial.</p>\n<author id=\"b138-3\">Brooke, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Aos\">agreed, that the judgment should be reversed, but on a different ground. He said\u2014As to the first exception, the circuit court was right in deciding, that the agreements did not constitute a partnership between plaintiff and defendant. In the second exception, I think the evidence is too imperfectly stated. It is stated, that the defendant introduced a <em>letter </em>from the post master general, and other evidence, to prove defaults in the plaintiff j but neither the <em>letter, </em>nor its purport, is set out, nor what was the other evidence to prove the misconduct of the plaintiff. And as the <em>letter </em>was not objected to by the plaintiff, I am not sure that the <em>certificate </em>of the post master general, introduced for the plaintiff, was not admissible to explain the <em>letter </em>introduced by the defendant. At least, after the defendant had introduced the <em>letter, </em>which was improper evidence, I am not satisfied, that it lay in his mouth to object to the <em>certificate </em>to explain it. I think the cause should be sent back, for uncertainty in the second bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
