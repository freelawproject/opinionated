In July 1817, <em>Delilah, </em>the widow, married <em>Willoughby Foreman, </em>who was appointed guardian of his wife\u2019s infant children of her first marriage; of <em>John </em>in March 1S19, and of <em>Adeline </em>in February 1820. The account of <em>Wallace\u2019s </em>administration was audited and settled before auditors appointed by the county court which granted the administration ; and the account so settled shewed a balance due to the estate of 3483 dollars; but in this account, no charge was made of interest on the annual balances in the administrator\u2019s hands ; and the moneys which he</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>had received on account of the rents of the real estate, were debited to him. The administrator, in 1821, after closing his administration, put the slaves of his intestate\u2019s estate into the hands of <em>Willoughby 'Foreman, </em>the husband of the widow, and the guardian of the two infant distributees, and he thenceforth took the profits <em>of </em>the slaves as well as of the lauds belonging to the estate. His ward <em>Adeline </em>lived with him, from the time of his marriage with her mother till her own marriage, except the years 1818 and 1819, when she was boarded out to <em>go </em>to <em>school: John lived </em>with <em>him the </em>whole time. <em>Mrs. Foreman </em>died in November 1821. In May 1823, <em>Adeline </em>married <em>Richard Murray; John </em>was still an infant about nine years old.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-5\">In May 1824, <em>Murray </em>and wife, and the infant <em>John Foreman </em>by <em>Murray </em>his next friend, exhibited this bill against <em>Willoughby Foreman, </em>praying a settlement of his accounts of guardianship. The bill charged him with divers acts of mismanagement and injustice; and it charged in particular, that though the administrator, in the settlement of his accounts, had not been charged with interest on the annual balances in his hands, which made up the general balance of 3483 dollars, yet the administrator had in fact paid interest on the annual balances to the guardian, because he had paid him the general balance of 34S3 dollars by transferring to him bonds taken by him in the course of his administration, which bonds bore interest from their date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-6\"><em>Willoughby Foreman, </em>in his answer, denied all the allegations of mismanagement and injustice; and he denied, that he had ever received from the administrator any thing more than the general balance of 3483 dollars, reported to be due from him to the intestate\u2019s estate, and consequently, he insisted, that he ought not to be held accountable for interest with which the administrator had not been charged in the settlement of his accounts, and which he the guardian had never received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Adt\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>, The chancellor referred the guardian\u2019s accounts to a commissioner, to be stated and settled. The commissioner made a report, upon which the controverted'questions in the cause arose. Of these there were very many, but all of them were mere questions of fact but the following'\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-5\">1. The commissioner restated <em>Wallace\u2019s </em>administration account, charging him wdth interest on the annual balances in his hands as they accrued, and thus augmenting the general balance due on that account, from 3483 dollars, reported by the county court auditors, to 3744 dollars, one third of which he carried to the debit of the guardian, in his accounts with each of his wards. This was done, without any proof that the guardian had received the interest from the administrator, in any way whatever. And though this was a point particularly litigated in the pleadings, yet no exception was taken by the defendant to the report for the charge of interest. The chancellor approved the report in this particular.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-6\">2. There was a debt due from the intestate <em>John Foreman\u2019s </em>estate to one <em>Bassett Butts, </em>which was paid by the guardian, in 1822, out of the estate of his wards in his hands, amounting to 589 dollars; and the commissioner, in stating the guardian\u2019s accounts, allowed him a credit against his wards respectively for the proportions of this debt chargeable to each. There was no doubt that the debt was justly due from <em>John Foreman\u2019s </em>estate to <em>Butts, </em>and that the debt was paid <em>by the </em>guardian. Yet the plaintiffs excepted to the credit allowed the guardian on account of this payment, because they said the payment by the guardian was gratuitous. And the chancellor sustained the exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-7\">3. The disbursements of the guardian for his wards,' respectively, exceeded, in some years, the profits of then-lands and slaves in the guardian\u2019s hands, and upon the whole account, exceeded somewhat the profits of that part of their estate; but they did not exceed the aggre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>gate of those profits and the wards\u2019 share of the interest on the balance of 3483 dollars in the hands of <em>Wallace </em>the administrator. Under these circumstances, the commissioner credited the guardian for the whole of his disbursements for each ward. The plaintiff's ex-copied, because, they insisted, the guardian was not authorized to expend on his wards any more than tile profits of their estate in his hands. And the chancellor (upon the authority, it seemed, of <em>Myers </em>v. Wade, 6 Rand. 444.) sustained the exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-4\">The accounts being referred again to the commissioner to be <em>reformed </em>according to the opinions of the court on the points excepted to, he reported two statements of the guardian\u2019s accounts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-5\">In the <em>first, </em>he credited the guardian for only so much of his disbursements for his wards, as the yearly profits of their estate in his hands amounted to; and disallowed the credit he claimed on account of the debt due to <em>Butts </em>which he had paid. Upon the accounts so staled, there was a balance found due to <em>Murray </em>and wife, of 1818 dollars, with interest on 1284 dollars from the 1st July 1830; and to <em>John </em>Foreman, 2498 dollars, with interest on 1966 dollars from the same date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-6\">In the <em>second, </em>he credited the guardian with the full amount of his disbursements for his wards; and u pon the account so staled, the balance found due to <em>Murray </em>and wife was 1151 dollars with interest on 776 dollars &amp;c. and the balance due to <em>John Foreman </em>was 2181 dollars with interest on 1690 dollars &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-7\">The chancellor, approving the <em>first </em>statement, decreed that the defendant should pay to the plaintiff's, respectively, the balances thereby appearing due to them. And the defendant appealed from the decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b435-8\">The case was argued here, by <em>Robinson </em>for <em>the </em>appellant and <em>Johnson </em>for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARRq\">upon the points above stated; and upon an objection taken by <em>Robinson </em>to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>final decree\u2014that it was erroneous in decreeing the defendant to pay the balance due to the infant plaintiff, to him, though he was still an infant, and the defendant\u2019s own ward. <em>Johnson </em>admitted that this was irregular; but he said, there was no need to correct it, since the ward was now certainly of full age.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b436-3\">Cabell, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AYk\">I am of opinion, that it is too late for the appellant to object, that, in the settlement of his guardianship accounts, he has been charged with interest as having been received from <em>Wallace </em>the administrator of <em>John </em>Foreman, when in fact he did not receive it. The account of <em>Wallace's </em>administration had been reformed by the commissioner by introducing rests into it, and charging the administrator with interest on the annual balances, according to the principles of the court, up to the time when the administrator settled with the guardian; and the balance of principal and interest thus ascertained by this reformed statement, was made the basis of the settlement of the guardianship accounts; one third of the balance of principal and interest being charged to the guardian, in the account with each of his wards. There <em>may </em>have been circumstances to justify this course; and as there was no objection made to it on the part of the guardian, we are bound, according to the uniform practice of this court, to presume that it was correct. Moreover, the report of the commissioner on the guardianship accounts, having been excepted to by the wards on other grounds, and some of these exceptions having been sustained by the chancellor, the report was recommitted, to be reformed accordingly. That report was made and returned, accompanied by alternative statements of the guardianship accounts. In these statements, the commissioner\u2019s reformed report of the administration. account, charging interest, was again made the basis of the settlement of the guardianship accounts: yet the guardian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>again abstained from filing anv exception to this course. * , . f \" . <em>\\ . </em>It is surely too late to make one in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"AZg\">The chancellor\u2019s decree is in conformity to the <em>first </em>statement of the guardianship accounts. Now the onljr difference between that statement and the <em>second </em>statemeut, is, that in the first no expenditures of the guardian for his wards are allowed, beyond the incomes of their estates in <em>his </em>hands; but in the <em>second, </em>the allowance of his expenditures is regulated by a regard, as well to the incomes of their estates in the hands of the administrator of their father, as to the incomes of their estates in the hands of the guardian. I am clearly of opinion, that the principle of the <em>second </em>statement was correct, and ought to have been adopted by the chancellor; and 1 would now rtwerse the decree, and enter one conformable to the <em>second </em>statement, were it not that the commissioner, in this statement also, acting on a previous direction of the chancellor, has excluded a credit to the guardian for the money which he paid on account of <em>Butts's </em>debt. 1 think he ought to have been credited for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Therefore, I am of opinion that the decree should be reversed, and the cause remanded, with directions to enter up a decree according to the last statement of the commissioner, after having allowed the appellant credit with his wards, for their proportion of the money paid by him on account of the debt due to <em>Butts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Care, and Brooke, J. concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b437-8\">Brockenbrougu, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A_Q\">dissented on the first point,\u2014that relating to the charge of interest to the guardian, which he had not received from the administrator,\u2014and concurred on the other points.</p>\n<author id=\"b437-9\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A3_y\">I am of opinion that the decree is erroneous in the following particulars: 1. In charging the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>defendant <em>Foreman </em>as guardian, upon the basis of his ^ ^ having received more than the sum of 3483 dollars from the administrator, when there is no proof of his having received more than that sum, or that he had ever received from the said administrator any further sum for or on account of interest. 2. In rejecting the payment to <em>Butts, </em>the evidence of which is decisive, and its propriety obvious, as there were abundant personal assets for the satisfaction of the debts. 3. In limiting the allowance for board and the annual expenses of the wards, to the annual income which came to the hands of the guardian himself, without adverting to the fact that the estate in the hands of the administrator afforded a revenue in addition to that received by the guardian, more than adequate to the expenses of the wards. Further, without undertaking to decide, upon the evidence, what allowance would be reasonable, I am of opinion that there was no obligation on <em>Foreman </em>to support his wards; that there is no adequate testimony of the waiver of compensation; that their services were <em>not </em>equivalent to their expenses, and that the guardian ought to be allowed a reasonable compensation for their board, and for all just and reasonable disbursements not exceeding the profits of the wards\u2019 estate, taking into the estimate that portion of it which was at the time in the hands of the administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Decree reversed, and cause remanded, <em>with </em>directions to enter a decree according to the last statement of the commissioner, after having allowed the appellant credit with his wards for their proportions of the money paid by him on account of the debt due to <em>Butts.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
