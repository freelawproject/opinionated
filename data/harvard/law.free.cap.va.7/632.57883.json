The first count charged that the defendant on &amp;c. broke and entered the plaintiff\u2019s closes in the said county of <em>Augusta, </em>and trod down, spoiled, consumed and depastured the plaintiff\u2019s grass, corn and small grain then and there growing, and cut and carried away other the grass, corn and small grain of the plaintiff then and there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>growing and being, of great value &amp;c. The second count was simply for taking and carrying away divers goods and quantities of grain, hay and corn, of the like quantity, quality and value as those described in the first count. The defendant pleaded not guilty, and issue was joined thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-4\">At the trial, the plaintiff gave in evidence to the jury a written lease, from <em>Elizabeth Furris </em>to himself, of the premises on which the trespass was alleged to have been committed, for the term of four years from the first day of April 1825. This instrument was signed and sealed by the said <em>Elizabeth Furris </em>and the plaintiff, and contained, among various covenants, the following : \u201c The said <em>James Harris </em>is to clear two acres of ground, and has the privilege of clearing fifteen, if he chooses, during the four years, for which he is to have three crops, as is customary for clearing land.\u201d But as to the question whether the tenant should be entitled to the crop which might be growing on the demised premises at the expiration of the term, the lease was wholly silent. The plaintiff further proved, that he entered upon and took possession of the demised premises, and held the same until the expiration of his lease. That, at the time of making the said lease, the whole of the cleared land on the demised premises, except a few acres, was in small grain, having been seeded the previous autumn by a certain <em>John Henry, </em>under a contract between him and the said <em>Elizabeth Furris; </em>and that in the summer of 1825 the said <em>John Henry </em>gathered and hauled away the said crop, without any claim being made thereto on the part of the plaintiff. That, in the autumn of 1828, the plaintiff sowed about 30 acres of the old cleared land on the demised premises, and three acres which he had cleared during the term, which last parcel was embraced in the same enclosure with part of the old cleared land. That he also, at the same time, sowed in small grain about se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>yen acres of land in a separate field, which he had cleared and fenced during the term. That from the three acres aforesaid he had, previous to the said seeding- in 1828, taken two crops, but the said seven acres had never been cultivated before. That, in the harvest of 1829, the defendant with his servants, horses and wagons, came upon the 30 acres aforesaid, and though prohibited by the plaintiff, took and carried away part of the said crop which the plaintiff had made thereupon, and which part the plaintiff had recently cut down ; and also cut and carried away, though prohibited by the plaintiff, another part of the crop last aforesaid; and that part of the grain so cut and carried away by the defendant was growing upon the three acres aforesaid. It was also proved that the plaintiff took away several wagon loads of grain from the said 30 acre field. The plaintiff further examined witnesses to prove that, by the custom and usage of the country, a tenant for a term of years is entitled to the waygoing crop; and the defendant examined witnesses to prove that such was not the custom and usage of the country, and particularly of the neighbourhood of the demised premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-6\">The defendant gave in evidence to the jury a written agreement, signed and sealed by himself and the said <em>Elizabeth Purris, </em>whereby the said <em>Elizabeth Purris </em>leased to him, for the term of four years from the first day of April 1829, the same premises which had been before demised to the plaintiff This instrument contained the following clause: \u201cIt is further understood and agreed that the said <em>Carson </em>is to have liberty to take his last fall crop off in peace.\u201d The defendant proved, that he entered upon and took possession of the demised premises at the expiration of the plaintiff\u2019s said lease; but there was no evidence to shew whether this possession extended to the land on which the waygoing crop was growing. He also proved, that about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>time of the expiration of the plaintiff\u2019s said lease, the plaintiff and <em>Elizabeth Furris </em>referred the settlement of their accounts for rent, repairs and improvements, to arbitrators, who reported a balance due from the said <em>Elizabeth </em>to the plaintiff, which was paid him ; but the said reference embraced no question in relation to the crops. The defendant further gave in evidence two notices in writing from <em>Elizabeth Furris </em>to the plaintiff; the first in these words : 41 June 11th 1827. <em>Mr. James Harris. </em>Sir, Take notice, I shall expect you to leave my farm by the first of April 1829. Any land which you have cleared or may clear, I wish you to have your crops off it before that time, as I shall expect it free from any and every incumbrance.\u201d And the second in the terms following: <em>\u201cMr. James Harris. </em>You will please take notice, that I will take possession of the land leased to you by articles, on the first day of April next, being the time your lease expires agreeably to the articles, and that you will leave the said place in the situation that may be required of you in conformity with the said articles. Given under my hand this 23d day of December 1828.\u201d Each of the said notices -was signed by <em>Elizabeth Furris, </em>and it was proved, that the first was duly served on the plaintiff in July 1828, and the last on the 23d day of December 1828. It also appeared from the evidence, that the plaintiff, at the time of the lease to him, was cognizant of the previous lease to <em>John Henry, </em>and of the fact that a crop was then in the ground. The defendant also proved, that it is customary for a tenant to be allowed three crops for clearing land, he enclosing and leaving it under a good fence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b655-5\">And this, the record stated, was all the evidence offered on either side, <em>except on the subject of usage.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b655-6\">After the introduction of the foregoing evidence, the defendant moved the court to instruct the jury, <em>first, </em>That under the terms of the lease aforesaid, the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>tiff was not entitled to recover for the crop severed from the 30 acre field aforesaid after the determination of his lease. <em>Secondly, </em>That the jury should disregard all the evidence offered by the plaintiff with a view of proving , a custom or usage varying the terms of the articles, and tending to shew that the plaintiff was entitled to the waygoing crop. <em>Thirdly, </em>That under the <em>facts aforesaid </em>this action cannot be maintained. <em>Fourthly, </em>That if evidence of usage is admissible to influence the construction of the articles, then such usage must be generally acquiesced in, in the particular neighbourhood where the contract was made. <em>Fifthly, </em>That if evidence.of usage is admissible, such usage must be of long standing, and uniform, peaceably acquiesced in, and not subject to contention and dispute, either at law or otherwise. <em>Sixthly, </em>That if such general usage shall be established to prevail in the district of country where the parties lived and where the contract was made, yet if it shall be shewn, on the other hand, that a different and opposite usage prevailed in the particular <em>neighbourhood </em>where the contract was made and <em>the </em>parties lived, and at the time such contract was made, then such particular usage of the neighbourhood should govern in the construction of the contract, in preference to the general usage. But the court refused to give any of the instructions asked for by the defendant, and he thereupon excepted; the bill of exceptions stating the whole of the evidence, as detailed above. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, and assessed his damages to 100 dollars; and the county court rendered judgment accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b656-4\">The circuit court of <em>Augusta, </em>on the petition of <em>Carson, </em>allowed a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment of the county court; and being of opinion that the said county-court ought to have given all the instructions asked for, reversed the judgment, set aside the verdict, and directed the cause to be sent back for a new trial.

There is nothing in the lease purporting to give to the tenant any interest in the land, or in the crops upon it, after the termination of the lease. On the day on which this lease terminated, the same tenement was leased by <em>Furris </em>to <em>Ca.rson </em>the defendant in error, who, in the summer of 1829, proceeded to cut and carry away a part of the crop of small grain which had been sown, the fail before, by the former tenant. The main question presented by the record is, whether the ofigoing or the incoming tenant was entitled to this crop.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The lease in this case having a fixed and certain period for its termination, it is clear, beyond doubt, that the ofigoing tenant had no right, at the common law, to any crops growing on the land, after the termination of the lease, although they may have been sown during his possession of and interest in the land; for it was his own folly to sow, when he knew that his interest would expire before he could reap. The crops are claimed, however, in this case, on the ground of a custom said to prevail in the district of country in which the land lies, that the ofigoing tenant shall have the way-going crops.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">The case of <em>Wigglesworth </em>v. <em>Dallison, </em>Doug. Rep. 201. was strongly relied upon by the counsel for the plaintiff in error, as shewing that a custom would, in <em>England, </em>entitle the ofigoing tenant to the waygoing crop, even where, as in this case, the lease was by writing under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>seal, and to end at a fixed time. But the ground on which lord <em>Mansfield </em>himself placed that decision, shews that it can have no weight in this country. He says \u201c The custom of a particular place may rectify what otherwise would be imprudence or folly. The lease being by deed does not vary the case. The custom does not alter or contradict the agreement in the lease; it only superadds a right which is consequential to the taking.\u201d I entirely concur in the correctness of this opinion, as applied to a case in <em>England. </em>But it is correct, not on the ground of direct contract, nor because the parties are presumed to have contracted in reference to the custom: it is correct, because of the force of the custom, as such; for, in England, where they have particular customs, the custom of the county in which the land lies is as much the law of that county, as the common law is the law of the other parts of the country where they have no such particular custom. The particular custom prevents the application of the common law to the county or district in which the custom prevails, by shewing that the common law, as to this subject, never had any existence in that county or district. For, a custom, to be valid, must be as old as the common law; it must be immemorial. And if the particular custom be proved to be immemorial, it necessarily excludes the general custom, or common law; for two opposite and inconsistent customs cannot have immemorially existed, in the same place, and as to the same thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">But the case is widely different in this country. Our ancestors brought with them the common law or general customs of <em>England, </em>but none of the particular customs. The common law became the law of our whole state, and gave the rule to every part of it; and we have seen that, by that law, the offgoing tenant was not entitled to the waygoing crop. Any practice or usage, however general, introduced into this country since its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>settlement, and in opposition to the common law, can have no force on the ground of custom; because it lacks the essential ingredient of a good custom\u2014it is not immemorial. It is clear that it could not have existed at any time, even as a recent custom, until after the settlement of the country, and after the common law had attached to every part of it. And nobody will contend that a recent usage or practice, however general, will change the common law. Nor is the case of the plaintiff in error helped by the argument, that the custom, although not obligatory as such, may nevertheless be looked to as having been within the contemplation of the parties at the time they contracted, and may therefore be regarded as an exponent of the contract. The principle of explaining a written instrument by parol testimony, applies to those cases only where there is some latent ambiguity in the written instrument, or where its terms have not a definite legal signification. <em>Bowyer </em>v. <em>Martin &amp;c. </em>6 Rand. 525. Here there is no ambiguity, no uncertainty, no doubt whatever. It is nothing more nor less than a lease for a period fixed and certain, when the interest of the tenant is to cease and determine. To extend it beyond that period by parol testimony, is contrary to received principles, and utterly inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">I am clearly of opinion that the plaintiff in error was not entitled to the waygoing crop; and this point being decided against him, it is equally clear that the county court ought to have given all the instructions moved for by the defendant in error. It may seem, at first view, that the third instruction is improper, as interfering with the province of the jury in deciding on the weight of testimony. But I do not think it liable to that objection. The court was not called on to say what facts were proved, but merely to say what the law would be on facts stated.</p>\n<p id=\"A_N\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>I am for affirming the judgment of the circuit superiour court.</p>\n<p id=\"A8Pl\">The other judges concurring, judgment of circuit court affirmed. ^</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
