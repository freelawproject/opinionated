The survey upon the entry was made, by <em>Preston </em>in person, on the 5th October 1798. This survey having been returned to the register\u2019s office, a grant was issued for the land to <em>Donndl, </em>on the 8th July 1800. And <em>Donndl, </em>by deed of bargain and sale dated the 6th day of October 1814, conveyed the land so granted to him, to <em>Preston.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-15\">Meantime, a survey of 330 acres, part of the same land located by <em>Donnell, </em>was made by an assistant surveyor of <em>Preston, </em>the surveyor of the county, for <em>James </em>and <em>Samuel Braden; but it </em>appeared, the <em>Bradens </em>had made no entry for the land so surveyed for them, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>no such entry could be found. This survey was dated the 22nd March 1790; and having been returned to the regi\u00bfter\u2019s \u00b0^ce&gt; a grant \u00b0f this land issued upon it to the <em>Bradens, </em>on the 22nd May 1793. And by deed of bargain and sale, dated the 19th August 1794, and immediately recorded, the <em>Bradens </em>conveyed the 330 acres of land so granted to them, to <em>William King </em>now deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-6\">The bill was exhibited by <em>Donnell </em>and <em>Preston, </em>in 1815, setting forth the facts above stated, and shewing further, that <em>Donnell </em>had, in fact, sold <em>Preston only </em>an undivided moiety of the 600 acres granted to him, soon after he obtained his grant, and had constituted <em>Preston </em>his agent to take care of his rights and interests in the other moiety thereof, and all other lands held by him in that part of <em>Virginia; </em>that <em>Donnell </em>had been in actual possession of the land, from July 1800, the date of the grant thereof to him, and he and <em>Preston </em>were still in possession; that the survey made for the <em>Bradens </em>in March 1790, not being founded on any previous entry or location, was therefore illegal and fraudulent, and, consequently, the grant issued to them upon that survey in May 1793, was surreptitiously and fraudulently obtained ; and that the land lying contiguous to <em>King\u2019s </em>salt works near <em>Abingdon, </em>and the wood upon it being very valuable, the heirs and devisees of <em>King </em>had already cut and removed large quantities thereof from the land, and were proceeding to cut and remove the residue. Therefore, the bill made the two <em>Bradens, </em>and the widow and the heirs and devisees of <em>King, </em>parties defendants; and prayed a <em>scire facias </em>to repeal the grant of May 1793 to the <em>Bradens; </em>and meantime, that <em>King\u2019s </em>representatives might be restrained, by injunction, from cutting and removing the wood from the land; that they might be compelled to make compensation to the plaintiffs for the wood they had already cut and carried away; that the plaintiffs might be quieted in their title; and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>The heirs of <em>King, </em>in their answer, alleged in the first place, that the 330 acres of land was sold and conveyed by the <em>Bradens </em>to <em>King </em>for 170 dollars, he <em>King </em>having no notice of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim; and then they proceeded to controvert the regulority and legality ol <em>Donnell\u2019s </em>entry, and all the other facts on which they grounded their claim to relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-3\">A gren,t many depositions were taken and filed, but it is not necessary to state the parol evidence, since, without referring to it at all, the questions of law on which the cause was decided are sufficiently presented by the general state of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-4\">The chancellor, declaring that a <em>scire facias </em>to repeal a patent for lands, when prosecuted by an individual, could only be supported by shewixtg a, better equitable right in the plaintiff than in the patentee, and that the plaintiffs here were not. entitled to relief in equity, because they had shewn no good reason why they had not entered a <em>caveat </em>against the grant to <em>Donnell, </em>dismissed the bill; and tlie plaintiffs appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b415-5\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b415-6\">No counsel for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b415-7\">Bb.oo.kenbrough, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ADDi\">If this was a controversy between the appellants and the original grantees, the <em>Bra-dens, </em>I should be strongly inclined to think that the appellants would not be entitled to relief. <em>Donnell </em>was a resident of <em>New Jersey, </em>and <em>Freston </em>the surveyor of <em>Washington </em>county was his agent. It is not perhaps clearly ascertained how far that agency extended; but from the evidence of one of the witnesses, and from a question which <em>Preston </em>put to him, it ma.y bo fairly inferred, that <em>Donnell </em>either lodged his warrants with <em>Preston </em>to make locations for him, or at least, that <em>Donnell </em>having made the locations, he made <em>Preston </em>his agent for making surveys on the entries, and carrying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>the surveys into grant. . The entry made by or for <em>Don- &lt; neM </em>f\u00b0r the 600 acre tract, bears date the 29th April 1783 ; no survey was made on it till 1798, and no grant issued thereon till 1800. Meanwhile, the <em>Bradens </em>caused their survey for 330 acres to be made in March 1790; thisn survey was. made by an assistant of <em>Preston, </em>and was placed iri the book of surveys; and <em>Preston </em>must be presumed to have had full notice of this survey, thus recorded on his own book. If it interfered with the land which <em>Donnell </em>had located seven years before, why did he not, as the <em>agent </em>of <em>Donnell, </em>cause a <em>caveat </em>to be entered against the emanation of a grant ? The plaintiffs allege no reason in their bill, why a <em>caveat </em>was not entered, nor do they allege or prove any actual fraud practised by the <em>Bradens </em>in obtaining their patent of 1793. According to the authority of <em>Noland </em>v. <em>Cromwell, </em>4 Munf. 155. and the subsequent cases, I apprehend they shew no ground for relief from a court of equity. Again, more than twenty-five years elapsed from the date of <em>Braden\u2019s </em>survey to <em>the </em>exhibition of the bill, whose object is to repeal the grant founded on that survey. If the plaintiffs had had the legal title to the land, they could not have maintained ejectment for it against the tenants in possession, after such a length of time; and on analogous principles, they ought not, I think, to be allowed to set up an equitable right ac-, quired thirty-two years before the suit brought, against the legal title of the grantees.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">\u25a0 Such are my strong impressions. But whether they are correct or not, I am of opinion that <em>King, </em>the purchaser from the grantees, without notice of the latent equity of <em>Donnell, </em>ought to be protected in his purchase; and that that defence may be made by answer as well as by plea. The heirs of <em>King </em>do rely on that defence, in their answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">I am for affirming the decree.</p>\n<author id=\"b417-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A0K\">Upon a careful examination of this record, the plaintiffs\u2019 cause wore an unfavourable aspect to my mind; and I doubted very much whether they ought to succeed in setting aside the older grant to the <em>Bradens. </em>The circumstances which produced this impression, were\u20141. The long lapse of time between <em>Donnell's </em>entry and his survey, the first in 1783, the last in 1798\u2014 fifteen years; and then two years more before he obtained his grant. <em>2. </em>The suspicion raised by the proofs, that the surveyor of the county was interested in the entry and survey. 3. The bill is filed by two plaintiffs, <em>Donnell </em>and <em>Preston, </em>as joint owners of the 600 acres, when the deed produced to support the claim is a deed by which <em>Donnell </em>conveys the whole land to <em>Preston. </em>4. The facts that in 1790 the plaintiff <em>Preston, </em>as surveyor of the county, surveyed 330 acres of the tract before entered with him by <em>Donnell, </em>for the <em>Bradens, </em>without any entry made by them (as he now asserts); which survey was carried into grant in 1793, and the land sold by the <em>Bradens to King </em>in 1794, and the deed put on record immediately; 'and in 1814 (twenty years after), this 600 acres, including the 330 sold to <em>King, </em>is bought by <em>Preston </em>of <em>Donnell. </em>These facts, I sa,y, produced an unfavourable impression on my mind against the plaintiffs\u2019 claim : but still I doubted strongly, whether the ground taken by the chancellor could be supported. In this state of suspense, a remark of my brother <em>Tucker </em>turned my attention to another consideration : it was this, that if the representatives of <em>King </em>had pleaded that they were purchasers without notice, he should have thought them protected, unless actual notice was proved, because a purchaser from an elder grantee ought not to be affected with constructive notice of priority of entry. Returning to the examination of the record 1 found, not indeed a plea, but an allegation in the answer, that the 330 acres of land granted to the <em>Bradens </em>was sold and conveyed by them to <em>King, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number><em>he havins; no notice of the claim of the plaintiffs. </em>Here is a positive allegation o\u00ed a purchase and conveyance lor a valuable consideration without notice, twenty years prior to the acquisition of title by the plaintiff <em>Preston. </em>And I find by examination of the authorities, that this is a defence which may be made by answer, as well as plea; indeed, a plea is an answer in another form, putting the defence upon a particular point, to save expense and delay. Thus, in Mitf. Plead. 177. it is said\u2014\u201cWhen an objection to a bill is not apparent on the bill itself, if the defendant means to taire advantage of it, <em>he </em>ought to shew to the court the matter which creates the objection, either by answer or by plea, which has been defined a special answer shewing and relying upon one or more things, as a cause why the suit should be either dismissed, delayed or barredfor which Pract. <em>Reg. 273. </em>is cited. In <em>Roche </em>v. <em>Morgell, 2 </em>Scho. &amp; Lef. 721. lord <em>Redesdale </em>remarked that a plea was a special answer to a bill, differing in this from an answer in the common form, as it demanded the judgment of the court, in the first instance, whether the special matter urged by it did not debar the plaintiff from his title to that answer which the bill required. So, <em>Beames </em>in his Pleas in Equity, p. 253. after treating at large on the plea of purchaser without notice, and pointing out the niceties of the plea, says\u2014\u201c It would seem that the difficulties of the plea of purchaser for valuable consideration without notice, as a mode of defence, may be avoided by adopting the more common mode of defence by way of answer; the proposition, that if a defendant answer he must answer fully, having for one of its excepted cases, that of a purchaser for valuable consideration without noticeciting <em>Stephens </em>v. <em>Gaule, 2 </em>Vern. 701. <em>Jerrard </em>v. <em>Saunders, 2 </em>Ves. jun. 454. <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Teed, </em>15 Ves. 372. 378. 1 Ball &amp; Beatt. 325. 2 Id. 303. I have examined the three first of these cases, and find them full to the point; making the defence of purcha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>ser without notice in the answer, and the defence in that form expressly held good by the court. The same has been our course too; 2 Rob. Pract. 807. and in addition to the cases there cited, <em>Doswell </em>v. <em>Buchanan, </em>3 Leigh 365. Here, then, is not only a good but a highly favoured defence, well <em>made; </em>and in the whole record there is not a <em>scintilla </em>of evidence to fix even a suspicion of actual notice on <em>King. </em>Nor is it a case for constructive notice, as no one can suppose it the duty of a purchaser, who sees his vendor with the grant of the commonwealth in his hands, to search the surveyor\u2019s office, to ascertain whether there may not be in existence an inchoate equitable title to the same land. Upon this ground, I am clearly of opinion that the decree should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b419-4\">Cabeul, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A5x\">I concur. It is unnecessary to inquire what might be the result of this controversy, if the only parties to it were the original conflicting grantees of the land or their legal representatives. There are other parties. <em>King </em>was a purchaser from the elder grantees, for valuable consideration, without notice of any objection to their title ; and that fact is sufficiently stated and relied upon in the answer. I think it manifest, that such a purchaser is not bound to go behind the patent, and to assure himself that there is no irregularity or objection in or to the patent. The exhibition of the commonwealth\u2019s grant is a warrant for his purchase, unless he has notice of some objection to the patent, or of the equitable claim of some other person.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b419-5\">Ttjckeb, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A_2\">I concur with the chancellor, that under the statute for the regulation of the <em>scire facias </em>to repeal a patent, an equitable title must be shewn in the party prosecuting the petition, where it is sued out by a private individual, and not <em>ex officio </em>by the officers of the commonwealth. The language of the statute puts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>this beyond doubt, and its purpose is commendable and <em>* </em>judicious. If, therefore, the appellants have not an equitable title against the appellees, the <em>scire facias </em>must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"AoA\">\u2022 -ft cann\u00b0t be denied, that the want of an entry on the part of the grantees under whom <em>King\u2019s </em>heirs clairb, would have been fatal to their title, had it been contested by a <em>caveat. </em>The entry of <em>Donnell, </em>which has not been successfully assailed, must have prevailed over the irregular and unauthorized survey of the <em>Bra-dens. </em>Nor\" do I think a failure to <em>caveat </em>would have debarred the appellants from asserting their equity in a court of chancery, as against the grantees, as the want of an entry was, in my opinion, an ample excuse for that failure. The adventurer who has made his entry has indeed always been held to be affected by constructive notice of the entries appearing upon the book of entries. Until he has completed his own works, and perfected his title by a grant, it is his business to look to that book, to see who interferes with his pretensions, and to arrest by <em>caveat </em>the surveying and patenting of a junior interfering location. And when the book of entries exhibits no such interference, when upon examination- there appears to be no adversary claim, he is justified in presuming that there is no junior locator to contend with. The attempt to procure a survey and patent without a previous entry, thus operates a fraud upon the prior adventurer, who is lulled into security by-this gross violation of the provisiqns of the land law, and fil\u00e9s no <em>caveat </em>to the proceeding, because he is ignorant of its existence. This constitutes such a fraud as to give jurisdiction to a court of equity, and to take the case out of tlie operation of the doctrine of that class of cases of which <em>Noland </em>v. <em>Cromwell </em>is at the head; and as against the <em>grantees, </em>and all persons claiming under them with actual notice of the junior grantee\u2019s equitable title, that title would prevail. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>not so as to purchasers without actual notice. Purchasers from patentees are not bound to look behind their own or antagonizing patents, to sec what might have been the state of equities between them. The book of entries is presumptive notice to aLl adventurers in their progress to a patent, but it would be greatly mischievous if purchasers under a patent were held to be affected by constructive notice of a prior entry. If the first purchaser would be so affected, every successive purchaser would be affected also, until the benign influence of the equitable limitation should conclude the assertion of such stale and obscure demands. In the case of <em>French </em>v. <em>Loyal Company, 5 </em>Leigh 627. I have presented the reasons which suggested themselves in support of this doctrine, and to them I refer.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">In the present case, the defendants allege that <em>King\u2019s </em>purchase and acquisition of title were without notice of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. The allegation is indeed set forth in the answer, and not by way of plea; but the industry of my brother <em>Carr </em>has presented a train of authorities, which shew that the defence may well be insisted on by way of answer. There is not, in the record, the slightest attempt to prove notice, so that the defence stands uncontradicted and unimpugned. The consequence is, that the decree is right and must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
