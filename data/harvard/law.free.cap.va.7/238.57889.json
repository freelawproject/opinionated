That <em>Carson </em>performed the service of general superintendant of all <em>Morgan's </em>plantations for three years, and charged for this service 300 dollars a year, which was a reasonable charge. That <em>Carson </em>during. the time sold <em>Morgan </em>tobacco, and <em>Morgan </em>paid some debts for him, which transactions were stated in an account rendered by <em>Morgan, </em>in which, however, no credit was allowed <em>Carson </em>for his three years services. That allowing <em>Carson </em>such credit for his services, <em>Morgan </em>would be indebted to him, on a fair settlement of accounts, above 200 dollars. That nevertheless, <em>Morgan </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>having acquired a bond, which <em>Carson </em>had executed to \u2022 other persons for 313 dollars, had brought suit upon the same against Carson, and recovered a judgment. That <em>Carson </em>would have defended himself in that suit at law; but, thinking that the suit had been brought in the circuit court of <em>Campbell, </em>he retained counsel to defend him there; who, not finding the suit on the docket of that court, applied for information to <em>Morgan\u2019s </em>attorney, and learned from him that the suit was in the county court; whereupon it was agreed that the suit should be transferred to the circuit court, but before the next ensuing term of the circuit court, an office judgment was confirmed in the county court. Therefore, the bill called for a discovery of the contracts between the parties, and prayed an injunction to stay proceedings on <em>Morgan\u2019s </em>judgment at law', and a decree for the balance due to <em>Carson </em>on the account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-5\">The injunction was awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-6\"><em>Morgan </em>made no objection to the jurisdiction of the court of chancery, but in his answer defended himself upon the merits; giving a different account, in many particulars, of the contracts between him and <em>Carson </em>for <em>Carson\u2019s </em>services as his overseer and as general superintenda.nt of his plantations, and insisting that the compensation <em>Carson </em>claimed for the latter was unreasonable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-7\">Many depositions were taken and filed, all relating to the merits of the ^controversy. But there was no evidence proving the. facts alleged in the bill, to account for and excuse the failure of <em>Carson </em>to defend himself in the suit at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-8\">The chancellor referred the accounts to a commissioner ; and upon his report, decreed, that the injunction should be perpetuated, and that <em>Morgan </em>should pay <em>Carson 26 </em>dollars with interest &amp;c. and the costs of suit. From which decree <em>Morgan </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A7s\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>The cause was argued here by <em>Johnson </em>for the appellanl, and <em>Robinson </em>for the appellee, upon an objection taken by <em>Johnson </em>to the jurisdiction of the court of chancery; because, as he insisted, the plaintiff might either have defended himself at law, and had not proved the excuse he alleged for his failure to do so, or he had a complete remedy at law by action of <em>assumpsit </em>on a <em>quantum meruit </em>for his services. <em>Robinson </em>argued, on the contrary, that the bill stated a case proper for relief in equity; and that, as the defendant had nowise objected to the jurisdiction, so as to call for proof of any fact necessary to sustain it, but had defended himself on the merits, the chancellor at the hearing, and much more this court, could pay no regard to the objection. He referred to 1 Rev. Code, ch. 66. \u00a7 S6. p. 214. and cited <em>Briclchouse </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>4 Hen. &amp; Munf. 363. <em>Hide-man </em>v. <em>Stout, </em>2 Leigh 6. <em>Vanl\u00e9w </em>v. <em>Bohannan, </em>4 Rand. 537. The facts alleged in the bill to excuse the failure of the plaintiff in equity to defend himself in the suit at law, not being denied, proof of them was not necessary ; <em>Page\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>Winston\u2019s adm\u2019r, </em>2 Munf. 298.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b260-4\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A-L\">The value of the appellee\u2019s services was the only matter in litigation in this case; and I am clearly of opinion, that it would have been much better settled had he brought his suit at law, than it can be before a commissioner of the court of chancery. Were the case properly in court, I should think that an issue should have been directed rather than an account. It is not, in short, a case for an account, and therefore this court has not jurisdiction of it. It is a simple question of <em>quantum meruit, </em>which is always best settled by a jury of the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">There are two grounds on which it was contended that a court of equity has jurisdiction of the case. The first is, that the plaintiff had a good defence at law, which he was prevented from making by surprize or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>accident. But this cannot avail him, because the facts . , \u201e ,, <em>1 </em>he states were, if true, clearly susceptible o\u00ed proof, and that proof has not been adduced. In this regard, then, the case stands nakedly thus\u2014that the plaintiff seeks here to arrest a judgment at law, upon a ground of defence which might have availed him in a court of law, and which he neglected to make. Such an attempt cannot receive the countenance of this court. A long train of decisions, no longer necessary to be cited or reviewed, leaves us no room for hesitation in dismissing such a case from the equitable forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">The second ground on which the jurisdiction was supposed to rest, is the character of the demand. And here, I readily admit, that if the court had jurisdiction of the subject or demand, though it was improper to award an injunction, yet the court might properly proceed with the cause, provided the right of the party was not concluded by the trial at law. I am inclined to think, in this case, it was not so concluded. My impression is, that the demand of <em>Carson </em>against <em>Morgan </em>was not a good legal set-off; for unliquidated damages are not a matter of set-off at law, more than in equity. And, moreover, a defendant has the election either to set off his demand, or if he prefers it, to institute his cross action. The omission of Carson, then, to sot off his claim for services did not conclude his right to recover the value of them. But the question recurs, whether this demand was a proper subject of equitable jurisdiction ? I think it was not. It is an action in equity for damages, arising, indeed, out of a contract, but still a naked action for damages. This cannot be sustained in equity. In <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Hogsheads, </em>3 Leigh 667. 673. it was said\u2014\u201c A bill for damages only will not lie in equity. The court could only ascertain these damages by sending the case to a court of law. To that court, therefore, the party should apply, instead of clogging the litigation by a suit in equity, which could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>only end where he ought to have begun. Would it be jusb defendants should be charged with the costs of this unnecessary proceeding?\u201d Ought the suitor to be permitted to go through the court of chancery, to get into the court of law, instead of going into the court of law at once ? Surely, this would be a gross abuse in any system of jurisprudence. Again, in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Maries, </em>2 Rand. 449. a bill was filed by a carpenter against his employer, to recover the balance due him for building a house. Now, this was exactly like the case at bar, which is for services performed as an <em>overseer. </em>Both are cases of <em>quantum meruit. </em>In that case, judge <em>Carr, </em>delivering the opinion of the court, observed\u2014\u201c In the case before us, I think a court of law can not only give a remedy, but a more complete remedy than a court of equity. It is a simple matter of contract and work and labour. The plaintiff says, he has built the house according to contract and must be paid. The'defendant says, he has done his work badly,\u201d [so says <em>Morgan </em>here] \u201chas broken his contract, and has received as much as he deserves. Now, this seems to me a case peculiarly apt for the decision of a jury .of the country; men who understand these matters, and who, with the witnesses before them, with counsel to assist, and a court to superintend the whole, would settle fairly such a matter as this in one hour : whereas in equity, it has been depending nineteen years. The commissioner charges for 76 hours, making a fee of 57 dollars. The record is stuffed with innumerable depositions, and the costs of the whole cannot be less than 200 dollars. Is not this monstrous ?\u201d Accordingly, this court affirmed the chancellor\u2019s decree dismissing the bill, and turning the party round, after nineteen years, to begin <em>de novo </em>at- law. It cannot but strike the most careless observer, that every word in this opinion tells in its application to the assertion, in a court of equity, of <em>Carson\u2019s </em>demand for compensation as an over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>seer. The cases are, in the view we are now taking, altogether parallel, and this must share the fate which overtook that after a fruitless race of nineteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">I am of opinion, therefore, that the decree be reversed, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">The other judges concurred. Care, <em>J. </em>added, (by way, he said, of exclusion of a conclusion) that he did not think the excuse alleged in the bill for the failure to make defence at la,w, would have been sufficient to sustain the jurisdiction, even if it had been proved, which it was not. The case was <em>assumpsit </em>on a <em>(quantum, meruit </em>for work and labour done, and was altogether unfit for a court of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">Decree reversed, and bill dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
