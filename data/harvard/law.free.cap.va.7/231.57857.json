The county court dismissed the motion. The plaintiffs filed a bill of exceptions, and appealed to the circuit court; which reversed the judgment, and remanded the cause to the county court for further proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A46\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Upon the second hearing of the motion in the county <em>, </em>court, <em>Chaplina </em>shewed, that no specific appropriation fiad been made of the moneys in his hands as an overseer of the poor, to his successors in office; and, on this ground, he again objected, that the plaintiffs could not maintain this motion. The plaintiffs insisted, that they were entitled to the motion, because the statute gave it to them,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and because the circuit court had decided the point. The county court overruled this objection of Ghapline, and entertained the motion; to which <em>Chap-line </em>excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-15\">Then, by consent, \u201c all matters in dispute between the parties in the cause were referred to arbitrators,\u201d whose award should be entered as the judgment of the court.

But the defendant shewed that the plaintiffs were not now overseers of the poor, their term of office having expired pending the motion, and successors having been regularly elected and appointed; and he moved the court to enter an abatement of the plaintiffs\u2019 motion. But the court overruled the objection, and gave judgment for the plaintiffs according to the award. <em>Chap-line </em>again excepted. And he took an appeal from the judgment to the circuit court, which affirmed it; and then he appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b252-17\"><em>Campbell, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b252-18\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b252-20\">See 2 Rev.

The first point to be established in this case, is the character of the overseers of the poor. By the act of May 17S0, ch. 22. 10 Hen. stat. at large, pp. 288-9. the overseers of the poor were commanded to be elected, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>and were declared to be a body politic and corporate, to sue and be sued, and were invested with the powers and duties of former churchwardens and vestries. This character they still retain. INext, if we advert to the law as to churchwardens, we find that they are a <em>quasi </em>corporation with power to sue and be sued, 1 Blacks. Cotnra. 394. and that succeeding churchwardens may bring an action of account against their predecessors at common law, 1 Bac. Abr. Churchwardens. E. p. 604. Moreover, though churchwardens cannot commence a suit in their own names after their year is out, yet if a suit was begun within their year, tiiey might proceed with it after their year was out; \u201c it being <em>ex necessitate </em>to prevent people from delays in order to wear out the <em>year Dent </em>v. <em>Prudence, 2 </em>Stra. 852. Thus an answer is at once afforded to most of the questions in this case. The overseers of the poor can sue their predecessors ; and the statute gives them the summary remedy by motion. The proceeding does not abate by the expiration of their office, but may go on in their names to a recovery, for the amount of which they in turn will be accountable to their successors. Being a corporation capable to sue, they moreover have power to submit to arbitration; for it is a general principle, that whoever can contract can submit; and, indeed, in general, wdioever can sue is entitled to submit except those who cannot contract. As to the errors in judgment of the arbitrators, I perceive none upon the face of the award ; and even if there were any, it is well established, that where a matter of law is referred, the parties must abide by the decision though erroneous; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>4 Rand. 95. 6 Ves. 282. 9 Ves. 364. And as to the facts, the court by the reference is divested of all judgment as to them; per lord commissioner <em>Eyre </em>in <em>Dick </em>v. <em>Milligan, 2 </em>Ves. jr. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
