Code, ch. 128. \u00a7 37. pp. 496,7.) against <em>J^elia </em>and <em>Mary Ann Wilson, </em>his devisees, who also appeared and pleaded the general issue, and put themselves upon the title, in the usual foi*m.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-21\">At the trial, the defendants, in order to prove that <em>John Bartle, </em>a deputy of <em>Beverley Booth </em>sheriff of <em>Surry, </em>had sold the land for which the action was brought, to <em>Walter Coche, </em>under whom the defendants claimed, offered in evidence a copy of a deed dated the 31st <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>August 1815, purporting to be a deed of <em>Booth </em>the sheriff to Cocke, by which,\u2014after reciting that the land had been returned delinquent for non-payment of taxes for the year 1798, in the name of <em>Benjamin Atkinson, </em>which-taxes with <em>ten per centum per annum </em>damages thereon amounted to <em>forty-eight cents, </em>and that <em>Booth </em>the sheriff had, in pursuance of the statute of the 9th February 1814 \u201c concerning taxes on lands,\u201d after due advertisement according to the statute, offered for sale at public auction, at <em>Surry </em>August court 1815, so much of the land as would satisfy the taxes in arrear and the damages,\u2014at which sale <em>Cocke </em>became the purchaser of the whole <em>tract,\u2014Booth, </em>in consideration of the premises, and of the sum of <em>forty-eight cents </em>paid him by <em>Cocke, </em>conveyed the whole tract to him in fee ; but this deed was executed, not by <em>Booth, </em>but by \u201c <em>Bartle </em>deputy for <em>Booth </em>sheriff,\u201d and was recorded on <em>Bartle's </em>acknowledgment thereof as his own act and deed. Whereupon, the plaintiff objected to the admission of the deed as evidence, and the court sustained the objection, on the ground that the deed was not the deed of <em>Bartle; </em>and the defendants excepted to the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-3\">There was a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff, from which the defendants appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b43-4\"><em>Allison, </em>for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5H\">said there was no doubt, that under the statute of February 1814, a deputy sheriff, as well as his principal, was authorized to sell, and to convey, lands forfeited for non-payment of taxes; <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>2 Leigh 329. But though this was a mere ministerial act, to which the deputy was competent, yet, as in all like cases, the deputy was bound to proceed in <em>the </em>name of his principal. And this was what had been done in this case: the deputy had sold in the name of the sheriff, as he ought, and then conveyed in his name, and executed the conveyance for him.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b43-6\">\n<em>Johnson, contra,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqH\">maintained, that <em>the </em>instrument in question was not the deed of either <em>Booth </em>the sheriff or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>of <em>Bartle </em>the deputy; not of <em>Booth, </em>for he did not exec,ute it; not of <em>Bartle, </em>for though he executed it, the deed recited that the land had been sold by <em>Booth, </em>and purported to be the conveyance of <em>Booth. </em>Though a deputy sheriff may sell and convey lands forfeited for taxes, under authority of the statute, this was not one of those ministerial functions, which, by the common law, a deputy sheriff might perform for and in the name of his principal, but a special agency for the commonwealth, confided to the sheriff, or to his deputy, by the statute. If the sheriff made the sale, he alone could make the conveyance; if the deputy made the sale, he alone was the proper person to convey: <em>Roclcbold </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>3 Rand. 474.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b44-4\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"APvS\">These sales and purchases founded on forfeitures, deserve no indulgence from the court. It is, therefore, the well settled law, that he who claims under a forfeiture must shew that the law has been exactly complied with. Here, a tract of land forfeited, as it is said, for non-payment of taxes, is bought for <em>forty-eight cents. </em>The sale is m\u00e1de by the sheriff; the deed purports to be made by <em>him; </em>but his <em>deputy </em>executes it. The court refused to let this deed go to the jury; and I think properly. The law, I think, never meant, that where the sale had been made by the sheriff, the deed could be made by one of his deputies. The case of <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Bennett </em>has decided (and I believe properly) that a deputy, where he has sold, may convey; but this is a different case. And here, it will be remarked, he has acknowledged the deed as his own. I think the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Brockenbrough, Cabell and Brooke, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b44-6\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ArX\">I also concur. The case of <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Bennett </em>has settled the point, that under the act of 1814, a deputy sheriff is competent to sell and make a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>valid conveyance of lands returned delinquent for non- \u2022 i i payment of taxes. But, without controverting that decisi\u00f3n, I think it may be safely affirmed, that the sale and conveyance must be made by the same person. It would be altogether irregular to permit the deputy to convey what had been sold by the sheriff or the sheriff to convey what had been sold by the deputy. Admitting that the law has authorized either to act, which we must do under the above cited decision, yet there is nothing in the law from which we can fairly infer, that the legislature designed to introduce the confusion of permitting the sale of one to be completed by the conveyance of the other. So far from it, the statute requires the officer \u201c to execute a deed to the purchaser at the sale, reciting the circumstances thereof;\u201d a requisition which fortifies the natural supposition, that he who makes the sale is to make the title. In this case, the sale is recited to have been made by the sheriff and the grant or conveyance purports to have been made by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Yet the deed is signed by the deputy and acknowledged by him, not as the act of the sheriff but as the act of the deputy himself. It is not necessary to decide whether he could have acknowledged it as the act and deed of <em>Booth; </em>which I very much doubt, as it is contrary to received principles, that one man should execute a deed for another without authority by deed. But as the deed is only acknowledged by the deputy as his own deed, and contains no grant or conveyance from him, and as indeed he could not lawfully convey what the sheriff himself had sold, I think the deed was properly rejected. I will add, that these laws of forfeiture ought to be strictly construed, and that there should be no leaning in favour of a transaction, by which a tract of thirty acres of land is sacrificed to a purchaser, <em>for forty-eight cents.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
