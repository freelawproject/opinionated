On looking over the record, it appears that the genuineness of the original grant was fully established, and indeed does not seem to be controverted now. The evidence discloses a substantial compliance with the conditions of the grant, and the boundaries of the land are distinctly indicated by natural objects. The land thus bounded has been found, on a survey, to contain less than the quantity called for in the grant. We are unable to discover any reason for refusing to confirm the decree of the commissioners. A decree to that effect must therefore be entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
