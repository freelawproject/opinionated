H. Hempstead, U. S. Dist. Atty.,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5oU\">in his argument in opposition to the motion, insisted on the following points, namely: (1) The law of congress of the 30th of April, 1790, \u00a7 3, declares that the crime of murder shall be punished with death. Gord. Dig. 937 [1 Stat. 113]. (2) That if a statute enacts an offence to be felony, though it may mention nothing of accessories before or after the fact, yet virtually and consequentially they are included. 1 Russ. Crimes, 35; 1 Hale, P. C. 613, 614, 704 ; 3 Inst. 59. (3) That accessories before the fact and principals were subject to capital punishment at common law, and as the above act punishing murder, ex vi termini, embraces accessories according to a well-settled rule of construction; therefore, accessories before the fact must be punishable capitally under that law. 4 Bl. Comm. 39; 3 Inst. 188. (4) That the only reason originally for the distinction between principals and accessories was' the benefit of clergy; but in contemplation of law and morals, the accessory before the fact is guilty of as deep enormity as the actual perpetrator of a murder, and therefore he ought to receive the same punishment. (51 That it cannot be supposed that congress meant to exempt accessories from punish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>ment, and the fact that there is no specific legislation with regard to them is almost conclusive proof that they were intended to he included in the general law against murder, and to receive the same punishment as principals.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b697-3\">JOHNSON, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Akar\">It is true, as urged by the district attorney, that he who advises or counsels the commission of a murder, is, in point of morals, as guilty as the principal, and should, doubtless, be punished accordingly. In legal language, however, he is not guilty of murder, but is only accessory to it; and this distinction is preserved in all the books on criminal jurisprudence. It is said that the act of congress punishing murder necessarily embraces an accessory before the fact, and subjects him to the punishment of death. I cannot assent to the correctness of this position; but, on the contrary, applying the known rule that penal statutes must be construed strictly, I entertain no doubt that the point made by the prisoner\u2019s counsel is well taken and must be sustained. Certainly, to commit the crime of wilful murder, and to be accessory to it, are different of-fences; and in the trial of Burr [Cases Nos. 14,692-14,694a],\u2019 for treason, Chief Justice Marshall very clearly lays down that proposition. That an accessory before the fact ought to be punished will not be questioned by any one, for he is, indeed, frequently involved in deeper guilt than the principal. This is a question, however, for the consideration of the legislative department, and this court is only authorized to try and punish such crimes as congress expressly or by necessary implication have visited with known and certain penalties, and the court has no common law jurisdiction in that respect. The defects in the Criminal Code of the United States, have been severely felt, but it is for congress, not this court, to interpose and apply the corrective; and as I should not feel warranted in pronouncing sentence of death on the prisoner in case of conviction, I shall sustain the motion to quash the indictment, and direct him to be discharged, regretting, at the same time, that there is no law to reach his ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Prisoner discharged accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
