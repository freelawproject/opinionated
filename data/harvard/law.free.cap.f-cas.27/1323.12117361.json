It appeared in evidence that a man named McComb, residing in Delaware, had a contract with the government to furnish so many knapsacks. He accordingly bought the cloth and had it cut, sewed together and painted elsewhere, and then delivered them to the defendants to have them put on the leather straps, buckles, &amp;e., which were necessary to finish them,\u2014the cost of the work which they did being nearly but not quite as much as the cost of what was done before the knapsacks were delivered to them. When they had done their work on them they delivered them to McComb, who delivered them to the government on his contract.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1325-13\">Mr. Smith, U.
