They stated that the first count, was for making a revolt, and confining the captain, which is not described as an offence in the 8th section; although making a revolt, is a capital offence, under the 8th section; and confining the captain, is a misdemeanor, under the 12th section. In like manner, the second count, is for confining the captain, and endeavouring to make a revolt; to which the same exceptions apply. It is essential to justice, that the grand jury should have it in their power, to ignoramus any offence in the indictment, which is not \u25a0 supported by evidence. But if two or more offences, are thus blended together, in one count, they must find the whole, or ignoramus the whole; whereas, if they are arranged in different counts, they may find one a true bill, and ignoramus as to the other. How axe the petty jury, in a case of this kind, to find their verdict? If they say the prisoners are guilty of part of the offence described in one count, and not guilty as to the others; they do not find them guilty \u201cin manner and form;\u201d but where there are different counts, they are the same as different indictments. 4 Hawks, 2.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1048-18\">THE COURT</author>\n<p id=\"A7P-\">decided that the indictment could not be supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-19\">The district attorney entered a nolle prose-qui, as to the defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
