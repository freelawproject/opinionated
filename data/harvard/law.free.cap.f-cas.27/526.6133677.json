' Here Phelps is prosecuted for resisting an inspector of customs, an officer known and described in the law. It does not appear that Cheeseborough was appointed to that office; and although he might have held another office, and how penal soever it might be to resist him, it is clear that this indictment cannot be supported. If Phelps be guilty of any crime it is that of resisting an assistant of a surveyor; but he is charged with a different crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">No other evidence being offered,</p>\n<p id=\"Agp\">THE COURT directed the jury to find the prisoner not guilty, which they did without retiring from their seats.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
