And also gave in evidence to the jury, by the testimony of several underwriters of great experience, that in their judgment the disclosure or non-disclosure of the fact, that the vessel on which insurance is asked, is to be laden entirely of contraband of war, on the voyage insured, would bo wholly immaterial, and would not increase or diminish the premium asked, where the order requests to be insured against contraband, or against all risks.

And <em>the defendants, </em>for the purpose of showing that vessels laden in part with contraband, and destined to ports in <em>Colombia, </em>or other ports in <em>Spanish America, </em>were, when met with by <em>Spanish </em>vessels of war, and privateers, suffered to pi-oceed after taking out the contraband, with the rest of their cargoes being innocent, offered as a witness to the jury, <em>Thomas Parker, </em>President of the <em>Universal </em>Insurance Company, who testified that in May, 1823, the schooner <em>Hunter, Captain Hull, </em>bound from <em>Baltimore </em>to <em>St. Martha, Carthagena, </em>and other places on the <em>Main, </em>partially laden with contraband, was captured by a <em>Spanish </em>privateer, and taken into <em>Havar na, </em>where prize proceedings having been instituted, the contraband articles were condemned, and the residue of the cargo with said schooner released. And also offered as a witness <em>Richard H.

That after-wards, the navy department ordered captain <em>Biddle, </em>of the <em>United States ship Congress, </em>to call at <em>St. Jago, </em>where the said privateer was owned, and interpose a claim for the said money so illegally taken by said privateer. And further offered evidence, that the general impression of merchants and underwriters in <em>Baltimore, </em>at the period when this insurance was made, was, that vessels sailing from the <em>United States </em>to ports in <em>Colombia, </em>and other ports in <em>South America, </em>with cargoes not contraband in whole, or in part, would be permitted to pass and proceed to their respective places of destination without interference, or capture by <em>Spanish </em>privateers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-5\">And thereupon the <em>plaintiffs </em>offered evidence to show, that the general impression of merchants and underwriters in <em>Baltimore </em>was, that vessels sailing from the <em>United States </em>to ports in <em>Colombia, </em>and other ports in <em>South America, </em>with any kind of cargoes, whether contraband or not, were after the proclamation of <em>Morales </em>relative to the blockade, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>as hereinbefore referred to, captured by <em>Spanish </em>privateers, and condemned in the <em>Spanish </em>tribunals. And also offered in evidence by <em>John D. </em>Da\u00f1\u00e9is, that the port of <em>La G\u00fcira, </em>from the 1st of October, 1832, to the 1st day of January, 1823, was never blockaded in fact, and that during that period the <em>Colombian </em>squadron had a decided ascendancy in that neighborhood. And the defendants gave in evidence that the said ship <em>Budget </em>was not a remarkably last sailer, and that the rates of premiums on vessels, proceeding from ports in the <em>United States, </em>to ports in the government of <em>Colombia, </em>with cargoes of contraband, were from six to seven and a half per cent., but that the vessels so insured were remarkably fast sailing vessels, and were of a class generally named clippers, and built expressly for the purpose of such voyages. And they further gave in evidence that the risk of a contraband cargo carried in such a ship as the <em>Budget, </em>from <em>London </em>to the ports of <em>La Gvkra </em>and <em>Porto Cabello, </em>would be much greater than in these fast sailing <em>American </em>vessels, going from ports in the <em>United States </em>in similar cases, to the said last mentioned ports. And the defendants further gave in evidence, by several underwriters of great experience, that underwriters, in calculating their premiums <em>on </em>orders of insurance, do not estimate the risk as the worst possible which can arise under such order, and charge accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-5\">And thereupon <em>the defendants, </em>by their counsel prayed the court to instruct the jury\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-6\">1.

Which instructions, and each of them, the court refused to give. The defendants excepted.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-5\">Upon these prayers Aechisk, Oh. J. delivered the following opinion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-6\">Many very important principles of insurance necessarily arise in this case, and have been very ably and learnedly discussed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-7\">The first question to which our attention will be directed, will be the existence or non-existence of a warranty of neutrality, or of a representation of neutrality.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-8\">The order for insurance containing the alleged representation, being referred to in the policy, and by such reference, constituting a part of the policy, whatever obligation it may create, would be considered rather in the light of an express Avarranty, which would require a strict performance than of a mere representation, which would only demand a substantial compliance with its terms.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-9\">It is conceded, that there exists in the order, no direct Avarranty of neutrality, but it is contended, that if one arises by necessary implication from the words used, an express warranty is created. We admit this doctrine, and shall examine the order to ascertain whether these inferences contended for, are necessarily deducible from it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>This order demands an insurance against <em>all risks, </em>and then merely speaks <em>of a possible danger of contraband. </em>The amount of it then, is only this, \u201c I apprehend danger from the peculiar voyage, guard me against every possible risk. I am ignorant of the hazard I run, for my advices are silent on the subject; my fear is, of the possibility of contraband, but you know the nature and course of the trade; as you are to cover all risks, secure yourself by an adequate premium.\u201d There is no assertion that contraband would be on board, the possibility only is asserted. If a vessel be stated to be <em>American, </em>there is. in general, a warranty that she is <em>American, </em>and all the just inferences, and legal consequences which are deducible from such an assertion, flow necessarily; she must be navigated, and documented, as the laws of her nation demand. So, to say, that she sails with a sea letter is a warranty. But it must be observed, that in both these cases there <em>is the positive averment of a fact. </em>In this case, there is no such positive averment. That which is stated, is stated <em>dubiously. </em>She may <em>possibly carry contraband, </em>but whether she will or not, the assured\u2019s advices are silent, or in other words, the they are ignorant of the fact. Can it then be seriously contended, that they meant to warrant as a fact, that which they apprize the office, they know nothing about ? Where is the case to be found which decides that the assertion, <em>she may possibly be an American, </em>she <em>may possibly carry a sea letter, </em>amounts to a warranty ? None such have been cited, pone such exist; to infer a warranty from such a statement, would be to make a contract for the assured, where they never intended to make one for themselves. The ship being in fact an <em>American, </em>and the owners residents and citizens of this place, can make no possible difference, because her national character is not pointed to in the policy by any express designation, and the policy is <em>\u201cfor whom it may </em>concern.\u201d That is, it is for the plaintiffs, if they are then the owners, or any body else, neutral or belligerent, who might then be the owner, and for whom the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>plaintiffs may have been the agents. The' expression, \u201c <em>lo he paid to them in case of a loss\u201d </em>amounts to nothing against this view. For it might have amounted to a mere direction to the office to pay them in the character of agents, if in fact, such agency had existed, in order that in such a case, they might be the more effectually indemnified in the event of loss, for <em>the </em>advance, not only of this premium, but of the balance of other premiums, which may have been advanced as a general agent for effecting insurances, for which advance and balance they would have had an unquestionable lien, as against their principal upon the policy itself. But if these words are interpreted to mean, that the insurance was, at all events, effected for them and them only; <em>then the words ufor whom it concerns\u201d </em>are contradicted, or they must be treated as if they constituted no part of the stipulation. The rule of interpretation, as we have always understood it to be, is, that you must so construe an instrument, that every word, if possible, shall have its appropriate meaning, and this we do in this instance, without violating or discarding any portion of the instrument. In aid of this view of the clause referred to, we cannot fail to remark the <em>commercial understanding </em>of the word contraband, as proved by one of the witnesses, that it was considered rather as having a reference to the kind, and description of the cargo, than the national character of its owner, or of the peaceful or belligerent relation of his government towards other powers. There is then no warranty of neutrality, and considering the representation as incorporated in the policy, and constituting a part of it, there exists of course no representation of neutrality.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-5\">This leads us to the inquiry of the extent of the risk covered by this policy. The words of the policy look <em>per se, </em>to a promise of indemnity for all losses except those proceeding from illicit or prohibited trade; it covers the risks of neutral ownership, and of belligerent ownership. We mean the ordinary risks of such an ownership, for perhaps there may be some belligerent risks, so extremely ha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>zardous, imminent and extraordinary, as that they could not be presumed to have entered into the contemplation of the parties, and where of course concealment might he held to vitiate the policy. But in the absence of such uncommon peculiar perils, the assurer shall, in the general phraseology he has used, be presumed to have contemplated the possibility of the greatest risk, and if they have not done so by demanding a premium commensurate with their contract, it is their own fault, and they shall not in a court of justice be permitted to seek shelter under their own neglect, from the fulfilment of their express stipulation. And here we may be permitted to say, that the interpretation of this instrument is a question for our consideration exclusively. The same rules apply to a policy, as to all other instruments. It must be expounded by principles of law, and not by the opinions of witnesses. It is true, that where the usage of trade has assigned meaning to particular words, the courts will resort to such usage to assist them in the interpretation, and to enable them to effectuate the intention of the parties. But the assured cannot escape from a legal responsibility, change, modify or alter it, by seeking refuge in the varying opinions of commercial men, when they expressly say, they assume all risks, and no warranty exists that will justify us in limiting their responsibility. Had <em>Thompson and </em>Bathurst, instead of acting for themselves, been agents of the subjects of a belligerent nation, there can be no doubt that the policy covered such belligerent property, and the ordinary risks to which it would have been subjected. It was true she was registered as an <em>American </em>ship, but the assurer had no right to look at this without a warranty or representation, for they might before the date of such policy have sold her to such belligerent, or had they been in treaty by their agent in <em>London </em>for the sale of this vessel to a belligerent, for whom they had orders in case of a purchase to insure, and <em>Thompson &amp;f Bathurst </em>not in fact knowing whether, at the date of the order for insurance, a sale had been effected or not, and acting in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>pursuance of their agency to cover belligerent ownership, if such should be the fact, or if not, to secure themselves, could there exist a doubt but that the policy would have covered either the belligerent owner, in case of a sale to him, or <em>Thompson Bathurst, </em>-if they had not in fact parted with their property?</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-6\">The doctrine, that in such a policy the risk of belligerent ownership is undertaken, is settled in the Supreme Court of the <em>United States. Hodgson vs. Mar. Ins. Co. of Alexandria, </em>5 <em>Cranch, </em>100. And it is conceded, that the <em>New York </em>decisions have pronounced the assumption of belligerent risks. Nor do we perceive that any of the <em>English </em>decisions contradict in this doctrine; certainly those which have been cited by no means impugn it. It is not our intention minutely to analyze all the authorities cited, but it may be briefly remarked, that the following principles are deducible from the cases of <em>Christie vs. Secretan, </em>8 <em>T. R. </em>192. <em>Dawson vs. </em>Atty, 7 <em>East. </em>367, as explained by <em>Lord </em>Ellenborough, in <em>Bell vs. Carstairs, </em>14 <em>East. </em>374. <em>Horneyer vs. Lushington, </em>15 <em>East. </em>46. <em>Oswell vs. Vigne, </em>15 <em>East. </em>74. 1. That although all risks are assured, neutral as well as belligerent, yet the vessel insured must not induce her condemnation, by the absence of documents necessary to attest her national character. 3. That the insurance operates upon the ship whether neutral or belligerent, as she may happen to <em>be at the </em>time <em>of </em>insurance. 3. That a general insurance covers all losses from the perils insured against operating <em>adversely, </em>and not <em>through the medium of any act or neglect </em>on the part of the assured himself, or his agent, producing the loss of the property insured. 4. That for a loss of which the owner or his agent may be the efficient cause, proceeding from his act or neglect, and which-in the captain will not amount to barratry; the owner is his own insurer, <em>and </em>his loss thus occasioned is not covered by the policy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-7\">Are not these doctrines reasonable and just? What i\u00ae more reasonable than to say, that although the contract is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>silent on the subject, it should be construed as having reference to, and operating upon the character and condition of the ship, as it existed in fact at the time the policy was effected? All contracts with regard to property, are undoubtedly made in reference to it, as it exists at the time of the contract, and any change in it, altering its character or its quality, would be a breach of good faith. This principle, as it is founded iii the soundest morality, will be found to pervade every branch of the law as connected With the doctrine of contracts. If the vessel be neutral, it Would be then only in accordance with this universal and obvious principle, to say either, that such her character as it existed in fact, should be maintained, or if forfeited <em>by </em>the act of the assured, he should not make such act the basis of a claim against the insurer. But it may be said, that the highest risk of a belligerent capture is assumed, and so no injury would be done to the insurer. To this however, it may be replied, that this is the chance the insurer takes, that the vessel may in fact be neutral, and if so, he is entitled to all the lessened responsibility growing out of such character. We do not mean to say, as seems to be intimated in the <em>Massachusetts </em>case, that it enters into the contract, that if the vessel be neutral, the neutral character shall be maintained; but the doctrine grows out of the soundest principles of equity and justice, as applicable to the state of the thing about which the contract is made, at the time when it is made, not as springing from any stipulations of the contract directly enforcing and coercing their observance, but as having their foundation in that sense of honesty and good faith, which the law declares shall regulate all the social transactions of man, which are the objects of its cognizance. With what pretence of equity or justice could the assured call upon the underwriter for indemnity, When his own default, or that of his agents, had occasioned the loss of the subject insured? We do not speak of such conduct on the part of the captain as may be barratrous, for that is expressly assumed, but of the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>acts and defaults of the captain not amounting to barratry.) The most labored train of reasoning could not make the proposition clearer, than the statement of the interrogatory itself, which must receive its response in that sense of justice, inherent in the breasts of all mankind. A policy against all risks will not cover the frauds of the owner, <em>Groix vs. </em>Knox, 1 <em>John. Ca. </em>340; nor his misconduct, nor his voluntary acts inducing loss; for it is impossible to presume that these risks entered into the contemplation of the parties, and if they did, would it not be manifestly against the policy of the law to support them ? Mr. <em>Philips </em>condemns the validity of a policy bottomed upon such principles, and subjects to the same fate, an insurance against the party\u2019s own negligence, as it would place one man completely in the power of another, and would be injurious to the parties, and to the community of which the assured and insurer were members. Mr. <em>Justice Kent </em>say3, in the case above referred to, that <em>\u201c </em>insurers are not liable for losses arising from even <em>the mistakes </em>of the owner or captain.\u201d And why should they be? The captain and mariners are the agents of the owner in the navigation of the ship, and in virtue of the existence of such agency, he is answerable for their conduct in this respect, and is his own insurer for losses proceeding, from such conduct- This doctrine is not confined, as has been contended, to such acts as leave the ship without the necessary documents, to attest her national, or neutral character, but <em>to other </em>acts, inducing a loss. If a vessel be partly laden with powder, and she is blown up by the negligence of one of the mariners, the underwriters are not answerable. So it has been held, that if a captain of a neutral vessel resist a search, when it is rightfully demanded by belligerents, or attempt to rescue a vessel sent in by a belligerent captor, the loss cannot be recovered of the underwriter. So in the cases of <em>Homeyer and Lushinglon, and Oswe\u00fc and Vigne, </em>the having on board simulated papers was the act of the captain, not af* feeting the character of the ship ; for that was admitted, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>the sentence of condemnation, to be <em>Russian </em>in the one1 ease, and <em>Swedish </em>in the other. In short, in all policies, general or special, the assured always undertake for the faults and negligence of their own captain, or for his unskilfulness, and he cannot be heard to ask in a court of justice for indemnity for losses proceeding from such causes, the risk of which the\" underwriters never undertook.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-5\">We cannot accede to-the doctrine,, that the cases in <em>East, </em>proceeded upon the ground of the unseaworthiness of the vessel. It is a conclusive answer to this argument, to say, that had this been the foundation of their judgment, the decision in <em>Dawson \u00a7\u25a0 Atty, </em>would have been different from what it was. For if the absence of a ship\u2019s necessary document made her unseaworthy,. the owner of the goods insured could not in that case have recovered. For his contract would have been infected by the condition of the ship,although he were not owner.\u2014Being.unseaworthy the policy would have been discharged. Besides,.-if these various-cases could have been put upon this ground-,, it is inconcievable that <em>Ld. Ellenborough </em>should have so labored to place them upon other grounds. Had the implied war-5 ranty of seaworthiness any thing to do with the determination in <em>Bell and Carstairs, </em>the possession of all documents5 to show national character, would have been held, to be necessary at the commencement of the voyage: this implied warranty always operating at that moment; yet his lordship-declares, that the possession of such documents are only necessary in case of capture, or when their production be-comes material; the want of them at any other time, or for any other purpose, is immaterial, and the want of them is immaterial even in the case of capture and condemnation, unless the absence of such paper is the efficient cause of condemnation. We may in fine, observe, that we discover in these cases, the development of no new or extraordinary doctrines, but the application of the first, elementary and best established principles of the law of insurance to the cases then before the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>We shall now consider the vessel in two lights. 1. Either as a belligerent transport, or, if not in that character, as having a death wound inflicted on her neutrality, by the trade in which she had embarked <em>before the policy began to operate.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-5\">2. As a neutral vessel insured against all risks which \u25a0underwriters in a general policy assume, except prohibited trade; but that the acts complained of as changing her character into a belligerent, took place after the policy began to operate, and that the condemnation proceeded upon that ground.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-6\">Taking either view, it will be found, as we conceive, that the cause of condemnation is covered by the terms of the policy, and the risks assumed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-7\">In the consideration of the first question, we shall not stop to inquire, whether she were in fact a belligerent vessel, and had lost her neutral character, at the date of the policy, but shall assume the truth of the proposition for the sake of this inquiry. It may, however, be observed, that the policy began to operate but the very day before her departure from <em>London, </em>and whatever hostile footsteps, if any, were impressed upon her, were made before the date of her policy. The charter party had been made nearly a month before her cargo was on board ; and it ig fair to presume, that all documents and papers which were found on board at the time of the capture, were with her when the policy began to operate. The fact of her neutral ownership, and her being documented as a neutral, could not affect the question; for if she were, in fact, in the service of one of the hostile powers, all the world, notwithstanding her ownership and documents, would have considered and treated her as a belligerent vessel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-8\">Assuming then the truth of the proposition, that she was a belligerent vessel at the date of the policy, let us recur to some of the results which we have endeavored to estab? Iish. We have seen,</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-9\">I.

That the policy operates upon the character of the ship at the time of insurance, and as a corollary from this, 3dly. That a change effected in the character of the object insured, and operating as the efficient cause of condemnation, must be made after the inception of the contract of insurance, to have the effect of discharging it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-5\">If we have succeeded in maintaining these positions, the conclusion inevitably follows, that the vessel being belligerent when the policy was effected, it operated upon its character as it then existed, and if her hostile attitude and character be construed to be the ground of condemnation, then the loss is within the policy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-6\">The second general inquiry we propose making, assumes the fact, that this vessel was neutral when the policy was effected. She is admitted to be neutral, and to have been documented as an <em>American </em>ship, but, independent of these admissions, it assumes the further fact, that the acts complained of, as effecting a change in her from a neutral to a belligerent, were done after the date of the policy, and this presents three inquiries for consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-7\">1., Was such change, if any, produced by the act or default of the captain or owner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-8\">2. Was such act or default the efficient cause of condemnation, and</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-9\">3. Was such cause of condemnation uncovered by the policy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-10\">Having regard to the above assumption, and supposing that the acts done converted her into a belligerent; if these inquiries are answered in the affirmative, then the policy is discharged, if there be any truth in the reasoning and views taken by us in the former part of this opinion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-11\">It appears that the cargo belonged to residents of London, and was consigned to a commercial house in <em>Caracas, </em>with an ultimate destination for the <em>Colombian </em>service. It is by no means certain from the sentence, whether Capt. <em>Meany </em>knew of the ultimate destination of this cargo. It is not believed, that any of the ship\u2019s papers, if made in the ordina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>ry form, would show more than the character of the goods, and the name of the consignees. But the destination of the cargo, in all probability, was fixed and ascertained by the shipper\u2019s letters of advice to the consignees, or by the communications of Mr. <em>Zea, </em>if there were any on board, or if there were not, his intentions with regard to this property might have been intimated in the shipper\u2019s letters to the consignees, or if not there ascertained, was found to exist in other documents or communications on board the vessel, or were proved by the declarations of Capt. <em>Meany. </em>But his knowledge is entirely immaterial. If he did know it, he must be considered as an actor in these transactions; and if he did not know, it was owing to <em>his default, </em>that letters of advice, or any other document, or papers were taken on board which would jeopard the neutrality of his vessel, and subject her to forfeiture and confiscation. He had a right to guard himself against the reception on board of every document, letter, or paper, which could tinge his property with a belligerent stain, and having the right, it was his duty to do so, and being his duty, it was his default in having them there. So, that viewing the case in any light, if these transactions converted the vessel from a neutral into a belligerent, the act, or the default of the captain was the <em>efficient cause of condemnation.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-5\">We have said, that the act or default of the master was the efficient cause of condemnation; this general expression however, we desire should be taken with this qualification, that the sentence proceeded upon the ground that the ship was by such act or default converted into a belligerent transport, or lost her character as a neutral; if this be not the fair interpretation of it, but it did actually proceed upon the ground of contraband, it would be a risk, expressly covered, and all the acts and proceedings of the master in relation to the shipment, &amp;c. so far from being any default on his part, would have been proceedings in furtherance of the objects of a legitimate neutral voyage, and covered by the stipulations of the parties. The contraband <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>character of the shipment being in that case the efficient cause of condemnation, and not any act or default of the master, changing the character of the thing insured.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-5\">And here we are led to the inquiry, what was this ground of condemnation ? and particularly its nature and character, as effecting the matter in controversy between \u2022the parties to this suit?</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-6\">Before we proceed to an examination of the facts averred in the sentence, it may be well to fix certain principles in order to enable us to arrive at proper conclusions from the facts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-7\">The policy of the nation is especially that of a neutral. It is dictated by the habits of our people, the character of our institutions, and our remote and <em>local condition. </em>Whatever discrepancy, therefore, there may exist among the writers upon inter-national law, upon the subject of the lawfulness of a contraband trade, it should be the duty of courts of justice, looking to this essential policy of the nation, to maintain such doctrines as would be calculated to extend our trade, not to limit and restrain it, provided such doctrines can be supported by writers of acknowledged authority. Vattel, 402. Although he admits the right of belligerents to confiscate contraband goods, he seems as implicitly to admit, the right of a neutral nation to trade in all articles in time of war, which she could in time of peace. He says, the nation at war does not oppose the right of the neutral. It only exercises its own right.of confiscation, and if the rights clash with, and reciprocally injure each other, it flows from the effect of an inevitable necessity: That it is a collision which happens every day in war. <em>Azumi </em>altogether denies the right of confiscation, except where the commerce in contraband is carried to places under the dominion and control of the enemy of the nation with whom she trades, unless permitted by some conventional law. But conceding the right of confiscation, derived from the tacit consent of nations, the right and lawfulness of trade in contraband is not impaired. Acting in conformity with these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>views, the courts of <em>Massachusetts </em>and <em>New York </em>have declared the lawfulness of contraband shipments, and of course, that the risk of such shipments may be rightfully undertaken by the underwriter. Following up this prinple, and conceding that a neutral, having nothing to do with the war, should be at liberty to exercise his accustomed trade in time of war, which he enjoyed in peace, would it not follow that the neutral had a right to ship contraband, with a view to a sale to one of the belligerents, in the same manner that he enjoyed that right in time of peace, and as he unquestionably enjoys it, where sales are in contemplation to the private subjects of such belligerent? No reason exists in the one case, for a condemnation of the shipment, more than in the other. The neutral shipper cannot be presumed to have imbibed a partiality for one of the nations at war, in the one case more than in the other, for both must be considered as undertaken for purposes of gain merely. And what is there in the different destination of such a cargo, that could mark one as contraband merely, and the other as hostile? Nothing surely, for in each case the shipper must know that his cannon and other munitions of war will be hostilely employed. In the one case, it is true, the government procures them directly, and in the other, indirectly, but his strength consists as much in the material of war in the hands of his subjects, as if he had them in his own military store houses. There is no prin-ciple growing out of the necessity of a belligerent, or his safety as a nation, which would lead us to denounce as hostile and unlawful, the cargo in the one case, more than in the other. They are in truth, both merely contraband shipments, and as neutral property, liable to capture and condemnation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-5\">But let us suppose, that, in virtue of the consignment, the property, by delivery, became the property of the consignees, then domiciled in a belligerent country, and that they were, therefore, by the laws of war, considered liable to capture and confiscation as enemie\u2019s property. This could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>only affect the cargo, and could not endanger the ship j for a neutral ship may lawfully carry belligerent property.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-5\">As far as the sentence regards the shipment, whether that shipment be considered as contraband, and the property of the neutral shipper, or as the consignee\u2019s property, and therefore enemy\u2019s property liable to capture and confiscation, the case presents no difficulties; for, in either point of view, the cargo was within the terms of the policy, and covered by it, both the one and the other being a lawful trade, and such as a neutral might rightfully embark in.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-6\">This shipment must be considered in the one light or the other* It cannot be viewed as government property, for the sentence avers the fact, that it was at the time of sailing the private property of the shippers, and it is not percieved, Whatever may have been the ultimate view with regard to the cargo, how, during the voyage, it could have been divested from the shippers. The consignees had no con* trol over it, until the delivery of the cargo; or of the bills of lading, and neither of course had taken place. So that it was, in fact, private property, and admitted to be private neutral property at the time of sailing. But let us see the object and purpose of the shipment. It seems to have had an alternative destination, dependent on the contingency of the existence of a blockade of the port of <em>La G\u00fcira. </em>If that port was not blockaded, it was to be delivered to the consignees, in order that certain intentions of Mr. <em>Zea, </em>the agent of <em>Colombia, </em>resident in <em>London, </em>might be carried into effect, in putting the squadron on a more respectable footing; that a brig of war might be armed, and that a depot of munitions might be established at <em>La G\u00fcira </em>for the public service. Now, however strong this language may be; as indicating a shipment in fact for the <em>Colombian </em>government, it seems to be negatived' by two considerations, which demonstrate a shipment in the first place, merely with a view to a sale to government; and in the second place, with a view to a general sale for the benefit of the owners, or in other words a mere commercial voyage, undertaken for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>commercial gain by private property holders. The property is averred, at the time of sailing, to be in the shippers; and if the port of <em>La G\u00fcira </em>was blockaded, the master had directions to bear away for <em>Santa </em>Martha, where the consignees were to dispose of the cargo at discretion, which terms, in their ordinary acceptation, would mean a sale of the cargo to the best advantage for the owners, without regard to the public or private character of the purchaser. These considerations negative a sale to the government of this property, and the whole sentence only goes to show, that the shippers had a prospect, derived from the communications of Mr. Zea, of a sale to government, if the vessel could reach <em>La G\u00fcira; </em>and if it should be blockaded, their consignees must dispose of it to whomsoever they could, to the best advantage for the shippers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-5\">But let us suppose, that the cargo was shipped under a contract to become the property of the government of <em>Colombia </em>on delivery, and to be there paid for; and this is the most favorable light for the underwriters in which the ground assigned by the court can be viewed, as it declares, that at the time of sailing, the shipment was the property of the shippers, which it could not have been if the government had given an order for the cargo, and it had been \u00a1delivered to the master, for in such a case the title to the property would have vested in the government considering it as the consignee. Then the cargo is neutrally owned, and is not belligerent. We are aware that the Prize Courts have determined that capture is equivalent to delivery, and that in consequence of it, the cargo would be confiscated as belligerent. But its neutral character is maintained up to the moment o\u00ed capture,, and the character of the cargo would be changed by no act over which the neutral owner could have any control, but by the technical principle of the laws of war, which substitutes in such case, the captor for the consignee, in order the more effectually to guard against the frauds of belligerent shipments, under the dress and appearance of neutral ownership. How far such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>shipment, thus consigned, after capture and condemnation,, might falsify a warranty of neutrality, it is unnecessary to determine. It is sufficient here to say, that there is no warranty of neutrality, and a shipment of belligerent property,, admitting it to be such, may be lawfully made by a neutral in the absence of any warranty or representation. But could it be seriously contended, that the principle above adverted to, could convert the neutral vessel into a belligerent transport? The vessel is transporting the property of neutrals, and is in their service, not in that of the government. She would seem to have no attribute of a hostile transport. If, by fiction of law, the property, from the moment of capture, is considered as delivered, it would seem to be a singular extension of that principle to say, that by capture, the character of the vehicle is utterly changed from, a neutral, commercial vessel, into a belligerent transport, when by the capture, the vessel is considered as having, terminated her voyage and delivered her cargo. If the delivery of her cargo to the enemy constituted her a transport, it might with the same propriety be maintained, that if' this vessel had delivered her cargo at <em>La G\u00fcira, </em>and was on her return voyage, in ballast, or with an innocent cargo,</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-4\">\u2022 that she was liable to condemnation as a belligerent transport. In such a case the position could not be maintained,, nor can it be in the actual predicament of this ship, as, disclosed by the sentence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-5\">Thus much with respect to the cargo. Any or all of these' considerations existing, would have rendered it liable to capture and condemnation, either as contraband or as enemy^s property, but by the laws of war would not have affected the vessel. Indeed, if any of the circumstances attending this shipment could be considered as of so malignant and aggravating a character, as to have affected the vessel in the judicial eye of a Prize Court, and to have justly subjected her to forfeiture, still, these proceedings, and this trade, being all such as <em>a neutral might lawfully engage in, </em>must be supposed to have been contemplated by the. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>underwriter, is within the risk assumed, and he must be answerable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-5\">The consideration of the transport character of the vessel must spring from the service in which she is engaged. Sir <em>William Scott </em>in the case of the <em>Friendship </em>says, that the hiring of a vessel by the agents of the belligerent, for the purpose of carrying stores in her service, constitutes her a transport. By this, he means, (and we collect his meaning as well from his words as the facts of the case he decides,) that such vessel is only a transport, if she carry the property of the government, and that in such a case she is equally a transport, as she would be if she carried a detachment of troops. There can be no doubt of the truth of this principle, but the considerations before urged go to show, that this vessel was in the pursuance of an ordinary, neutral, and commercial voyage, <em>neither hired by the government, </em>nor in <em>her service, </em>but in <em>the service of private </em>individuals, and there exists of course no foundation for considering her as a belligerent transport.</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-6\">We have stated that it was clearly inferable from the sentence, that the shipment in the first instance was made with a view to a sale to the government by the consignees, and no doubt their instructions, in ease of the vessel\u2019s reaching <em>La G\u00fcira, </em>were to that effect. But this design could not make her a transport. She must, to give her that character, <em>be employed to carry goods belonging to the belligerent. But \u201cshe was offered, in case she should be needed, to the Colombian </em>government.\u201d Now, suppose the vessel completely equipped for war, and built in a neutral State, whose laws did not forbid it, with intent to sell her to one of the belligerents, and she sails in pursuance of that intent, she would be only a contraband article, and such as might be lawfully transported by a neutral citizen, subject only to the conflicting right of <em>seizure in transitu, </em>and of <em>confiscation, </em>and such being the right of the neutral owner, the underwriter must look to the possibility of the existence of such an intent. He knows her destination is to a belliger<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>ent port: He knows the structure of the vessel, and is bound to know the course of the trade, and all the incidents and dangers to which the vessel as a neutral may be subjected; clothing this part of the case in the worst possible garb for the assured, the underwriter would be responsible. This vessel was an ordinary ship, pursuing the usual avocations of commerce, with none of those dangerous characteristics which distinguish the vessel in <em>Robinson\u2019s </em>reports. It is true, like all other vessels engaged in that trade, she was originally built with some adaptation to warfare, but, from the time of her first structure, she had been employed in commercial voyages. She had not the distinctive marks of warlike offence which the <em>Brutus </em>had, but her predominant character was commercial; so that conceding that case to be law, this would not fall within its range.\u2014But here, it is true she was to be contingently offered to the government, and considering her as an article <em>ancipitis us\u00fcs, </em>it might be proper to look to her contingent destination, as determining her character to be contraband. Considering then, the fact of her being offered to the government, as converting the ship into a contraband, still a neutral owner may lawfully transport his ship with a view to a sale, and there, would be no forfeiture of even a warranty of neutrality by the existence of such an intent, accompanied by a sailing in pursuance thereof.,</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-4\">So far then, as this ground of condemnation is concerned, whether we consider that condemnation as lawless, except as regards the goods, or as justified by the aggravating circumstances attending the shipment, or upon the ground that the yessel herself was contraband, (and in any other light, we-have endeavored to show it cannot be viewed,) the assured, by it, are not prevented from recovery, even although these various acts were done after the inception of the risk. For although they might have been the efficient cause of the condemnation of the vessel, we cannot consider them as flowing from the fault or default of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>owner of the vessel, or her captain, as they were all justifiable in the rightful pursuit of a lawful neutral voyage, and were of course, within the risks assumed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-5\">The next cause of condemnation must be passed in review. The attempt of this vessel to break a blockade of the port of <em>La G\u00fcira.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-6\">The principles applicable to this subject, it has been adjudged by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, 1 <em>Bin. </em>293, and by the Supreme Court of the <em>United States, </em>4 <em>Cranch. </em>186, are correctly ascertained by the <em>British </em>treaty of 1794, and that it is, in exact conformity with the law of nations. Without mounting to a more distant source, we shall look to these eases, and to this treaty, as furnishing the law on the subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-7\">There must be notice to neutrals of the existence of a blockade. When the <em>Budget </em>sailed from <em>London, </em>it is clear from the sentence, that she did not know of the existence of a blockade, for she had orders, if there existed a blockade, to bear away for <em>Santa Martha. </em>This too, manifests the absence of a <em>sailing with intent to violate a blockade. </em>If <em>without notice she attempted </em>to enter, it was the duty of the blockading squadron <em>to have turned her away. The attempt, then, to enter without notice is not an offence, </em>but the offence which subjects to confiscation, is the <em>attempt to enter with notice, </em>or <em>after being turned away, again attempting to enter.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-8\">Now the sentence is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of what it states, and all inferences which a rational mind can draw from such a statement, may legally and properly be deduced to uphold and sustain the legality of the ground. It states <em>an attempt to enter a blockaded port merely, unaccompanied with any assertion of notice, either actual or constructive. </em>It is then <em>prima facie </em>evidence of an attempt to enter a blockaded port, but <em>not of notice, not of a turning away. </em>This you <em>cannot </em>infer. We infer one fact from the proof of the existence of another fact, because the fact inferred, usually attends the fact proved. This princi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>pie is at the bottom of all the doctrine of inference and presumption. Now, the attempt to enter a besieged town regularly invested after notice, is an extraordinary occurrence, and the usual attendant of such attempts, instead of notice, is a <em>want of notice. </em>There is then, no ground of inference, no room for deduction; but looking at the instructions of the captain to bear away in case of a blockade, and .accompany them, with the consideration of the notices usually governing men, and their customary conduct, the inference is directly arid palpably the other way, that there did exist no actual notice\u2014constructive notice there clearly was none. There is, then, nothing to leave to the jury upon this subject, and this furnishes no ground of condemnation. But if notice cannot be inferred from the ground condemnation, can you infer it from the <em>sentence of condemnation itself </em>? You may support the sentence by referring to the grounds of it, but we should doubt whether the reverse of the proposition is true.' <em>The reasons must speak for themselves. </em>These show on the part of the assured, only an innocent act, because there is no notice. But suppose it for a moment to be ambiguous, no court has heretofore, that we are aware of, resorted to the sentence to explain the ambiguity, and to support and maintain the reasons; but in such case, they look into the proceedings, and the facts therein detailed and proven, to dissipate the doubt. Would we be bound to comity to foreign tribunals to infer a legal condemnation from an ambiguous ground ? Would it not be an overstrained comity, looking to the actual practices of the prize tribunals of the <em>European </em>nations for the last forty years ? Are we, in the face of the fact, that <em>Spain </em>has acknowledged that our property to the amount, at all events, of five millions of dollars, has been illegally condemned and confiscated, to proffer on our part this comity ? With all these facts before us, with the remonstrances of our citizens for the last thirty years, against the violations of our neutral commerce on the part of nearly every maratime nation of Europe, (and which are now mat-</p>\n<p data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>ters of history, having formed the basis of many negotiations,) if the mind would have an inclination, where there existed an ambiguity, it would be rather against the evidence than in favor of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-5\">It follows from the preceding views, that the prayers offered by the defendants\u2019 counsel must be rejected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-6\"><em>Plaintiff\u2019s Exceptions. </em>1. The defendants, to support the issue on their part, offered evidence to the jury, that the ship Budget, on which the policy in this cause was effected, at a sale made in pursuance of the condemnation of said ship at <em>Porto </em>Rico, was purchased by <em>John Meany, </em>her former captain, as the agent, and for the account of <em>Hugh Thompson, </em>in whom the interest in said ship, and her freight in this cause is averred; and also offered in evidence, that after the return of said ship to <em>Baltimore </em>from <em>Porto Rico, </em>she came into possession of <em>Thompson, </em>as owner thereof, and that he exercised acts of ownership in relation to said ship, and fitted her out, and despatched her on a foreign voyage, and was considered the owner of said vessel. Whereupon the plaintiff\u2019 offered evidence to prove, that the said ship, at the sale under the condemnation at <em>Porto Rico </em>aforesaid, was purchased by said <em>Meany, </em>on his sole account, and not as the agent, or for the account of said <em>Thompson, </em>and that after the return of said ship to <em>Baltimore </em>from <em>Porto Rico </em>aforesaid, she was continually in the possession of said <em>Meany </em>as his property, and that he exercised acts of ownership in relation <em>to </em>said ship, and that the said <em>Thompson </em>never meddled with said ship, after her return, but as the agent of said <em>Meany. </em>And thereupon the defendants, by their counsel, prayed the opinion of the court to the jury, that if they should find from the evidence, that at the sale made by virtue of the decree of condemnation of the Prize Court at <em>Porto Rico, </em>in evidence in this cause, <em>John Meany, </em>who was the captain of said ship at the time of her capture, became the purchaser of said ship or the account of <em>Hugh Thompson, </em>and that said <em>Thomp</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number><em>son </em>affirmed and adopted the said purchase, as so made on his account, that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover in this action, as for a total loss on said ship ; which opimion the court (Hanson, A.

Upon the whole evidence stated in the preceding exceptions of the plaintiff and defendants, which is to be considered as a part of this, the plaintiff, by his counsel prayed the opinion and direction of the court to the jury, that if the jury find from the evidence, that after the condemnation of said vessel, captain Meany, at the sale at <em>Porto Rico, </em>made under said condemnation, became the purchaser of the said vessel, on account of the said <em>Thompson, </em>without any authority Frorn the said <em>Hugh Thompson, </em>except what may be held to be incident to his office as captain of said ship, and that the said <em>Hugh Thompson </em>after-wards ratified and adopted the purchase of said <em>Meany, </em>and took possession of said vessel as his own, yet, that such purchase and adoptiori\u2019did^ not convert the total loss into a partial one, and does not baFthe plaintiff from recovering in this cause as for a total loss of the said vessel. 2d. That the underwriters, if they can avail themselves in any way of such purchase and confirmation, can only claim as salvage, the difference between the actual value of the ship, at the time of the sale, and the sum paid for her by Capt. <em>Meany. </em>Which directions, and each of them, the court (Hanson, A.

The failure to communicate to the underwriters, the facts set forth in these prayers; and the manner in which the assured did communicate other facts, amounted to a misrepresentation on their part, of facts material to the risk, and vitiated the policy. Considering the assured as having all the knowledge that <em>Meany </em>had, (and they are hound by it, whether actually known to them or not;) the question is, were they not guilty of a misrepresention where they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>said, there <em>might possibly </em>be some contraband articles on hoard, when they knew that she was not only to be entirely loaded with such articles, but that both ship and cargo were destined for the service of the <em>Colombian </em>government ? According to the true state of the facts, the voyage was peculiarly perilous ; when the information communicated to the underwriters was calculated to produce a belief, that the risk was an ordinary commercial risk, enhanced by a small quantity contraband articles. Independent of the forfeiture of the cargo, consequent upon a capture, under such circumstances, its destination to the agents of a belligerent government involved the forfeiture of the ship also, she being converted by such employment into a belligerent transport. <em>The Commercen, </em>1 <em>Wheat. </em>391, 392, 393. <em>The Friendship, </em>6 <em>Robinson, </em>425. <em>The Orozimbo, Ib. </em>430.</p>\n<p data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-5\">The first exception of defendant\u2019s was abandoned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-6\">Upon the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions, they argued, that the contract of insurance is a contract of <em>indemnity </em>merely, and that any act of the assured, after the vessel returns to this country, manifesting an intention to adopt the act of recovery as his own, is for the benefit of the underwriters, and converts a total, into a partial loss. 1 <em>Caine\u2019s Ca. </em>296. <em>note, Ib. </em>41, 42.</p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-7\">Up to the period of abandonment, the captain is the agent of the owner; subsequently, he is the agent of the underwriter. <em>Phillips, </em>468.

And it was incumbent on the defendants to show, that they had offered evidence in support of each of their alternative prayers, from which the facts assumed might he found by the jury.

It follows therefore, that the failure of the assured, to communicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>to the underwriters, that he intends to carry a contraband or belligerent cargo, can have no effect upon the policy; as the very terms of the contract are evidence of such an intention. <em>Carter vs. Boehm, </em>3 <em>Burr. Rep. </em>1911.</p>\n<p data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-5\">A party Avould never ask for an insurance against all risks, unless he contemplated the probability of a contraband or belligerent cargo, as it would be useless to enhance the premium. <em>Buck and Hedrick vs. The Chesapeake Ins. Co. </em>1 <em>Peters, </em>160. The case at bar, is stronger than the case in 1 <em>Peters, </em>as it is manifest from the order of this case, that the assured did not, and could not know, of what the cargo would consist, nor to whom it would belong, and as a prudent man, he could only effect such an insurance, as would embrace perils of every description. In the order of the 9th of October, asking for insurance against all risks, and for whom it may concern, nothing is said about contraband, or from which a neutral character could be inferred; and consequently the risk asked, was a belligerent risk, of which the Underwriters are treated, as having knowledge. If the \u25a0case stood upon that order, it would be free from all doubt, upon the authority of the case of <em>Buck and Hedrick </em>in 1 <em>Peters. </em>That the explanatory order of the 10th, did not, in the opinion of the underwriters, change the character of the risk, and reduce it from a war, to a peace risk, is proved by their refusal to reduce the premium. There was then, no deceit in the second order, and all parties considered the risk as remaining as it was before.</p>\n<p data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-6\">The second order was submitted, because some of the <em>Baltimore </em>policies contained a warranty against contraband, which if introduced must be complied with, whether material or not. A good reason then existing for the second order, why should the language of it be strained beyond the evident intention of the parties, which clearly was, to be covered against all risks, or why should the legal operation of the former order be restrained, by an act designed to enlarge it ? To construe the last order as a representation, or warranty of neutrality, would be to convert the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>risk into a mere peace risk, when the assured was asking for, and paying the premium of a war risk. If none of the <em>Baltimore </em>policies contained a warranty against contraband, and there was no proof of a usage on the subject, it might be difficult to account for the second order. But as the proof is, the object is manifest, and perfectly consistent with the declared desire, to be covered against all risks. St is impossible to consider this last order as amounting to a misrepresentation. The assured fairly and truly told the underwriter all he knew, and in terms to awaken his apprehension, and put him on his guard ; and the premium charged, shows, he was on his guard. The order in this case, cannot be considered as a representation of neutrality; for although <em>contraband </em>cannot be predicated of a neutral ship, here it does not <em>expressly </em>assert that there will be <em>contraband </em>on board, but that there <em>possibly </em>may be, and hence, a belligerent character might fairly be inferred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-5\">If the defendants did not mean to insure a war risk, it was their duty so to have stipulated, and reduced the premium accordingly. 2 <em>Johns.

This, though true perhaps, as a general rule, is not applicable to a case like the present, where from the relative situation of the parties to each other, such common intelligence was impossible. If the rule was universal, then the principal never could insure a lost vessel, if such loss was known to the master. <em>Genl. </em>Int. <em>Ins. Co. vs. Ruggles, </em>12 <em>Wheat. </em>408. Again, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>when the agent is in one country, and the principal in another, without knowledge in fact, and so tells the underwriter, can it be said, that he shall be so affected by the agent\u2019s knowledge, as to forfeit his policy ? When he says to the underwriter that he has no knowledge, he puts him on his guard, and the premium is regulated accordingly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"162\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-5\">If, however, these parties are to be affected with the knowledge of <em>Meany, </em>the policy being against all risks, and for whom it may concern, is nevertheless good. <em>Buck and Hedrick vs. Chesapeake Ins.

It was a question of law to be decided by the court. Now, the sentence does not say that the captain had <em>knowledge </em>of the blockade, if in fact a blockade existed, nor does it say that he intended to violate it; and the mere attempt to enter a blockaded port, of which the party attempting has no knowledge. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>does not avoid the policy. <em>Fitzsimmons vs. The Newport Ins.

There was in fact nothing to abandon ; nothing upon which it could operate. How then, can it be said, that the conduct of the assured afterwards, is a waiver of the abandonment ? If the abandonment conferred no title upon the insurer, there was nothing to waive; and nothing with which the subsequent conduct of the assured can be said to have been inconsistent. 3 <em>Mason, </em>86. 5 <em>Johns.

Is the copy of the record of the prize court of <em>Porto Rico </em>competent evidence, \u201cfor the purpose of showing that the original papers, of which copies and translations, purporting to be inserted in said record, were on board the said ship <em>Budget, </em>at the time of her capture, and were acknowledged to have been so on board by the said <em>Meany, </em>the captain of said ship, in his examination upon oath, before the said Prize Court?\u201d With the decision made by the county court on this question we fully concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The sentence of condemnation of the foreign prize court is evidence of the facts, which it purports to decide, in an action on a policy of insurance on the thing condemned <em>; </em>and was conclusive evidence thereof, until the act of assembly of 1813, <em>ch. </em>164, reduced it to the character of mere <em>prima facie </em>proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">But the proof upon which such sentence may have been predicated, is not, <em>per se, </em>admissible in such collateral action.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">The utmost efficacy that could be given to it, would be, to permit it to have the same effect, as if taken in a former cause between the present litigant parties. When viewed in that light, it is clearly inadmissible, there being nothing in the record to show the impracticability of procuring in the usual way, the testimony of captain <em>Meany, </em>or the ori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>ginal papers referred to, or the testimony of the witnesses, who deposed that such papers were on board the <em>Budget. </em>The competency of the evidence offered, through <em>John D. </em>Daniels, forms the subject of our examination in the third bill of exceptions. And its offer is predicated upon the assumption, that a breach of blockade, was one of the grounds of condemnation, alleged in the sentence. The objection urged to the testimony is, that <em>Thompson Bathurst </em>having given the sentence in evidence to the jury, could not subsequently be permitted to contradict, by the examinaton of witnesses, any of the facts which it professes to establish. There would be a semblance of reason and plausibility in this objection, if <em>Thompson If Bathurst </em>had offered the sentence as evidence of the truth of the allegations on which it professes to be founded. But the reverse is the fact; it was offered for no such purpose. On the contrary, the offer under the circumstances in which it was made, distinctly announced to the court, and the <em>Insurance </em>Company, that those allegations, as far as they presented any barrier to the right of the plaintiffs below to recover, were denied, and would bo disproved. The only object in producing the sentence, other than that of sustaining the abandonment, was to prove, that by the act of a foreign Prize Court, the insured had been deprived of all property in their ship. There is therefore, no inconsistency, no violation of the policy, nor any principle of law, in the sentence, and testimony of <em>Danels, </em>being offered as evidence by the same party. The sentence was the cause assigned for the abandonment, and must be proved ; or the abandonment would be a nullity, and give no right of recovery as for a total loss. But say the counsel for the Insurance Company, there was no necessity for producing in evidence the sentence of condemnation, as proof of capture was sufficient. Does the law warrant this assertion ? The plaintiffs abandoned, not because of the capture, but of the condemnation. Admitting they were notified of the capture at the time of its occurrence, of which there is no evidence, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>may have hoped, that the ship would have been released; and were therefore unwilling to relinquish to the insurer, the profits anticipated from the enterprize. Were they bound to have done so ? Assuredly not. They waited the event, and abandoned on the 'ground of condemnation. If in a reasonable time after notice of capture, they failed to abandon, they lost the privilege of doing so, and could not have recovered for a total loss, on any abandonment for that cause subsequently made.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">But the unanswerable objection to the argument is this ; that no abandonment was made on the ground of capture, and consequently, the proof thereof would not entitle the insured to recover for a total loss. The principle is not now to be controverted, that in recovering for a total loss, founded on an abandonment, you must prove as the basis of your action, the cause assigned in the notice. Failing to do this, you cannot sustain your pretensions by proving another cause, which if made the subject of abandonment, would have warranted a recovery. The production of the sentence of condemnation, is therefore an indispensible link in the chain of testimony, requisite to the prosecution of a suit for a total loss, grounded on such an abandonment as that presented by the record before us. If the objection to the testimony be a sound one, <em>Thompson fy Bathurst </em>were on the horns of a dilemma. To entitle them to recover they must produce the sentence, and the production of the sentence rendered a recovery impossible. To sanction the objection insisted on, would be judicially to repeal the act of 1813, and to give to the sentences of foreign Prize Courts, that conclusiveness of which by the act of 1813, they had been divested. That act declaring, <em>\u201c </em>that no sentence, judgment, or decree, final, or interlocutory, of any judge, court, board, council, or tribunal, having or exercising municipal admiralty, or prize jurisdiction, without the limits of the <em>United States, </em>or its territories, shall be conclusive evidence in any case or controversy in the courts of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>State, of any fact, matter or thing contained, stated or expressed, except of the acts and doings of such foreign judge, court, board, council, or tribunal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">In the aspect in which this question was presented to the county court, their disposition of it is in accordance with the views of this court. But we deny the assumption upon which the objection was founded; viz: that the sentence disclosed a condemnation for the breach of blockade. The sentence states no such fact. It alleges that <em>La </em>G\u00fcira, the port of destination of the Budget, was on the 23d of December, the day of the condemnation, a blockaded port; but not that it was so at the time of the capture, or the attempt to enter it. The testimony of <em>Daniels </em>was on that account wholly irrelevant to any matter at issue in the cause; and the county court, on that ground erred, in over-ruling the objection to its going to the jury. But this error, being in its nature wholly immaterial, and having no tendency to influence the minds of the jury, in forming their verdict upon the matters really in issue before them, forms no ground lor the reversal of the judgment rendered on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The first branch of the first prayer, in the fourth bill of exceptions, is, \u201cthat the terms of the order for insurance and the policy, in this case amount to a warranty, that the ship <em>Budget </em>was a neutral ship, bound upon a mercantile voyage, with permission to carry some articles contraband of war, but in every respect to be employed and navigated as a neutral ship.\u201d To sustain this idea of warranty, the following endorsement on the order of insurance is relied on: viz: \u201calthough our advices give us no reason to believe there will he any articles contraband of war on board the ship <em>Budget, </em>still, as we wish to be covered against all possible risk, we request your reconsideration of the written application including articles contraband of war.\u201d This, say the counsel for the insurers, is equivalent to an express asseveration of neutrality, as articles contraband of war have neither meaning nor existence, but in reference to a neutral ship. Suppose this indissoluble connection, between arti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>cles contraband and a neutral ship be conceded; does the inference of warranty of neutrality in this case, necessarily follow? Can it be denied, that the original order covered belligerent as well as neutral risks? Was the endorsement on the order, intended to reduce the premium, by diminishing the risks insured against, to those of a neutral character only ? Was it so understood by the underwriters? Their <em>continuing </em>to demand the same premium is unanswerable proof to the contrary. Do the terms of the endorsement intimate such an intention ? So far from it, they reiterate the contrary by renewing the same offer, and declaring their \u201cwish to be covered against all possible risk.\u201d Do they in express terms, or by necessary inference assert, that there will be articles contraband of war on board ? The reverse is the truth ; they state that their advices give them no reason to believe that such will be the fact; but should such a contingency happen, they seek by insurance an indemnity against it. In other words, the order in effect declares the <em>Budget </em>may be belligerent property; if so, we require protection against all perils, incident to her, in that character. Or she may be in point of fact, neutral, in that event, we ask an indemnity against every casualty, not explicitly excepted, which may befal her as such. It neither asserts her to be the one, nor the other, but provides an exemption from loss, let her condition in that respect be what <em>it </em>may.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">That the original order, with the terms \u201cagainst all risks,\u201d and \u201cfor account of all whom it may concern,\u201d covered both neutral and belligerent risks, has been admitted, and could not be denied. Had it then been the design of the second offer, to reduce the liabilities of the underwriters to neutral risks only, and obtain a consequent reduction of the premium of insurance, it would not have omitted an express assertion or warranty of neutrality. In the rejection of this part of the said first prayer, we therefore concur with the county court.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">By the remaining part of this first prayer, in the third bill of exceptions, the instruction required of the court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>was, that \u201c if the jury find from all the evidence, and admissions in the cause, that the ship <em>Budget, </em>on the voyage insured, was entirely laden with munitions of war, and that the same were destined for the service of the <em>Colombian </em>government at <em>La G\u00fcira, </em>partly to arm a vessel of war called the <em>New Orleans </em>belonging to the said government, and in part to establish a <em>depot </em>of arms at <em>La G\u00fcira </em>for the service of the said government; or that if said ship was to be offered for salo to the <em>Colombian </em>government whenever she might be wanted; or that the said <em>Meany, </em>captain of the <em>Budget, </em>was to be employed in the naval service of said government; or that a breach of blockade was committed by the <em>Budget, </em>as set forth in the sentence of condemnation of the <em>Prize Court of Porto Rico; </em>that then the policy is violated, and the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.\u201d In <em>Buck &amp; Hedrick vs. The Chesapeake Ins. Co. </em>1 <em>Peters, </em>159, the <em>Supreme Court of the United States </em>have declared, that \u201c courts of justice are not bound to modify or fashion the instructions moved for by counsel, so as to bring them within the rules of law.\u201d If it wore otherwise, instead of deciding the question submitted as presented by the counsel, they would in fact themselves become counsel, by raising the question, which as a court they must subsequently determine, and by analogy in every case it would be error, to reject a prayer asking more than the principles of law would warrant, unless at the same time the court gave an instruction, as favorable to the interest of the party praying, as if they were responding to a prayer aptly formed to elicit such instruction. The law, for wise reasons, imposes upon the court no such double and inconsistent duties of counsel and judge. They may, if they see fit, content themselves with a simple refusal of any prayer not sanctioned by the rules of law. The court below were therefore justified in an unqualified rejection of the said remaining part of the first prayer, because they were required to give it, if the jury were satisfied of the existence of any one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>of four enumerated alternatives; one of which, (in relation to a breach of blockade,) was not a question which the court could have submitted to the finding of the jury, for the reasons stated in our opinion on the second bill of exceptions. But according to our view of the subject, the court would have been right in refusing the instruction prayed, though a separate prayer had been framed on each alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">\u25a0 In the case of <em>Buck &amp; Hedrick vs. The Chesapeake Ins. Co. </em>before referred to, <em>the Supreme Court </em>say, <em>\u201c </em>a knowledge of the'state of the world, of the allegiance of particular countries, of the risks and embarrassments affecting their trade, of the course and incidents of the trade on which they insure, and the established import of the terms used in their contract, must necessarily be imputed to the underwriters.\u201d <em>\u201c No </em>underwriter can be ignorant of the practice of neutrals to cover belligerent property under neutral names, or of the precautions ordinarily resorted to, that the cover may escape detection.\u201d Neither can the <em>'Maryland </em>Insurance Company in this case, be deemed uninformed of the practice of chartering neutral vessels at London, and elsewhere, by the agents of the <em>Spanish South American </em>governments, for the transportation of military stores, and troops; nor of such vessels being sold to those agents, deliverable in <em>South America, </em>for the purpose of being there used as national cruisers. These were facts of universal notoriety in the commercial world, at the time of the insurance on the <em>Budget; </em>are a part of the public history of that epoch, against the light of which this court cannot shut their eyes, and of which the law imputes knowledge to the appellants. Nay, it is more than probable, if not apparent, that these were the belligerent perils, mainly contemplated by the parties in their compact of insurance; and against which the underwriters especially designed to indemnify.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">It is admitted on both sides, that the <em>Budget, </em>until her arrival at <em>London, </em>was well known as an <em>American </em>ship; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>and owned, commanded, and navigated as such. The letters of <em>Meany, </em>the captain, to his owners, communicated to the underwriters, and on which the policy was effected, informs them of what? That he had sold the ship? No. That he had \u201cchartered\u201d her to <em>go </em>\u201cto one of the following ports in the <em>Colombian government\u2014La G\u00fcira, Sania Martha or </em>Carthagena.\u201d And upon these facts, with the aforementioned knowledge of the usage of neutrals in that trade, the underwriters were called on to insure the ship, against all possible perils that could betide her, either in a neutral or belligerent character. The asking of such an insurance, is of itself demonstration, that protection against dangers ordinarily incident to neutrality, was not all that was desired. To suppose that for such a limited liability, they offered (as they did,) more than double the premium necessary <em>to </em>the attainment of such an object, would be to impute to them a species of senseless prodigality, never before deemed applicable to an <em>American </em>merchant. The idea of the enhanced premium being paid on account of a <em>bona fide </em>regular belligerent ownership, is repudiated by the letter of <em>Meany, </em>on which the insurance company acted, when the policy was underwritten. That announced the chartering, not the sale of the <em>Budget. </em>What kind of belligerent risks were they then, for which, they designed to become responsible? The strong probability, if not the natural presumption is, that they assumed the liability for those very contingencies, for which they are now called upon to answer; and which were contemplated by both insurer and insured, from their knowledge of the character of the trade by neutrals from <em>London </em>to <em>Colombia. </em>No other rational motive could have prompted <em>Thompson &amp;f Bathurst </em>to have sought such an insurance ; and the facts in the cause warrant the assumption, that the underwriters intentionally assumed the responsibility to the full extent into which they were invited to enter. Being uncertain, whether it could be called a neutral or a belligerent risk; where the ship, though in fact neutral, was in con tern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>plation of law regarded as belligerent; <em>Thompson and Bathurst </em>required not only a eover, to neutral and belligerent ownership, but also against \u201call risks,\u201d or \u201call possible risk.\u201d Thus manifestly seeking to obtain security against other losses, than those which usually attend neutral and belligerent ownership. And such must have been the understanding of the insurance company, from the knowledge with which they are affected. In this view of the subject, we are more than sustained, by the case of <em>Goix vs. Knox, </em>1 <em>Johns. Cases, </em>340; where it is said, \u201cthe insuranse is against all risks.\u201d This expression is vague and indefinite; but if we allow it any force, it must be considered as creating a special insurance, and extending to other risks than are usually contemplated. We are inclined to give it a liberal construction, and apply it to all losses, except such as arise from the fraud of the insured. \u201cThe terms used are sufficiently broad to comprehend every other loss.\u201d This doctrine was affirmed in <em>Skidmore vs. Desdoity, </em>2 <em>Johns. Cases, </em>77.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">We have so far, examined the effect of the order for insurance, in reference to the question of warranty of neutrality ; and in doing so, have regarded it as incorporated in the policy. By the second prayer in the third bill of exceptions, the county court were required to give the same instruction to the jury, which was applied for in the first, except that the order for insurance in the first prayer was assumed to operate as a warranty, in the second as a representation. If when regarded as a warranty, the order for insurance, as we have endeavored to show, can afford no relief to the appellants, there is no pretext for an attempt to invoke it to their aid, when viewed in the light of a representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">We approve of the county court\u2019s refusal, to grant the second, third and fourth prayers, for the same reasons which induced us to sanction their rejection of the first; and we sustain them in their denial of the fifth and sixth prayers upon the grounds, stated by us in the examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>of the second bill of exceptions. We also concur in opinion with the county court, in the rejection of the seventh, eighth and ninth prayers ; believing that the assured wore under no obligation to communicate existence of those facts, the concealment, or non-disclosure of which, is relied on as the ground for vacating the policy. In our remarks on the first prayer, in the third bill of exceptions, we have so construed the contract of insurance, as to fix upon the underwriters a liability for losses arising from the transportation of hostile stores, troops, &amp;c. the facts alleged as unduly-concealed. The obligation to disclose is limited to such facts, as would vary the risk, or nature of the contract. Mo communication need be made, of what is necessarily implied by the contract. Where the necessity of disclosure, when the insurers agreed to run the hazard of the very peril concealed? If the underwriters have assumed the risk, to which the ship may be subjected in transporting a cargo of hostile stores, can it he requisite, that they should be informed, that such a cargo is to be laden on board the ship? On an assurance for account of whom it may concern, is the assured bound to inform the assurer, that there exists a belligerent owner, or twenty of them, if there be so many? Assuredly not.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">If the insurers designed to assume a mere neutral risk, (of which we cannot indulge a momentary belief,) they were not led into this error by the conduct of the insured. Every thing, short of express information to the contrary, was disclosed to them. They were told, that insurance was required \u201cfor all whom it may concern,\u201d against \u201call risks,\u201d or \u201call possible riks;\u201d they were aware of the trade carried on by neutrals from <em>London </em>to <em>Colombia. </em>If under such circumstances, they neither charged an adequate premium, nor sought the further information requisite to lead their judgment to a just estimate of their responsibility, they must bear the consequences of their own misprision.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Having disclosed our views upon the exceptions taken, in behalf of the underwriters, we are now brought to the ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>animation of the bills of exceptions on the part of the assured, which present the question, whether the total loss claimed, was converted into a partial loss, by <em>Meany\u2019s </em>purchase of the <em>Budget </em>for account of the owners, and their subsequent ratification thereof, as stated in the bills of exceptions. To sustain the affirmative of this proposition, in addition to some <em>American </em>authorities on the subject, that part of <em>Ld. Mansfield\u2019s </em>opinion, in <em>Goss vs. </em>Withers, <em>2 Burr. </em>694, has been much relied on, which declares, that \u201cthe insurer-runs the risk of the insured, and undertakes to bear the loss actually sustained, and can be liable to no more. So that if after condemnation, the owner recover the ship in her complete condition, but has paid salvage, or been at any expense in getting her back, the insurer must bear the loss so actually sustained.\u201d This may be sound doctrine in England, where it is held, that the right to recover for a total loss, is not made absolute by the state of facts, on which the abandonment is founded, continuing to exist at the date of the abandonment, but is dependent on subsequent events. In this country, a different rule prevails. The right to recover of the assurer, for a total loss is complete, if the loss which is its basis, continue at the time of the abandonment, and of this consummate right or privilege, the assured cannot, without default, be deprived, but by their consent expressed or implied. Like other privileges, it may be waived by the insured, either in express terms, or by their acts inconsistent with its existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">If after capture and abandonment, but before condemnation, a ship be ransomed by the captain, or retaken by the crew, or be recovered and delivered to the owners, who claim, and use her as their own, they possess her under no new title or right of property; their acts are the assertion of their original ownership, and therefore inconsistent with the abandonment, which if sustained, casts the right of property on the insurers. Both cannot therefore stand together; the necessary inference is, that the insured, by the resumption of their ownership, surrendered their rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>under the abandonment. But where a condemnation has taken place, the assured, apart from all statutory regulation on the subject, is divested of all property in the ship, and in it, if purchased by themselves, or their agents, they acquire a new and independent title to which their subsequent acts of ownership are imputable, and not to their original proprietary rights. An intention to waive the abandonment is not the natural inference from their conduct. There is no inconsistency in their claiming for a total loss under the abandonment, and asserting the right of property under the newly acquired title. As against all the world, save the underwriters, the assured as purchasers, have an incontrovertible title. And it is conclusive even against them, if they consented to its acquisition, or have waived the light to impeach it. We are aware, that this question has been apparently otherwise decided in some of the <em>United States, </em>and especially in <em>New York; </em>where in the honest zeal for the protection of insurers, it is respectfully suggested, they have stretched their doctrines upon this subject to an unjust invasion of the rights of the insured, and gone beyond what the policy, or analogies of the law would sanction. The principle contended for in the argument, as fairly deducible from the <em>New York </em>cases is, that the acceptance by the insured for his own benefit, of a purchase of the thing insured, made by the captain for account of his owner, is <em>per se, </em>a waiver of the abandonment; and converts the otherwise total, into a partial loss. To this universal and unqualified proposition, we cannot assent. Whilst we admit, that the law has wisely erected around insurers, an impenetrable harrier to fraud and injustice on the part of the insured, we insist, that in doing so, it has gone no further than the necessity of the occasion demanded, and, that it has not been unmindful of providing a like protection for the insured, against practices of a similar character emanating frarri the insurers. That whilst <em>uberrima jides </em>is exacted of the insured, a like course of conduct must be practiced by insurers. That to neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>party, is it permitted to do acts, the natural tendency of which is injustice, and imposition on the other. We freely concede, that neither the insured in person, or through the instrumentality of others, either before, or after the condemnation of the thing insured, possesses, where an abandonment has been made, an unqualified right to become its purchaser, for their own benefit. Such purchases, after condemnation, where a total loss is claimed, are ever subject to this qualification ; that the insurers have the right or privilege, if they see fit, to exercise it within a reasonable time after a knowledge of the purchase, to elect to become themselves the purchasers; and if the insured refuse to surrender the bargain, the total is converted into a partial loss; or in other words, the insurers, by their election, having made the thing insured their own, have a right to deduct from the plaintiff\u2019s claim, the amount of the insurance, first subtracting therefrom, the <em>quantum </em>of loss actually sustained' by the insured, by reason of the perils insured against. By an abandonment, the rights of the underwriters relate back to the date of the disaster, not of the abandonment. All intermediate acts of the captain, and agents of the insured, inure to the benefit of the insurer. Any purchase therefore made by such captain or agents, no matter for whose account, if in due season adopted by the underwriters, becomes their own. This view of the subject, so consonant to reason, justice, and policy, is not without support from the decisions from <em>New York, </em>which have been relied on by the Insurance Com pany. In <em>Robinson &amp; Hartshorne vs. United Ins. Co. </em>1 <em>Johns. </em>611, <em>Woodworth, </em>of the Court of Errors of <em>New York, </em>says, \u201cI subscribe to the correctness of the rule, that the insurers ought <em>to </em>decide immediately after notice, whether they will avail themselves of the purchase made by the agent.\u201d In <em>Jumel and Desobry vs. Marine Ins. Co. </em>7 <em>Johns. </em>426, Chief Justice <em>Kent, </em>in delivering the opinion of the court, speaking of the repurchase of a vessel by the captain, for the benefit of the owner, says, the insurers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Mi at':; nothing to do with the purchase of the vessel, <em>unless \u25a0at their election, </em>is a genera! principle of insurance, &amp;c.\u201d and in <em>Ogden vs. Fire Ins. Co. </em>10 <em>Johns. </em>180, the court, in relation to a purchase made by the assured after abandonment, state, that \u00edsif he persevere in the claim for a iota! loss, he must surrender to the insurer the benefit of the purchase; and this rule is founded in sound policy, to prevent fraudulent speculations upon a loss, at the expense of the insurer.55</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The principle of law upon this subject as recognised by us, gives protection to both parties, and is founded on equal and reciprocal justice, as far as the nature of the case will admit of. Adopt the rule as contended for by the Insurance Company, and you deal unjustly by <em>Thompson </em>&lt;\u00a7\u2022 Bathurst, by rendering them without their consent purchasers of the ship; not at the price they stipulated to pay, but perhaps at double that amount; at her valuation at the port of departure, not her value at the port of purchase. You also inflict a serious injury upon underwriters, by depriving them of all chance of being restored to the property condemned, or its value, at a reasonable salvage, through the instrumentality of the insured, or their agents, who would never become purchasers where no ray of hope was left them, of being permitted to enjoy any benefit by the purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">It is alleged, that unless the assured committed a fraud upon the underwriters, by an excessive valuation, they have no just ground to complain of the exercise of the right now claimed by the Insurance Company. But is the allegation well founded? Is it just, that the assured should receive their ship at the port of condemnation, at her full value, where she may be so surrounded by perils and \u25a0difficulties, as not to be worth one-half of what she was, at the port of departure ; or would have been, at the port of destination, to which her safe arrival had been guarantied ? If in the navigation of the <em>Budget </em>from <em>Porto Rico to Baltimore, or </em>in attempting to complete the voyage insured, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>after the purchase, she had been lost by any of the perils insured against, could <em>Thompson fy Bathurst </em>have recovered, not only the entire valuation in the policy, but in addition thereto, the purchase money paid for the ship ? Or indeed any thing but the loss, which had accrued to the time of the purchase? Unquestionably not. Is there then no ground for complaint, no hardship in the case, that <em>Thompson of Bathurst </em>after paying a full premium of indemnity for an entire voyage, should not be covered by the policy, for more than one-half of it ? That by legal presumption, they are to be held, as restored to their property, which by necessary implication revives the policy for the voyage; and yet,that they are entitled to no further protection under it? The law raises presumptions to subserve the ends of justice ; never to work such absurdity and injustice as would follow the presumption now insisted on.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">That the election of the assurer to adopt the purchase, should be made without delay, after the knowledge of the sale, is so forcibly enjoined by the plainest dictates of reason and justice, that it can hardly be necessary to invoke, either reason, argument, or illustration, to its support. He surely ought not to be permitted to lie by, and speculate on contingencies, at the risk and cost of the assured. If the vessel arrive in safety from the port of sale, having evaded the perils by which she was beset, and turns out upon minute inspection to be of greater value than the price paid for her, or if she has earned freight, or been profitably employed, or there has been an improvement in the price of ships, then will the assurer claim the advantages of the purchase. But on the other hand, if the vessel should be unprofitably employed, lost, damaged, or from any other cause, become of less value than when sold, \u00bfhen would all the burthen be cast on the shoulders of the insured. With the re-purchase it would be alleged they had no concern. This would be playing a safe game for the underwriters, but a ruinous one to the assured, and wholly inconsistent with that frankness and fair dealing which pervades every branch of insurance law. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number><em>dictum </em>of Ld. <em>Mansfield </em>in <em>Goss and Withers, </em>to the extent now attempted to enforce it, has not been confirmed by any subsequent <em>English </em>adjudication: on the contrary, it is in direct opposition to the law, as admitted by <em>Ld. Kenyon, </em>and the counsel on both sides, in the case of <em>McMasters vs. Shoolbred, </em>1 <em>Esp. Rep. </em>237.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">But concede for the moment that we are in error in the views we have stated, and that the general rule as established in <em>New York </em>be correct; viz: that the insurers have a right to regard a purchase of the subject matter of insurance, by the insured or their agents, after its condemnation, as a waiver of the abandonment, and a conversion of the total, into a partial loss. If the insurers agree that such purchase shall not be a waiver of the abandonment, and the assured unequivocally evince his intention not to waive it; or if by the acts of both parties, it plainly appears, that it was not the intention of either, that it should he so regarded; would the abandonment then be waived ? Certainly not. The right of the underwriter so to regard it, is of that class of rights, which may be waived, or insisted on, at the election of their possessor. Did they elect to waive their right in this case ? In our opinion the proof sufficiently establishes that fact. On the J2th of March, 1823, <em>Thompson &amp;f Bathurst </em>address a note to the underwriters, stating the receipt of advice from captain <em>Meany, </em>that he had purchased the <em>Budget </em>after her being condemned, and drawn on them for the amount; and desiring to know, if they might calculate on receiving from the appellants the amount insured in their office, at the time stipulated in the policy, ninety days from proof of loss. The nature of this communication cannot have been misinterpreted. It was an explicit avowal of a claim for the whole \u201camount insured,\u201d for a total loss; and it was so understood by the underwriters, who in their answer of the same <em>dale </em>reply, \u201cthat not having seen captain <em>Meany\u2019a </em>protest, we eannot satisfactorily make you a reply, because on it mainly depends the ground for payment, which (when presented) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>if found in order, the loss is payable ninety days after proof and adjustment thereof.\u201d They do not, in this letter, intimate any claim to the ship which had been purchased, or that instead of paying as demanded of them, the whole \u201camount insured,\u201d by reason of the purchase for the owners, their liability was limited to the price at which the ship was sold. The notice of abandonment had been given on the 6th of February, 1823, accompanied by a certified copy of the condemnation.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The object to be attained by the production of the protest, was to ascertain whether they were responsible at all; not what was the measure of their responsibility. It could not possibly give any information as to the purchase, having been made long anterior. On the 7th of May, (the ninety days mentioned in the policy having expired) payment was again demanded of the Insurance Company, which they declined for want of documents to prove the loss : alleging, that \u201cas the vessel is now here, no doubt they can be produced.\u201d On the gist of May, the insured, after having presented all the documents they had received, address the underwiters a third time, urging the settlement of the loss, and offering to procure in a reasonable time, if possible, any other documents which might be deemed necessary to elucidate the condemnation of the ship. On the 24th of May the Insurance Company reply to this communication, offering to advance to the insured $4498 75, upon their and <em>Robert Oliver\u2019s </em>joint note at six months, bearing interest; and requiring them at the expiration of that time, or sooner, to furnish the following documents relative to the ship Budget, viz: the proceedings of the Court at <em>Porto Rico ; </em>the log book, or authenticated copy thereof ; the charter party, or an authenticated copy: upon receipt of which, and their proving satisfactory, an adjustment of the loss was to take place. This proposition was. manifestly made, (in accordance with usuge) that the insured might sustain no injury by delay, but be put in possession of the identical amount he would be entiled to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>ceive, upon producing the documents required, or as they alleged, customary proof o\u00ed loss; upon the production of which, if satisfactory, the note demanded, was to be cancel-led or given up. <em>Thompson 8f </em>Bathurst, in their letter to the underwriters of the 26th of May, say, \u201cwe consider the proofs already handed you, as fully establishing the capture and condemnation of the ship <em>Budget; </em>still, we do not hesitate in trying to procure the documents you have pointed out, and have therefore written for them by a vessel that sailed yesterday for <em>Porto </em>Rico. We should esteem it an accommodation, your now paying us the loss, in the same manner the <em>Phoenix </em>insurance Company have done, viz: by giving our note for the same at six months date, with interest, <em>being as a security for our procuring such further documents as may be requisite ; </em>but we prefer forfeiting that temporary advantage, to giving a note in the manner you prescribe.\u201d On the 28th of May, the Insurance Company, in their answer to the last preceding letter, state, \u201cthat the proofs produced in the case of the ship <em>Budget </em>are not satisfactory, or such as are usually produced by the assured, in similar cases, to entitle the assured to claim a total loss. On that score we beg leave to refer you to our letter of the 24th, and what we verbally communicated some time ago. With respect to an accommodation, we have no objection to grant one to the extent treated of in our last, on your note with satisfactory security; which is in conformity with the custom of this company, and from which we cannot deviate ; at the same time, we wish you to understand, that it is neither meant nor intended, as paying a loss, which in our opinion, is not fully established. Should you not approve of our terms, you will of course have to wait until the documents sent for are received, and when received, if satisfactory to this company, no unnecessary delay will be made in paying the loss.\u201d All the documents furnished, and those demanded, were for the purpose of satisfying the underwriters, whether they were liable for any loss. They could throw no light upon the question, whether their lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>bility was for a total, or partial loss. But for the purchase, made by captain <em>Meany </em>for the owners, that question could never have arisen. The loss could not have been otherwise than total. With respect to this purchase, the documents sought for were known to be silent. Of the purchase, information had been given by the assured in their note of the 12th of March, 1823, and no further intelligence on that subject had been required. On that head the underwriters were satisfied. Their only dissatisfaction, their only objection to pay, as for a total loss, was, that the customary proof of loss, showing any liability on their part, had not been furnished. And to indemnify the assured for the delay in the payment of their claim, they proposed to them the grant of a loan, for the precise amount insured, after deducting the premium note, and $1 25, the cost of the policy, cautiously providing that this accommodation should not be regarded \u201cas paying a loss,\u201d solely on the ground, that a liability on their part had not been fully established. If they had designed, in the event of their being held responsible for the loss, to take to themselves the benefit of captain <em>Meany\u2019s </em>purchase, they ought, within a reasonable time after it was made known to them, to have announced their determination to do so. Had this been done, <em>Thompson Sf Bathurst </em>might have repudiated the purchase made on their behalf, as they were under no legal obligation to sanction it. They had a right to conclude, nay, they could draw no other conclusion from their correspondence with the underwriters, than that they were to be paid as for a total loss, as soon as they could make it appear that they had a right to recover any thing. By such conduct, the underwriters are to be regarded as having waived the privilege of taking the purchase of <em>Meany </em>to themselves, or of relying on it as a waiver of the abandonment. To permit them to do so at the time, and under the circumstances in which they claim to exercise this right, would be a fraud upon the assured; an act of injustice towards them which no judicial tribunal should countenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Concurring with the County Court, in their opinion on all the exceptions on the part of the defendants below, as far as concerns their appeal, we affirm the judgment; but dissenting from the opinions on the exceptions taken by the plaintiffs below, on their appeal the judgment is reversed, and judgment entered according to the agreement of the par <em>ties set forth </em>in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">JUDGMENT ENTERED ACCORDINGLY AS FOR A TOTAL LOSS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
