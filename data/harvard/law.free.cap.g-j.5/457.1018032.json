Issue was joined upon both pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-14\">1. At the trial the defendant contended, that in as much as he had justified the language charged to him in the declaration, the affirmative of the issue was upon him, and that he had a right to open and close the argument before the jury. But the court (Key, A. J.) refused the application, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>2. The plaintiff then offered to read, from the printed pamphlet referred to and made a part of the defendant\u2019s first plea, various paragraphs in the said pamphlet, as the thirty-nine articles of accusation, made by the defendant against the plaintiffs, before the publication of the said pamphlet, as evidence that the defendant had written the said thirty-nine articles, and sent them to the plaintiff, <em>Peter Gough, </em>and that consequently the defendant was the aggressor in the controversies, which had led to the publication of that pamphlet. To the reading of which thirty-nine articles for that purpose, the defendant objected, and insisted that the plaintiff had no right to read said pamphlet, or any part thereof, except for the purpose of explaining his, the plaintiff\u2019s meaning and intention, by such parts of said pamphlet as contained abusive, and defamatory words in application to the defendant. But the court (Stephen, Ch. J., and Key, A. J.) was of opinion, that by the introduction of the said pamphlet into the defendant\u2019s plea, the whole pamphlet was in evidence before the jury, and that the plaintiffs had a right to read the said thirty-nine articles, for the purpose aforesaid. The defendant excepted, and the verdict and judgment being against him, he brought the record upon appeal before this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b460-5\">The cause was argued before Buchanan, Ch. J., and Earle, Martin, and Dorsey, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b460-6\"><em>A. C. Magruder </em>for the appellant, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b460-7\">1. The first plea did not authorise the plaintiffs reading the pamphlet written by one of them. It does not appear that the defendant attempted to support said plea, or offered any proof touching said pamphlet, alleged to have been written by plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b460-8\">2. It does not appear, that any attempt was made by the defendant to prove the plaintiff the aggressor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b460-9\">3. But if the defendant had offered it (the pamphlet) in evidence, the plaintiff\u2019s own pamphlet is not evidence, that the defendant had said or done any thing.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number><em>V. II. </em>Dorsey, for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-5\">1. According to the established practice in the <em>Maryland </em>courts, the plaintiff on the record has the right to open and conclude the argument; and the rule is a very convenient one, as it dispenses with many troublesome inquiries. If however, it cannot be considered as settled, it is at all events, a matter resting in the discretion of the courts, and of course is not the subject of review on appeal. <em>Hawkins vs. </em>Jackson, 6 <em>Harr. and Johns. </em>151, <em>note (a.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-6\"><em>2. </em>By introducing a part of the plaintiff\u2019s pamphlet in the plea, the whole was made evidence. <em>Roscoe\u2019s Ev. </em>32. <em>Bul.
