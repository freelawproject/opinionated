The lease reserved the usual right to re-enter for non-payment of rent, but contained no agreement in relation to the payment of taxes. In an action of covenant brought upon this lease in 1828, it was Held, that the taxes assessed upon, and chargeable against the demised premises, were due from, and payable by the lessee or his assigns, and that he could not set-off a payment of taxes, against a claim for rent.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b74-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Appeal from <em>Baltimore </em>County Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-5\">This was an action of Covenant, commenced by the appellee against the appellant, on the 1st of September, 1828, on an indenture of lease; the plaintiff being the heir at law of the lessor, and the defendant the assignee of lessee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-6\">The following statement of facts was submitted for the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-7\">It is agreed between the parties in this case, that, on the 5th day of August, 1780, the following lease was executed, by and between the parties thereto. \u201cThis indenture, made this 5th of August, 1780, between <em>Charles Ridgely, </em>of <em>John, </em>of, &amp;c. of the one part, and <em>James </em>Lyston, of, &amp;c. of the other part; witnesseth, that the aforesaid C. <em>R. </em>in consideration of the rents and performance of the covenants hereinafter mentioned, on the part of the said <em>J.

In witness whereof, the parties have hereto set their hands, and affixed their seals., the day and year above written.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-5\">It is fui\u2019ther agreed, that the plaintiff was, from before the 1st day of January, 1825, thenceforth, and at this time, is legally vested with all the right, title and interest in and to the premises in said lease described, which the said <em>C. R. </em>possessed, immediately after the execution of the said lease, and that the defendant was, before the said 1st day of January, 1825, thenceforth, and now is vested with all the right, title and interest, which the said <em>J. L. </em>had immediately after the execution of the said lease. It is also agreed, that the premises are wholly unimproved ; that the same have been, for the purpose of taxation, assessed by <em>the </em>proper authority at the sum of $448, which assessment is always <em>one-fifth </em>of the actual value of the property, when assessed. And further, that improvements on property are always assessed separately from the land itself. It is further agreed, that in regard to the premises in question, the defendant is the party in fact, against whom the taxes hereinafter mentioned, during the period alluded to, have been charged. It is admitted that there remains due and in arrear, the sum of $214, with an average interest from the 1st day of July, 1828, for rent stated and reserved in and by the lease aforesaid, to be payable thereby. And it is further admitted, that there has been paid by the defendant, for taxes assessed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>upon the premises, since the 1st of January, 1825, the sum of $51 56, in equal, or nearly equal annual payments.\u2014 Upon the foregoing statement, the following questions are submitted to this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-5\">First, are the taxes assessed upon and chargeable against the premises aforesaid, due from, and payable by the plaintiff or the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-6\"><em>Second, if </em>the whole of the taxes is not payable by either party, what portion is payable by the plaintiff, and what portion for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-7\">It is further agreed, that the court shall enter up judgment, either for the whole of the rent stated to be in arrear, or for such balance as shall, by thezn be decided to be due, according to their decision upon the foregoing question; it is finally agreed, that all errors in the pleadings be mutually released, and that either party, or both parties may appeal to the Court of Appeals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-8\">On the preceding statement of facts, the County Court gave judgment for the whole amount of the plaintiff\u2019s \"claim, being $214, with interest from the 1st of July, 1828, and costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-9\">From this judgment, the defendant prosecuted the present appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b77-10\">The cause was argued before Buchanan, Ch. J., Stephen, and Doksey, J,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b77-11\"><em>Walsh, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-12\">The question is, whether the owner of the fee, or the tenant, the lessee, is liable for taxes levied on the demised premises. He contended that they were payable by the former, and if the tenant paid them, he could set them off in an action of covenant, brought by the landlord for his rent. <em>Woodfall's Land, and </em>Tenant, 275, 6, 7. Act of 1812, <em>ch. </em>191, <em>sec. </em>36. <em>Graham vs. Wade, </em>16 <em>East. </em>29. It is not said in the case stated, that the property in question, improved in value from the date of the lease, in 1780, to 1825. The assessment appears to been made upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>unimproved land. In reference to the public, the tenant is no doubt responsible for the taxes; and being consequently obliged to pay them, the right to discount the amount from the landlord\u2019s rent, would seem to be clear.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b78-5\"><em>Williams </em>and Johnson, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b78-6\">1. This being a case stated, the court can <em>infer </em>nothing. The judgment must be according to the facts expressly alledged. <em>Hysinger vs. Baltzell, </em>3 <em>Gill and Johns. </em>158. And the question therefore is, has a lessee in any case of this kind, a right to deduct taxes paid by him, imposed for State, or local purposes, from the rent due his landlord.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b78-7\">It does not appear whether the taxes were imposed for State or city purposes; nor whether they were levied under the act of 1817, <em>ch. </em>148, or the act <em>of 1812, ch. </em>191. In regard to the taxes in virtue of the act of 1817, the lessor is never answerable, though he is for those imposed under the act of 1812; and as the statement does not .say, under which of these laws the taxes in question were levied, the judgment must be affirmed. <em>Mayor and City Council vs. Chase, </em>2 <em>Gill and Johns. </em>376.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b78-8\">2. There is no obligation on the part of the landlord, to pay the whole amount of the taxes, either on the original, or appreciated value of the property. Even if there had been an express <em>covenant by the </em>landlord <em>to pay taxes, </em>still the tenant would be responsible for that portion, <em>which </em>accrued in consequence of an enhancement on the value of the property subsequent to the lease. The value of the property as ascertained by the lease, would be the measure of the landlord\u2019s responsibility. Watson <em>vs. Atkins, </em>3 <em>Barn. and Ald. </em>647. <em>Watson vs. Home, </em>14 <em>Serg. and Low. 45. The act </em>of 1812, <em>ch. </em>191, <em>sec. </em>36. 1785, <em>ch. 53, 1797, ch. </em>89, <em>sec. </em>41. <em>Woodfall's Land, and Tent. </em>276.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b78-9\">But upon such a lease as the present, the landlord is not liable for any portion of the taxes. The question arises upon the covenants of the defendant, and not those of the landlord, who only covenants for quiet enjoyment. This covenant then, is to be taken most strongly against the co<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>venantor. <em>Woodfall, </em>369. 1 <em>Wheat. Selw. </em>376. <em>Wagner vs. White, </em>4 <em>Harr. and Johns. </em>564.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-6\">The convenant here is, that the lessee will pay a certain amount of rent annually to the landlord, and there is nothing in the contract to qualify this engagement, or to discharge the tenant <em>pro </em>tanto, if he is made to pay taxes to the government. Nothing hut an express stipulation would entitle the plaintiff to deduct these taxes. <em>Fowler vs. Bott, </em>6 <em>Massa Rep. </em>63.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-7\">Leases like the present, are considered as sales of the property for the term, and the tenant is bound for all burdens which may be imposed on it during that period. If the taxes are reduced, he is relieved; if increased, he must bear the burthen. If the property enhances in value, he enjoys the advantage; if it depreciates, it is his loss.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-8\">If the landlord is liable for the taxes, then if they should be so increased as to exceed the amount of the rent, the latter would be entirely extinguished; which is a result, to which the court would not come, unless it was manifest that the parties intended to make a contract, from which such consequences might flow. No such stipulation is contained in the contract, and the court is called upon to interpolate it. If demised premises are destroyed by fire, the tenant is nevertheless bound for the rent, and the court cannot aid him; and if it is incompetent to do so in the case of a total destruction of the property, what pretence is there for the exercise of such a power, upon the ground of his being subjected to some additional burden. The same would be the case if a portion or even the whole of the premises should be condemned by the public, for public purposes. But the court, in this case, is not only called on to introduce a stipulation into the contract of the parties, throwing on the landlord a liability for taxes ; but it is asked to say, that the contract intended, that he should pay taxes imposed by a particular act of assembly\u2014the act of 1812.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-9\">The rule is, that the insertion of particular covenants, is an exclusion of all others ; and consequently, as the land<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>lord in this lease has eonvenanted for quiet enjoyment, and for further assurance, he is not by implication to be saddled with others.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-5\">This lease having been made in 1780, cannot be affected by the acts of 1785, and 1812, and is not to be construed with reference to their provisions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-6\">In England, leases made prior to the statute in reference to the land tax, do not subject the landlord to the payment of such tax, when the lease itself is silent on that subject. Leases made <em>since </em>the statute, are differently expounded, because the judges suppose such leases are made with reference to the law. <em>Bradbury vs </em>Wright, 2 Douglass, 624. Woodfall, 276. In some cases, a covenant to renew, makes the lease renewable for ever, but there can be no doubt of the present being a perpetually renewable lease. 5 <em>Bro. P. Cases, </em>519, 522. <em>Woodfall, </em>146, 204.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b80-7\"><em>Walsh, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-8\">In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the legal presumption is, that the tax was levied on the interest of the landlord. It cannot be inferred from the case stated, that the rent reserved, was exactly proportioned to that interest; and consequently, it cannot be known with certainty what the parties contemplated on the subject of the taxes. The rent may have been higher than it would otherwise have been, because of understanding at the time, that the landlord should pay the taxes. In the case stated, it is expressly said, that the property is unimproved, and as there is no distinction between improvements, resulting from natural or other causes, and improvements made by the tenant; it must be understood as meaning, that it was not improved in any way, or to any extent, and therefore, the taxes now in question, were levied on the original and unenhanced interest of the landlord.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-9\">The legal presumption is, that the taxes were imposed for the purposes of the State. <em>Woodfall, </em>254. <em>Doug. </em>614, 615.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>It is said that the act of 1817, exempts the landlord from taxation. This is not so ; though for the purpose of facilitating the collection of taxes, it authorises a resort to the occupier or his property. <em>Mayor and City Council of Balt. vs. Chase, </em>2 <em>Gill and Johns. </em>310, 381.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-5\">The question then is, whether taxes imposed for State purposes, and for the general good, are to be borne by the interest of one of the parties only, and the interest of the other is to be wholly exonerated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-6\">No case can be found in which such a lease as the present has been adjudged to be renewable for ever, looking only to the covenants contained in it, and disregarding the acts of the parties. <em>Woodfall, </em>146, 147. But be this as it may, it would seem a strange anomaly, that the interest of the landlord, distinct and palpable as it is, should be totally exempt from taxation, whilst that of the tenant is made to bear the whole burden of the government. The case in 14 <em>Serg. and Low. 45, </em>and all the eases cited on the other side, only show, that the landlord is not liable for taxes on the <em>improved </em>value of the property, and this because he does not enjoy the benefit of such improved value.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b81-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
