That judgment was affirmed by this court, and a <em>fieri facias </em>was sued out, which was returned by the sheriff, \u201clevied as per schedule, and not sold for want of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>bidders.\u201d Whereupon a <em>venditioni exponas </em>was issued j which was returned by the sheriff, \u201cnot sold by order of the plaintiffs.\u201d A suit was afterwards instituted by the appellees upon the appeal bond, against <em>Kemp, </em>and <em>Sasscer </em>his surety, which is brought up upon appeal by <em>Sasscer </em>\u25a0alone.

To this rejoinder there is a general demurrer, and judgment on the demurrer for the appellees.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-5\">The cause was submitted on notes to Buchanan, Oh.

The appellees, the plaintiffs below, having entered a general demurrer to the defendant\u2019s rejoinder, the judgment of the County Court should have been for the defendants, the first error in the pleading, having been committed by the plaintiffs. The suit was instituted by the plaintiffs, as executors of <em>William Walker; </em>yet the declaration states the bond declared on, to have been executed to \u2022 the plaintiffs, in their individual capacity. To this, the defendants pleaded performance, and the plaintiffs reply in their capacity of executors; alleging, as a breach, that the judgment mentioned in the condition of the bond, and which had been obtained by the plaintiffs as executors of <em>William </em>Walker, had been affirmed by the Court of Appeals, &amp;c. To this the defendants rejoined, as set forth in the record, and to their rejoinder, there was a general demurrer by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>The appellants contend, even if it should be conceded, that the rejoinder was not sufficient in law to sustain the issue on their part, still, the judgment should not have been against them, when the plaintiffs had previously committed so many errors, and departures in pleading. The suit had been brought by the plaintiffs in their <em>capacity of </em>executors, and yet, they declare on a bond executed to them in their individual capacity. For although they are described in the bond, as executors of <em>Walker, </em>still it was in <em>fact, </em>given <em>to them </em>in their individual capacity, and their being mentioned as executors, could only be considered as <em>descriplio personae, </em>and they have declared on it in their own right. To the plea of performance, they came back again in the replication to their starting position, and reply as executors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-4\">g. But the rejoinder of the defendants was sufficient in law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-5\">The allegation contained therein, that the sheriff had returned the <em>venditioni exponas, </em>\u201cnot sold by order of plaintiffs,\u201d was sufficient for that purpose. When property is taken by the sheriff to satisfy a debt, it is his bounden duty to proceed to sell, and he is answerable for the property until it is sold. He has a qualified interest in it, until he can sell; and the very moment the plaintiff directs the sheriff to return the property, or stops him in the legal discharge of his duty, without the positive assent of the defendant, by interfering and directing property levied on, not to be sold, the law will raise a presumption, that the debt has been satisfied. For such au order operates to release the sheriff from all liability for the property taken; and of course, if the defendant had given no assent thereto, it must release him from all further liability for the debt.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b111-6\"><em>A. C. Magruder, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-7\">The first error in the declaration, it is alleged, consists in this; that the suit was instituted by the plaintiffs, \u201cas executors of <em>William </em>WalkerWith respect to this objection, it might well be questioned, whether the plaintiffs below <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>had not a right to sue as <em>executors. </em>The bond was given to them as executors, and could only be given to them in that character. It was to remove a judgment obtained by them as executors, and the amount of which, whenever recovered, whether upon the appeal bond, or on the original judgment, constitutes a part of the assets of the estate of their intestate. The most that can be said of it, is, that it is a superfluous description, and not an error which the law will notice. 1 <em>Chitty Plead. </em>252.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-5\">2. The condition of the bond sued on has not been performed, as is admitted by the rejoinder; why then have the plaintiffs no remedy upon it? Unquestionably, the law gave them a right to put it in suit, <em>eo instanti, </em>the judgment was affirmed. They might also issue an execution on the judgment, which they have done, and the question is, does the exercise of this latter right deprive them of their remedy on the bond ? The plaintiffs certainly could not recover the money twice, and a sale of the property would have been a payment <em>pro tanto </em>of the claim. The return of the sheriff however, is not evidence of payment of any part of it, and is not pleaded as a payment. Even if the sheriff had actually made the money, after the institution of the suit upon the bond, it might have been relied on to show, that we were only entitled to nominal damages, not that the defendants were entitled to a judgment for costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-6\">A party may at the same time sue on an injunction and appeal bond, relative to the same claim. The plaintiff does not claim the same thing in his action, and under his execution. In the former, he claims damages for the breach of the condition of the bond. The notion is, that the party has an election, either to issue an execution, or sue upon the appeal bond, and must elect between the two remedies; and that the election of the one, is the abandonment of the other. It will not do to say, that the remedy by action on the bond is not gone, but is only suspended. \u201cA thing or action personal once suspended, is for ever suspended. <em>Jacob's Law. Die. </em>title suspensions. <em>Croke </em>Chas. 373.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>A mortgagee may at the same time, proceed in ejectment to recover the land, and upon the bond to recover the mortgage debt. So in this case, the plaintiffs had a right to their execution for the debt and costs, and to his action on the appeal bond to recover <em>damages, </em>for not prosecuting the appeal with effect. <em>Southcote vs. Braithwaite, </em>1 <em>Term.

Wherever the money when recovered, would be assets in the hands of the executor, he may sue in his representative capacity. 5 <em>Co. Rep. </em>31. <em>King and others vs. Thorn. </em>1 <em>Term. Rep. </em>265, (487.)</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">In <em>Hosier vs. Lord Arundel, </em>3 <em>Bos. and Pul. </em>7, decided in the year 1802, a different notion seems to have been entertained; but afterwards in the year 1805, in <em>Cowell and wife vs. Watts, </em>6 <em>East. </em>405, the court of <em>Kings Bench </em>returned to the old rule, <em>\u201c that </em>where money when recovered would be assets, the executor may declare for it in his representative character,\u201d accompanied by an expression of regret, that it had ever been departed from. And the same rule is recognized, and treated as settled law, in 1 <em>Saunders Pl. and Ev. </em>610, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The bond upon which this suit was brought, being given to the appellees as the executors of <em>William Walker'1 s </em>will, on an appeal from a judgment obtained by them in that character against <em>Kemp, </em>the money when recovered, will be assets their hands. They had a right therefore <em>to sue </em>in their representative capacity; and considering this suit as brought in that character, it was properly brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">We come then to the rejoinder, the matter of which is clearly no sufficient bar to the action. Every word of it may be true, (and which the demurrer admits,) and yet the appellees be entitled to recover. They were under no obligation to entitle them to proceed upon the appeal bond, to have issued a <em>fieri facias, </em>or <em>venditioni exponas; </em>and when issued, there was nothing to prevent their countermanding either of them, without impairing their right to put the appeal bond in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>The mere taking the property under the <em>fieri </em>facias, was not itself equivalent to payment, and did not amount to a satisfaction of the judgment. The plaintiff might have countermanded the <em>venditioni </em>exponas, and restored the property at the instance, and for the accommodation of the defendant in the judgment, without having received payment of, or satisfaction for any part of it; and no payment, satisfaction or discharge is alleged in the rejoinder, which is no answer to the replication assigning the breaches of the condition of the bond; which was, that Kemp, the defendant in the judgment appealed from, should prosecute the appeal with effect, and in case the judgment should be affirmed, pay to the appellees, executors, &amp;c. the debt, damages, &amp;c. The condition of the bond, as the rejoinder admits, was not performed. The appeal was not prosecuted with effect, and the return of the sheriff did not amount to a payment, and satisfaction of the judgment according to the condition of the bond, and is not pleaded as such. If the appellees had taken issue on the rejoinder, the only matter referred to the jury would have been, whether a <em>fieri facias, </em>and <em>venditioni exponas, </em>were issued and returned as alleged in the rejoinder, which may well have been, yet the judgment remained altogether unsatisfied, either in fact, or in contemplation of law. The demurrer therefore to the rejoinder in this case was properly sustained. In <em>Southcote vs. Braithwaite, 1 Term. Rep. </em>624, it was decided that bail in error, could not surrender the principal, but were liable at all events, in case the judgment was affirmed, and not entitled to be relieved, though the principal became bankrupt pending the writ of error. And in <em>Perkins vs. Pettit and Yale, </em>2 <em>Bos. and Pul. </em>440, which was a much stronger case than this, it was held upon general demurrer to be perfectly clear, that if a defendant in error, upon the judgment being affirmed, take into execution the body of the plaintiff in error, for the debt, damages and costs in error, he does not thereby discharge the bail in error, but may sue them upon their recognizance.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>But instead of swearing a jury of enquiry, which should have been done, on the demurrer to the rejoinder being ruled good; the court below proceeded to enter up a final judgment for the appellees, (the plaintiffs there,) which is clearly an error, for which the judgment would be reversed, were we not restrained by the act of 1825, <em>ch. 117, sec. </em>1, which provides, that <em>\u201c </em>the Court of .Appeals shall not reverse any judgment, on any <em>point, or question, which shall not appear to have been presented to the County Court, and upon which that court may have rendered judgment. </em>And it does not appear that any <em>point </em>or <em>question </em>relating to, or involved in the final judgment was presented, and decided by the County Court. It is not like the case of <em>Charlotte Hall School vs. Greenwell, 4 Gill &amp; Johns. </em>407, where there was a motion in arrest of judgment, which presented to the court the question, whether any judgment should be rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
