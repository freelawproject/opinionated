The question was reserved whether evidence offered by the defendant is admissible to show that John B.

A. </em>Hibbard, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMB\">Under the statute of uses the <em>cestui que use </em>becomes the legal owner of the land in such a case. As the use and the land became now convertible terms, they became liable to dower, courtesy, and escheat. 2 Bl. Com. 333. John B. Eaton obtained \u201cthe legal estate. The use was executed in him by the statute.\u201d <em>Upham </em>v. Varney, 15 N. H. 467. \u201c In such cases the statute of uses, which is in force in this state, executes the use, and the legal estate, by force of said statute, vests in the <em>cestui que use.\u201d Hayes </em>v. <em>Tabor, </em>41 N. H. 521, 526. If it is suggested that the equitable title held by the demand-ant in <em>Hutchins </em>v. <em>Heywood, 50 </em>N. H. 491, was derived under a levy of an execution against the <em>cestui que use, </em>instead of under a conveyance from him, it may be answered that there is no reason why that circumstance should alter the rule of evidence. There would be no more necessity for equitable proceedings in one case than in the other.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b522-15\">Stanley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcT\">The evidence is competent. <em>Hutchins </em>v. <em>Heywood, 50 </em>N.
