And he is entitled to partition without entry, actual possession, or judgment in a writ of entry, and notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s actual and exclusive possession. The plaintiff\u2019s title and right of possession are sufficient for the maintenance of this action without a technical seizin not included in his title and right. In this state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>the ancient doctrine of entry and seizin is largely obsolete. The plaintiff claims another fifth under a levy of an execution on a mortgagor\u2019s equity of redemption. But the mortgage has been foreclosed, and its covenants are effective as an estoppel against the mortgagor. <em>Fletcher </em>v. Chamberlin, 61 N. H. 438. After twenty years the mortgage debt was presumed to be <em>paid; </em>but the presumption is a disputable one, and the fact is found that the debt was not paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The defendant claims all the land under tax titles which he has bought: but they are not a bar to this or any other real action in which the plaintiff\u2019s judgment may contain a condition requiring him to contribute his share of what the defendant has paid. There will be an accounting at the trial term, and a decree for a partition assigning the plaintiff one fifth of the land when he pays into court the amount equitably due from him for taxes paid 'and tax titles bought by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b508-7\"><em>\u25a0 </em>Carpenter, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
