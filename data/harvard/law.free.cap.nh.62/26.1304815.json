Sheriff Flanders attempted to preserve Iris attachment by trusteeing the other partner, and went away leaving each partner in ^possession of his goods and keys, with no notice posted of any attachment. According to our decisions, this was sufficient to preserve the attachment. A second sheriff\u2019s right to make a subsequent attachment of the same interest in the partnership stands like a second attachment of chattels in the hands of a third person as trustee, or a second attachment of real estate or bulky articles.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-8\">The plaintiff cannot maintain his action, because, if the defendant\u2019s attachment was not good, it was because the property was in Sheriff Flanders\u2019s possession, and it was so found by the referee. The gist of the action is disturbance of possession. <em>Jewell </em>v. Mahood, 44 N. H. 474; <em>Brown </em>v. Manter, 22 N. H. 472; <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Greorge, </em>7 N. H. 306; <em>Anderson </em>v. Nesmith, 7 N. H. 167. According to the report, the only person whose possession was disturbed was Sheriff Flanders, and he is the only person who could maintain this action. He makes no claim; the referee finds nothing to show damage to him, or that he ever objected in any way to the defendant\u2019s possession of the store with him. The plaintiff cannot maintain this action, because everything that the defendant did wms with the consent and assistance of FT. Russell, an equal owner with the plaintiff. The right to occupy this <em>locus in quo </em>was in Russell &amp; Fellows equally. Russell, then, having this undisturbed right to the possession of this <em>locus </em>equally with the plaintiff, preferred to have his private property pay private debts first, and admitted the defendant to attach his interest, and assisted him in all he did afterwards. No attempt was ever made by the defendant or Russell to exclude Fellows from an equal possession with them. The case shows no act that would sustain trespass <em>qu. d. </em>if the original entry was lawful; and this the referee\u2019s finding would seem to admit. If a person have authority, in fact, to make an entry, and the party exceed that authority, he will not, be liable in <em>trespass quare clausum. Jewell </em>v. Mahood, 44 N. H. 474; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Manter, </em>22 N. H. 472. The case shows that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>the plaintiff\u2019s damages, if any, were as a member of tbe firm of Russell &amp; Fellows, and the action should have been brought in their names. If the plaintiff can recover, it would make the defendant pay Russell indirectly for damages as a trespasser when he consented to the act, and assisted in it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-5\"><em>W. W. Flanders </em>and <em>H. W.

Flanders, a deputy sheriff, having a writ against Russell, attached his interest in the partnership property, took possession of. the store, and made the plaintiff his keeper. The defendant, another deputy sheriff, against the plaintiff\u2019s objection and with knowledge of what Flanders had done, with Russell\u2019s consent who opened the store, attached or undertook to attach the same goods, paying no attention to Flanders\u2019s attachment, and putting in a keeper of his own. Subsequently, the defendant surrendered possession of the store and stock of goods, and Flanders, by consent of Russell\u2019s creditors, sold the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">By Flanders\u2019s attachment of the goods on a writ against Russell, Russell was excluded from the possession. When the goods were attached, the plaintiff, who was joint owner of the goods with Russell, by becoming the sheriff\u2019s keeper, surrendered his possession as owner, and had possession of the store and goods as the sheriff\u2019s keeper. He was bailee of the officer making the attachment, and as such might maintain trespass against any one who interfered with or disturbed his possession. <em>Poole </em>v. <em>Symonds, </em>1 N. H. <em>289; Hartford </em>v. Jackson, 11 N. H. 145, 147. The plaintiff, having surrendered his possession of the goods as owner, that an attachment might be made, the attachment gave Flanders a valid lien on the goods to the extent of Russell\u2019s interest, and a second attachment could not be made by another officer while the. goods were in the possession of Flanders or the plaintiff as his keeper. <em>Odiorne </em>v. Colley, 2 N. H. 70; <em>Sinclair </em>v. Tarbox, 2 N. H. 135. Russell, being excluded from the possession by the first attachment, could not, by any act or consent of his, let in the defendant so that a valid attachment could be made by him. Even if the property had come back to the hands of the debtor, Russell, there being no design to relinquish the first attachment, the defendant, having knowledge of a subsisting attachment, could acquire no rights by a seizure of the goods against the first attachment. <em>Young </em>v. Walker, 12 N. H. 502, 507. <em>Carpenter v. </em>Cummings, 40 N. H. 158, 171; <em>Houston </em>v. Blake, 43 N. H. 115, 117; <em>Cooper </em>v. Newman, 45 N. H. 339, 342. The plaintiff, being in possession of the property as keeper of an officer having a valid attachment, is entitled to a l\u2019ecovery against the defendant for the disturbance of that possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">The plaintiff cannot recover damage as owner of the goods. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Having, as ownei\u2019, consented to the first attachment, any damage to him by reason of the disturbance of the business and loss of trade cannot be recovered; and the goods and possession of the store being returned to him by the defendant, no special damage to him, as keeper, is shown. On the facts reported, the plaintiff can recover only nominal damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\"><em>Judgment on the report for nominal </em>damages.</p>\n<judges id=\"b39-6\">Stanley, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
