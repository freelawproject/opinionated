Facts found by a referee. August 25,1871, the defendants, by deed containing full covenants of warranty, conveyed to the plaintiff a lot of land in Concord, particularly describing and bounding it. The north line is described as beginning at a particular point \u201c on said Warren street,\u201d and \u201c thence easterly by said street about 48 feet.\u201d The easterly line is described as extending by a given course \u201c about 35 feet\u201d southerly from Warren street. The deed also conveyed a right of passway on the easterly side of the premises'sixteen feet in width, \u201cand extending the distance of forty feet southerly from said Warren street, \u2014 meaning all the real estate and all interest and appurtenances. thereto connected, as were conveyed to said George Main by James R. Hill by deed dated Februai\u2019y 2, 1853.\u201d The defendants\u2019 deed to the plaintiff contains substantially the same descrip- \u2022 tion of the land and passway as is given in Hill\u2019s deed to Main.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-9\">June 4, 1860, while the defendants owned the premises, Warren street was legally widened and straightened in such a way that a narrow gore of land was taken from the northerly side of the premises. The breaches assigned relate to this gore of land between the old and new lines of the street, and to the extent of the passway southerly from the street. At the date of the defendants\u2019 deed to the plaintiff there was no visible boundary marking the southerly end of the passway.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b14-10\"><em>Tappan, Alb\u00edn Shurtleff, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AX\">The land conveyed by the defendants to the plaintiff is the same land which was conveyed by Hill to the defendant, George Main. The deed to the plaintiff says so in these words, viz., \u201cmeaning all. the real estate etc. conveyed to the said Main,\u201d etc. Such reference to a former deed makes it a part of the description in this deed. <em>Eastman </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>35 N. H. 551; <em>New Market M'f\u2019g Co. </em>v. <em>Pendergast, </em>24 N. H. 54; <em>Flagg </em>v. <em>Bean, </em>25 N. H. 60; 2 Wash. Real Prop. 638; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Bates, </em>9 Pick. 460; <em>Foss </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Crisp, 20 Pick. 121. Tlie first easterly bound is described in tbe deed as being about 35 feet long; and tbe same easterly bound is described in the deed of Hill to the defendants as being 35 feet long also. It is evident that, having the former deed before him, the grantor would have used some words denoting less than 35 feet if the parties had not in their minds that the land sold was the same as that described in the former deed. Although distance will not prevail against other certain description, yet, when there is a conflict between other descriptions, distance will help determine which is the true one. If the north bound is limited by the highway, as the defendants contend, then a long, thin, wedge-like piece of land in the travelled street will be left in the ownership of the defendants \u2014 a thing which the parties cannot be presumed to have intended. When the meaning of a deed is doubtful, it is to be construed most strongly against the grantor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-5\">The defendants claim that Warren street is a bound which will control all other descriptions. But we say it will not control when the contrary intent is evident. <em>Coburn </em>v. <em>Coxete.r, </em>51 N. H. 158, 163. Besides, there were no monuments which showed where the margin of Warren street was: and the court in this state, in all the cases where they have decided that bounds control the construction of deeds, have always emphasized the fact that in each case the bound was indicated on the ground by some monument. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>36 N. H. 571; <em>Breck </em>v. <em>Young, </em>11 N. H. 485 ; <em>Enfield </em>v. <em>Day, </em>11 N. H. 525; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Dodge, 2 </em>N. H. 303. Although it may not be necessary, in order to give effect to a bound, to have it indicated by monuments, still, the fact that such monuments are wanting, by which the purchaser can see with his eye just what he is buying, must weaken the controlling influence of the boundary as against other description.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-6\">One breach is, that the street is an incumbrance on the land conveyed by said deed, contrary to the covenants therein. <em>Prichard </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>3 N. H. 335; <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>11 N. H. 28. Another breach is, that the defendants by their deed undertook to grant a passway \u201c extending forty feet southerly from Warren street.\u201d The term \u201cfrom Warren street\u201d must mean from the margin of the street, because the grantor cannot be presumed to grant a right which the grantee has already in common with the public. The margin of Warren street being the point of beginning, a passway forty feet in length would extend several feet beyond the right then owned by the defendants. This passway is described only by distances, no bounds being mentioned except the point of beginning; and it is a principle well settled, that in such cases the courses and distances govern. <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Cawood, </em>3 H. &amp; M\u2019M. 415; <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Shenck, </em>2 Dev. Law. 415; <em>Conn </em>v. <em>Penn, </em>Pet. C. C. 496; <em>Hickman </em>v. <em>Tait, </em>Cooke, Tenn., 460; <em>Machias </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>16 Me. 347; <em>Blaney </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>20 Pick. 62; <em>Break </em>v. <em>Young, </em>11 N. H. 489.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b16-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number><em>J. Y. Mugridge </em>and <em>A. F. L. Norris, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9\">1. The true rule is, where there is a particular description in a deed, which is certain and definite, followed by a general description differing from the former, the particular description shall prevail. <em>Peaslee </em>v. <em>Gee, </em>19 N. H. 273; <em>Nutting </em>v. <em>Herbert, </em>35 N. H. 120. This rule, applied to the deed of Main and wife? to McShane, would carry the northerly line of the premises conveyed to the southerly line of Warren street, as Warren street was at the time of the conveyance, and not over or across any part of it; and the general description \u2014 \u201c meaning all the real estate and all interest and appurtenances thereto connected, as were conveyed to said George Main by James R. Hill by deed dated February 2, 1853 \u201d \u2014 must be rejected in any particular wherein it is inconsistent with the particular description. <em>Lovejoy </em>v. <em>Lovett, </em>124 Mass. 270.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-5\">2. It is otherwise with the passway. The particular description is imperfect or incomplete. The only bounds given to designate it in the particular description are, \u201c the easterly border of said premises\u201d on the west, and \u201cWarren street\u201d on the north. It is bounded on Warren street on the north, and on the easterly border of the premises on the west; but there are no distinct or definite boundaries showing its extent upon the south or east, as in the case of the premises conveyed. The general description, therefore, as said by the court in <em>Peaslee </em>v. <em>Gee, </em>before cited, must prevail, and fix and determine the extent of the passway on the east and on the south.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-6\">Whatever, therefore, the passway was in Hill\u2019s deed to Main,\u2014 southerly from the southerly line of Warren street, \u2014 Main and his wife conveyed to McShane. <em>Clap </em>v. <em>M\u2019Niel, </em>4 Mass. 589; <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>2 N. H. 287. Whether the passway is described in the deed of Main and wife as extending south from Warren street forty feet, or any other particular distance, it can really extend no further, because of the reference to the deed from Hill to Main, than the passway named in that deed in fact extended. See, also, <em>Flagg </em>v. <em>Bean, </em>25 N. H. 49. The southerly and easterly lines of the passway, by reference to the deed from Hill to Main, became monuments which control both course and distance in the passway conveyed by Main and wife to McShane. <em>Breck </em>v. Young, 11 N. H. 485; <em>Fnfield </em>v. <em>Day, </em>7 N. H. 457; <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Bass, </em>2 Mass. 380; <em>Folger </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>3 Pick. 401.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-7\">3. The words \u201csixteen feet\u201d and \u201cforty feet,\u201d as applied to the extent of the passway in the deed, are merely descriptive, and the grant was of a passway as it was then opened and used. In order, therefore, for McShane to maintain the action for covenant broken, he must show an express covenant that the passway extended forty feet southerly from Warren street. But the deed shows no such covenant. <em>Clap </em>v. <em>M\u2019Niel, </em>4 Mass. <em>589; Perkins </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>2 N. H. 287.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b17-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Stanley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AW\">The construction of a deed is the finding of the fact of the parties\u2019 intention from competent evidence. <em>Lane </em>v. Thompson, 43 N. H. 320, 324; <em>Richardson </em>v. Palmer, 38 N. H. 212, 218; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>36 N. H. 91, 93; <em>White </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>9 N. H. 126, 130; <em>Driscoll </em>v. <em>Green, </em>59 N. H. 101; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Holton, </em>20 Pick. 458, 463; <em>Worthington </em>v. <em>Hylyer, </em>4 Mass. 196; <em>Rice </em>v. Society, 56 N. H. 191, 197, 198, 203; <em>Houghton </em>v. <em>Pattee, </em>58 N. H. 326; <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>58 N. H. 391; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>58 N. H. 511. The description of the land in the deed as beginning at a given point \u201con Warren street,\u201d and \u201cthence easterly by said street forty-eight feet,\u201d included the land to the centre of the street as it then existed, subject to the easement of a public highway over a part of it. There is no evidence showing a contrary intention. <em>Reed\u2019s Petition, </em>13 N. H. 381, 384; <em>Woodman </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>54 N. H. 507, 511; <em>Sleeper v. Laconia, </em>60 N. H. 201; 3 Wash. Real Prop. 420. If it was the defendants\u2019 purpose to warrant the title to land which they did not own, by referring, in the description of the land conveyed, to a former southerly line of Warren street, the deed furnished little evidence of it. The parties are fairly presumed to have made their contract with reference to the property as it was then apparently located and bounded, and not as it may have existed at some former time. <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Palmer, supra; Dunklee </em>v. <em>Wilton Railroad, </em>24 N. H. 489. The object of the reference to Hill\u2019s deed, after the particular and unambiguous description of the premises, obviously was, not to give another and different description, or to extend the grant to land not owned by the grantors, but to show the grantors\u2019 chain of title, or to identify, in a general way, the land conveyed. <em>Lovejoy </em>v. <em>Lovett, </em>124 Mass. 270, 274; <em>Colby </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>41 N H. 301, 304; <em>Nutting </em>v. <em>Herbert, </em>85 N. H. 120, 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-9\">As the deed represented the passway as extending forty feet southerly from Warren street, and as there was no visible boundary indicating the southerly limit of it, the presumption is that the grantors meant what the language of the deed expresses, and intended to convey a passway forty feet in length from the margin of the street as then located upon the ground. A passway of that description would extend beyond the grantors\u2019 land, and there is, at least, a technical breach of their covenants. But if the parties understood that the defendants were conveying the rights purchased by them of Hill, subject to the modification in the boundaries caused b'y the widening of the street, the plaintiff\u2019s recovery of damages would be inequitable. The defendants, therefore, may move at the trial term for leave to amend their plea by filing a bill in equity to reform the deed. <em>Metcalf </em>v. <em>Grilmore, </em>59 N. H. 417, 432. If such an amendment be allowed, and if it appear, on a trial of the bill, that the parties understood the length of the passway had reference to the original and not the present line of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>the street, justice will be done by reforming the deed, and rendering judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-5\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b18-6\">Allen, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
