Winch against Sarah E. Bean and her husband, Charles W. Bean. Ifacts found by a referee. April 1, 1881, the plaintiff, being 76 years old, conveyed a four-acre lot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>of land to the defendant Sarah, and delivered all her personal property except her clothing to the defendants, to be held by them subject to the condition hereafter mentioned. On the same day the defendants conveyed to the plaintiff the same lot of land, and their own homestead, by a deed containing the following condition : \u201c if the said Sarah E. Bean and Charles W. Bean, their heirs, executors, and administrators, shall well and truly pay unto the said Dolly S. Winch, her heirs and assigns, the sum of one dollar each year during her natural life if she shall demand it, and furnish for her a good and sufficient home at their dwelling-house, wherever it may be, giving to her suitable meat, drink, clothing, lodging and nursing, caring for her in sickness and in health in such a way and manner as would be suitable for a woman of her age; also furnish for her a suitable nurse and fire when she may need it, and at her decease give her a suitable burial, and paying all bills for her support, doctoring, and any and all other bills that may be contracted to give her a suitable support for and during her natural life, then the foregoing deed is to be void.\u201d The plaintiff went to the defendants\u2019 house, and lived with them until November 23,1881, when she left. The defendant Charles treated her with such harshness and disrespect that she was justified in leaving, and it is not reasonable to ask her to return. The defendants excepted to a decree that the plaintiff\u2019s title to the four acre lot become absolute; that a writ of possession issue therefor; and that, within two months, the defendants return to her the personal property, .or pay her its value (fixed by the decree), and in. default thereof that her title to the homestead become absolute, and be enforced by a writ of possession.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b438-5\"><em>Bingham, Mitchells \u00bf- Batchellor, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b438-6\"><em>Bingham, Aldrich Remich, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b438-7\">Dob, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApO\">\u201c A good and sufficient home at their dwelling-house,\u201d with the care \u201csuitable for a woman of her age,\u201d was more than lodging, food, and raiment. A house where the plaintiff experienced treatment to which she could not reasonably be required to submit, and to which she cannot reasonably be asked to return, is not the home to which she is entitled'. The referee should have further reported that for this reason, and on this ground, he found, as a matter of fact, that the defendants had broken the condition of the deed. But as this is presumptively his meaning, the exception will be overruled unless the defendants obtain' an amendatory report showing a different conclusion. *</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">Contracts of this kind frequently end in controversy, and sometimes in litigation. <em>Currier </em>v. <em>Currier, </em>2 N.
