Verdict for the plaintiff! The defect complained of was the want of a railing. The jury were instructed that if they found the highway, at the time and place of the accident, was reasonably safe and suitable for the travel thereon, or if not, that the defects and insufficiencies therein did not cause the accident, their verdict would be for the defendants ; but if they found it was not reasonably safe and suitable for the travel thereon, and that the defects and insufficiencies caused, the accident, they would then take up the question whether the plaintiff was in fault. The defendants excepted to the refusal of the court to give the following instructions: \u201cIf the jury find that, the horse did not fall in consequence of any fault of the town, but that the highway was defective by reason of the lack of a suitable railing and the plaintiff was injured thereby, and is not precluded from recovering a verdict by contributory negligence (according to the definition of contributory negligence the court will give), then the jury must determine whether the plaintiff would have been injured if there had been a suitable railing. And if they find that her injuries would have been as great, or greater, had there been a suitable failing, then the plaintiff cannot recover.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b375-7\"><em>Pike Parsons </em>and <em>JE.
