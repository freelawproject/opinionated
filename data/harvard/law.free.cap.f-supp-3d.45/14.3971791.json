BOASBERG, United States District Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">In September 2011, a thief broke into a ear sitting in a San Antonio parking garage and stole the ear\u2019s GPS system, stereo, and several data tapes. This seemingly run-of-the mill theft has spawned massive litigation. Why? Because of the contents of those pilfered tapes. The car, as it turns out, belonged to an employee of Science Applications International Corporation, an information-technology company that handles data for the federal government. And the tapes contained personal information and medical records concerning 4.7 million members of the U.S. military (and their families) who were enrolled in TRICARE health care, which contracts with SAIC\u2014 somewhat ironically\u2014to protect patients\u2019 data.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">Plaintiffs, who are potential victims of the data breach, filed a number of lawsuits in various courts around the country alleging harm from an increased likelihood of identity theft and from an invasion of their privacy, among other things. Eight of those suits have been consolidated here as a multi-district litigation. Recently, SAIC and the three Government Defendants\u2014 TRICARE, the Department of Defense, and its Secretary, Chuck Hagel\u2014moved to dismiss the now-consolidated Complaint. Defendants claim that the service members can show no injury based on the data breach and hence lack standing to sue in federal court; in addition, SAIC and the Government contend, none of the victims has stated a claim for relief under any of the many federal and state laws that might protect them. Plaintiffs rejoin that they have, in fact, been injured by the breach and that their various causes of action\u2014 ranging from state tort law to the federal Privacy Act of 1974\u2014are sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-11\">This case presents thorny standing issues regarding when, exactly, the loss or theft of something as abstract as data becomes a concrete injury. That is, when is a consumer actually harmed by a data breach\u2014the moment data is lost or stolen, or only after the data has been accessed or used by a third party? As the issue has percolated through various courts, most have agreed that the mere loss of data\u2014 without evidence that it has been either viewed or misused\u2014does not constitute an injury sufficient to confer standing. This Court agrees. Mere loss of the data is all that most Plaintiffs allege here, so the majority must be dismissed from this case. Two Plaintiffs, however, do plausibly assert that their data was accessed or abused, and those victims may move forward with their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Standing thus resolved, the Court would typically next delve into the merits of the remaining Plaintiffs\u2019 claims. In this case, however, the Court believes it more advisable to pause and confer with the litigants. The dismissal of most Plaintiffs will have serious consequences moving forward, which may well alter the parties\u2019 perceptions of the case and how they prefer to proceed. Not every count in the Complaint applies to every Plaintiff, for example\u2014so many of the counts may fall on that basis alone. Given that many of the Plaintiffs have been dismissed, moreover, they may desire to appeal immediately, which the Court might sanction. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). This matter was, after all, intended to proceed as a class action, and the number of potential class members has now considerably diminished. The Court will thus hold a status hearing to assess the parties\u2019 intentions before taking up the question of whether the two remaining Plaintiffs have stated a legal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">A. <em>Factual Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"A-\">As outlined above, this case revolves around the theft of several data tapes from an SAIC employee\u2019s car in 2011. <em>See </em>Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 99-100. As the police report indicates, those tapes were taken along with a GPS and stereo when a criminal smashed a window and broke into the vehicle in mid-September. <em>See </em>SAIC Mot., Exh. A (San Antonio Police Report of Sept. 14, 2011) at 2-3; Compl., \u00b6 100<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, Despite the efforts of law enforcement, the thief was never apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">The tapes were backup copies of medical data related to over 4 million TRICARE beneficiaries who had received medical treatment or testing in San Antonio, Texas., <em>See </em>Compl., \u00b6 93. On September 29, 2011, TRICARE released a statement detailing the data breach to alert customers to the situation. <em>See id. </em>In November, SAIC mailed letters to affected service members explaining the scope of the theft and noting that \u201cthe information contained on the tapes may include names, Social Security Numbers, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers,\u201d and a variety of medical information. SAIC Mot., Exh. B (Letter from SAIC to Customer (Nov. 16, 2011)) at 1; <em>see </em>Compl., \u00b6 94.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But the tapes did not include \u201cany financial data, such as credit card or bank account information.\u201d Letter from SAIC at 1. SAIC also observed, \u201cThe chance that [any] information could be obtained from these tapes is low since accessing, viewing and using the data requires specific hardware and software.\u201d <em>Id. </em>SAIC nevertheless offered all affected parties free credit monitoring and identity-theft protection and restoration services for one year. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">Still, Plaintiffs claim that the data breach caused them substantial harm. Twenty-four of the thirty-three Plaintiffs here allege that they have been injured because of the disclosure alone.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>claim that, even if no one has yet used their personal information, they face an increased risk of identity theft, which they view as a distinct and palpable harm. <em>See </em>Compl., \u00b6\u00b620, 23. They also claim that the data breach violated their expectation of privacy, as codified in various statutes, state tort law, and possibly through contract. <em>See id., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 1, 20, 21, 24. In addition, five of those twenty-four Plaintiffs claim that they have spent time or money monitoring their credit or interfacing with their banks since the theft, and that then-time and effort should be compensable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Six Plaintiffs also claim that someone used their credit cards or bank accounts without their authorization, although no one alleges that financial information was actually on the stolen tapes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> One of those six additionally claims that loans have been opened in his name using his personal information\u2014presumably including his social security number, name, date of birth, and address, all of which <em>were </em>on the backup tapes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Yet another Plaintiff alleges that she was harmed because her medical identity has disappeared.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Finally, two Plaintiffs allege that they have received unwanted phone calls or \u201cphishing\u201d emails, and one of those Plaintiffs claims that marketers have information about her medical condition that they likely obtained from, the tapes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit against TRI-CARE, which is a government agency that provides insurance coverage and health care to active-duty service members and their families, <em>see </em>10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1074, 1076, 1079; 32 C.F.R. pt. 199; Compl., \u00b6 3,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and against the Department of Defense and its Secretary. The breach victims are also suing SAIC, a security firm that contracts with TRICARE to ensure the security of the personally identifiable information (PII) and protected health information (PHI) in its records. <em>See </em>Compl., \u00b6 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-13\">In their Consolidated Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs allege no fewer than twenty separate causes of action, ranging from the violation of various federal statutes\u2014 such as the Privacy Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act\u2014to the contravention of state statutes and common law\u2014such as claims of negligence, breach of contract, and violation of various state consumer-protection laws. The injuries alleged include: (i) increased risk of identity theft, which Plaintiffs peg at 9.5 times their pre-theft risk; (ii) expenses incurred in mitigating the risk of identity theft; (iii) loss of privacy through the exposure of their personal information; (iv) loss of the value of their personal and medical information; (v) loss of the value of their insurance premiums, which should have been used to pay for proper security measures; (vi) SAIC\u2019s failure to meet the requisite standard for data security; (vii) the lost right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>to truthful information about their data security; (viii) statutory (or liquidated) damages; and, in at least one case, (ix) actual identity theft. Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 20-23. The Court will address each theory of injury in turn as it analyzes the standing of Plaintiffs to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">B. <em>Procedural Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">This action encompasses eight separate cases filed in four different courts around the country. While most of those actions originated here in D.C., others were transferred from the Northern and Southern Districts of California as well as the Western District of Texas. <em>See </em>ECF No. 1 (Transfer Order) at 1-3. Consolidation of those cases for pretrial purposes took effect in June 2012, <em>id., </em>and in August of that year the Court held a hearing to sort out the administrative details of the newly combined multi-district litigation. <em>See </em>ECF No. 13 (Hearing Tr.) at 6. In October 2012, Plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Amended Complaint encompassing the allegations of thirty-three Plaintiffs from twenty-four states. <em>See </em>Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 1, 154. In November 2012, Defendants moved to dismiss all thirty-three Plaintiffs for lack of standing or, in the alternative, to dismiss each cause of action as unsupported by the factual allegations in the Complaint. Since that time, Plaintiffs have moved to supplement their pleadings, Defendants have filed multiple notices of supplemental authority; and the case has been reassigned from one judge to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Having recently taken the reins, this Court now addresses the first major issue raised by the Motions to Dismiss: standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">II. Legal Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Because this Opinion addresses only Defendants\u2019 jurisdictional arguments, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) provides the relevant legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">In evaluating Defendants\u2019 Motions to Dismiss, then, the Court must \u201ctreat the complaint\u2019s factual allegations as true .:. and must grant plaintiff \u2018the benefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sparrow v. United Air Lines, Inc., </em>216 F.3d 1111, 1113 (D.C.Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Schuler v. United States, </em>617 F.2d 605, 608 (D.C.Cir.1979)) (internal citation omitted); <em>see also Jerome Stevens Pharms., Inc. v. FDA, </em>402 F.3d 1249, 1253 (D.C.Cir.2005). This standard governs the Court\u2019s considerations of Defendants\u2019 Motions under both Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). <em>See Scheuer v. Rhodes, </em>416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974) (\u201cin passing on a motion to dismiss, whether on the ground of lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter or for failure to state a cause of action, the allegations of the complaint should be construed favorably to the pleader\u201d); <em>Walker v. Jones, </em>733 F.2d 923, 925-26 (D.C.Cir.1984) (same). The Court need not accept as true, however, \u201ca legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation,\u201d nor an inference unsupported by the facts set forth in the Complaint. <em>Trudeau v. Fed. Trade Comm\u2019n, </em>456 F.3d 178, 193 (D.C.Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Papasan v. Allain, </em>478 U.S. 265, 286, 106 S.Ct. 2932, 92 L.Ed.2d 209 (1986)) (internal quotation marks omitted). In addition, the \u201ccomplaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1), Plaintiffs bear the burden of proving that the Court has jurisdiction to hear their claims. <em>See Lujan v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number><em>Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992); <em>U.S. Ecology, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Interior, </em>231 F.3d 20, 24 (D.C.Cir.2000). A court has an \u201caffirmative obligation to ensure that it is acting within the scope of its jurisdictional authority.\u201d <em>Grand Lodge of Fraternal Order of Police v. Ashcroft, </em>185 F.Supp.2d 9, 13 (D.D.C.2001). For this reason, \u201c \u2018the [p]laintiffs factual allegations in the complaint ... will bear closer scrutiny in resolving a 12(b)(1) motion\u2019 than in resolving a 12(b)(6) motion for failure to state a claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13-14 (quoting 5A Charles A. Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 1350 (2d ed.1987)) (alteration in original). Additionally, unlike with a motion to dismiss under. Rule 12(b)(6), the Court \u201cmay consider materials outside the pleadings in deciding whether to grant a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Jerome Stevens Pharms., </em>402 F.3d at 1253; <em>see also Venetian Casino Resort, LLC v. EEOC, </em>409 F.3d 359, 366 (D.C.Cir.2005); <em>Herbert v. Nat\u2019l Academy of Sciences, </em>974 F.2d 192, 197 (D.C.Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Before examining the merits of any claim, courts must begin with questions of jurisdiction. <em>See Fla. Audubon Soc\u2019y v. Bentsen, </em>94 F.3d 658, 663 (D.C.Cir.1996) <em>(en </em>banc). Plaintiffs\u2019 first battle, then, is to prove that they have standing to pursue their claims. See <em>Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, </em>523 U.S. 83, 93-95, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998). That, as it turns out, is an uphill climb for all but two of the named Plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">Article III of the Constitution limits the power of the federal judiciary to the resolution of \u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControversies.\u201d U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2; <em>see also Allen v. Wright, </em>468 U.S. 737, 750, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984) (discussing the ease- or-controversy requirement). Because \u201cstanding is an essential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III,\u201d <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992), standing is a necessary \u201cpredicate to any exercise of [the Court\u2019s] jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Fla. Audubon Soc\u2019y., </em>94 F.3d at 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">\u201cEvery plaintiff in federal court,\u201d consequently, \u201cbears the burden of establishing the three elements that make up the \u2018irreducible constitutional minimum\u2019 of Article III standing: injury-in-fact, causation, and redressability.\u201d <em>Dominguez v. UAL Corp., </em>666 F.3d 1359, 1362 (D.C.Cir.2012) (quoting <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130). Even in the class-action context, all named Plaintiffs \u201cmust allege and show that they <em>personally </em>have been injured, not that injury has been suffered by other, unidentified members of the class to which they belong and which they purport to represent.\u201d <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 502, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975) (emphasis added). Each element of standing must be pled or proven with the requisite \u201cdegree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.\u201d <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130. That is, at the motion-to-dismiss stage, Plaintiffs must plead facts that, taken as true, make the existence of standing <em>plausible. </em>See <em>Galaria v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>998 F.Supp.2d 646, 651-52 (S.D.Ohio 2014) (emphasis added). In \u201cconsidering whether a plaintiff has Article III standing, a federal court must assume <em>arguendo </em>the merits of his or her legal claim.\u201d <em>Parker v. District of Columbia, </em>478 F.3d 370, 377 (D.C.Cir.2007), <em>aff'd on other grounds sub nom. District of Columbia v. Heller, </em>554 U.S. 570, 128 S.Ct. 2783, 171 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>A. <em>Injury in Fact</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">The Court will examine each element of standing in turn, beginning with injury in fact. An injury in fact is \u201can invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\u201d <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cAllegations of possible future injury do not satisfy the requirements of Art. III. A threatened injury must be <em>certainly impending </em>to constitute injury in fact.\u201d <em>Whitmore v. Arkansas, </em>495 U.S. 149, 158, 110 S.Ct. 1717, 109 L.Ed.2d 135 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The Supreme Court recently reviewed the contours of this requirement in <em>Clapper v. Amnesty International USA, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 1138, 185 L.Ed.2d 264 (2013). There, plaintiffs\u2014who were attorneys and human-rights, labor, legal, and media organizations who worked with foreign clients or sources\u2014contended that they were likely to be targeted for surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. <em>See id. </em>at 1145^46. This, they claimed, would work them harm. As such, they had taken steps to keep conversations with their clients confidential at their own personal expense. <em>See id. </em>The Court held, however, that plaintiffs did not have an injury in fact because the threat of surveillance was too speculative. There were, the Court reasoned, simply too many \u201cifs\u201d involved before an injury came to pass. The plaintiffs would be impacted by FISA only if (1) the government decided to target communications involving their clients and (2) used the challenged FISA provision to do so, (3) the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court authorized the eavesdropping, (4) the government succeeded in picking up their targets\u2019 phone calls or emails, and, finally, (5) the plaintiffs were involved in whatever communication the government intercepted. <em>Id. </em>at 1147-48. The Court concluded that such \u201ca highly attenuated chain of possibilities! ] does not satisfy the requirement that threatened injury must be certainly impending.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1148; <em>see also Whitmore, </em>495 U.S. at 156-57, 110 S.Ct. 1717 (speculative to assume that petitioner would request federal habeas review; habeas would be granted; petitioner would be retried for his capital offense; and thus, on appeal from this new trial, petitioner would suffer due to a lack of data on similarly situated criminal defendants); <em>O\u2019Shea v. Littleton, </em>414 U.S. 488, 496-97, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974) (injury speculative where plaintiff would need to violate the law, be arrested, and be tried before a specific magistrate judge to be harmed by the judge\u2019s allegedly illegal courtroom practice); <em>Los Angeles v. Lyons, </em>461 U.S. 95, 105-09, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983) (injury conjectural or hypothetical where plaintiff would have to commit an illegal act, be arrested, and be subjected to a chokehold in the future for injury to occur).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">The Court added, \u201cRespondents\u2019 contention that they have standing because they incurred certain costs as a reasonable reaction to a risk of harm\u201d was also \u201cunavailing\u2014because the harm respondents seek to avoid is not certainly impending. In other words, respondents cannot manufacture standing merely by inflicting harm on themselves based on their fears of hypothetical future harm that is not certainly impending.\u201d <em>Clapper, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1151.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">With those precepts in mind\u2014that an injury must be present or certainly impending, that an attenuated chain of possibilities does not confer standing, and that plaintiffs cannot create standing by taking steps to avoid an otherwise specula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>tive harm\u2014the Court turns to Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of injury here.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\n<em>1. Increased Risk of Harm and Monitoring Costs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Plaintiffs begin by asserting that an increased risk of harm alone constitutes an injury sufficient to confer standing to sue. Due to the data breach, they claim that they are 9.5 times more likely than the average person to become victims of identity theft. Compl., \u00b623. That increased risk, they maintain, in and of itself confers standing. But as <em>Clapper </em>makes clear, that is not true. The degree by which the risk of harm has increased is irrelevant\u2014instead, the question is whether the harm is certainly impending. <em>See also Public Citizen, Inc. v. Nat\u2019l Highway Traffic Safety Admin., </em>489 F.3d 1279, 1297-98 (D.C.Cir.2007) (\u201c\u2018increased risk\u2019 is\u201d not by <em>\u201citself </em>[a] concrete, particularized, and <em>actual </em>injury for standing purposes\u201d\u2014harm must be \u201cactual\u201d or \u201cimminent,\u201d not merely \u201cincreased\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Here, the relevant harm alleged is identity theft. A handful of Plaintiffs claims that they have suffered actual identity theft, and those Plaintiffs have clearly suffered an injury. At least twenty-four, however, allege only a <em>risk </em>of identity theft. <em>See supra </em>n.3. At this point, the likelihood that any individual Plaintiff will suffer harm remains entirely speculative. For identity theft to occur, after all, the following chain of events would have to transpire: First, the thief would have to recognize the tapes for what they were, instead of merely a minor addition to the GPS and stereo haul. Data tapes, after all, are not something an average computer user often encounters. The reader, for example, may not even be aware that some companies still use tapes\u2014as opposed to hard drives, servers, or even CDs\u2014to back up their data. <em>See Disk or Tape Backup: Which is Best?, </em>Backup For Servers, http://goo.gl/7JsXQF (last visited Apr. 28, 2014). Then, the criminal would have to find a tape reader and attach it to her computer. Next, she would need to acquire software to upload the data from the tapes onto a computer\u2014otherwise, tapes have to be slowly spooled through like cassettes for data to be read. <em>Id. </em>After that, portions of the data that are encrypted would have to be deciphered. See Compl., \u00b6 95 (\u201ca portion of the PII/PHI on the data tapes was encrypted\u201d). Once the data was fully unencrypted, the crook would need to acquire a familiarity with TRICARE\u2019s database format, which might require another round of special software. Finally, the larcenist would have to either misuse a particular Plaintiffs name and social security number (out of 4.7 million TRICARE customers) or sell that Plaintiff\u2019s data to a willing buyer who would then abuse it.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">The vast majority of Plaintiffs has not alleged that any of those things have happened\u2014because they cannot. Those events are entirely dependent on the actions of an unknown third party\u2014namely, the thief. At this point, we do not know who she was, how much she knows about computers, or what she has done with the tapes. The tapes could be uploaded onto her computer and fully deciphered, or they could be lying in a landfill somewhere in Texas because she trashed them after achieving her main goal of boosting the car stereo and GPS. Unfortunately, there is simply no way to know until either the crook is apprehended or the data is actually used. Courts for this reason are reluctant to grant standing where the alleged future injury depends on the actions of an independent third party. <em>See Clapper, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1150 (expressing \u201cour usual reluctance to endorse standing theories that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>rest on speculation about the decisions of independent actors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">That is, no doubt, cold comfort to the millions of servicemen and women who must wait and watch their credit reports until something untoward occurs. After all, it is reasonable to fear the worst in the wake of such a theft, and it is understandably frustrating to know that the safety of your most personal information could be in danger. The Supreme Court, however, has held that an \u201cobjectively reasonable likelihood\u201d of harm is not enough to create standing, even if it is enough to engender some anxiety. <em>See id., </em>133 S.Ct. at 1147-48. Plaintiffs thus do not have standing based on risk alone, even if their fears are rational.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Nor is the cost involved in <em>preventing </em>future harm enough to confer standing, even when such efforts are sensible. <em>See id. </em>at 1150-51. There is, after all, nothing unreasonable about monitoring your credit after a data breach. In fact, that is exactly what TRICARE and SAIC advised Plaintiffs to do\u2014and what SAIC, in part, offered to pay for. <em>See, e.g., </em>Letter from SAIC at 1. But the Supreme Court has determined that proactive measures based on \u201cfears of ... future harm that is not certainly impending\u201d do not create an injury in fact, even where such fears are not unfounded. <em>Clapper, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1151. Put another way, the Court has held that plaintiffs cannot create standing by \u201cinflicting harm on themselves\u201d to ward off an otherwise speculative injury. <em>Id. </em>The cost of credit monitoring and other preventive measures, therefore, cannot create standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">There is, however, an alternative argument. Plaintiffs point out that, in <em>Clapper, </em>the Court acknowledged that it sometimes \u201cfound standing based on a <em>\u2018substantial risk\u2019 </em>that ... harm will occur, which [could] prompt plaintiffs to reasonably incur costs to mitigate or avoid that harm.\u201d <em>Clapper, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1150 n. 5 (emphasis added). So Plaintiffs could, theoretically, prevail if the risk of harm here were substantial. Yet, Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint itself makes clear that they do not surmount that hurdle. To be sure, Plaintiffs allege that data-breach victims in general are 9.5 times more likely than the average person to experience identity theft postbreach. Compl., \u00b6 132. But then Plaintiffs note that, overall, only about <em>19% </em>of breach victims actually experience identity theft. <em>Id. </em>By Plaintiffs own calculations, then, injury is likely not impending for over 80% of victims\u2014and the figure is likely to be considerably higher in this case, where the theft was unsophisticated and where the lack of widespread harm suggests that the tapes have not ever been accessed. <em>Cf. Galaria, </em>998 F.Supp.2d at 653-55. The harm in these circumstances, therefore, cannot satisfy the requirement of either the Supreme Court or the D.C. Circuit that there be \u201c(i) a substantially increased risk of harm and (ii) <em>a substantial probability of harm </em>with that increase taken into account.\u201d <em>Public Citizen, Inc., </em>489 F.3d at 1295.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">The conclusion that an increased risk of harm alone does not confer standing is supported by other courts\u2019 analyses in similar data-breach cases. In <em>Reilly v. Ceridian Corp., </em>664 F.3d 38 (3d Cir.2011), for example, a payroll company\u2019s database was hacked, possibly exposing \u201cemployees\u2019 names, addresses, social security numbers, dates of birth, and bank account information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40. Still, the Third Circuit held that, where it was \u201cnot known whether the hacker read, copied, or understood the data,\u201d injury remained speculative. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Randolph v. ING Life Insurance &amp; Annuity Co., </em>486 F.Supp.2d 1 (D.D.C.2007), an unknown crook pilfered a laptop containing insurance information, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>the \u201cnames, addresses, and Social Security numbers\u201d of customers. <em>Id. </em>at 3. Nonetheless, because plaintiffs did \u201cnot allege that the burglar who stole the laptop did so in order to access their Information, or that their Information has actually been accessed since the laptop was stolen,\u201d it was \u201cmere speculation\u201d to assume \u201cthat at some unspecified point in the indefinite future they w[ould] be the victims of identity theft.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7-8; <em>see also Whitaker v. Health Net of Cal., Inc., </em>No. 11-910, 2012 WL 174961, at *2 (E.D. Cal. Jan. 20, 2012) (\u201c[PJlaintiffs do not explain how the loss here has actually harmed them ... or that third parties have accessed their data.

Acxiom Corp., </em>No. 06-485, 2006 WL 2850042, at *2 (E.D. Ark. Oct. 3, 2006) (\u201c[W]hile there have been several lawsuits alleging an increased risk of identity theft, no court has considered the risk itself to be damage.

DSW, Inc., </em>454 F.Supp.2d 684, 690 (S.D.Ohio 2006) (In data-breach case, \u201cplaintiffs allegations, if true, create only the possibility of harm at a future date. Plaintiff ] alleges that her potential injury is contingent upon her information being obtained and then used by an unauthorized person for an unlawful purpose.\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Giordano v. Wachovia Sec., LLC, </em>No. 06-476, 2006 WL 2177036, at *,5 (D.N.J. July 31, 2006) (\u201cPlaintiff only alleges a potential injury (identity theft) that is contingent on (1) Plaintiffs information falling into the hands of an unauthorized person and (2) that person using such information for unlawful purposes to Plaintiffs detriment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Litigants\u2019 cost-of-monitoring claims fared no better. <em>See, e.g., Reilly, </em>664 F.3d at 46 (\u201cAppellants\u2019 alleged time and money expenditures to monitor their financial information do not establish standing, because costs incurred to watch for a speculative chain of future events based on hypothetical future criminal acts are no more \u2018actual\u2019 injuries than the alleged \u2018increased risk of injury\u2019 which forms the basis for Appellants\u2019 claims.\u201d); <em>Randolph, </em>486 F.Supp.2d at 8 (The \u201cargument that the time and money spent monitoring a plaintiffs credit suffices to establish an injury overlook[s] the fact that their expenditure of time and money was not the result of any present injury, but rather the anticipation of future injury that has not materialized.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">This is not to say that courts have uniformly denied standing in data-breach cases. <em>See, e.g., Holmes v. Countrywide Fin. Corp., </em>No. 08-205, 2012 WL 2873892, at *5-11 (W.D.Ky. July 12, 2012); <em>McLoughlin v. People\u2019s United Bank, Inc., </em>No. 08-944, 2009 WL 2843269, at *3-4 (D.Conn. Aug. 31, 2009); <em>Doe 1 v. AOL, </em>719 F.Supp.2d 1102, 1109 (N.D.Cal.2010); <em>Caudle v. Towers, Perrin, Forster &amp; Crosby, Inc., </em>580 F.Supp.2d 273, 279-80 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>(S.D.N.Y.2008). Most cases that found standing in similar circumstances, however, were decided pr <em>e-Clapper </em>or rely on pr <em>e-Clapper </em>precedent and are, at best, thinly reasoned. For example, in <em>Ruiz v. Gap, </em>Inc., 380 Fed.Appx. 689 (9th Cir.2010) <em>(Gap III), </em>the court stated that a \u201ccredible threat of harm is sufficient to constitute actual injury for standing purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 691; <em>see also, e.g., Krottner v. Starbucks Corp., </em>628 F.3d 1139, 1142 (9th Cir.2010) (\u201cthe possibility of future injury may be sufficient to confer standing on plaintiffs; threatened injury constitutes \u2018injury in fact\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Cent. Delta Water Agency v. United States, </em>306 F.3d 938, 947 (9th Cir.2002)); <em>Pisciotta v. Old Nat\u2019l Bancorp, </em>499 F.3d 629, 632 (7th Cir.2007) (standing because \u201cthe scope and manner of access suggests that the intrusion was sophisticated, intentional and malicious\u201d). Yet after <em>Clapper, Gap Ill\u2019s </em>\u201ccredible threat of harm\u201d standard is clearly not supportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Indeed, since <em>Clapper </em>was handed down last year, courts have been even more emphatic in rejecting \u201cincreased risk\u201d as a theory of standing in data-breach cases. As one court noted, after <em>\u201cClapper, </em>the mere fact that the risk has been increased does not suffice to establish standing.\u201d <em>Strautins v. Trustwave Holdings, Inc., </em>27 F.Supp.3d 871, 876-77 (N.D.Ill.2014). After all, an <em>increased risk </em>or <em>credible threat </em>of impending harm is plainly different from <em>certainly impending </em>harm, and certainly impending harm is what the Constitution and <em>Clapper </em>require. <em>Clapper, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1148; <em>see, e.g., Strautins, </em>27 F.Supp.3d at 876 (deciding in light of <em>Clapper </em>that injury was speculative based \u201con a number of variables, such as whether their data was actually taken during the breach, whether it was subsequently sold or otherwise transferred, whether anyone who obtained the data attempted to use it, and whether or not they succeeded\u201d); <em>Galaria, </em>998 F.Supp.2d at 654-55 (noting the similarity to <em>Clapper </em>and holding that \u201c[i]n this case, an increased risk of identity theft, identity fraud, medical fraud or phishing is not itself an injury-in-fact because Named Plaintiffs did not allege\u2014or offer facts to make plausible\u2014an allegation that such harm is \u2018certainly impending\u2019 \u201d); <em>Polanco v. Omnicell, Inc., </em>988 F.Supp.2d 451, 470 (D.N.J.2013) (relying on <em>Clapper </em>and <em>Reilly </em>to conclude that mere loss of data, without misuse, is not \u201can injury sufficient to confer standing\u201d); <em>but see In re Sony Gaming Networks &amp; Customer Data Sec. Breach Litigation, </em>996 F.Supp.2d 942, 962 (S.D.Cal.2014) (finding standing <em>post-Clapper </em>based on a \u201cplausibly alleged ... \u2018credible threat\u2019 of impending harm\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">In sum, increased risk of harm alone does not constitute an injury in fact. Nor do measures taken to prevent a future, speculative harm. At least twenty-four of the thirty-three Plaintiffs in this case, then, must rely on an alternative theory of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">\n<em>2. Privacy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">Plaintiffs also allege that they have been injured because their privacy was invaded by the data breach. Yet this claim suffers from the same defects as Plaintiffs\u2019 previous contention. For a person\u2019s privacy to be invaded, their personal information must, at a minimum, be disclosed to a third party. Existing case law and legislation support that common-sense intuition: If po one has viewed your private information (or is about to view it imminently), then your privacy has not been violated. <em>See, e.g., </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 297.102 (Under Privacy Act, \u201c[disclosure means providing <em>personal review </em>of a record, or a copy thereof, to someone other than the data subject or the data subject\u2019s authorized representative, parent, or legal guardian.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Walia v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number><em>Chertoff, </em>No. 06-6587, 2008 WL 5246014, at *11 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 17, 2008) (\u201caccessibility\u201d is not the same as \u201cactive disclosure\u201d); <em>Schmidt v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>218 F.R.D. 619, 680 (E.D.Wis.2003) (Disclosure is \u201cthe placing into the view of another information which was previously unknown,\u201d requiring that information be \u201cactually viewed.\u201d); <em>Harper v. United States, </em>428 F.Supp. 192, 197 (D.S.C.1976) (Disclose means \u201cthe imparting of information which in itself has meaning and which was previously unknown to the person to whom it was imparted.\u201d); <em>Fairfax Hosp. v. Curtis, </em>492 S.E.2d 642, 644 (Va.1997) (violation where third party \u201cpossessed]\u201d and \u201creviewed\u201d records).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Here, the majority of Plaintiffs contend neither that their personal information has been viewed nor that their information has been exposed in a way that would facilitate easy, imminent access. As in the Third Circuit case <em>Reilly, </em>it would be speculative to assume that the thief \u201cread, copied, or understood the data.\u201d 664 F.3d at 40. As a result, no invasion of Plaintiffs\u2019 privacy is imminent. <em>See also Katz v. Pershing, LLC, </em>672 F.3d 64 (1st Cir.2012) (dismissing privacy claim for lack of standing where information had not been viewed by third party); <em>Allison, </em>2010 WL 3719243 (no standing in data-breach case, even where claim involved invasion of privacy); <em>Giordano, </em>2006 WL 2177036 (same); <em>Strautins, </em>27 F.Supp.3d 871 (same); <em>but see Cala\u00f1a, </em>998 F.Supp.2d 646 (allowing standing for certain claims based only on invasion of privacy); <em>Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Emps. v. Hawley, </em>543 F.Supp.2d 44, 50 n. 12 (D.D.C.2008) (\u201cemotional trauma alone is sufficient to qualify as an\u201d injury \u201cunder Section 552a(g)(l)(D) of the Privacy Act\u201d) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">To be sure, the Supreme Court has intimated that disclosure of personally identifiable information alone, along with some attendant emotional distress, may constitute \u201cinjury enough to open the courthouse door\u201d in privacy actions. <em>Doe v. Chao, </em>540 U.S. 614, 624-25, 124 S.Ct. 1204, 157 L.Ed.2d 1122 (2004). But again, disclosure involves publication to a third party. In that case, Doe\u2019s social security number had actually been published by the government on various documents \u201csent to groups of [workers\u2019-compensation] claimants, their employers, and the lawyers involved in their cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 617, 124 S.Ct. 1204. In other words, Doe\u2019s information was actually exposed to dozens of readers. Here, by contrast, disclosure and access of Plaintiffs\u2019 personal information is anything but certain. Rather, the information itself is locked inside tapes that require some expertise to open and decipher. Indeed, it is highly unlikely that the crook even understood what the tapes were, let alone had the wherewithal to access them or navigate her way to any one of the 4.7 million records contained therein. And until Plaintiffs can aver that their records have been viewed (or certainly will be viewed), any harm to their privacy remains speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">A few of the Plaintiffs here do allege that their data was used.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Those Plaintiffs have at least claimed an injury to their privacy insofar as they allege that their data was accessed. The other Plaintiffs, however, are out of luck.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">\n<em>3. Loss of Value</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b67-12\">Plaintiffs next contend that they were injured by the loss of two valuable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>assets. First, they argue that they lost the value of their personal and medical information, which could be \u201csold on the cyber black market for $14 to $25 per medical record.\u201d Compl., \u00b621. Second, they claim they forfeited the value of their insurance premiums, which should have been used to pay for better security. <em>See id., </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">As to the value of their personal and medical information, Plaintiffs do not contend that <em>they </em>intended to sell this information on the cyber black market in the first place, so it is uncertain how they were injured by this alleged loss. Even if the service members did intend to sell their own data\u2014something no one alleges\u2014it is unclear whether or how the data has been devalued by the breach. For those reasons, Plaintiffs\u2019 first theory, of injury is unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Similarly, as to the value of their insurance premiums, Plaintiffs do not plausibly allege any actual loss. They allege that they were paying for \u201chealth and dental insurance\u201d\u2014and they do not claim that they were denied coverage or services in any way whatsoever. <em>See id. </em>To the extent that Plaintiffs claim that some indeterminate part of their premiums went toward paying for security measures, such a claim is too flimsy to support standing. They do not maintain, moreover, that the money they paid could have or would have bought a better policy with a more bulletproof information-security regime. Put another way, Plaintiffs have not alleged facts that show that the market value of their insurance coverage (plus security services) was somehow less than what they paid. Nothing in the Complaint makes a plausible case that Plaintiffs were cheated out of their premiums. As a result, no injury lies.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">\n<em>U. Legal Violations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Plaintiffs next set forth various legal violations that they claim create standing: They argue that SAIC failed to meet the requisite legal standards for data security; that SAIC and TRICARE violated their right to truthful information about their data; and that certain statutes, if violated, give them the right to automatic damages or paymeht. Standing, however, does not merely require a showing that the law has been violated, or that a statute will reward litigants in general upon showing of a violation. Rather, standing demands some form of injury\u2014some showing that the legal violation harmed <em>you </em>in particular, and that you are therefore an appropriate advocate in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">As the Supreme Court \u201chas repeatedly held ... [,] an asserted right to have the [defendant] act in accordance with law is not sufficient, standing alone, to confer jurisdiction on a federal court.\u201d <em>Allen v. Wright, </em>468 U.S. 737, 754, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984). Rather, the unlawful activity must work some harm on Plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">In terms of the alleged contravention of security standards, Plaintiffs have not outlined any actual or imminent harm caused by that purported violation\u2014aside from the theories the Court has already rejected. Plaintiffs, therefore, cannot acquire standing on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">The same is true of the supposed deprivation of Plaintiffs \u201cright to truthful information about the security of their PII/ PHI.\u201d Opp. to SAIC at 7. No independent harm has flowed from that so-called deprivation. Of course, as Plaintiffs point out, denial of information alone can sometimes create an injury when statutes require disclosure. <em>See Zivotofsky ex rel. Ari Z. v. Sec\u2019y of State, </em>444 F.3d 614, 617-19 (D.C.Cir.2006) (noting that violation of plaintiffs right to documents under Free<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>dom of Information Act can create standing). Here, however, Plaintiffs have failed to allege any <em>actual </em>deprivation of information, even assuming they have a right to it. First, they claim that they were deprived of information before TRICARE and SAIC notified them of the data breach. Any injury that might have occurred during that time, however, has been cured, since SAIC has now explained the extent of the breach to Plaintiffs in some detail, see Letter from SAIC at 1, and no one alleges any independent harm caused by the delay. Indeed, expedient notification of the data breach and its scope, along with certain required contact information, is all the relevant laws demand. <em>See, e.g., </em>Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1798.82; Or.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 646A.604(l)-(2). In addition, Plaintiffs claim that they have been deprived of truthful information because SAIC \u201c[c]ategoriz[ed] the risk of access\u201d to their data \u201cas \u2018low \u201d in their letters notifying servicemen of the breach. Compl., \u00b6 116. But that is, at best, a difference of opinion\u2014Plaintiffs do not identify any actual <em>facts </em>that SAIC or TRICARE has withheld. As a result, Plaintiffs\u2019 abstract assertion that their \u201cright to truthful information\u201d has been violated does not constitute an injury, since the facts in the complaint identify neither an actual deprivation nor any independent harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\n<em>5. Actual Misuse</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">As noted above, Plaintiffs who claim that their information was, in fact, accessed and misused have alleged an actual injury. That injury, however, must still be finked to Defendants\u2019 conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">\n<em>B. Causation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">The second element of standing, causation, requires \u201ca causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of.\u201d <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130. The harm alleged must be \u201cfairly ... trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not injury that results from the independent action of some third party not before the court.\u201d <em>Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights Org., </em>426 U.S. 26, 41-42, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">To review the bidding: The majority of Plaintiffs in this case lack standing to sue because they failed to allege any cognizable injury. Six Plaintiffs, however, claim that their data was actually misused; one Plaintiff claims she has suffered medical fraud; and two claim that their privacy was invaded by phone calls and other solicitations from companies that may have accessed their medical records. Each of these three groups of Plaintiffs must be able to fink their harm to the data breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">\n<em>1. Identity Theft</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b69-12\">Six out of thirty-three Plaintiffs allege that their personal information was used for fraudulent purposes. <em>See supra </em>n.5. Five of those six claim only that unauthorized charges were made to their existing credit cards or debit cards, or that money was withdrawn from an existing bank account. But here\u2019s the problem: No one alleges that credit-card, debit-card, or bank-account information was on the stolen tapes. <em>See, e.g., </em>Letter from SAIC at 1 (tapes did not include \u201cany financial data, such as credit card or bank account information\u201d). To be sure, as Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel noted at the Court\u2019s August hearing, a criminal could obtain some of a victim\u2019s personal information from a data breach and then go \u201cphishing\u201d to get the rest. <em>See </em>Hrg. Tr. at 45^46. That is, the crook could acquire a name and phone number and then make calls pretending to be a legitimate business asking for information like credit-card or bank-account numbers. Here, however, the identity-theft Plaintiffs have not alleged any phish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>ing. Indeed, they proffer no plausible explanation for how the thief would have acquired their banking information. In a society where around 3.3% of the population will experience some form of identity theft\u2014regardless of the source\u2014it is not surprising that at least five people out of a group of 4.7 million happen to have experienced some form of credit or bank-account fraud. <em>See </em>Kristin Finklea, Cong. Research Serv., R40599, <em>Identity Theft: Trends and Issues </em>1 (2014), <em>available at </em>http://goo.gl/bCsTEg (10.2 million Americans, out of around 308.7 million total, experienced identity theft in 2010). As that information was not on the tapes, though, Plaintiffs cannot causally link it to the SAIC breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">One Plaintiff, however\u2014Robert Curtis, a Colorado resident\u2014may have a case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> After the data breach, he received \u201cletters in the mail from American Express,\u201d among others, \u201cthanking him for applying for loans\u201d that he had never applied for. Compl., \u00b6 35. To apply for such a loan, one would likely need a person\u2019s name, address, date of birth, and social security number\u2014exactly the sort of information that was on the tapes. <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 7. The Court believes that this creates a sufficient causal link between the identity theft\u2014which has hurt Curtis\u2019s credit history, <em>id., </em>\u00b6 35\u2014and the tape theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">That said, the Court would be remiss if it did not note that Curtis also alleges a spate of identity theft that cannot plausibly be linked to the tapes. For example, he also complains that many of his existing accounts have been tampered with in seriously concerning and, no doubt, frustrating ways. <em>Id. </em>In one instance, Curtis\u2019s bank notified him when \u201can individual in Mexico\u201d called his bank asking for money \u201cand knew Plaintiff Curtis\u2019 account number, unlisted telephone number, address, date of birth and e-mail address, Social Security number and answers to the security questions.\u201d ECF No. 43 (Reply to Motion to Supplement Pleadings), Exh. A (Supplement to Compl., \u00b6 35) at 1. No one alleges, however, that the name of Curtis\u2019s bank, his account number, his e-mail address, or the answers to his security questions were on the stolen tapes. He also claims that \u201cindividuals wired approximately $32,500 out of his credit union account.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But again, he does not claim that the account information was on the tapes, although he does aver that he gave TRICARE his payment information at some point. <em>Id. </em>The inescapable conclusion is that Curtis has been subjected to another, more profound data breach involving his financial\u2014not medical\u2014records.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">As a result, the fraudulent loan applications may also be linked to this other, more severe data breach and not the SAIC breach. At this point, however, the Court is willing to give Curtis the benefit of the doubt, since there is at least a plausible connection between some of the harm he has suffered and the SAIC theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">\n<em>2. Medical Fraud</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b70-12\">Another Plaintiff, Robin Warner, claims that she experienced medical fraud because her medical records no longer exist. Compl., 160. This is a striking allegation, but it cannot establish standing because only <em>backup </em>tapes were stolen from the SAIC employee\u2019s car. <em>Id., </em>16. Warner does not explain how the disappearance of her medical identity can be linked to the theft of tapes that contained only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number><em>copies </em>of her actual medical records. She has thus not carried her burden of alleging causation and hence has no standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\n<em>2. Privacy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Two final Plaintiffs\u2014in addition to Curtis, who has experienced similar woes\u2014claim that their privacy has been invaded due to the data breach. Murray Moskowitz simply alleges that he \u201chas received a number of unsolicited calls from telemarketers and scam artists.\u201d <em>Id., </em>149. He does not otherwise link the calls to the tapes, claim that the callers have personal or private information found on the tapes, or even allege that his phone number was unlisted and hence would have been difficult for marketers to locate absent the assistance of the data thief. Moskowitz seems to simply be one among the many of us who are interrupted in our daily lives by unsolicited calls. His harm, consequently, cannot plausibly be linked to the tapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Dorothy Yarde, on the other hand, does allege a credible link to the data breach. She claims'that her \u201ctelephone number is unlisted.\u201d <em>Id., </em>162. Still, after the theft, \u201cshe received numerous unsolicited telephone calls from insurance companies and other[s]\u201d pitching \u201cmedical products and services ... targeted at a <em>specific medical condition listed in her medical records.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). She had not received such calls in the past. <em>Id. </em>The fact that the callers had Yarde\u2019s unlisted phone number and medical diagnosis\u2014both of which were on the tapes\u2014 suffices to create a causal link.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">\n<em>C. Redressability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">The third and final element of standing is redressability, which requires that it \u201cbe \u2018likely,\u2019 as opposed to merely \u2018speculative,\u2019 that the\u201d alleged \u201cinjury will be \u2018redressed by a favorable decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">At this point, only two Plaintiffs remain: Curtis, who has alleged actual misuse of his social security number, and Yarde, who has alleged a privacy violation linked to her medical information. Both harms can be redressed, at least in part, by a monetary reward. Those two Plaintiffs\u2014and only those two Plaintiffs\u2014therefore have standing to sue.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-12\">A reasonable reader may still wonder: If Curtis and Yarde\u2019s information was potentially accessed or misused, why not presume that the remaining Plaintiffs\u2019 information will suffer the same fate? Indeed, other courts have allowed cases to move forward where some form of fraud had already taken place. For example, in <em>Anderson v. Hannaford Bros., </em>659 F.3d 151 (1st Cir.2011), the First Circuit declined to question the plaintiffs\u2019 standing where 1,800 instances of credit- and debit-card fraud had already occurred and had been clearly linked to the data breach. <em>Id. </em>at 162-67. Similarly, in <em>Pisciotta, </em>the court allowed plaintiffs to proceed where \u201cthe scope and manner of access suggested] that the intrusion was sophisticated, intentional and malicious,\u201d and thus that the potential for harm was indeed substantial. 499 F.3d at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-13\">The circumstances here, however, are starkly different. First, the theft from the SAIC employee\u2019s car was a low-tech, garden-variety one. Any inference to the contrary is undermined by the snatching of the GPS and car stereo. This is hardly a black-ops caper. Second, while Curtis and Yarde have alleged personalized injury sufficient to surmount a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1), there are no facts here that plausibly point to imminent, widespread harm. In fact, the link be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>tween Curtis and Yarde\u2019s injuries and the data breach barely crosses the line from possible to plausible. Curtis, after all, was almost certainly the victim of another, more severe data breach, and that breach may well have been responsible for every instance of identity theft he alleges. It remains likely, in other words, that no one accessed his information from the tapes. Yarde\u2019s harm may also stem from another source. For example, she might have bought specific medications related to her condition over the counter at the neighborhood drugstore or online. That information could have been sold to companies targeting such patients\u2014no data breach necessary. At this stage, the Court simply acknowledges that the link between the data breach and Yarde and Curtis\u2019s claims is <em>plausible, </em>even if it is very likely that their harm stems from another source.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">The fact that Curtis and Yarde\u2019s allegations are plausible, however, does not lead to the conclusion that wide-scale disclosure and misuse of all 4.7 million TRICARE customers\u2019 data is plausibly \u201ccertainly impending.\u201d <em>Clapper, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1147. After all, as previously noted, roughly 3.3% of Americans will experience identity theft of some form, regardless of the source. <em>See </em>Finklea, <em>Identity Theft: Trends and Issues, supra, </em>at 1. So one would expect 3.3% of TRICARE\u2019s customers to experience some type of identity theft, even if the tapes were never read or misused. To quantify that percentage, of the 4.7 million customers whose data was on the tapes, one would expect around 155,100 of them to experience identity fraud simply by virtue of living in America and engaging in commerce, even if the tapes had not been lost. Here, only six Plaintiffs allege some form of identity theft, and out of those six only Curtis offers any plausible link to the tapes. And Yarde is the only other Plaintiff\u2014out of a population of 4.7 million\u2014 who has offered any evidence that someone may have accessed her medical or personal information.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Given those numbers, it would be entirely implausible to assume that a massive identity-theft scheme is currently in progress or is certainly impending. Indeed, given that thirty-four months have elapsed, either the malefactors are extraordinarily patient or no mining of the tapes has occurred. This is simply not a case where hundreds or thousands of instances of fraud have been linked to the data breach. <em>See, e.g., Anderson, </em>659 F.3d at 162-67. Rather, as far as the Court is aware, only six instances of fraud have been reported, and. only two customers can plausibly link either identity theft or privacy violations to the tapes\u2019 loss. As such, only those two Plaintiffs whose harm is plausibly linked to the breach may move forward with their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">IY. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Since the majority of Plaintiffs has been dismissed\u2014potentially altering the scope of the remaining litigants\u2019 claims moving forward\u2014the Court will pause to confer with the parties before determining which, if any, of the Complaint\u2019s twenty counts has been properly alleged. The Court thus reserves the issue of whether Defendants\u2019 Rule 12(b)(6) Motions should be granted for a future date. It further notes that it expects the parties to confer before the forthcoming status to determine if they can reach some agreement on the next procedural steps in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">For the aforementioned reasons, the Court will grant in part and deny in part Defendants\u2019 Motions to Dismiss. A separate Order consistent. with this Opinion will be issued this day.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b58-6\">. The police report is a public record subject to judicial notice.
