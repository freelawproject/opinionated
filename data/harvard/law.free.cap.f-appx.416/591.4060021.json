Based on its determination that the total offense level was 21 and that Juarez-Reyes\u2019s criminal history category was II, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> calculated a guidelines range of 41 to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment. It then sentenced Juarez-Reyes to 46 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">Juarez-Reyes argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it was \u201cgreater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d In his view, a below-guidelines sentence of 24 months\u2019 imprisonment would have been \u201cmore than sufficient\u201d because the guidelines overstate his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">\u201cWe review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard, and we accord a presumption of reasonableness to a sentence within the advisory guideline range.\u201d <em>United States v. Vinton, </em>631 F.3d 476 (8th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted). At sentencing, the district court reviewed Juarez-Reyes\u2019s criminal history, which includes, among others, two incidents yielding a total of three criminal history points. The first was a domestic assault in November 2000, during which Juarez-Reyes pushed the victim to the floor two times. The district court noted that there was \u201cnothing overstated\u201d about the one criminal history point attaching to this conduct and that, indeed, \u201cit might be understated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-14\">The second incident was an \u201caltercation,\u201d <em>see </em>Sentencing Tr. at 35:2-10, in November 2002, during which Juarez-Reyes grabbed his then-wife by the head, threw her to the ground, and threatened to kill her. Juarez-Reyes later pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, aggravated assault, and terroristic threatening. The district court rejected Juarez-Reyes\u2019s argument that two criminal history points overstated these offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-15\">Our review of the record satisfies us that the district court did not abuse its discretion in selecting a within-guidelines sentence of 46 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-16\">The sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-11\">.
