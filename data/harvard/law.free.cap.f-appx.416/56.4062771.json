No. 105-100, 111 Stat. 2160, 2196-99 (1997). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-19\">To establish his eligibility for special rule cancellation of removal under the NA-CARA, Reyes-Muralles bears the burden of showing, <em>inter alia, </em>that he has been continually present in the United States for the seven years preceding the disposition of his application \u2014 in this case, 2002-09.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.66(b)(2). He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>must do so by a preponderance of the evidence. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.64(a). The IJ determined Reyes-Muralles failed to meet this burden, and the BIA agreed, dismissing his administrative appeal. Reyes-Muralles claims this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">We review the BIA\u2019s continuous-presence determination under the substantial-evidence test, evaluating whether the record as a whole supports the decision with \u201creasonable, substantial, and probative evidence.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001). Under this test, we view \u201cthe record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision,\u201d and we will only reverse the findings of the agency when the record evidence compels that result. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc). In this case, there is no such compulsion.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The BIA\u2019s conclusion is supported by substantial evidence. Reyes-Muralles\u2019s hearing testimony contained several inconsistencies, leading the IJ to find that he was not \u201cfully credible.\u201d Furthermore, despite his claim that he has resided in the United States for decades, Reyes-Muralles offered scant evidence to corroborate his continuous presence in the country during the time period in question. The BIA specifically found that he failed to offer \u201cany contemporaneous documentation\u201d from the years in question. Contrary to that finding, however, the record shows Reyes-Muralles did offer some documentation actually generated during this time period, including a Florida driver\u2019s license issued in 2004 and three \u201c1099\u201d tax forms issued from his employer in the years 2005, 2006, and 2008. Nevertheless, we cannot say that, when coupled with the IJ\u2019s credibility determination, this evidence compels the conclusion that ReyesMuralles demonstrated his continuous presence in the United States by a preponderance of the evidence. Consequently, we must deny his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">Reyes-Muralles also asserts that the administrative proceedings were procedurally deficient, claiming the IJ enforced a clear-and-convincing evidentiary burden against him, instead of the appropriate preponderance standard. Because ReyesMuralles failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to these claims, we are without jurisdiction to entertain them. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d). This lack of jurisdiction extends to Reyes-Muralles\u2019s procedural-due-process claim. <em>See Amayar-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1251 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). Accordingly, his claims of procedural defect are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">For the foregoing reasons, Reyes-Muralles\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s final order is dismissed in part and denied in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">DISMISSED <em>IN </em>PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-10\">. This case is docketed under the name \"Cesario DeJesus Reyes-Morales,\u201d but the petitioner has clarified that his name is \"Cesario Anibal Reyes-Muralles.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b79-11\">. Section 203 of the NACARA allows nationals of certain countries to apply for special rule cancellation of removal, provided they filed asylum applications with the INS on or before April 1, 1990 and meet certain other conditions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b79-12\">. Notwithstanding \u00a7 1252\u2019s jurisdiction-stripping provision precluding judicial review of discretionary BIA determinations, \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B), we have jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s non-discretionary determination here-at-issue; whether Reyes-Muralles has satisfied the NACARA\u2019s continuous-presence requirement. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1298 (11th Cir.2001) (evaluating the statutory predecessor of the requirement at issue and determining it was not a \"discretionary decision\u201d within the scope of the jurisdiction-stripping provision); <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza </em>v. <em>U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam) (applying <em>Al Najjar </em>to the current statute).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b79-21\">. Notwithstanding 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(1)'s stop-time provision, the BIA has interpreted the continuous-presence requirement to apply to the seven years preceding the final administrative disposition of an application for special rule cancellation of removal. <em>See In re Garcia, </em>24 I. &amp; N.
