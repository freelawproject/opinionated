Pledger filed his petition in January 2009, while confined at the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> arguing that his confinement pursuant to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>2004 commitment order entered in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas was unlawful because the commitment proceedings did not comply with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4246. In dismissing Pledger\u2019s petition, the district court held that issues related to Pledger\u2019s commitment needed to be resolved in the committing court, as it was in the best position to evaluate the merits of Pledger\u2019s argument that the commitment order was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Upon review, we reverse the dismissal order, and we remand the case to the district court with instructions to transfer the case to the Eastern District of Arkansas \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a) (district court may transfer to cure venue defect \u201cif it be in the interest of justice\u201d); <em>Archuleta v. Hedrick, </em>365 F.3d 644, 649 (8th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Accordingly, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b602-7\">.
