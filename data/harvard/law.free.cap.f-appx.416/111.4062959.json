We review the grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>\u201cresolving all ambiguities and drawing all permissible factual inferences in favor\u201d of Cole. <em>Burg v. Gosselin, </em>591 F.3d 95, 97 (2d Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Despite this deference, a non-movant cannot defeat a motion for summary judgment merely through conclusory statements or allegations. <em>See Davis v. New York, </em>316 F.3d 93, 100 (2d Cir.2002). In applying these principles, we assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>1. <em>Deliberate Indifference</em></p>\n<p id=\"A77\"><em>\u25a0 </em>To substantiate his Eighth Amendment claim, Cole was obliged to adduce evidence of defendants\u2019 deliberate indifference to a serious medical need. <em>See Salahuddin v. Goord, </em>467 F.3d 263, 279-81 (2d Cir.2006). Deliberate indifference has two necessary components, one objective and the other subjective. <em>See Hathaway v. Coughlin, </em>99 F.3d 550, 553 (2d Cir.1996). Objectively, the deprivation must be \u201csufficiently serious,\u201d creating a risk of \u201cdeath, degeneration, or extreme pain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted); <em>accord Johnson v. Wright, </em>412 F.3d 398, 403 (2d Cir.2005). Subjectively, the official must have acted with the requisite state of mind, the \u201cequivalent of criminal recklessness.\u201d <em>Hathaway v. Coughlin, </em>99 F.3d at 553. Generally, a prisoner\u2019s \u201cmere allegations of negligent malpractice do not state a claim of deliberate indifference.\u201d <em>Id.; see Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 105-06, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Here, the record reveals, as a matter of law, that Cole failed to state a cognizable claim of deliberate indifference because the alleged deprivation \u2014 use of a makeshift hot-pack to treat Cole\u2019s chronic back pain, inadvertently resulting in a small second-degree burn \u2014 was not sufficiently serious to cause possible death, degeneration, or extreme pain, or \u201coffend evolving standards of decency.\u201d <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. at 106, 97 S.Ct. 285 (internal quotation marks omitted). We need not address Cole\u2019s claim that the magistrate judge improperly resolved certain issues of fact because the disputed issues are not material to Cole\u2019s indifference claim. To the extent Cole now asserts that defendants\u2019 treatment of his burn was inadequate, this argument was not raised below and is not appropriately brought before this Court for the first time on appeal. <em>See In re Flanagan, </em>503 F.3d 171, 182 (2d Cir.2007) (stating that, generally, this court \u201cwill not consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal,\u201d especially where additional factfinding is necessary). In any event, the medical records do not support Cole\u2019s new allegations. Accordingly, summary judgment was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">2. <em>Retaliation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">To show retaliation, Cole was required to present evidence that his constitutionally protected conduct in filing past grievances was a substantial or motivating factor for a prison official\u2019s adverse action. <em>See Bennett v. Goord, </em>343 F.3d 133, 137 (2d Cir.2003). The record fails to support an inference of the requisite causal connection between Cole\u2019s grievances and the misbehavior report filed against him. Rather, the evidence reveals that, at the disciplinary hearing triggered by the report at issue, Cole admitted the alleged misconduct. The adverse action, therefore, appears independently justified. <em>See id. </em>at 138. Thus, the district court correctly granted summary judgment on Cole\u2019s retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">3. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">We have reviewed Cole\u2019s remaining arguments on appeal and conclude that they are without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
