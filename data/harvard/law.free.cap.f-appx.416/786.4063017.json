O\u2019BRIEN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Timothy L. Wyrick appeals from the district court\u2019s imposition of a 37-month sentence arising from his guilty plea to five counts of making threatening telephone calls in interstate commerce. He claims his sentence is substantively unreasonable given his \u201ctrue first offender\u201d status <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and mental illness. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">In 2005, Wyrick began working as a motorist assist technician<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with the Kansas Highway Patrol (KHP). In mid-March 2009, he began a six-month campaign of making more than sixty harassing and threatening telephone calls to KHP Trooper Kristie Gatlin. During some of these calls, he either hung up before the call went to voicemail or let the call go to voicemail but did not leave a message or left an inaudible message. However, in a great number of these calls, he left messages on Gatlin\u2019s voicemail telling her he was watching her and stating facts indicating he knew her whereabouts and activities. Seven of the telephone calls were particularly egregious:</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">(1) May 26:</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">Hello, Kristie. I know you have a gold police car. I have fixed the brakes for you. Hello, Kristie. Letting you know I\u2019m still watching you. I know you had contact with the [Kansas Bureau of Investigation].</p>\n<p id=\"b809-14\">(R. Vol. 3 at 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b809-15\">(2) June 22:</p>\n<p id=\"b809-16\">What are you doing? Yes, I see you moved your cattle. How come you took your flag down? The gun you\u2019re carrying ain\u2019t going to help you off duty.

I\u2019m gonna flip a coin, see which one I do to ya first. Well I flipped a coin, I betcha you\u2019d like to know how that turned out. Bye!

Bye, bye now!</p>\n<p id=\"b810-16\"><em>(Id. </em>at 16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-17\">Wyrick was arrested on September 15; one of the telephones used to make some of the telephone calls was found in his boot. In a post-arrest interview, he admitted to making some of the telephone calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-18\">II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b810-19\">Wyrick was indicted on five counts of transmitting in interstate commerce a telephone call and voice mail message containing threats to injure the person of another in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(c). The counts in the indictment related to the calls made on May 26 (Count 1), June 22 (Count 2), August 7 (Count 3), August 10 (Count 4) and September 4 (Count 5). He was released on bond pending trial. He eventually pled guilty to the indictment without the benefit of a plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-20\">A presentence report (PSR) was prepared. The probation officer determined the base offense level was 12. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2A6.1(a). She recommended a two-level enhancement to the base offense level because the offense involved more than two threats. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(2)(A). She also recommended a four-level enhancement because the offense resulted in a \u201csubstantial disruption of public, governmental, or business functions or services.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(4)(A). Although Wyrick pled guilty, she did not recommend a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility due to his denial of responsibility after he pled guilty.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>Therefore, she determined the total offense level was 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Because Wyriek had no juvenile adjudications, adult criminal convictions, arrests or other criminal conduct, the PSR concluded his Criminal History Category was I. Based on a total offense level of 18 and a Criminal History Category of I, the advisory guideline range was 27 to 33 months imprisonment. The probation officer recommended, however, that the court depart upward from the advisory guideline range under USSG \u00a7 5K2.0(a) due to the following aggravating circumstances: (1) the \u201cunusually egregious\u201d nature of Wyriek\u2019s conduct; (2) Wyriek \u201cused his position as a motorfist] assist technician to commit the crime and to evade detection\u201d; and (3) the offenses involved over sixty threatening communications and took place over a period of six months. (R. Vol. 3 at 27-28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Wyriek objected to the PSR and filed a sentencing memorandum. He said he was entitled to a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, blaming any difficulty he has had in accepting the wrongfulness of his actions on his diagnosed mental condition of Delusional Disorder, Persecutory and Erotomania Types.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He also argued the four-level enhancement under USSG \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(4)(A) (substantial disruption) was unwarranted under the facts of the case. He not only objected to the probation officer\u2019s recommendation for an upward departure but requested a downward variance from the advisory guideline range based on his Delusional Disorder and his status as a \u201ctrue first offender.\u201d He requested the court \u201csentence him to a term of probation with special conditions that include mental health counseling.\u201d (R. Vol. 1 at 71.)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">The government filed a sentencing memorandum agreeing with the probation officer\u2019s guideline calculations and its recommendation for an upward departure under USSG \u00a7 5K2.0(a)(l). It recommended Wyriek receive the statutory maximum sentence of 60 months imprisonment \u201c[gjiven [his] six month campaign of terror ... against Trooper Gatlin, which also involved her family and investigating officers ____\u201d (R. Vol. 1 at 42.)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">Several witnesses testified at the sentencing hearing. Relevant here, Wyriek called Dr. Gregory Sisk, the clinical psychologist who diagnosed his Delusional Disorder. Sisk opined Wyriek was a \u201clow risk\u201d to the community because he did not demonstrate many of the factors used to predict violence in stalkers \u2014 Wyriek had no history of substance abuse or previous violence against persons or things; he had not been treated for any kind of mental illness; he did not possess weapons; he had never violated a protection order or taken a hostage; he did not have suicidal tendencies; and he did not appear to be jealous or possessive of Gatlin. (R. Vol. 2 at 187.) The only risk factors Sisk identified were that Wyrick\u2019s communications with Gatlin involved \u201cfour or five\u201d threats to kill and he was \u201csomewhat obsessed\u201d with her. <em>(Id. </em>at 186.) In part due to his behavior on bond, <em>ie., </em>his compliance with all of his bond conditions, including his having no contact with Gatlin, Sisk did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>believe Wyrick would reoffend. Sisk did think Wyrick would benefit from treatment for his Delusional Disorder as well as training to enhance his social skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">On cross examination, Sisk admitted it was \u201cpossible\u201d the risk to the community could be elevated where, as here, the stalking involved threats to multiple victims, <em>ie., </em>Gatlin, her family, and the investigating officers. <em>(Id. </em>at 196.) But he said the research only focused on the risk of violence to the object of the delusion, in this case, Gatlin. Of the more than sixty calls Wyrick made to Gatlin, Sisk characterized only five as \u201cthreatening.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 219.) While admitting that the number of threats to kill Gatlin could be relevant, the number of threats in this case did not change his assessment of Wyrick\u2019s risk to the community. And that risk assessment came in spite of his acknowledgment that between twenty-one and twenty-five percent of stalking cases result in some type of violence, with two percent of them resulting in the stalker killing the victim. He described these percentages as \u201clow.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 214.)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">The district court sustained Wyrick\u2019s objection to the four-level enhancement under USSG \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(4)(A). While it was a \u201cclose call,\u201d the court did \u201cnot believe that the disruption which occurred here was the kind of disruption the guidelines envisioned when [USSG \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(4)(A) ] was adopted.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 280.) Otherwise, the court reasoned, the enhancement would apply any time there is a substantial investigation. The court overruled Wyrick\u2019s objection to the probation officer\u2019s failure to recommend a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, concluding \u201cWyrick\u2019s testimony to the Kansas Department of Labor judge was purposefully untruthful and represented a denial by him of the full and complete responsibility that ... to this day he has not truly accepted.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 282.)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Although the court recognized its authority to depart or vary downward, it declined to do so based on either Wyriek\u2019s \u201ctrue first offender\u201d status or his suffering from a delusional disorder. It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJP\">Although Mr. Wyrick has no reported previous contacts with law enforcement, I also do not regard him as the sort of, quote, true first offender, end quote, for whom the Criminal History Category [I] overrepresents his culpability or his risk of recidivism. The duration and severity of his activities here belie that.... As to his mental condition, I agree with Dr. Sisk that Mr. Wyrick is in need of treatment, whatever the technical diagnosis. His behavior was reprehensible and bizarre, and if he truly can come to understand that and to see the world in a different way, perhaps he will not be a significant threat to repeat this conduct either as to Trooper Gatlin or as to someone else who might become the focus of his erotomania.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-8\">As I reflect on Dr. Sisk\u2019s testimony, I am drawn to the conclusion that even if it were true that the need for ... just punishment ... is lower for someone like Mr. Wyrick because of a mental defect, the need to protect the public from his crimes is in some respects greater. He did not suffer from some of the other problems that we often see with offenders, such as the lack of employment skills or substance abuse, but that is a two-edged sword. A person who lacks employment skills or has had a substance abuse problem can accept responsibility, address those issues, receive training and treatment, and be on the path to rehabilitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-9\">Here Mr. Wyrick has shown only the most cursory remorse, the [apology] letter to Trooper Gatlin, and has continual<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>ly minimized his culpability for an offense which terrorized a coworker and disrupted the activities of his employer, whose job it is to protect the public. Interestingly enough, while Mr. Wyrick had interviews with Dr. Sisk to prepare an expert report and for expert testimony at trial, Mr. Wyrick has not sought out any treatment, notwithstanding that he has been at liberty and available to do so. He understands the difference between right and wrong ... he does not suffer from uncontrollable impulses; he simply engaged in behavior that may have been rooted in a psychological disorder but which was no less serious as a result and is no less likely to happen again unless he decides that it is worth it to him to address seriously whatever issues he may have. And as one of the [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 3553 factors elaborates, the opportunity for [treatment] will be available to him as a result of his incarceration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-5\"><em>(Id. </em>at 283-85.)</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">The court did not credit Sisk\u2019s opinion that Wyrick was a low risk to the community:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-8\">I did not find [Sisk\u2019s] balancing of risk factors to be persuasive, especially upon cross examination by the government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-11\">The prolonged threats, especially in the face of knowing an investigation was in progress, the violent nature of many of those threats, and his irrational view of himself as a victim all undercut the reasons set forth by Dr. Sisk; thus, I see Mr. Wyrick as not only a threat to recidivate as to harassing behavior but also a risk to escalate that behavior to actual violence....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-12\"><em>(Id. </em>at 285.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-13\">In the end, the court determined a five-level upward departure under USSG \u00a7 5K2.0(a) was appropriate: (1) two levels for the number of calls and the duration of the offense conduct; (2) one level for the fact Wyrick used his employment position to facilitate the calls, (3) one level for the \u201chorrific\u201d nature of the telephone calls which included threats to kill and led Gatlin to believe Wyrick was constantly watching her, and (4) one level for his willful conduct in disrupting the Kansas Highway Patrol\u2019s ordinary activities.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at 287.) It concluded such enhancement \u201cwould be sufficient but not greater than necessary to carry out Congress\u2019 objectives for sentencing embodied in the [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 3553 factors.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (R. Vol. 2 at 288.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>After factoring in the upward departure, the total offense level was 19, which, with a Criminal History Category of I, resulted in an advisory guideline range of 30 to 37 months imprisonment. The court concluded a sentence at the high end of that range was appropriate and sentenced Wyriek to 37 months imprisonment. Reflecting its consideration of the \u00a7 3553 factors, it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An5M\">Mr. Wyrick\u2019s conduct was very serious, albeit he did not actually assault Trooper Gatlin or worse, but I do not believe that she will soon get over the mental anguish inflicted; moreover, her family and her coworkers were all adversely affected by his activity. Thus, this sentence would reflect the seriousness of the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-4\">The need for just punishment calls out for a substantial imprisonment sentence. To the extent that Mr. Wyrick\u2019s mental condition is a mitigating factor, that is somewhat offset by the availability of treatment for him in the prison system, and this sentence would constitute just punishment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-5\">Others should be deterred from such behavior. These were not just childish prank calls; they had consequences for the victims and others, and those people who might be inclined to do such calls or engage in such activity should realize that there are serious consequences for one who does engage in such activity. I have previously observed that I believe the public needs protection from Mr. Wyriek and a 37-month sentence will do so by incapacitating him for a substantial period of time, during which treatment will be available and he will have the opportunity to come to grips with and overcome whatever led to this offense behavior.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">(R. Vol. 2 at 289-90.)</p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">\u201cAfter <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review sentences for reasonableness .... \u201d <em>United States v. Alapizco-Valenzuela, </em>546 F.3d 1208,\u2019 1214 (10th Cir. 2008). Reasonableness review consists of both a procedural and a substantive component. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe procedural component focuses on the manner in which the sentence was calculated, and the substantive component concerns the length of the sentence actually imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Masek, </em>588 F.3d 1283, 1290 (10th Cir.2009) (quotations omitted). Wyriek does not dispute the procedural reasonableness of his sentence. He only claims his 37-month sentence is substantively unreasonable because it failed to accommodate his status as a \u201ctrue first offender\u201d and his delusional disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">\u201cWe review sentences for substantive reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Middagh, </em>594 F.3d 1291, 1294 (10th Cir.2010). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion when it renders a judgment that is arbitrary, capricious, whimsical, or manifestly unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Mu\u00f1oz-Nava, </em>524 F.3d 1137, 1146 (10th Cir.2008) (quotations omitted). We must determine \u201cwhether the length of the sentence is reasonable given all the circumstances of the case in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Alapizco-Valenzuela, </em>546 F.3d at 1215 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">In May 2004, the United States Sentencing Commission released a study entitled \u201cRecidivism and the \u2018First Offender.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That study showed that recidivism rates differ among defendants who are assigned to Criminal History Category I. For instance, the study showed that defendants who had one criminal history point were almost twice as likely to reoffend as those with no criminal history points, even though both sets of defendants would fall within Criminal History Category I. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Recidivism and the \u201cFirst Offender\u201d </em>(May 2004) at 13. It also revealed a significant difference in recidivism rates among Category I offenders with no criminal history points \u2014 offenders with no prior arrests have a recidivism rate of 6.8% whereas offenders with prior arrests but no prior convictions have a recidivism rate of 17.2%. <em>Id. </em>at 16-17. The study concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-6\">From both culpability and recidivism risk perspectives, ... offenders! ] with no prior arrests, most strongly meet the conceptual definition of the first offender category. [These] [offenders have had no recorded contact with the criminal justice system prior to their instant federal offense. Moreover, as indicated by their extremely low recidivism rate of 6.8 percent, they are easily the most empirically identifiable group of guideline federal offenders who are the least likely to re-offend.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">Relying on this study, Wyrick argues the district court should have varied downward from the advisory guideline range due to his \u201ctrue first offender\u201d status. He says his \u201ccomplete lack of prior contact with the law distinguishes him even from other defendants in criminal history category I, and projects a very low risk of recidivism. This differential in recidivism rates is not adequately captured in the Sentencing Guidelines, and provides a[ ] separate rationale for a downward variance.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 10.) He claims his behavior while on bond supports the research that as a \u201ctrue first offender\u201d he is unlikely to reoffend.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">Wyrick also argues the court should have considered his mental illness a mitigating circumstance requiring a downward variance. While his delusional disorder did not render him unable to differentiate between right and wrong, he says it was the \u201cdriving force behind his bizarre and irrational behavior\u201d and \u201cclearly decreased [his] culpability.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 21.) Wyrick also contends the district court erred in justifying the length of the sentence on his ability to obtain treatment while in prison. He says his behavior on pretrial release demonstrates he could be treated successfully while under supervision in the community. Therefore, he contends, the court\u2019s use of treatment as a justification for the imposition of a lengthy prison sentence runs contrary to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(k), which states it is inappropriate to impose a prison sentence for purposes of rehabilitating the defendant or' providing the defendant with needed correctional treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>We see no abuse of discretion and conclude Wyrick\u2019s sentence is patently reasonable. The district court considered Wyrick\u2019s argument that he was entitled to a lower sentence due to his being a \u201ctrue first offender.\u201d However, it determined the duration and severity of Wyrick\u2019s conduct belied any notion that he was a \u201ctrue first offender.\u201d It also was not convinced (and reasonably so) that Wyrick was unlikely to reoffend merely because he did not have any previous contact with law enforcement. The court noted Wyrick (1) had continued his harassing behavior despite knowing he was under investigation, (2) had shown only the most cursory remorse, and (3) continued to minimize his culpability for the offense. It also pointed out that although Wyrick sought Sisk\u2019s assistance for purposes of preparing an expert report for trial, he had utterly failed to seek any treatment for his delusional disorder while released on bond. His failure to address his delusional disorder, the alleged cause of his offensive behavior, weighs against any argument that he is unlikely to reoffend. Finally, the court did not credit Sisk\u2019s opinion that Wyrick was not a threat for violence concluding \u201chis balancing of risk factors [was not] persuasive.... I see Mr. Wyrick as not only a threat to recidivate as to harassing behavior but also a risk to escalate that behavior to actual violence.\u201d (R. Vol. 2 at 285.) That was the court\u2019s prerogative. <em>See United, States v. Munoz-Tello, </em>531 F.3d 1174, 1182 (10th Cir.2008) (stating we defer to the district court\u2019s assessment of the sentencing-hearing testimony where other evidence does not unequivocally controvert that assessment); <em>see also, c.f, United States v. Oliver, </em>278 F.3d 1035, 1043 (10th Cir.2001) (stating \u201cit is solely within the province of the jury[ ] to weigh ... expert testimony\u201d) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">The same is true for Wyrick\u2019s argument that he is entitled to a downward variance based on his delusional disorder. The district court considered his mental illness but concluded a downward variance on that basis was unwarranted because his behavior \u201cwas no less serious as a result and is no less likely to happen again.\u201d (R. Vol. 2 at 285.) And the court reasoned that although the need for just punishment (one of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors) may be lower for someone with a mental illness, the need to protect the public (also a \u00a7 3553(a) factor) may be greater.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">Wyrick is correct that \u00a7 994(k) provides that the Sentencing Commission \u201cshall insure that the guidelines reflect the inappropriateness of imposing a sentence to a term of imprisonment for the purpose of rehabilitating the defendant or providing [him] with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment.\u201d However, \u00a7 994(k), along with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> merely \u201cclarify that it is inappropriate to impose a sentence to a term of imprisonment <em>solely for </em>rehabilitative purposes or correctional treatment.\u201d <em>United States v. Tsosie, </em>376 F.3d 1210, 1215 (10th Cir.2004) (emphasis in original omitted, new emphasis added). Here, the court did not impose a prison sentence solely to allow Wyrick to receive treatment. Rather, it is apparent that the court mentioned Wyrick\u2019s ability to receive treatment while in prison in response to Wyrick\u2019s argument that a term of probation was appropriate as it would allow him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>to obtain treatment for his mental illness. Even assuming the court did consider his ability to receive treatment in prison in deciding a term of imprisonment was appropriate, it clearly was not the only factor. Wyrick\u2019s claim that his need for treatment did not justify a prison sentence because he could be treated while released in the community is strained because he never sought treatment for his disorder while on pretrial release. It does, however, reflect a common theme running throughout these proceedings \u2014 Wyrick\u2019s refusal to take responsibility for his actions and his attempt to shift the blame elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">It is clear from the sentencing transcript that the district court took pains to arrive at a just sentence, one that was \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary to carry out Congress\u2019 objectives for sentencing embodied in the [\u00a7 ] 3553 factors.\u201d (R. Vol. 2 at 288.) It acknowledged Wyrick\u2019s arguments but reasonably found them unconvincing given the facts of the case. We discern no abuse of discretion in the imposition of a 37-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b809-10\"> The parties have waived oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed.

After the court imposed sentence, defense counsel asked for clarification as to whether the sentence increase was a departure or a variance.

The government argues that because the district court correctly calculated the guideline range and imposed a sentence within that range, Wyrick\u2019s sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. That is incorrect. Wyrick's sentence included a five-level upward departure (or variance) from the advisory guideline range. Therefore, the presumption of reasonableness does not apply. <em>See United States v.
