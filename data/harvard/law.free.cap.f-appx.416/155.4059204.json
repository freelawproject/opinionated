He overstayed his period of admission and, in 2006, was charged with removability pursuant to Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B) ]. Benek conceded that he was removable as an overstay, but sought withholding of removal and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied relief, stating that he was \u201cmak[ing] as strong [an adverse] credibility finding as I can.\u201d The Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) dismissed Benek\u2019s appeal, concluding that the IJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>\u201cprovided specific and cogent reasons for finding the respondent not credible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Benek filed a timely motion to reopen, seeking to apply for adjustment of status based on an approved visa petition filed by his United States citizen wife, Raquel Lopez.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 245 [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255]. The BIA denied reopening \u201cas a matter of discretion,\u201d essentially concluding that the marriage was not bona fide. In particular, the Board noted a significant discrepancy between Benek\u2019s visa petition materials (which indicated that he had no prior marriages) and the record concerning his unsuccessful asylum application (which revealed that he had married a Turkish citizen in New Jersey in 2002). The Board stated that it was \u201cunable to locate within [Benek\u2019s] current filings any indication that he has been divorced from his first wife or that he ever informed DHS about the marriage, or the children who were born during that marriage.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Benek filed a timely petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The Government has moved to dismiss the petition for review, arguing that we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary judgment regarding the granting of adjustment of status under \u00a7 245. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(i) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) ]; <em>Martinez-Maldonado v. Gonzales, </em>437 F.3d 679, 683 (7th Cir. 2006) (holding that \u201cwe lack jurisdiction over motions to reopen and reconsider in cases where we lack jurisdiction to review the underlying order\u201d). Benek counters that he \u201cis not appealing the denial of an application for relief under \u00a7 245, but [is] appealing the discretionary denial of his motion to reopen.\u201d <em>See </em>Petitioner\u2019s Response, 3; <em>cf. Korytnyuk v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 272, 280-81 &amp; n. 12 (3d Cir.2005) (holding that BIA\u2019s denial of motion to remand for adjustment of status \u201cis not a judgment on whether to adjust [the petitioner\u2019s] status under \u00a7 245(a) of the INA, which would be a discretionary decision under an enumerated provision in [the transitional rules], but is rather a discretionary decision under a regulation not listed in, or derived from, any of the enumerated provisions in [the transitional rules].\u201d). In any event, we have jurisdiction to review questions of law and constitutional claims, <em>see </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), including Benek\u2019s arguments that the Board improperly engaged in fact-finding and denied him an opportunity to respond to potentially dispositive administratively noticed facts. <em>See Padmore v. Holder, </em>609 F.3d 62, 67 (2d Cir.2010) (\u201c[W]hen the BIA engages in factfinding in contravention of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv), it commits an error of law, which we have jurisdiction to correct.\u201d); <em>Enriquez-Gutierrez v. Holder, </em>612 F.3d 400, 406, 410-11 (5th Cir.2010) (exercising jurisdiction, pursuant to \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), over claim that BIA went beyond its authority in taking administrative notice of transcript of prior deportation hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">Benek argues that if the BIA intends to take administrative notice of potentially dispositive facts, it must warn a petitioner and provide the petitioner with an oppor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>tunity to respond before it denies a motion to reopen on the basis of those facts. In support of this assertion, he relies on <em>Burger v. Gonzales, </em>498 F.3d 131 (2d Cir. 2007), and <em>Chhetry v. Department of Justice, </em>490 F.3d 196 (2d Cir.2007) (per curiam). In those cases, the Board\u2019s decisions to deny relief were solely based on facts that it administratively noticed, namely, current events bearing on the asylum applicants\u2019 well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See Burger, </em>498 F.3d at 133, 135; <em>Chhetry, </em>490 F.3d at 198-99. Here, however, the inconsistencies concerning Benek\u2019s marriage were apparent from the record and the materials Benek submitted in support of his motion to reopen.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, because the Board drew its conclusions from evidence provided by Benek himself, it did not have to provide him with an opportunity to respond prior to denying the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we will deny Benek\u2019s petition for review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b178-7\">. When he filed his motion to reopen, the visa petition had not yet been approved. But by the time the BIA adjudicated the motion to reopen, the visa petition had been granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b178-8\">. Benek alleges that the \u201cUSCIS was or should have been aware of [his] prior marriage\u201d because it had before it the record from the asylum proceedings, which included information concerning his previous wife. Contrary to Benek's assertion, however, the asylum proceedings were still pending before the BIA when the visa petition was filed. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.5(a) (providing that \"[i]f an appeal is taken from a decision of an immigration judge, the record of proceeding shall be forwarded to the Board upon the request or the order of the Board.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b179-7\">. Benek's assertion that he is prima facie eligible for adjustment of status is not in dispute. <em>Cf. In re Velarde-Pacheco, 23 </em>I. &amp; N. Dec. 253, 256 (BIA 2002) (addressing factors necessary to grant a motion to reopen based on an <em>unadjndicated </em>visa petition). Indeed, an approved visa petition based on marriage \"will be considered primary evidence of eligibility for the bona fide marriage exemption.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.1(c)(8)(v). Nevertheless, despite Benek\u2019s eligibility, the BIA's discretionary denial of the motion to reopen was permissible. <em>See INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104-05, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988) (holding that where the underlying relief sought is discretionary, the BIA may deny a motion to reopen if it determines that it would ultimately exercise discretion to deny that relief).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b179-24\">.
