Because McDonald received ineffective assistance in conjunction with his guilty plea which affected the voluntariness of the plea, we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-26\">McDonald was charged with possession with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine. He filed two motions to suppress the statements and physical evidence obtained during a traffic stop, automobile search, and interrogation. Fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>lowing a lengthy suppression hearing, on April 15, 2008, the district court denied the motions to suppress in open court. On the same day, McDonald entered an unconditional guilty plea to the aforementioned charge pursuant to a written plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">On September 22, 2008, McDonald filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, asserting that his plea was not knowing and voluntary because he did not understand the consequences of his plea, he felt pressured to plead guilty, he pleaded guilty only to avoid a lengthy sentence if he was found guilty at trial, and he was actually innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">On January 21, 2009, McDonald filed a supplemental motion to withdraw his guilty plea, asserting for the first time that his plea was not knowing and voluntary because counsel erroneously informed him that he could appeal the denial of his motions to suppress even if he pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Following an evidentiary hearing on the motion to withdraw, the district court denied the motion. The district court sentenced McDonald to 120 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release. McDonald filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">McDonald\u2019s primary argument on appeal is that the district court erred by denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea because he was provided ineffective assistance of counsel. McDonald was advised that, despite a guilty plea, he would be able to appeal the district court\u2019s rulings on his motions to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">The district court may permit a defendant to withdraw his guilty plea after acceptance of the plea but before sentence is imposed if \u201cthe defendant can show a fair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B). The denial of a motion to withdraw is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. McKnight, </em>570 F.3d 641, 645 (5th Cir. 2009). Courts have considered the following factors to determine whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the district court should have permitted the defendant to withdraw his plea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-11\">(1) whether or not the defendant has asserted his innocence; (2) whether or not the government would suffer prejudice if the withdrawal motion were granted; (3) whether or not the defendant has delayed in filing his withdrawal motion; (4) whether or not the withdrawal would substantially inconvenience the court; (5) whether or not close assistance of counsel was available; (6) whether or not the original plea was knowing and voluntary; and (7) whether or not the withdrawal would waste judicial resources.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-12\"><em>United States v. Carr, </em>740 F.2d 339, 343-44 (5th Cir.1984) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-13\">The district court denied McDonald\u2019s motion based on his conclusion that McDonald admitted his guilt on several occasions which contradicted his claim of actual innocence, received close assistance of counsel, and delayed in filing his withdrawal motion for several months after his plea. The court put no weight on the factors of prejudice to the government, inconvenience to the court or waste of judicial resources. The district court also found that McDonald\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary. This last factor is the focus of this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-14\">McDonald contends that his plea was not knowing and voluntary because he pleaded guilty under \u201cextreme time pressure\u201d and \u201cact[ed] hastily and without fully appreciating the nature of his plea of guilty and the consequences.\u201d He also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>argues that his plea was not knowing and voluntary because he pleaded guilty in reliance on counsel\u2019s erroneous advice that he could appeal the suppression rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The time constraints McDonald faced when deciding whether to plead guilty were not so extreme as to render his plea unknowing and involuntary. The suppression motions were denied on April 15, 2008, the same day trial was scheduled to begin, and McDonald pleaded guilty approximately five minutes later. However, McDonald and counsel had sufficient time to decide whether to plead guilty if the district court denied the motion. At the April 4, 2008 pretrial conference, counsel was informed that the hearing on the suppression motion would be held shortly before trial was scheduled to begin. As of April 8, 2008, trial was scheduled to begin on April 14, 2008. On April 13, 2008, the trial date was reset for April 15, 2008. Further, counsel\u2019s request for a brief recess in between the suppression and rearraignment hearings indicates that he and McDonald had discussed and were prepared for this contingency: \u201cMay I have about five minutes? I think \u2018cause probably my client\u2019s going to probably change his plea at this time based on the Court\u2019s ruling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">McDonald also argues that his plea was involuntary based on counsel\u2019s erroneous advice that he would be able to appeal the suppression rulings even if he pleaded guilty. This court does not review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal unless the claim was addressed by the district court or the record is sufficiently developed to allow evaluation of the claim on its merits. <em>United States v. Villegas-Rodriguez, </em>171 F.3d 224, 230 (5th Cir. 1999). The record in this case allows review of McDonald\u2019s claim in this direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">When examining the voluntariness of a plea, the reviewing court asks \u201cwhether the plea represents a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action open to the defendant.\u201d <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 56, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The two-part <em>Strickland </em>test applies to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 58, 106 S.Ct. 366. \u201cWhere ... a defendant is represented by counsel during the plea process and enters his plea upon the advice of counsel, the voluntariness of the plea depends on whether counsel\u2019s advice was within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56, 106 S.Ct. 366. In addition, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s ineffective, performance affected the outcome of the plea process. <em>Id. </em>at 59,106 S.Ct. 366.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">In other words, in order to satisfy the \u201cprejudice\u201d requirement, the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-10\">It is the lawyer\u2019s duty to ascertain if the plea is entered voluntarily and knowingly. He must actually and substantially assist his client in deciding whether to plead guilty. It is his job to provide the accused an \u201cunderstanding of the law in relation to the facts.\u201d The advice he gives need not be perfect, but it must be reasonably competent. His advice should permit the accused to make an informed and conscious choice. In other words, if the quality of counsel\u2019s service falls below a certain minimum level, the client\u2019s guilty plea cannot be knowing and voluntary because it will not represent an informed choice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ack\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number><em>Herring v. Estelle, </em>491 F.2d 125, 128 (5th Cir.l974)(internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Counsel\u2019s erroneous advice in this case about McDonald\u2019s appeal rights constitutes deficient performance. A voluntary and unconditional guilty plea waives a defendant\u2019s right to challenge any nonjurisdictional defects arising prior to the plea, including the erroneous denial of a motion to suppress. <em>United States v. Wise, </em>179 F.3d 184, 186 (5th Cir.1999). A defendant may plead guilty and reserve his right to challenge a pretrial ruling by entering a conditional plea with the Government\u2019s and district court\u2019s consent. Fed.R. Crim.P. 11(a)(2). Counsel\u2019s advice was thus erroneous because he advised McDonald that he could appeal the denial of his suppression motions without securing a conditional plea or arranging for and counseling McDonald to enter a conditional plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">McDonald submitted a duly sworn affidavit in which he averred that he pleaded guilty based on counsel\u2019s advice that he would be able to appeal the suppression ruling even if he pleaded guilty and that he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial had he been correctly informed. Counsel also submitted a duly sworn affidavit in which he averred that he advised McDonald he could appeal the suppression ruling even if he pleaded guilty. The district court accepted these affidavits as true. That finding should have ended the analysis because both prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>analysis were thus satisfied \u2014 erroneous advice and prejudice that affected the defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty. Accordingly, McDonald\u2019s plea was not knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The district court analyzed the issue differently. It stated that the defendant\u2019s recourse for ineffective assistance was a petition for habeas relief. It also assumed that McDonald would only be prejudiced by counsel\u2019s erroneous advice on the appealability of the suppression issues if the district court\u2019s suppression ruling was incorrect. Evaluating his own ruling, the district court concluded that its decision on the suppression motions was correct. This was error.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">When the defendant waives his constitutional rights by pleading guilty, it is crucial that the waiver be knowing and voluntary. \u201cCourts must always be diligent to ascertain whether a plea of guilty was understandingly made, and when it appears before sentencing that such a plea was entered by a defendant who ... acted as a result of mistake, it is an abuse of discretion not to permit the plea to be withdrawn.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-10\"><em>United States v. Pressley, </em>602 F.2d 709, 710-711 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\"><em>Carr </em>recognized that in analyzing the factors to be considered in addressing a motion to withdraw a guilty plea, the court must consider the totality of the circumstances. <em>Car.r, </em>740 F.2d at 344. <em>Carr </em>also recognized that the various factors that may be considered are not equal in weight. <em>Id. </em>When, as in this case, the defendant delays in bringing his motion to withdraw, more substantial reasons must be proffered to support the motion. In this case, the fact that McDonald received ineffective assistance of counsel that affected his decision to plead guilty is such a reason. Although the district court was understandably skeptical regarding McDonald\u2019s claims of actual innocence and correctly counted the fact that McDonald delayed in bringing his motion to withdraw and had close assistance of counsel against him, our conclusion that McDonald\u2019s plea was not knowing and voluntary as a result of ineffective of assistance of counsel is sufficient to establish that the district court abused its discretion in denying McDonald\u2019s motion to withdraw the plea. We therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>remand this case to the district court so that it can issue an order permitting McDonald to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">We decline McDonald\u2019s request to address the merits of the district court\u2019s rulings on his motions to suppress. The effect of our order is to place this case back in the posture it was in before the entry of the plea, allowing McDonald to face trial with his motions to suppress having been denied and preserving his right to appeal the rulings on those motions, following entry of final judgment in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b455-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
