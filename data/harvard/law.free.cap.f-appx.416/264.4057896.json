Gonzalez was sentenced to consecutive mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment of 120 months on Count 1 and 60 months on Count 69, for a total sentence of 180 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-24\">On appeal, Gonzalez argues that he was improperly convicted on Count 69 and that if that conviction is vacated, his sentence on Count 1 is flawed because without the conviction on Count 69, he would have met the qualifications for the \u201csafety valve\u201d provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) (2006) and U.S. <em>Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5C1.2 (2007), and thus may have received a sentence below the otherwise applicable statutory minimum term of 120 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-25\">The United States has filed a motion to vacate Gonzalez\u2019s conviction and sentence on Count 69 and to remand to the district court for further proceedings. Gonzalez concurs in this disposition of Count 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Upon consideration, the court grants the Government\u2019s motion to vacate Gonzalez\u2019s conviction and sentence on Count 69, and to remand to the district court for further proceedings as may be appropriate. In addition, we affirm Gonzalez\u2019s conviction on Count 1. To preserve the rights of both Gonzalez and the Government as to Gonzalez\u2019s sentence on Count 1, however, we further vacate Gonzalez\u2019s sentence on Count 1, and remand with instructions that Gonzalez is to be resentenced as to Count 1 after the Government has had a reasonable opportunity to determine whether to pursue further charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
