On appeal, Lemorin argues that: (1) substantial evidence does not support the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s conclusion that based on his involvement with the Moorish Science Temple (\u201cMST\u201d) in Miami, he was removable under the three grounds provided by the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B)(i), and listed in the Notice to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d); (2) the BIA and IJ violated his due process rights; (3) the BIA and IJ violated the Double Jeopardy Clause under the Fifth Amendment; and (4) substantial evidence does not support the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s finding that he was not entitled to CAT relief. After thorough review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-17\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). To the extent that the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-18\">We review constitutional challenges <em>de novo. Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006). We review the BIA\u2019s interpretation of applicable statutes <em>de novo, </em>but defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation if it is reasonable. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. We review factual findings under the substantial-evidence test. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). Under the substantial-evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>test, we must affirm the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decisions if they are \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.Bd at 1284 (citation omitted). \u201cTo reverse a factual finding ..., [we] must find not only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but that it compels one.\u201d <em>Farquharson v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>246 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir.2001). The fact that evidence in the record may also support a conclusion contrary to the administrative findings is not enough to justify a reversal. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(fin banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">A party abandons a claim by not raising it or by only making passing references to the issue on appeal. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). Also, Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28 provides that the argument section of an appellant\u2019s brief must contain \u201cappellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u201d Fed.RApp.P. 28(a)(9)(A); <em>see also Kelliher v. Veneman, </em>313 F.3d 1270, 1274 n. 3 (11th Cir.2002) (holding that, in an employment-discrimination appeal, the plaintiff waived any challenge to an issue by only mentioning it in the summary of the argument section of the initial brief). Finally, we lack jurisdiction to consider claims not raised and therefore not exhausted before the BIA. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">First, we are unpersuaded by Lemorin\u2019s argument that substantial evidence does not support the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s finding that he was removable under the three grounds provided in the INA. Under the INA, an admitted alien is deportable if he has engaged in terrorist activities described in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(3). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(4)(B). In relevant part, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(3) targets an alien (1) who has engaged in a terrorist activity, (2) whom a consular officer, the Attorney General, or the Secretary of Homeland Security knows, or has reasonable ground to believe, is engaged in or is likely to engage in any terrorist activity, or (3) who is a member of a \u201cTier III\u201d terrorist organization,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> unless the alien can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he did not know, and should not have known, that the organization was a terrorist organization. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B)(i)(I), (II), <em>&amp; </em>(VI). The statute broadly defines the act of engaging in terrorist activity as including, in relevant part, (1) committing, under circumstances indicating an intention to cause death or serious bodily injury, a terrorist activity; (2) preparing or planning a terrorist activity; (3) gathering information on potential targets for terrorist activity; and (4) committing an act that the actor knows, or reasonably should know, that affords material support (a) for the commission of a terrorist activity, (b) to any individual who the actor knows or reasonably should know has committed or plans to commit a terrorist activity, or (c) to a Tier III terrorist organization, if the alien cannot satisfy the lack-of-knowledge exception. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B)(iv); <em>see Khan v. Holder, </em>584 F.3d 773, 777 (9th Cir.2009) (persuasive authority noting that the statute defines the \u201cengaging] in terrorist activity\u201d phrase broadly).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">On this record, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s conclusion that Lemorin was removable under all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>three statutory grounds listed in the NTA. First, the record shows that Lemorin actually engaged in terrorist activities, in that he had acted with the intent to cause death or seriously bodily injury, and that he had provided material support to the MST, and its leader, Narseal Batiste. As the record shows, in March 2006, Batiste, Lemorin, and five other MST members pledged allegiance to al Qaeda and discussed plans to blow up the Sears Tower in Chicago, Illinois, and various FBI buildings nationwide. Moreover, even assuming that Lemorin only had committed two discrete acts of terrorism (i.e., two oath ceremonies in March 2006), as he argues, those two acts still show that he had engaged in terrorist activities within the meaning of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B)(i)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Second, for these same reasons, there are reasonable grounds to believe that he was engaged in terrorist activities. Third, substantial evidence shows that Lemorin was a \u201cmember\u201d of the MST group led by Batiste, because its shows that Lemorin knew the nature of the group and associated with it in several meaningful ways. And as for Lemorin\u2019s claim that MST was a <em>bona fide </em>national religious group and not a terrorist organization, we lack jurisdiction to address that argument because he failed'to exhaust the issue by not raising it before the BIA. See <em>Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>46B F.Sd at 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Next, we find no merit in Lemorin\u2019s claims that the BIA and IJ committed the following due process violations: (1) the IJ initially sustained only two of the three removal charges, but subsequently considered the government\u2019s motion to clarify and amended the order to sustain all three removal charges, after the IJ had instructed the parties not to file further motions; (2) the BIA denied a joint motion for a second extension of time and deprived him of a reasonable time to adequately prepare a brief; (3) the IJ failed to rule on his numerous evidentiary objections to the government\u2019s submissions during the hearings, other than noting that hearsay evidence was admissible; (4) the BIA denied his challenge in this regard by merely repeating the standard of admissibility; and (5) the IJ relied \u201cexclusively\u201d on evidence from his previous criminal trial, such as the trial transcript and expert testimony, particularly due to the fact that he was acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">\u201c[T]he Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process of law in deportation proceedings.\u201d <em>Reno v. Flores, </em>507 U.S. 292, 306, 113 S.Ct. 1439, 123 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993). Accordingly, aliens must receive \u201cnotice and opportunity to be heard in their removal proceedings.\u201d <em>Fernandez-Bernal v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>257 F.3d 1304, 1310 n. 8 (11th Cir.2001). To prevail on a due process challenge, an alien must show substantial prejudice such that the outcome would have differed \u201cin the absence of the alleged procedural deficiencies.\u201d <em>Patel v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>334 F.3d 1259, 1263 (11th Cir .2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">\u201cDue process is satisfied only by a full and fair hearing.\u201d <em>Ibrahim v. U.S. INS, </em>821 F.2d 1547, 1550 (11th Cir.1987). The INA provides that \u201cthe alien shall have a reasonable opportunity ... to present evidence on the alien\u2019s own behalf....\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(4)(B). Under federal regulation, an alien in custody has 21 days to file a brief to the BIA, but, \u201cupon written motion, [the BIA] may extend the period for filing a brief or a reply brief for up to 90 days for good cause shown.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.3(c)(1). \u201cIn the interests of fairness and the efficient use of administrative resources,\u201d extension requests are disfavored. <em>See </em>BIA Practice Manual, \u00a7 4.7(c)(i). Accordingly, the BIA\u2019s policy is to grant a first briefing extension, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>only to grant second requests \u201cin rare circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4.7(c)(i)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">It is well settled that in administrative proceedings, the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply. <em>Garces v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>611 F.3d 1337, 1347 (11th Cir.2010). \u201cUncontradicted hearsay evidence is admissible in deportation proceedings if it is probative and its use is not fundamentally unfair so as to deprive petitioner of due process.\u201d <em>Tashnizi v. INS, </em>585 F.2d 781, 782-83 (5th Cir.1978) (quotation omitted);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>see also Zahedi v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1157, 1164 n. 6 (9th Cir.2000) (persuasive authority holding that, in immigration proceedings, documentary evidence is admissible if it is probative and its admission is fundamentally fair).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Here, the BIA and IJ did not commit any due process violations because (1) Lemorin had notice and an opportunity to respond to the government\u2019s motion for clarification, which the IJ considered in amending the removal order to sustain all three charges in the NTA; (2) the BIA did not err in denying his second request to extend the briefing deadline because he failed to show good cause; and (3) the IJ properly addressed all of his evidentiary objections during the proceedings by stating that hearsay evidence was generally admissible in immigration proceedings. In addition, Lemorin has failed to exhaust the argument that the IJ improperly relied on records from his criminal trial because he did not raise the issue in front of the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">We also reject Lemorin\u2019s argument that he was subjected to double jeopardy when the government initiated removal proceedings against him based on the same terrorism charges of which he was acquitted in a previous criminal trial. Under our law, deportation proceedings cannot form the basis of a double-jeopardy claim because double jeopardy arises in criminal proceedings, and deportation is a civil matter. <em>De La Teja v. United States, </em>321 F.3d 1357, 1364-65 (11th Cir.2003) (rejecting an alien\u2019s argument that his continuing detention pending the entry of a final order of removal violates the prohibition against double jeopardy because deportation proceedings \u201ccannot form the basis for a double jeopardy claim\u201d because \u201cthey are inherently civil in nature\u201d); <em>see Garces, </em>611 F.3d at 1347 (holding that immigration proceedings are not criminal trials and involve a considerably less stringent standard of proof); <em>Cadet v. Bulger, </em>377 F.3d 1173, 1196 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment is criminal in nature, and, thus, does not apply to deportation proceedings because deportation is neither criminal nor punitive, in that it is \u201cpurely civil\u201d). But in any event, we do not address Lemorin\u2019s double-jeopardy argument because he only raises that argument for the first time on appeal and failed to exhaust the issue in front of the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">Finally, we disagree with Lemorin\u2019s claim that the BIA and IJ erred in denying his application for withholding of removal based on CAT relief because substantial evidence shows that he would be tortured by the Haitian government upon deportation. Relief under CAT is a type of mandatory remedy of withholding of removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). To qualify for CAT relief, the applicant carries the burden of proof to establish \u201c \u2018that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sanchez Jim</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number><em>enez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1239 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2)). In turn, \u201ctorture\u201d is defined as \u201cany act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person ... when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1). Further, federal regulations provide that \u201c[t]orture is an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment and does not include lesser forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that do not amount to torture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 208.18(a)(2). \u201cIn order to constitute torture, an act must be specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 208.18(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">On the record before us, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief. First, because the knowledge of Lemorin\u2019s expert, Michelle Karshan, was solely derived from her experience before 2004, because Karshan failed to submit any evidence corroborating her alleged expertise in anti-terrorism efforts of the Haitian government, and because Karshan\u2019s testimony that the Haitian government employed special torture squads to interrogate detainees is contradicted by the Department of State Report of Haiti in both 2007 and 2008, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s decision to qualify Karshan as a limited witness in areas regarding Haitian country conditions and the experiences of criminal deportees in Haiti, and to give less weight to her testimony in the area of counter-terrorism efforts by the Haitian government. Moreover, because the government\u2019s expert, Maurice Geiger, took a total of 44 trips to Haiti from 1995 to 2008, while he interviewed numerous Haitian detainees, deportees, and government officials, and because Geiger had firsthand experience observing the treatment of deportees and detainees in Haiti, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s decision to give weight to Geiger\u2019s testimony, as a limited expert on Haitian prison conditions. And lastly, because Lemorin failed to satisfy his burden of showing that he would more likely than not be tortured by the Haitian government upon deportation, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s denial of Lemorin\u2019s application for CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b60-6\">.
