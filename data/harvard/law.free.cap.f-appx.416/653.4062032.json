Arias and Fredy Eduardo Cutzal-Arias, natives and citizens of Guatemala, petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order dismissing their appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying their application for asylum, withholding of removal, protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), and Arias\u2019 request for cancellation of removal. Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Nahrvani v. Gonzales, </em>399 F.3d 1148, 1151 (9th Cir.2005), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that petitioners\u2019 experiences in Guatemala did not constitute persecution. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2003). Further, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that petitioners failed to establish they have an objective well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See Nahrvani, </em>399 F.3d at 1154; <em>see also Aruta v. INS, </em>80 F.3d 1389, 1395-96 (9th Cir.1996) (record evidence did not compel finding that petitioner\u2019s fear of future persecution was objectively reasonable). Accordingly, petitioners\u2019 asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Because petitioners failed to demonstrate they were eligible for asylum, they necessarily failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Nahrvani, </em>399 F.3d at 1154.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because petitioners failed to establish it is more likely than not they would be tortured if returned to Guatemala. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">Finally, we lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary determination that Arias failed to establish the requisite hardship for cancellation of removal. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b676-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
