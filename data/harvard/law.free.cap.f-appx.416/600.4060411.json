We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-20\">Sabbath contends that the district court clearly erred in imposing a two-level increase for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. The district court did not clearly err in applying the enhancement because Sabbath\u2019s lie to the authorities regarding the identity of one of the co-conspirators significantly impeded the investigation and prosecution of the offense. <em>See United States v. McNally, </em>159 F.3d 1215, 1217 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-21\">Sabbath also contends the district court clearly erred by denying his request for a minor role adjustment pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). The district court did not clearly err in denying the adjustment because Sabbath failed to show he was entitled to such an adjustment where, among other things, he knowingly transported his co-conspirators to and from the robbery and planned to receive money in return, and he provided his cousin as an additional member of the robbery crew. <em>See United States v. Pinkney, </em>15 F.3d 825, 827-28 (9th Cir.1994); <em>see also United States v. Cantrell, </em>433 F.3d 1269, 1282-84 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b623-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
