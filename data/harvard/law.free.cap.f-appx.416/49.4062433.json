Marler stored three service trucks in warehouse space that his company, Fleet Service Specialist, Inc., leased from YSI Management and was owned by U-Store-It. Marler was injured at the leased space while repairing one of his service trucks, and he complained that U-Store-It had acted negligently by failing to maintain the asphalt at its facility. The district court ruled that an exculpatory clause in the lease insulated U-Store-It from liability. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-16\">Marler signed the lease and, in paragraph 19, \u201caeknowledge[d] that neither [U-Store-It] nor [YSI Management] [had] made any representations or warranties, either express or implied, as to the safety of the property, the Space [or] otherwise.\u201d In the same paragraph, Marler agreed that neither U-Store-It or YSI Management would be liable for \u201cpersonal injury or loss or damage to any Personal Property\u201d caused by any intentional or negligent act or omission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-17\">Neither [U-Store-It] nor [YSI Management] shall be liable to Occupant or any other party for personal injury or loss or damage to any Personal Property arising from any cause whatsoever ... regardless of whether such loss or damage is caused by the intentional or negligent acts or omissions of [U-Store-It-], [YSI Management], [U-Store-It]\u2019s or [YSI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Management\u2019s agents, Occupant or any other party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Paragraph 6 of the lease prohibited occupants from \u201cpark[ing] any vehicle at the Property ... except in areas designated by [U-Store-It] and then only during such periods necessary for the performance of and while Occupant is exercising its rights, duties and obligations hereunder,\u201d and paragraph 9 of the lease prohibited occupants from \u201cperform[ing] any mechanical or restoration work on any vehicle either in the Space or at the Property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">While Marler was repairing one of his service trucks at the warehouse, some asphalt under the truck crumbled, and the truck crushed Marler\u2019s right arm. Marler filed a complaint in a Florida court and alleged that U-Store-It had acted negligently by failing to maintain the asphalt in a safe condition or warn Marler that the asphalt was unsafe. After U-Store-It removed the action to district court, U-Store-It moved for summary judgment on the grounds that it was relieved of liability under the exculpatory clause in paragraph 14 of the lease; Marler had breached Paragraph 9 of the lease, which prohibited repairing vehicles at the warehouse; and U-Store-It did not breach a duty owed to Marler. Marler responded that U-Store-It had violated the Florida Building Code and that violation nullified the exculpatory clause and U-Store-It had waived its right to enforce paragraph 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The district court granted summary judgment in favor of U-Store-It. The district court ruled that the language of the exculpatory clause was \u201csufficient to indemnify [U-Store-It] against their own negligent acts\u201d and \u201cinsulated [it] from any injuries Marler sustained on\u201d the warehouse property. In response to Marler\u2019s argument that the clause was not \u201csufficiently clear and unequivocal to pass muster under Florida law,\u201d the district court ruled that the clause contained \u201cprecisely the type of language which Florida courts [had] upheld as sufficient\u201d to \u201cindemnify]\u201d a party \u201cagainst its own negligence.\u201d The district court also ruled that there was no \u201cgenuine issue of material fact as to whether [U-Store-It] violated the Florida Building Code\u201d because Marler and his expert acknowledged there were no written guidelines or standards governing the thickness of asphalt and, alternatively, Marler failed to provide any authority that a violation would invalidate the exculpatory clause. The district court declined to \u201cconsider whether Marler [was] owed any duty of care because he violated\u201d paragraph 9, \u201cwhether [U-Store-It] waived [its] right to enforce\u201d the provision, or whether U-Store-It breached a duty owed to Marler \u201c[b]eeause the exculpatory clause [was] valid\u201d and \u201cinsulate[d] [U-Store-It] from suit for any personal injuries occurring on the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">The contract states in \u201cclear and unequivocal terms\u201d that U-Store-It shall be indemnified against its own negligence. <em>Etiole Intern., N.V. v. Miami Elevator Co., Inc., </em>573 So.2d 921, 922 (Fla.Dist.Ct. App.1990). Marler argues that the phrase \u201ccaused by the intentional or negligent acts or omission\u201d modifies only the preceding clause \u201closs or damage\u201d and does not apply to \u201cpersonal injuries,\u201d but we disagree. \u201c[T]he doctrine of the last antecedent is not an absolute rule,\u201d <em>Penzer v. Transp. Ins. Co., </em>29 So.3d 1000, 1007 (Fla. 2010) (citing <em>United States v. Hayes, </em>555 U.S. 415,129 S.Ct. 1079, 1086, 172 L.Ed.2d 816 (2009), and <em>Fortune Ins. Co. v. Dep\u2019t of Ins., </em>664 So.2d 312, 316 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1995)), and \u201c\u2018is not applicable where a further extension or inclusion is clearly required by the intent and meaning of the context\u2019 \u201d of the contract, <em>Fortune Ins., </em>664 So.2d at 316 (quoting 73 Am.Jur.2d <em>Statutes </em>\u00a7 138). If a \u201cplain reading of the language,\u201d <em>Penzer, </em>29 So.3d at 1007, reveals that \u201c \u2018several words are followed by a clause which is applicable as much to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>first and other words as to the last, the natural construction of the language demands that the clause be read as applicable to all.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fortune Ins., </em>664 So.2d at 316 (quoting <em>Porto Rico Ry., Light &amp; Power Co. v. Mor, </em>253 U.S. 345, 348, 40 S.Ct. 516, 518, 64 L.Ed. 944 (1920)). The exculpatory clause states that U-Store-It is insulated from liability for \u201csuch loss or damage,\u201d which includes \u201cpersonal injuries,\u201d that have been caused by its \u201cnegligent acts or omissions.\u201d <em>See Winn Dixie Stores, Inc. v. D &amp; J Const. Co., </em>633 So.2d 65, 65-66 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1994) (interpreting indemnity agreement that covered \u201cany claim or loss ... notwithstanding such accident or damage may have been caused in whole or in part [by the] negligence of\u2019 Winn Dixie insulated it against liability for personal injury to an employee of D &amp; J Construction). The exculpatory clause absolves U-Store-It of liability for any negligence that might have caused Marler\u2019s personal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">We AFFIRM the summary judgment in favor of U-Store-It.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
