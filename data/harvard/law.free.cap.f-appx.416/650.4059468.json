We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">Swift correctly asserts that the district court procedurally erred by incorrectly calculating the applicable Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 993 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc); <em>see also United States v. Takahashi, </em>205 F.3d 1161, 1167 (9th Cir.2000); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.2, cmt., n. 1. (2009). The most appropriate offense guideline for the conviction at issue is U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G1.1; therefore it was error for the district court to rely on \u00a7 2G 1.3 in calculating Swift\u2019s base offense level. We vacate Swift\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-18\">Swift also contends that the district court erred by refusing to consider his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, and by denying his motion to continue the sentencing hearing to allow him to brief the issue. The district court did not abuse its discretion by ruling that Swift\u2019s unsupported claim of innocence was not a fair and just reason to withdraw his guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Turner, </em>898 F.2d 705, 713 (9th Cir.1990). Accordingly, the conviction is affirmed. In light of the foregoing disposition, the district court\u2019s denial of a continuance is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-19\">AFFIRMED in part; VACATED in part; and REMANDED for RESEN-TENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b673-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
