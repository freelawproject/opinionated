R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b640-8\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">Amar Pal Singh Bakshi and Surneet Kaur, natives and citizens of India, petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order dismissing their appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cLJ\u201d) decision denying Bakshi\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence findings of fact, including adverse credibility determinations. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on the inconsistencies between Bakshi\u2019s testimony and his asylum application regarding the identity of the alleged persecutors, and the inconsistencies between Bakshi and Kaur\u2019s testimony regarding what occurred when the alleged persecutors came to then-home. <em>See id. </em>at 1043; <em>Kin v. Holder, </em>595 F.3d 1050, 1057 (9th Cir.2010). In the absence of credible testimony, Bakshi\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-13\">Because Bakshi\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony found to be not credible, and he does not point to any other evidence that shows it is more likely than not he would be tortured if returned to India, his CAT claim fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-14\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary denial of petitioners\u2019 cancellation of removal application. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Bermudez v. Holder, </em>586 F.3d 1167, 1169 (9th Cir.2009) (per curiam). Petitioners\u2019 contention that the agency violated due process by failing to adequately consider their evidence of hardship does not amount to a colorable constitutional claim. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir. 2005) (\u201c[T]raditional abuse of discretion challenges recast as alleged due process violations do not constitute colorable constitutional claims that would invoke our jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b640-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
