By entering into their respective plea agreements, however, Alexander and Kamerling knowingly and voluntarily waived their rights to appeal. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>628 F.3d 1203, 1205 (9th Cir.2011). The plea agreements\u2019 waiver of \u201cany right conferred by Title 18, United States Code, Section 3742,\u201d which was conditioned only on the court\u2019s imposition of \u201ca sentence that is within the Sentencing Guidelines range that is determined by the Court at the time of sentencing,\u201d constitutes an unambiguous waiver of Alexander and Kamerling\u2019s right to appeal the sentencing court\u2019s Guidelines calculations. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-18\">The government did not breach the plea agreement by advocating for additional offense level adjustments. Alexander and Kamerling\u2019s plea agreements do not state that the parties are barred from advocating for such adjustments, <em>see United States v. Nunez, </em>223 F.3d 956, 958 (9th Cir.2000), and the absence of a provision expressly authorizing such advocacy does not implicitly create such a bar, <em>cf. Foad Consulting Group, Inc. v. Azzalino, </em>270 F.3d 821, 829-31 (9th Cir.2001). Moreover, Alexander and Kamerling\u2019s subsequent behavior, including Alexander\u2019s own advocacy for an additional offense level adjustment, confirms that they did not understand the agreements as prohibiting the government from advocating for additional offense level adjustments. <em>See Laborers Health &amp; Welfare Trust Fund v. Kaufman &amp; Broad, </em>707 F.2d 412, 418 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Finally, the district court\u2019s ambiguous statement regarding acceptance of responsibility at Kamerling\u2019s change-of-plea hearing was not a guarantee that Kamerling would receive an offense level reduction at sentencing. <em>See United States v. Buchanan, </em>59 F.3d 914, 917-18 (9th Cir.1995). Thus, this statement does not undermine the validity of Kamerling\u2019s appeal waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Because Alexander and Kamerling remain bound by their appeal waivers, we decline to exercise jurisdiction over this consolidated appeal. <em>See Harris, </em>628 F.3d at 1205.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b688-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
