BALDOCK, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b700-20\">Petitioner Ricardo Olivan-Duenas, a native of Mexico, challenges the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (BIA\u2019s) decision affirming the ruling of an immigration judge (IJ) that he is ineligible for adjustment of status and not entitled to a waiver of inadmissibility. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-21\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b700-22\">In 1991, when Olivan-Duenas was an infant, he and his mother entered this country illegally. In 2008, at the age of eighteen, he was arrested and charged in Utah County, Utah, with possessing less than one ounce of marijuana within 1,000 feet of a church, a drug-free zone. <em>See </em>Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 58-37-8(2)(a)(i) <em>&amp; </em>(4)(a)(ix). The charge was accompanied by a street-gang enhancement. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 76-3-203.1. Ultimately, the state dismissed the gang enhancement, and Olivan-Duenas pleaded guilty to possession in a drug-free zone. Because this was Olivan-Duenas\u2019s first possession conviction, it would ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>narily have been only a class B misdemeanor. <em>See </em>Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 58-37-8(2)(d). But since the possession occurred within a drug-free zone, the conviction was elevated to a class A misdemeanor. <em>See </em>Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 58-37-8(4)(c). The state court sentenced Olivan-Duenas to 365 days in jail, but suspended 320 of those days, and placed him on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Two months after his conviction, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security charged Olivan-Duenas with being a removable alien. He conceded removability, but sought adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident. An IJ held a hearing and concluded that Olivan-Duenas\u2019s status could not be adjusted because of his conviction. The IJ noted that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h) waives the conviction \u201cinsofar as it relates to a single offense of simple possession of 30 grams [1.05821 ounces] or less of marijuana\u201d if certain other conditions, such as extreme hardship, exist. But the IJ determined that waiver was precluded by <em>In re Martinez-Zapata, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 424, 431 (BIA 2007), where the BIA held that a Texas conviction for possessing marijuana in a drug-free zone was not \u201csimple possession\u201d that would qualify for a \u00a7 1182(h) waiver. Consequently, the IJ ordered Olivan-Duenas removed to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The BIA affirmed, holding that <em>In re Martinez-Zapata </em>governed.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">When, as in this case, \u201ca single member of the BIA [has] issue[d] a brief order affirming an IJ\u2019s decision, [we] review[] both the decision of the BIA and any parts of the IJ\u2019s decision relied on by the BIA in reaching its conclusion.\u201d <em>Dallakoti v. Holder, </em>619 F.3d 1264, 1267 (10th Cir. 2010) (quotation omitted). \u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s legal determinations de novo and its findings of fact for substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">As noted above, the BIA has determined that possessing marijuana in a drug-free zone does not relate to \u201csimple possession ... of marijuana,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h), and therefore, it is not a waivable offense. <em>In re Martinez-Zapata, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 431. The BIA reasoned that because the drug-free-zone enhancement had to be decided by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, it was the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of an element of the possession crime. <em>Id. </em>at 430. Thus, with that added element, the crime was no longer \u201csimple possession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">Under <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat\u2019l Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), we must defer to the BIA\u2019s determination if \u201c(1) the statute is ambiguous or silent as to the issue at hand and (2) the agency\u2019s interpretation is neither arbitrary, capricious, nor manifestly contrary to the statute.\u201d <em>Carpio v. Holder, </em>592 F.3d 1091, 1096 (10th Cir.2010) (quotation and alteration omitted). \u201cIndeed, judicial deference to the Executive Branch is especially appropriate in the immigration context where officials exercise especially sensitive political functions that implicate questions of foreign relations.\u201d <em>Niang v. Gonzales, </em>422 F.3d 1187, 1196-97 (10th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-12\">Olivan-Duenas appears to concede that the statutory language waiving a conviction that \u201crelates to a single offense of simple possession of ... marijuana\u201d is ambiguous or silent when it comes to a conviction for possessing marijuana in a drug-free zone. In any event, as the waiver statute does not define the term \u201csimple possession\u201d or otherwise indicate whether possession in a drug-free zone constitutes \u201csimple possession,\u201d we conclude that the meaning of the term was open to interpre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>tation by the BIA. Consequently, Olivan-Duenas must show that the interpretation is arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute. <em>See Carpio, </em>592 F.3d at 1096.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Olivan-Duenas contends that the statutory language is much broader than the BIA recognizes because the conviction must only \u201crelate\u201d to simple possession, it does not have <em>be </em>simple possession. He asserts that the Supreme Court\u2019s broad interpretation of the words \u201crelating to\u201d in <em>Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>504 U.S. 374, 383, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992), precludes the BIA from employing a more narrow definition. But <em>Morales </em>involved the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 and its preemptive effect on state consumer-protection laws. It is, therefore, inapposite in the immigration context.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">We conclude that the BIA\u2019s reading of the waiver statute, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h), to not include convictions for marijuana possession in a drug-free zone is a reasonable and permissible interpretation of the statute. Such a conviction could logically be viewed as not relating to \u201csimple possession\u201d on the basis that the location of the crime is a sufficiently distinguishing or aggravating criminal element. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1509 (9th ed. 2009) (defining \u201csimple\u201d in the criminal-law context as \u201cnot accompanied by aggravating circumstances\u201d). Indeed, the Utah courts view the drug-free-zone fact as an element that enhances the underlying offense and that must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt if not admitted by the defendant. <em>State v. Davis, </em>155 P.3d 909, 912 (Utah Ct.App. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">Olivan-Duenas suggests that the BIA recently rejected <em>In re Martinez-Zapata </em>by concluding that a conviction for possessing drug paraphernalia can relate to a single offense of simple marijuana possession for purposes of a \u00a7 1182(h) waiver. <em>See In re Espinoza, </em>25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 118 (BIA 2009). In fact, the opposite is true. While the BIA did observe that the \u00a7 1182(h) language would not eliminate a waiver for offenses that are \u201ca mere adjunct to\u201d simple possession, like certain instances of possessing drug paraphernalia, <em>id. </em>at 123, a waiver would be unavailable if the crime\u2019s \u201celements ... make it substantially more serious than \u2018simple possession,\u2019\u201d <em>id. </em>at 125. \u201cFor example, possessing marijuana in a prison or near a school [i.e., drug-free zones] may relate to marijuana possession, but such offenses do not relate to <em>simple </em>possession because they are inherently more serious than the basic crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125. Thus, <em>In re Espinoza </em>completely supports <em>In re Martinez-Zapata </em>\u2019s holding that possessing marijuana in a drug-free zone does not relate to simple possession of marijuana.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">Olivan-Duenas also contends that the BIA\u2019s narrow interpretation of the \u00a7 1182(h) waiver language is inconsistent with its interpretation of similar language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>in statutes like 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), which renders aggravated felons removable. He states that the BIA \u201cis willing to give an expansive definition to the phrase \u2018related to\u2019 ... when it means bringing more crimes under the ambit of the [removability statutes],\u201d but it then contracts the reach of the \u201crelated to\u201d language when it comes to determining which crimes qualify for a waiver. Aplt. Br. at 33. But far from exhibiting inconsistency, the BIA\u2019s approach uniformly treats criminality as a presumptive disqualifier under the immigration statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The BIA\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1182(h)\u2019s waiver for \u201ca single offense of simple possession of ... marijuana\u201d as not including drug-free-zone-enhanced possession crimes is not arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b700-15\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b702-6\">. Even when a Supreme Court decision conflicts with an agency\u2019s subsequent decision over the meaning of the <em>same </em>statute, we must still defer to the agency\u2019s decision, so long as it is reasonable and constitutional. <em>Hernandez-Cairera v. Carlson, </em>547 F.3d 1237, 1242 (10th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b702-7\">. Olivan-Duenas also claims that <em>In re Martinez-Zapata </em>is undermined by <em>Escobar Barraza v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 388 (7th Cir.2008). But there, the Seventh Circuit simply held that possessing drug paraphernalia can relate to marijuana possession. <em>Id. </em>at 392-93. The court did not purport to address when a criminal offense relates to <em>simple </em>possession, other than to surmise that distribution offenses would not Further, the BIA\u2019s reasonable interpretation of unclear or ambiguous immigration statutes trumps contrary judicial interpretations. <em>See Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 845, 104 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
