Counsel has moved to withdraw, and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), challenging the reasonableness of Swingen\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-26\">We conclude that the district court committed no procedural error in sentencing Swingen, and that the court imposed a substantively reasonable sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (in reviewing sentence, appellate court first ensures that district court committed no significant procedural error, and then considers substantive reasonableness of sentence under abuse-of-discretion standard); <em>United States v. Miles, </em>499 F.3d 906, 909-10 (8th Cir.2007) (explaining that district court\u2019s awareness of defendant\u2019s arguments precludes conclusion that court abused its discretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>failing to consider them); <em>United States v. Haack, </em>403 F.3d 997, 1004 (8th Cir. 2005) (describing ways in which court might abuse its discretion at sentencing).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Having reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-17\">. The Honorable Linda R. Reade, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
