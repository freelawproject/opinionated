For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-27\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-28\">On May 18, 2006, Douglas was sentenced in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania to a term of life imprisonment for drug and firearm possession and related crimes. A $500 felony assessment was also imposed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>to be paid in a lump sum payment \u201cdue immediately.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Criminal Judgment 4. On September 13, 2006, Douglas made a payment toward his court-ordered special felony assessment in the amount of $25.00. He made a second payment of $25.00 on December 12, 2006. Douglas made no further payments and was subsequently placed in \u201cIFRP Refuse\u201d status. On October 6, 2008, Douglas\u2019s life imprisonment sentence was vacated and he was re-resentenced to an aggregate term of 220 months of imprisonment and ordered to pay a $500 felony assessment. No restitution or other fines were imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">On June 23, 2009, Douglas filed a habeas corpus petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 challenging the authority of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) to set a payment schedule through its Inmate Financial Responsibility Program (\u201cIFRP\u201d) for the $500 special assessment imposed by the sentencing court. He argued that only the sentencing court has authority to issue orders regarding the collection of criminal fines, special felony assessments, and restitution, and that the BOP cannot force inmates to make payments, or impose sanctions against inmates who do not make payments via the IFRP. The District Court denied the petition as meritless.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Douglas timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>See Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-13\">On appeal, Douglas argues that the BOP failed to provide him with due process before placing him in IFRP, in violation of his constitutional rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He cites <em>United States v. Coates </em>for the proposition that the sentencing court cannot delegate to the BOP the authority to set the schedule of restitution payments. 178 F.3d 681, 685 (3d Cir.1999); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664. In <em>Coates, </em>we held that, under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (\u201cMVRA\u201d), the sentencing court cannot delegate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>scheduling of <em>restitution </em>payments to a probation officer or to the BOP because the fixing of restitution payments is an exclusively judicial act. More recently, we held that a sentencing court impermissibly delegates its authority when it orders immediate payment of restitution with knowledge that the defendant could not make immediate payment in full. <em>See United States v. Corley, </em>500 F.3d 210, 226-27 (3d Cir.2007), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1558, 173 L.Ed.2d 443 (2009). These holdings are based on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(2), which provides that, \u201cin consideration of\u2019 the defendant\u2019s financial resources, the sentencing court \u201cshall ... specify in the restitution order the manner in which, and the schedule according to which, the restitution is to be paid.\u201d <em>See Coates, </em>178 F.3d at 684; <em>Corley, </em>500 F.3d at 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">However, Douglas\u2019s claim does not arise from an order of restitution. Instead, he is challenging the BOP\u2019s authority to set payments of his $500 special felony assessment. This special felony assessment is mandatory under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3013(a)(2)(A), and is to be \u201ccollected in the manner that fines are collected in criminal cases.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3013(b). The Attorney General is responsible for the collection of criminal fines imposed under \u00a7 3013. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3612(c). Thus, the collection of a special assessment is governed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(d)(1), which provides that \u201c[a] person sentenced to pay a fine or other monetary penalty, including restitution, shall make such payment immediately, unless ... the court provides for payment on a date certain or in installments.\u201d However, we have not held that a sentencing court is required to set a schedule for the payment of a special assessment, nor have we held that \u00a7 3572(d) precludes a sentencing court from delegating the scheduling of such payments to the BOP through its IFRP program. In fact, federal regulation 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 545.10 explicitly permits the BOP to \u201cassist the inmate in developing a financial plan for meeting\u201d his or her \u201clegitimate financial obligations.\u201d In <em>Coates, </em>we held that the language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(2) directing the court to specify the manner and schedule of restitution payments \u201ccontradicts, and thus overrides, the regulations.\u201d 178 F.3d at 685. However, we have not extended that holding to special felony assessment payments which are governed instead by \u00a7 3572(d)(1). <em>See Coates, </em>178 F.3d at 684 (distinguishing between \u00a7 3572(d)(1) and the affirmative requirement for the sentencing court to set a payment schedule under the MVRA).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-6\">. The order of judgment further stated that: \u201cUnless the court order has expressly ordered otherwise, if this judgment imposes imprisonment, payment of criminal monetary penalties is due during imprisonment. All criminal monetary penalties, except those payments made through the Federal Bureau of Prisons\u2019 Inmate Financial Responsibility Program, are made to the clerk of the court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b191-7\">. In its order denying Douglas\u2019s habeas petition, the District Court also addressed two additional claims Douglas had raised for the first time in his objections to the Report and Recommendation: a challenge to the dismissal of his civil rights suit (M.D.Pa.No.08-cv0140) (M.D.Pa.), and a claim that the five-year statute of limitation period during which the special assessment may be collected has expired. Douglas does not reference either of these claims in his arguments on appeal. Nonetheless, we have reviewed the record and agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Douglas cannot challenge the dismissal of a prior law suit in a \u00a7 2241 petition. We also agree with the District Court that, because Douglas was re-sentenced on October 6, 2008, the five-year statute of limitations on collection of a special assessment has not expired, and Douglas is obligated to make payments until October 2013.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b191-15\">. Douglas's claim falls within the purview of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, which permits a petitioner to attack the execution of his sentence. <em>See Woodall v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>432 F.3d 235, 241-44 (3d Cir.2005) (surveying Circuit law on what constitutes a challenge to the execution of a sentence under \u00a7 2241); <em>see also Matheny v. Morrison, </em>307 F.3d 709, 712 (8th Cir.2002) (holding that a claim challenging a payment schedule imposed via the IFRP concerned the execution of petitioner's sentence and was correctly brought under \u00a7 2241).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
