We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">We review BIA decisions on motions to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006). Jiang\u2019s second renewed motion to reopen was untimely because she filed it more than six years after her final removal order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Nevertheless, the 90-day timeliness requirement does not apply to motions based on changed country conditions, so long as the new evidence is material, was previously unavailable, and could not have been discovered and presented at the prior hearing. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Changed country conditions are distinct from changed personal circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 273-74 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by rejecting Jiang\u2019s argument of changed country conditions. First, the BIA reasonably discredited Jiang\u2019s village committee notice because it was unauthenticated and the immigration judge had previously found Jiang not credible. <em>See Zheng v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 143, 146-48 (2d Cir. 2007). For the same reasons, the BIA reasonably declined to credit Jiang\u2019s or her mother\u2019s affidavit. <em>Id. </em>Second, while Jiang\u2019s Falun Gong practice may have changed her <em>personal </em>circumstances, it did not change the conditions in China. As a result, it was not an abuse of discretion to find no changed country conditions and to deny Jiang\u2019s motion as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-13\">We have considered and reject Jiang\u2019s other arguments. Jiang\u2019s petition for review is DENIED and her pending motion for a stay of removal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
