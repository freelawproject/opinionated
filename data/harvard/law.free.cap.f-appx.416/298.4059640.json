Hodge\u2019s written plea agreement included a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) stipulated sentence of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court imposed the stipulated sentence. Hodge then filed this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-23\">Hodge\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), questioning the adequacy of Hodge\u2019s Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 hearing. A letter filed by Hodge was docketed as an untimely pro se supplemental brief in which he asserts that counsel was ineffective for misleading him into signing the plea agreement for a sentence over his guideline range. Because we find no meritorious grounds for appeal, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-24\">Hodge questions whether the district court adequately advised him during his Rule 11 hearing. Prior to accepting a guilty plea, a district court must conduct a plea colloquy in which it informs the defendant of, and determines that the defendant comprehends, the nature of the charge to which he is pleading guilty, any mandatory minimum penalty, the maximum possible penalty he faces, and the rights he is relin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>quishing by pleading guilty. Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(b); <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 116 (4th Cir.1991). \u201cIn reviewing the adequacy of compliance with Rule 11, this Court should accord deference to the trial court\u2019s decision as to how best to conduct the mandated colloquy with the defendant.\u201d <em>DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d at 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">We have thoroughly reviewed the record in this case and conclude that the district court complied with the mandates of Rule 11 in accepting Hodge\u2019s guilty plea. Thus, we hold that the record affirmatively shows there was a factual basis for Hodge\u2019s plea, Hodge understood the constitutional rights he waived in pleading guilty, and Hodge\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary. Additionally, we have reviewed Hodge\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and find that the record does not conclusively establish ineffective assistance. Accordingly, the ineffective assistance claims are not cognizable on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Next, we conclude we lack jurisdiction to review Hodge\u2019s sentence. The federal statute governing appellate review of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(c) (2006), limits the circumstances under which a defendant may appeal a sentence to which he stipulated in a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement to claims that \u201chis sentence was imposed in violation of law [or] was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines[.]\u201d <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>146 F.3d 796, 797 &amp; n. 1 (10th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Little-field, </em>105 F.3d 527, 527-28 (9th Cir.1997). Here, Hodge\u2019s sentence did not exceed the applicable statutory maximum and was the precise sentence he had bargained for with the Government. Thus, review of his sentence is precluded by \u00a7 3742(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Hodge\u2019s conviction and dismiss his appeal to the extent he challenges his sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Hodge in writing of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Hodge requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Hodge. Finally, we deny Hodge\u2019s motion to appoint new counsel and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
