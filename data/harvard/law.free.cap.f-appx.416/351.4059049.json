Berrones appeals her within-guidelines sentence. She argues that the district court erred in (1) increasing her base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) because there was insufficient reliable evidence showing that she transferred the firearm with reason to believe that the firearm would be used or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>possessed in connection with another felony offense; (2) failing to group her two counts pursuant to \u00a7 3D1.2(d); and (3) failing to adequately and properly consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The district court did not clearly err in enhancing Berrones\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir. 2008). The presentence report (PSR) states that Berrones\u2019s boyfriend told her that the firearm was going to be used in connection with another felony offense. Berrones fails to present any evidence other than self-serving statements to rebut the information in the PSR. <em>See United States v. Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d 135, 138 (5th Cir.1989). Thus, this argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Berrones\u2019s remaining arguments are also without merit. Because Berrones did not raise these arguments in the district court, this court reviews the issues for plain error only. <em>United States v. Ronquillo, </em>508 F.3d 744, 748 (5th Cir.2007). Berrones has not shown error, plain or otherwise, because the PSR specifically states that both counts were grouped pursuant to \u00a7 3D1.2(d) and because the sentencing transcript reflects that the district court considered the nature and circumstances of the offense and Berrones\u2019s history and characteristics. <em>See id. </em>Thus, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
