As a result of alleged defaults by appellants, appellee successfully obtained a TRO followed by a preliminary injunction. In granting both the district court did not require a bond. The court stated: \u201cThere is no need for the imposition of a preliminary injunction bond in this case. AFC\u2019s annual revenues exceed $100 million, and it is able to pay any judgment ... In the event that this finding is reversed, the Court finds a bond of $25,000 would be reasonable.\u201d (D.E. 22 at 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-21\">Appellant does not contest these findings by the district court but argues that pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(c) a bond is mandatory. Such is simply not the case. Under our existing precedent, it is within the discretion of the court to set the amount of the bond or to require \u201cno security at all.\u201d <em>BellSouth Telecomms., Inc. v. MCImetro Access Transmission Services, LLC, </em>425 F.3d 964, 971 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
