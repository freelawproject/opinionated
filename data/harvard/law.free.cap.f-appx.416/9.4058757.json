The Van Bilderbeeks requested from the Department copies of \u201call documents related to\u201d an investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration of the Van Bilderbeeks and them company, Llanos Oil Exploration Limited. The Van Bilderbeeks filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment that the Department had violated the Act and an injunction to release the documents. After the Department released two documents and withheld other documents as exempt \u201cinvestigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7), the Department moved for summary judgment and submitted the declaration of an agent that described the documents withheld and the factual bases for the exemption. The Van Bilderbeeks argued that the declaration was insufficient to substantiate the exemption and that the Department had to file a <em>Vaughn </em>index or submit the documents for an <em>in camera </em>review by the district court. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Department. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The Department filed the declaration of Michael Seidel, a senior attorney of the Department who provides \u201cgeneral legal support for the [Drug Enforcement Administration] Headquarters staff ... involving the Freedom of Information Act\u201d and \u201cnecessary litigation support to Assistant United States Attorneys\u201d who prosecute eases under the Act. Seidel stated that he was familiar with the Van Bilderbeek\u2019s complaint and the \u201cprocessing file maintained by the [Freedom of Information Operations Unit of the Administration],\u201d and that his declaration contained information \u201cof [his] own personal knowledge\u201d about his review of Administration \u201crecords, coordination and oversight of [the] search [by the Administration] and processing efforts, and information [he had] acquired ... in the performance of [his] official duties to include coordination with the [Freedom of Information Operations Unit], foreign and domestic [Administration] officers, and other federal agencies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">Seidel stated that his declaration was prepared \u201c[i]n accordance with <em>Vaughn v. Rosen, </em>484 F.2d 82[0] (D.C.Cir.1973),\u201d and he explained how the Administration had processed the Van Bilderbeek\u2019s request for documents, discovered seven investigative files in the Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Information System of the Administration, and classified those files. Seidel stated that the Administration had compiled the files during \u201cdomestic and foreign criminal law enforcement investigations ... associated with drug trafficking and money laundering of illegal drug trafficking proceeds.\u201d Seidel stated that he learned from the lead agent of the investigation that the files \u201crelate[d] to [an] ongoing investigation and/or prospective enforcement proceedings\u201d of the Van Bilderbeeks, their company, and \u201cother third parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">Seidel described the documents in the files and explained that they contained sensitive material. Seidel identified eight types of documents in the files: DEA-6 Reports of Investigation; DEA Form 202; DEA Form 7a; DEA cable or teletype communications; DEA letters or memoranda; electronic communications; source documents/information; and miscellaneous administrative documents. Seidel described in detail the documents and discussed that they contained information about intelligence activities, evidence col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>lected, communications between suspects and/or third parties, criminal activities, property acquired with drug proceeds, persons involved in transactions, confidential information about those persons, informants, and federal agents and other law enforcement personnel involved in the investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Seidel stated that he used a three-step process to determine whether the individual documents in the seven files were exempt under the Act. Under the process, Seidel reviewed each document, identified the document by type, and placed each document in one of three functional categories \u2014 investigative, administrative, and publicly known. Seidel placed two documents in the publicly known category and explained that they could be released to the Van Bilderbeeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Seidel classified the documents within the investigative and administrative categories into seven subcategories. He divided the investigative category into four subcategories: documentary and physical evidence, documentation of investigative activity, information exchanges between domestic and foreign agencies, and confidential source information. He divided the administrative category into three subcategories: information contained in reports of investigative activity, information related to investigative activity, and miscellaneous administrative documents. Seidel mentioned specific documents in the investigative files and types of documents that were included in each subcategory.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Seidel stated that disclosure of the documents would \u201cinterfere with enforcement proceedings,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(A). Seidel explained that releasing the documents would enable the Van Bilderbeeks and third parties to identify \u201cspecific evidence related to [the] investigation, reveal sources, ... expose the scope of investigative activity\u201d; could \u201clead to the intimidation of potential witnesses and confidential sources, or physical harm, given the violence inherent in the international drug trafficking trade\u201d; and would \u201creveal[ ] the scope, direction, nature, and pace of the investigation\u201d and \u201cthwart prospective enforcement proceedings.\u201d Seidel also explained that the documents could not be segregated \u201cwithout jeopardizing the ongoing investigation or hindering future enforcement proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">The district court ruled that the withheld material was exempt under section 552(b)(7)(A) of the Act and granted summary judgment in favor of the Department. The district court ruled that the documents were compiled for law enforcement purposes based on the ongoing investigation of the Van Bilderbeeks, their company, and third parties for their involvement in drug trafficking and money laundering. The district court found that there was a \u201cplausible basis\u201d for the investigation in the light of the Van Bilderbeeks\u2019s \u201cown statement that Colombian government officials [had] implicated them\u201d in an \u201c \u2018international drug and money laundering organization.\u2019 \u201d The district court ruled that the Seidel declaration provided \u201cadequate information\u201d about the documents that had been withheld and \u201chow the release of each category of documents would interfere with enforcement proceedings.\u201d The district court also ruled that \u201cthe Department has explained with reasonable specificity why the records at issue cannot be further segregated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b33-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>a motion for summary judgment and view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Fla. v. United States, </em>516 F.3d 1235, 1243 (11th Cir.2008). Summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>should be entered when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). A factual dispute will not defeat summary judgment unless \u201cit would affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law\u201d and would require judgment in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Miccosukee Tribe, </em>516 F.3d at 1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The Freedom of Information Act requires a federal agency to disclose records requested by an individual. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a). That requirement is not unlimited, and an agency may withhold documents that fall within one of nine statutory exemptions. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 552(b); <em>Moye, O\u2019Brien, O\u2019Rourke, Hogan, &amp; Pickert v. Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp., </em>376 F.3d 1270, 1276-77 (11th Cir.2004). The burden rests with the government to prove that a requested document is exempt from disclosure, <em>Moye, </em>376 F.3d at 1277, and the government can satisfy its burden by affidavit testimony that \u201cprovide[s] as accurate a basis for decision as would sanitized indexing, random or representative sampling, <em>in camera </em>review, or oral testimony.\u201d <em>Miscavige v. I.R.S., </em>2 F.3d 366, 368 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">We apply a two-part test to determine if documents are exempt from disclosure under the Act. First, we must ensure that \u201cthe district court had an adequate factual basis\u201d to determine that the documents were exempt. <em>Miccosukee Tribe, </em>516 F.3d at 1244; <em>Miscavige, 2 </em>F.3d at 367. Second, we must decide if \u201cthe decision reached by the district court was clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Miccosukee Tribe, </em>516 F.3d at 1244; <em>see Miscavige, 2 </em>F.3d at 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">The Van Bilderbeeks argue that Seidel\u2019s declaration is insufficient to support an exemption from disclosure for three reasons. First, the Van Bilderbeeks argue that Seidel\u2019s statements that the Administration was investigating the Van Bilderbeeks and that disclosure of the records would interfere with the investigation were unreliable because those statements were based on information Seidel received from federal agents. Second, the Van Bilderbeeks argue that the Administration lacked a plausible basis to conduct the ongoing investigation because the agency either had been tricked or had conspired with officials in the Colombian government \u201cto manufacture a criminal \u2018investigation\u2019 ... to deprive [the Van Bilderbeeks] of valuable oil rights.\u201d Third, the Van Bilderbeeks argue that the declaration \u201cgives absolutely no information about any document or records that might be responsive to\u201d their request for documents and that Seidel failed to \u201cprovide a \u2018detailed justification\u2019 of the nonsegregability of any material not released.\u201d These arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">The district court did not err by relying on statements in Seidel\u2019s declaration about the investigation and the need to withhold the documents. A \u201cdeclaration used to support ... a motion [for summary judgment] must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the ... declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(4). Although Seidel stated that he learned from \u201cthe lead DEA agent\u201d that the seven \u201cinvestigative files did indeed relate to an ongoing investigation and/or prospective enforcement action,\u201d Seidel said that he reviewed the files and observed that the \u201cdocuments contain[ed] information which exempted] them \u2014 in whole or in part\u2014 from disclosure under\u201d the Act. Seidel provided first-hand information about the documents and the sensitive nature of their contents. The nature of those documents reveals that they were accumulated during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>an investigation of suspected criminal activity by the Van Bilderbeeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The district court also did not clearly err in finding that the Administration had a plausible basis to investigate the Van Bilderbeeks. The Van Bilderbeeks admitted that they had been implicated in trafficking in drugs and laundering money by officials in the Colombian government. In addition, Hendrik Van Bilderbeek has been convicted in a Colombian court of laundering money and sentenced to serve 20 years in prison. Although the Van Bilderbeeks submitted three affidavits to challenge the basis of the investigation, those affidavits do not establish that the investigation was unfounded. In two of the affidavits, Hendrik Van Bilderbeek and Albert Jacques Van Bilderbeek provided self-serving statements that there were \u201cno ongoing investigations\u201d about them or their company \u201crelated to the continuance of the investigation under which [they] filed\u201d a request for information under the Act. In the third affidavit, Rafael Enrique Garcia Torres, a former official in the Colombian government, states twice that a government official ordered a government agency to investigate the Van Bilderbeeks \u201cbased on an investigation [already] being carried out by the DEA in the United States,\u201d which suggests that the investigation of the Administration is unrelated to any action by the Colombian government. Notably, Torres was arrested for \u201callegedly manipulat[ing] the data of\u2019 the Administrative Safety Department in Colombia \u201cto favor[, in part,] ... alleged drug traffickers .... \u201d The district court was not required to examine further the decision of the Administration to investigate the Van Bilderbeeks. <em>See Arenberg v. Drug Enforcement Admin., </em>849 F.2d 579, 581 (11th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Seidel\u2019s declaration provided a sufficient factual basis for the district court to determine that the documents were exempt from disclosure. Seidel identified in detail the contents of the records and documents, which provided insight into the types of information in particular documents and the close proximity of information that made the documents non-segregable. As explained by Seidel, the documents contained information about the evidence collected, investigators, and informants, the disclosure of which would not only hamper the investigations but also endanger the individuals identified in the documents. The Van Bilderbeeks seek more detailed information about the documents to justify their exemption, but \u201can adequate factual basis can be established in this Circuit by affidavits alone,\u201d <em>Miccosukee Tribe, </em>516 F.3d at 1260, particularly when the supporting document contains the level of specificity provided by Seidel, <em>see Miscavige, </em>2 F.3d at 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">The district court did not clearly err when it found that disclosure of the documents would \u201cinterfere with enforcement proceedings,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(A). The Department did not seek to withhold all the documents found in the Van Bilderbeek\u2019s investigatory files. <em>See N.L.R.B. v. Robbins Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>437 U.S. 214, 236, 98 S.Ct. 2311, 2324, 57 L.Ed.2d 159 (1978) (acknowledging that Congress amended \u201cExemption 7 ... to eliminate \u2018blanket exemptions\u2019 \u201d); <em>Miscavige, </em>2 F.3d at 367 (\u201cIt is well established in this Circuit that in most situations blanket objections ... will not suffice for disposition of FOIA claims.\u201d). In fact, the Department reviewed each document and determined that two documents did not qualify for the exemption \u201cbecause the information [was] publicly known or [was] not reasonably expected to interfere with law enforcement proceedings.\u201d The Department sought to exempt the other documents because they contained sensitive material that would thwart an active investigation. <em>See Rob</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number><em>bins Tire, </em>437 U.S. at 236, 98 S.Ct. at 2323-24 (approving \u201cgeneric determinations of likely interference\u201d when \u201cdisclosure of particular kinds of investigatory records while a case is pending would generally \u2018interfere with enforcement proceedings\u2019 \u201d); <em>see also Moorefield v. U.S. Secret Serv., </em>611 F.2d 1021 (5th Cir.1980) (approving the exemption of records of the Secret Service compiled against an individual \u201cof interest\u201d to the Sendee because he had been twice convicted of threatening the life of the President of the United States). The reasons Seidel gave for nondisclosure are more than sufficient to support the withholding of the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">We AFFIRM the summary judgment in favor of the Department.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
