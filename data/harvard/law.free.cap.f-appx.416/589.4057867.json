On February 22, 2010, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced Roberts to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment on each count, to run concurrently. Roberts appeals his sentence, challenging only the application of a two-level sophisticated-means enhancement to his advisory sentencing guidelines range. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-24\">Sophisticated means under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C) are \u201cespecially complex or especially intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of an offense.\u201d \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 8(B). The sophisticated-means enhancement is proper when the offense conduct, viewed as a whole, \u201cwas notably more intricate than that of the garden-variety [offense].\u201d <em>United States v. Hance, </em>501 F.3d 900, 909 (8th Cir.2007). \u201cRepetitive and coordinated conduct, though no one step is particularly complicated, can be a sophisticated scheme.\u201d <em>United States v. Finck, </em>407 F.3d 908, 915 (8th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-25\">Absent a challenge to any of the factual findings underlying the sophisticated-means enhancement, \u201cwe ... review <em>de novo </em>\u2018whether the district court correctly applied the guidelines when it determined those facts constituted sophisticated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>means.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 918 (quoting <em>United States v. Hart, </em>324 F.3d 575, 579 (8th Cir.2003)). Roberts does not dispute the district court\u2019s findings of fact concerning the offense conduct that formed the basis for the sophisticated-means enhancement. He argues instead that the district court erred in its legal conclusion that those facts constituted sophisticated means under \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(9)(C). We disagree. Roberts and his wife contacted the victim approximately one hundred times between March 2006 and June 2008. They concocted elaborate scenarios to induce the victim to surrender more and more money. For instance, Roberts once falsely told the victim that he required money because his wife had been jailed for drunk driving. On another occasion, Roberts fabricated a story that his son had died and requested money to cover expenses. Further, Roberts lied about nonexistent filing fees, court costs, bond amounts, travel costs, and hourly billing statements. He bolstered the continuing requests for money with copious fictional court documents, including a notice of appeal, a motion for reconsideration of sentence, a transportation order, and an order and ruling. See <em>United States v. Edelmann, </em>458 F.3d 791, 816 (8th Cir.2006) (holding that the defendant used sophisticated means where he \u201ccreated and used numerous false documents\u201d). Moreover, a number of the fabricated documents falsely bore the caption of the court from which they purportedly originated. <em>See United States v. Septon, </em>557 F.3d 934, 937 (8th Cir.2009) (affirming application of the sophisticated-means enhancement where a scheme involved \u201csubmitting numerous loan applications to lenders containing forged signatures, forged notary stamps, and falsified or altered [documents]\u201d). We therefore find no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that this \u201cRepetitive and coordinated conduct\u201d \u2014 which succeeded in defrauding the victim of more than $103,000 over the course of the scheme \u2014 can serve as a basis for the sophisticated-means enhancement. <em>See Finch, </em>407 F.3d at 915.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Roberts\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b611-19\">.
