R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2006); <em>Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 369 (4th Cir.2004). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2006). When the district court denies relief on the merits, a prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims is debatable or wrong. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>see Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). When the district court denies relief on procedural grounds, the prisoner must demonstrate both that the dispositive procedural ruling is debatable, and that the motion states a debatable claim of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484-85, 120 S.Ct. 1595. We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Robinson has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny the motion for a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-22\">Additionally, we construe Robinson\u2019s notice of appeal and informal brief as an application to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d at 208. In order to obtain authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, a prisoner must assert claims based on either: (1) \u201cnewly discovered evidence that ... would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty;\u201d or (2) \u201ca new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\u201d 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255(h) (West Supp. 2010). Robinson\u2019s claims do not satisfy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>either of these criteria. Therefore, we deny authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b339-19\"> Because the Rule 60(b) motion directly attacked Robinson\u2019s convictions, the motion was an unauthorized and successive \u00a7 2255 motion over which the district court lacked jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 206 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
