The parties stipulated in the agreement to a ninety-six month prison sentence, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C), and the district court sentenced Barrow in accordance with the agreement. On appeal, Barrow\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but questioning whether the district court committed plain error by failing to calculate Barrow\u2019s Guidelines range under the <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(2009). The Government seeks enforcement of Barrow\u2019s waiver of appellate rights in the plea agreement. We dismiss in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-15\">A defendant may waive the right to appeal if that waiver is knowing and intelligent. <em>United States v. Poindexter, </em>492 F.3d 263, 270 (4th Cir.2007). Generally, if the district court fully questions a defendant regarding the waiver of his right to appeal during the plea colloquy performed in accordance with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, the waiver is both valid and enforceable. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>410 F.3d 137, 151 (4th Cir.2005). The question of whether a defendant validly waived his right to appeal is a question of law that this court reviews de novo. <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162,168 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-16\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that Barrow knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his sentence. We therefore grant the Government\u2019s request and dismiss the appeal of Barrow\u2019s sentence. Although Barrow\u2019s appeal waiver insulates his sentence from appellate review, the waiver does not preclude our consideration of the validity of Barrow\u2019s conviction in accordance with <em>Anders.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-17\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the remainder of the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for review. We therefore affirm Barrow\u2019s conviction and dismiss the appeal of his sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Barrow, in writing, of the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Barrow requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Barrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
