We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">Wyatt filed a motion to dismiss the indictment in the district court, arguing that: (i) SORNA\u2019s criminal provision exceeded Congress\u2019s power under the Commerce Clause; and (ii) the Attorney General violated the APA, specifically 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (2006) when he retroactively applied SORNA to offenders who committed their crimes prior to the enactment of SORNA. In denying Wyatt\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment, the district court recognized that Wyatt\u2019s legal and constitutional challenges to SORNA were foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Gould, </em>568 F.3d 459 (4th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1686, 176 L.Ed.2d 186 (2010). Wyatt\u2019s counsel conceded that <em>Gould </em>resolved the legal challenges contained within the motion to dismiss and stated that he was preserving the issues for appeal. The court denied Wyatt\u2019s motion. Wyatt pleaded guilty pursuant to a written plea agreement, reserving his right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-17\">As Wyatt conceded in the district court, this court already addressed in <em>Gould </em>whether the Attorney General\u2019s issuance of the regulations making \u00a7 2250 retroactive violates the APA. <em>See Gould, </em>568 F.3d at 470 (recognizing that \u201cthe Attorney General had good cause to invoke the exception to providing the 30-day notice\u201d required under the APA). Accordingly, Wyatt\u2019s argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s holding in <em>Gould. See Scotts Co. v. United Indus. Corp., </em>315 F.3d 264, 271 n. 2 (4th Cir.2002) (\u201c[A] panel of this court cannot overrule, explicitly or implicitly, the precedent set by a prior panel of this court. Only the Supreme Court or this court sitting en banc can do that.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-18\">Wyatt also argues that Congress\u2019s authority under the Commerce Clause impinged on his fundamental right to travel. This court expressly discussed the interaction of travel and Congress\u2019s power under the Commerce Clause in <em>Gould, </em>explaining that \u201cCongress ... has the authority to regulate persons in interstate commerce, especially persons who move from the State of conviction to another State and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>there fail to register, as they use instrumentalities of interstate commerce.\" Gould, 568 F.3d at 471 (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, SORNA does not criminalize a sexual offender simply for engaging in interstate travel. Rather, as we explained, \"Congress, motivated by a desire to prevent sex offenders from traveling among the States to avoid state registration, used its commerce power to enact a national program mandating stronger and the more comprehensive registration system, as contained in SORNA.\" Id. at 474. Thus, although a SORNA violation under \u00a7 2250(a)(2)(B) requires interstate travel, it also requires \"the act of failing to register.\" Id. at 470. Accordingly, we conclude that Gould controls this issue and it is therefore without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">We therefore affirm the conviction, We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"AAQ\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b277-12\"> SORNA was enacted on July 27, 2006, and created a federal requirement that sex offenders register in each jurisdiction where the individual resides, is employed, or is a student. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 16913(a) (West Supp.2010). SORNA also criminalized an individual's failure to register. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2250(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
