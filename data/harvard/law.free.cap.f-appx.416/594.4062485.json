Upon de novo review, <em>see Hastings v. Wilson, </em>516 F.3d 1055, 1058 (8th Cir.2008), we conclude that the district court properly dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 1415(c) (governing procedure for hearing officer\u2019s pre-hearing determination of sufficiency of due process complaint notice), (f) (governing impartial due process hearings), (i)(2)(A) (\u201cany party aggrieved by the findings and decisions made under subsection (f) or (k) ... and ... findings and decision made under this subsection\u201d shall have right to bring civil action in federal district court); S. Rep. 108-185 (2003) (\u201c[t]here should be no hearing or appeal in regard to the hearing officer\u2019s determination\u201d of sufficiency of notice); <em>see also </em>Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 162.962 (permitting party to seek judicial review of hearing panel\u2019s \u201cdecision\u201d), 162.961.3 (indicating \u201cdecision\u201d is one reached when, \u201c[a]fter review of all evidence presented and a proper deliberation,\u201d hearing panel \u201cby majority vote determine^] its findings, conclusions, and decision in the matter in question\u201d); <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 200-01, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976) (in cases of statutory interpretation, language of statute controls when it is sufficiently clear in context). We conclude, however, that the dismissal should have been without prejudice. <em>See Cty. of Mille Lacs v. Benjamin, </em>361 F.3d 460, 464-65 (8th Cir.2004) (district court generally barred from dismissing case with prejudice if it concludes subject-matter jurisdiction is lacking).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Accordingly, we modify the dismissal to be without prejudice, and affirm the dismissal as modified. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-7\">. The Honorable E. Richard Webber, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
