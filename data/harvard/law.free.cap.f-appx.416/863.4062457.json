We affirm Chavers\u2019s convictions, but vacate his sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-17\">I. CONVICTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b887-18\">Based on this record, we find that the district court was well within its discretion in overruling Chavers\u2019s various objections to the testimony of co-conspirator Lewis, police officer Donald Ammon, witness Joanne Oliphant, and detective Cecil Wagner, as well as in excluding testimony regarding the identity of the car-jacker, the amount of money Lewis made from selling cocaine, and what Lewis told his mother about his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-19\">We likewise find no reversible error in the admission, as a prior consistent statement, of the testimony of Marty Darrisaw, who testified that Lewis had told him of the robbery days after the event. \u201cThe district court has broad discretion in determining the admissibility of a prior consistent statement under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(B) and will not be reversed absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Belfast, </em>611 F.3d 783, 816 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation marks omitted). Lewis made the statement at issue before he started cooperating with the government and before he had any motive to fabricate his statement. The district court thus did not abuse its discretion in permitting Darrisaw\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-20\">With reference to the district court\u2019s removal of a juror, there was more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>ample support for this decision based on the evidentiary hearing held by the district court, which disclosed the racial bias of the removed juror. Finally, having found no error, there can be no cumulative error. <em>United States v. Waldon, </em>363 F.3d 1103, 1109-10 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">We also find sufficient evidence to support each conviction. As to the convictions for credit union robbery and conspiracy to commit credit union robbery, the jury was free to credit Lewis\u2019s testimony describing the robbery attempt in detail and implicating Chavers in the conspiracy. This testimony was corroborated by independent evidence, including testimony that (1) linked the two cars to the robbery; (2) identified Michael\u2019s footprint at the credit union; (3) described how the three men fled the scene of the Mitsubishi car accident, and explained that one of the ski masks discarded by these individuals contained Chavers\u2019s DNA; and (4) described the discovery of guns and items belonging to the credit union in the Mitsubishi, including a bank envelope containing Chavers\u2019s palm prints. As to the conviction for use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, the jury was similarly free to believe Lewis\u2019s testimony that Chavers hit a bank teller with his gun while trying to get him to open the vault, which was corroborated by the bank teller\u2019s own testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">II. SENTENCING</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">As to sentencing, Chavers argues that the district court violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights when it applied various sentencing enhancements under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1, on the grounds that these enhancements were not pled in the indictment or submitted to a jury. The enhancements applied by the district court did not raise Chavers\u2019s sentence above the statutory maximum, and thus the district court was not required to submit them to the jury. <em>See United States v. Underwood, </em>446 F.3d 1340, 1344-45 (11th Cir. 2006) (holding that under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the district court must submit to a jury only facts that increase the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum). In addition, unindicted conduct can serve as a basis for sentencing enhancements. <em>United States v. Nyhuis, </em>8 F.3d 731, 744 (11th Cir.1993). Accordingly, the district court did not err in overruling Chavers\u2019s constitutional challenges to these sentencing enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">Likewise, we find that the district court did not err in applying a two-level sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(5) for an offense involving a car-jacking. Given the significant efforts by the robbers to avoid detection, we cannot say the district court clearly erred in finding that it was reasonably foreseeable that a co-conspirator might resort to carjacking should the original escape plan go awry. <em>See United States v. Cover, </em>199 F.3d 1270, 1274 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">Finally, Chavers argues that the district court erred in applying a six-level sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B) based on the fact that his co-defendants carried firearms during the credit union robbery. Chavers argues that his conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) precludes application of this enhancement. When Chavers was sentenced, this Court\u2019s precedent permitted the district court\u2019s application of the six-level enhancement. <em>See Cover, </em>199 F.3d at 1276-78. However, the U.S. Sentencing Commission subsequently amended the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4 \u2014 the firearm sentencing guideline under which Chavers was sentenced for his 18 U.S.C \u00a7 924(c) conviction \u2014 to clarify that an en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>hancement under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B) cannot be applied to a defendant based on the fact that his co-defendants carried firearms during the offense of conviction, if the defendant was also convicted under \u00a7 924(c) for use of a firearm during and in relation to the same underlying offense. <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>248 F.3d 1065, 1107 (11th Cir.2001). In the wake of this amendment, which applies retroactively, Chavers\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 924(c) for use of a firearm during or in relation to the credit union robbery precludes the district court\u2019s application of a six-level sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B). <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, we vacate Chavers\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing without application of the six-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Chavers\u2019s convictions are AFFIRMED. His sentences are AFFIRMED IN PART, and VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b887-15\">. Millard Chavers\u2019s convictions arose from an attempt to rob the Credit Union Center in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, a federally insured credit union. Chavers was tried with his co-defendant, Michael Chavers (\"Michael\u201d), while a third-co-defendant, Timothy Lewis, pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement and testified against both Chavers and Michael at trial. Lewis testified that on March 30, 1998, he was with Michael at a pool hall when Chavers asked them if they wanted to \"get into something.\u201d Lewis stated that they were \"all robbing banks at that time.\u201d Chavers suggested that they rob a bank, and they decided to rob the credit union.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
