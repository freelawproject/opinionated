Curtner, </em>619 F.3d 979, 982 (8th Cir. 2010), we conclude that summary judgment was properly granted on Fowler\u2019s equal protection claim because Fowler did not establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination, and also did not establish a genuine dispute as to whether defendant\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the challenged decisions were pretextual, <em>see id. </em>at 983 &amp; n. 3 (summarizing burden-shifting framework set forth in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), which applies to race discrimination claims in absence of direct evidence of discrimination; noting that such claims under Title VII and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983 are all analyzed under same framework); <em>Lewis v. Jacks, </em>486 F.3d 1025, 1028 (8th Cir.2007) (to avoid summary judgment on race discrimination claim, inmate had to identify affirmative evidence from which jury could find proof of discriminatory motive; motive is most often proved with evidence that similarly situated inmates were treated differently). We also conclude that summary judgment was properly granted on Fowler\u2019s due process claim. <em>See Lyon v. Farrier, </em>727 F.2d 766, 769 (8th Cir.1984) (per curiam) (inmates generally have no constitutional right to tenure in prison jobs; concluding that prison regulations did not create liberty or property interest). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment, <em>see </em>8th Cir. R. 47B, and we deny Fowler\u2019s pending motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-19\">.
