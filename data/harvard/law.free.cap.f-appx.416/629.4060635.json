He contends that he is not an aggravated felon subject to removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2) (A) (iii). He further argues that, even if his conviction amounts to an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d he is entitled to deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.17(a). We deny the petition for review and hold that Olawale-Ayinde is not entitled to deferral of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-20\">Olawale-Ayinde pled guilty to and was convicted of seven counts of bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344; two counts of illegal transfer of means of identification, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(7); one count of conspiracy to launder money, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h); and five counts of aiding and abetting laundering monetary instruments, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1). As charged in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>indictment, the seven counts of bank fraud alone involved a total loss of $70,634.67. The judgment indicated that Olawale-Ayinde pled guilty to these counts \u201cas charged\u201d in the indictment. At sentencing, Olawale-Ayinde was ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $1,393,129.04 pursuant to the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A. The restitution order specifically referenced only those counts to which Olawale-Ayinde had pled guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Under federal immigration law, an \u201caggravated felony\u201d includes any \u201coffense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i). Recently, the Supreme Court clarified that the $10,000 threshold in subparagraph (M)(i) refers to \u201cthe factual circumstances surrounding commission of the crime on a specific occasion,\u201d rather than an element of the crime of conviction. <em>Nijhawan v. Holder, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2294, 2298, 174 L.Ed.2d 22 (2009). The immigration judge properly considered Ola-wale-Ayinde\u2019s guilty plea as charged and the district court\u2019s restitution order in determining that he is an \u201caggravated felon\u201d within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i). <em>See id. </em>at 2303-04. As an aggravated felon, Olawale-Ayinde is statutorily ineligible for asylum and for withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act and CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">Likewise, the immigration judge did not err in determining that Olawale-Ayinde is ineligible for deferral of removal pursuant to CAT. To establish eligibility for CAT relief, an alien must show that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he will be tortured in the proposed country of removal. <em>See, e.g., Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1283 (9th Cir.2001) (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2)). To come within the purview of the Convention, the torture must be \u201cinflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">Even assuming that Olawale-Ayinde was credible, he presented no documentation or other evidence that the Nigerian government could not and would not protect him from ritual human sacrifice at the hands of the Ogboni. Nor did he establish state action or acquiescence in support of such purported goings on within Nigeria. He also did not establish that participation in Ogboni rituals is not voluntary on the part of members. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1). Olawale-Ayinde thus failed to shoulder his burden of proof and to demonstrate eligibility for CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-13\">For the foregoing reasons, Olawale-Ayinde\u2019s petition for review is denied and he is ordered removed to Nigeria. All pending motions are denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-14\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b652-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
