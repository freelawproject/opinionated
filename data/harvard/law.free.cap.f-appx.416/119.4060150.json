We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, proceedings below, and specification of issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">We review an order granting summary judgment <em>de novo </em>and ask whether the district court properly concluded that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Miller v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, L.L.P., </em>321 F.3d 292, 300 (2d Cir.2003). In determining whether there are genuine issues of material fact, we are \u201crequired to resolve all ambiguities and draw all permissible factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought.\u201d <em>Terry v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 128, 137 (2d Cir.2003) (quotation marks omitted). However, \u201cconclusory statements or mere allegations [are] not sufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion.\u201d <em>Davis v. New York, </em>316 F.3d 93, 100 (2d Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">Haring conducted an independent and <em>de novo </em>review of the record in light of these principles, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment for substantially the same reasons stated by the district court in its thorough and well-reasoned decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">We have considered Appellant\u2019s other arguments on appeal and have found them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
