WINTER, ROSEMARY S. POOLER, PETER W. HALL, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b143-8\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">Appellant Shirley Williams, <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s grant of the Commissioner\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, upholding the Commissioner\u2019s partially-favorable determination that Williams was not disabled from May 23, 1998, the date she alleged disability, through May 11, 2004. Liberally construing her brief, Williams challenges the administrative law judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) onset finding. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">In Williams\u2019s prior appeal, we held that substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s June 2003 determination that she was not disabled, but that new evidence, namely, a May 2004 myelogram that revealed that Williams was suffering from spinal epidural lipomatosis (\u201cSEL\u201d), was material and probative; thus, remand was warranted so that the Commissioner could consider the record in light of the new evidence. <em>See Williams v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>236 Fed.Appx. 641 (2d Cir.2007) (summary order). Upon remand, an ALJ rendered a partially favorable decision, determining that Williams was not disabled on the date she alleged, May 23,1998, but that she became disabled on May 11, 2004, the date the myelogram revealed a diagnosis of SEL. The principal issue on appeal, therefore, is whether the record after remand demonstrated that Williams\u2019s condition was not disabling until the May 11, 2004 myelogram. <em>See Pollard v. Halter, </em>377 F.3d 183,193 (2d Cir.2004) (remanding case and directing Commissioner to consider new evidence \u201cin conjunction with the existing administrative record\u201d); <em>id. </em>(noting that new evidence on remand may support \u201cearlier contentions\u201d regarding the claimant\u2019s condition, and show that, during the relevant time period, the claimant\u2019s condition \u201cwas far more serious than previously thought and that additional impairments existed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">We review district court orders granting motions to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(c) <em>de novo, see Jasinski v. Barnhart, </em>341 F.3d 182, 184 (2d Cir.2003), and when reviewing determinations made by the Commissioner, we conduct a plenary review of the administrative record, <em>see Schaal v. Apfel, </em>134 F.3d 496, 500-01 (2d Cir.1998) (noting focus of review is the administrative ruling, not the district court\u2019s decision). Moreover, we may only set aside the Commissioner\u2019s decision if the factual findings are not supported by substantial evidence, or if incorrect legal standards were applied. <em>See Burgess v. Astrue, </em>537 F.3d 117, 127 (2d Cir.2008); <em>Hallaran v. Barnhart, </em>362 F.3d 28, 31 (2d Cir.2004). A determination is supported by substantial evidence if the record contains \u201csuch relevant evidence as [a] reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Jasinski, </em>341 F.3d at 184 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">Here, after having conducted an independent and <em>de novo </em>review of the record in light of these principles, we affirm the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>district court\u2019s judgment. The medical evidence in the record concerning Williams\u2019s condition provides substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s onset finding. In particular, several diagnostic tests prior to the May 2004 myelogram failed to reveal SEL \u2014 in fact, as late as July 2002, an MRI of Williams\u2019s lumbar spine revealed no sign of \u201cspinal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing.\u201d In addition, four physicians\u2019 reports through September 2000 demonstrated that Williams had a functional capacity to perform light work. Moreover, although back pain is a symptom of SEL that \u201coften presents long before ... other symptoms\u201d and Williams\u2019s complaints of back pain were consistent throughout the administrative record, her complaints are undercut by the ALJ\u2019s finding that she was not entirely credible, which finding is supported by substantial evidence. Finally, as the ALJ found, there is no evidence in the record to show that a treating physician considered SEL prior to the May 2004 myelogram. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, it was appropriate for the ALJ to choose the conclusive diagnostic finding of SEL to support his onset determination. We have considered Williams\u2019s other arguments on appeal and have found them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
