The Liquidating Trustee\u2019s assignment of the litigation claims at issue is expressly permitted in the Trust Agreement (the \u201cTrust Agreement\u201d) created under the Plan of Liquidation confirmed by the bankruptcy court, in such plan, and in the related confirmation order. The role of the Liquidating Trustee is defined by the Trust Agreement and governed by state law, and the actions he took that are at issue here are assessed under the business judgment rule, which he comfortably satisfies.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The bankruptcy court\u2019s orders of August 18, 2008 and September 24, 2008 are AFFIRMED, as is the district court\u2019s judgment affirming such orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">AFFIRMED.
