We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We grant the petition to reopen and remand for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-23\">1. The BIA abused its discretion in holding that Habtemicael\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim demonstrated neither (A) due diligence nor (B) prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-24\">A. Due Diligence</p>\n<p id=\"b669-25\">Habtemicael\u2019s first two attorneys assumed (without doing any research) that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>Habtemicael\u2019s assault conviction was a crime involving moral turpitude (CIMT). Habtemicael did not learn that his conviction may not be a CIMT until he retained new counsel. Within 90 days after learning of the alleged ineffectiveness, Habtemicael filed a motion to reopen. Where, as here, Habtemicael was represented by counsel during the entire proceedings, he could not have discovered the ineffectiveness of prior counsel until he spoke with new counsel. <em>See Ghahremani v. Gonzales, </em>498 F.3d 993, 999 (9th Cir.2007). Therefore, based upon the record before us, the BIA abused its discretion in finding that Habtemicael failed to act with due diligence in discovering the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 897-98 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">B. Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">After demonstrating due diligence, Habtemicael must show that he was prejudiced by the performance of his two counsel. <em>See Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 793 (9th Cir.2005). A showing of prejudice can be made if counsel\u2019s performance \u201cwas so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Iturribarria, </em>321 F.3d at 899-900 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, upon reviewing the judicially noticeable documents,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> one cannot determine that Habtemicael\u2019s conviction for Assault in the Second Degree, RCW \u00a7 9A.36.021(l)(e) (which requires an assault on another with the intent to commit a felony), was a CIMT. The record does not evidence which felony Habtemicael intended to commit. We can glean that the underlying felony may have involved sexual assault on a minor female. However, even if we were to assume that the underlying felony was the originating charge of Rape of Child in the Third Degree, RCW \u00a7 9A.44.079, that statute, without more, does not unequivocally prove a CIMT. <em>See Quintero-Salazar v. Keisler, </em>506 F.3d 688, 693-94 (9th Cir.2007) (holding that a violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 261.5(d), a similar statute to RCW \u00a7 9A.44.079, was not necessarily a CIMT). Because the record before us does not unequivocally show that Habtemicael was convicted of a CIMT, counsels\u2019 failure to raise this issue may have affected the outcome of the proceedings. <em>See Lin v. Ashcroft, </em>377 F.3d 1014, 1027 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cTo prove he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s alleged ineffectiveness, [petitioner] only needs to show that he has <em>plausible </em>grounds for relief.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Thus, the BIA abused its discretion in finding that Habtemicael failed to demonstrate prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">2. The BIA abused its discretion when it failed to consider Habtemicael\u2019s allegations of changed country conditions in connection with his proposed asylum application. This failure to even consider the allegation was error. We do not require \u201cthe BIA ... to write an exegesis on every contention.\u201d <em>Lopez v. Ashcroft, </em>366 F.3d 799, 807 n. 6 (9th Cir.2004) (alterations, internal quotation marks and citation omitted). However, we do require the BIA to \u201cconsider the issues raised, and announce its decision in terms sufficient to enable a reviewing court to perceive that it has heard and thought and not merely reacted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because we are unable to conduct a meaningful review of the BIA\u2019s decision, as to this issue, we remand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>with instructions for the BIA to address the issue in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Accordingly, we grant the petition and remand on an open record for any further determinations that the BIA deems necessary. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b669-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b670-6\">. We note that the Certificate for Determination of Probable Cause is not a judicially noticeable document under these circumstances. <em>See Parrilla </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>414 F.3d 1038, 1040 &amp; 1044 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
