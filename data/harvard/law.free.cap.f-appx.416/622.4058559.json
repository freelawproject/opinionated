We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence findings of fact, including adverse credibility determinations. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-25\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based upon the inconsistency regarding whether Aulakh knew his brother was involved with militants, which was the basis for Aulakh\u2019s purported mistreatment by police. <em>See id. </em>at 1043. In the absence of credible testimony, Aulakh\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number><em>Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir .2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Because Aulakh\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony found to be not credible, and Aulakh does not point to any other evidence that shows it is more likely than not he would be tortured if returned to India, his CAT claim fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b644-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
