Cabrera-Gurola argues that his sentence, at the low end of the advisory guidelines range, is substantively unreasonable. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-26\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AgC\">A. Offense Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b84-27\">In 1998, Cabrera-Gurola, a Mexican citizen, was arrested in Georgia after he attempted to sell two kilograms of cocaine to a confidential informant working with federal agents. In 1999, Cabrera-Gurola pled guilty in federal district court to conspiracy to distribute cocaine and possession with intent to distribute marijuana and received a sentence of 38 months\u2019 imprisonment and four years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-28\">After serving his imprisonment term, on October 5, 2001, Cabrera-Gurola began <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>serving his four-year supervised release term. On October 6, 2001, Cabrera-Gurola was deported to Mexico. In July 2005, Cabrera-Gurola\u2019s probation officer filed a warrant and petition alleging Cabrera-Gurola had violated the conditions of his supervised release by failing to report and to pay fines and fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">In 2006, Cabrera-Gurola re-entered the United States without authorization and returned to Georgia, where he lived with a friend. On December 4, 2009, CabreraGurola was arrested for selling cocaine to an undercover officer with the Hall County Sheriffs Office (\u201cHCSO\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The HCSO notified Special Agent John Cweika with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement of Cabrera-Gurola\u2019s detention. In an interview, Cabrera-Gurola admitted to Agent Cweika that he was a Mexican citizen and was previously removed from the United States. In federal court, Cabrera-Gurola was charged with, and pled guilty to, being an alien found in the United States after having been deported and without having obtained permission to re-enter the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">B. Presentence Investigation Report</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) recommended: (1) a base offense level of 8, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a); (2) a 16-level increase, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i), due to Cabrera-Gurola\u2019s prior removal following his felony drug trafficking convictions; and (3) a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b). Because Cabrera-Gurola committed the instant offense while on supervised release, he received an additional 2 criminal history points, for a total of 5, which raised his criminal history category from a II to a III. With a total offense level of 21 and a criminal history category of III, the PSI recommended an advisory guidelines range of 46 to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment. Cabrera-Gurola did not file written objections to the PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">In a sentencing memorandum, CabreraGurola argued that he should receive a sentence below the advisory guidelines range because (1) the additional 2 criminal history points for committing the offense while on supervised release, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d) (referred to as \u201crecency points\u201d), unreasonably increased his criminal history score in light of the Sentencing Commission\u2019s recent vote to delete this provision from the Guidelines;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) the 16-level increase in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) disproportionately increased the offense level compared to similar enhancements for more egregious conduct and inappropriately double counted prior convictions, resulting in an unreason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>ably high guidelines range; and (3) the nature and circumstances of his offense and his life history merited a lower sentence. Cabrera-Gurola asked for a 24-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">C. Sentencing Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">At the sentencing hearing on his illegal reentry charge, Cabrera-Gurola confirmed that he had no objection to the PSI\u2019s guidelines calculations, only \u201carguments on reasonableness.\u201d The district court adopted the PSI and found that CabreraGurola\u2019s offense level was a 21 and his criminal history category was a III, resulting in an advisory guidelines range of 46 to 57 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">In support of his request for a 24-month sentence, below the advisory guidelines range, Cabrera-Gurola reiterated his arguments that the recency points pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d) unreasonably inflated his criminal history category and that the 16-level increase pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i), while technically applicable, overestimated the seriousness of his offense. Cabrera-Gurola also contended that he was unlikely to re-offend because his entire family had returned to Mexico, decreasing his likelihood of returning to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The government asked for a 51-month sentence, in the middle of the advisory guidelines range. The government pointed out that, even if the two recency points pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d) were removed, a 51-month sentence would fall \u2022within the resulting 41-to-51-month range.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">The government argued that the 16-level increase pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) was appropriate in Cabrera-Gurola\u2019s case and was proportional to the type of offense committed. The government stressed that Cabrera-Gurola\u2019s offense was serious, that he was previously convicted of two aggravated felonies \u2014 drug trafficking offenses \u2014 and, after removal, returned to the United States, where he was arrested again for a drug trafficking offense. The government contended that the dangerousness of Cabrera-Gurola\u2019s prior drug trafficking crimes warranted the 16-level increase. The government argued that a 51-month sentence was appropriate because it would promote respect for the law given Cabrera\u2019s-Gurola\u2019s continued engagement in criminal activity, decrease the threat to the community posed by the dangerousness of Cabrera-Gurola\u2019s drug trafficking crimes and allow Cabrera-Gurola to receive drug treatment if he had a drug-use problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">The district court imposed a 46-month sentence. The district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-11\">I\u2019m taking into consideration what [Cabrera-Gurola] argued about in the change of points, and that would make so little that I\u2019m going to the bottom end of the guideline range to compensate for that. As opposed to what the government\u2019s requesting at the top end. That difference was very nominal, three or four months. I\u2019ve really gone further than that to compensate for that factor because I do think that the court should take that into consideration and not \u2014 as part of the calculations at the current time and appropriate to so calculate it at the current time, but I take it in consideration in the sentence that\u2019s imposed, which I am doing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-12\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court also considered the petition for revocation of supervised release for CabreraGurola\u2019s 1999 drug trafficking convictions. The district court found that Cabrera-Gurola had violated the terms of his supervised release and imposed a consecutive twelve-month sentence. The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>noted, \u201cThis case is more aggravated than the others, a lot of the others I have, and I think that\u2019s an appropriate sentence. And the combination of the two are appropriate sentences under the guideline range and under the circumstances of this case.\u201d Cabrera-Gurola filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence under the abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of both the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We ordinarily expect a sentence within the advisory guidelines range will be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Cabrera-Gurola argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable specifically due to the district court\u2019s 16-level increase of his offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(a)(i).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Our reasonableness review, however, applies only to the defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence, not to \u201ceach individual decision made during the sentencing process.\u201d <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir. 2005). Cabrera-Gurola did not challenge the district court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(i) 16-level increase in the district court and, in fact, conceded in the district court that the enhancement applied. And, Cabrera-Gurola does not raise this guidelines calculation issue in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-12\">Here, considering the totality of the circumstances, Cabrera-Gurola has not shown that his total 46-month sentence is unreasonable. Cabrera-Gurola illegally entered the United States, committed two drug trafficking offenses and was deported back to Mexico. Cabrera-Gurola then illegally re-entered the United States and was arrested for another drug trafficking offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-13\">The district court emphasized the seriousness of the offense when it noted that Cabrera-Gurola\u2019s offense was \u201cmore aggravated\u201d than most of the illegal reentry cases it saw. The district court considered Cabrera-Gurola\u2019s arguments in mitigation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>and clearly concluded that the mitigating facts militated in favor of a sentence at the low end of the advisory guidelines range of 46 to 57 months, but did not support a variance below that range. We cannot say the district court abused its discretion in imposing a 46-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-9\">. Cabrera-Gurola was charged in state court with sale of cocaine. The state charge was still pending at the time of Cabrera-Gurola's federal sentencing on the instant offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b85-10\">.

In contrast, at the time of the sentencing, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(e) provided for a two-level increase if the defendant \"committed the instant offense less than two years after release from imprisonment\u201d on a sentence of imprisonment of at least sixty days. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(e) (2009). Effective November 1, 2010, the Sentencing Commission amended U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1 by, <em>inter alia, </em>eliminating subsection (e) and redesignating subsection (f) as subsection (e). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 742. Based on Amendment 742, Cabrera-Gurola asked the district court either to adjust his criminal history to II, resulting in an advisory guidelines range of 41 to 51 months, or to \u201carrive at a similar result\u201d using a downward variance. However, Cabrera-Gurola\u2019s two-level increase was not pursuant to soon-to-be-amended subsection (e), but to subsection (d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b87-8\">. Cabrera-Gurola does not challenge the district court\u2019s guidelines calculations or in any other way argue that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable.
