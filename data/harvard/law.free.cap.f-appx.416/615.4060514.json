They petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 denial, as untimely, of their motion to reopen based on their claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen was filed late; the final administrative decision was rendered on February 11, 2005 and Petitioners filed their motion to reopen on November 3, 2006. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(e)(2) (requiring filing of a motion to reopen \u201cno later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened\u201d). Equitable tolling does not apply since Petitioners did not demonstrate the required due diligence. <em>See Socop-Gonzalez v. I.N.S., </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1193 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc) (explaining that equitable tolling applies when \u201cdespite all due diligence, the party invoking equitable tolling is unable to obtain vital information bearing on the existence of the claim\u201d) (citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted). The hearing before the Immigration Judge took place in December 2003. At that time, Petitioners knew of what counsel did that they now claim was ineffective. They thus had the information necessary to bring their ineffective assistance of counsel claim in 2003, but only filed their motion to reopen in 2006, more than a year after the administrative decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Petition DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b637-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
