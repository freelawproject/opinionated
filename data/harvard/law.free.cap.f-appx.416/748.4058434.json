McKAY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b771-13\">Wanda J. Harley appeals the district court\u2019s judgment, after a bench trial, that the United States Postal Service\u2019s termination of her employment was not in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(1). Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we conclude that the district court did not apply incorrect legal standards and did not clearly err in concluding that age was not the but-for cause of the termination. Accordingly, we must affirm its judgment in favor of the Postal Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-14\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b771-15\">Ms. Harley was forty-six years old during the events underlying this case. At the beginning of April 2006, she left her position as a substitute rural carrier at the Blackwell, Oklahoma post office to become a city carrier at the Fairfax, Oklahoma, post office. In her new position, she had to complete a ninety-day probation period, which included reviews at thirty and sixty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-16\">On April 15, 2006, Anthony Jansson became the Fairfax postmaster. Just before Ms. Harley\u2019s thirty-day review, Mr. Jansson\u2019s supervisor told him to do an all-day observation of her performance. Mr. Jansson asked Scott Shepard, a supervisor at another post office, to do the observation, which Mr. Shepard did on May 2, 2006. According to Mr. Shepard, while he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>was at the Fairfax post office, Mr. Jansson told him that he (Mr. Jansson) needed somebody younger and faster in Ms. Harley\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">For the thirty-day review, Mr. Jansson gave Ms. Harley \u201csatisfactory\u201d ratings for dependability, work relations, and work methods, and \u201cunacceptable\u201d ratings for work quality, work quantity, and personal conduct. Mr. Jansson testified that he based the quality and quantity ratings on his observations of her speed in sorting the mail and getting out of the office to deliver it, and the conduct rating on his perception that she was not flexible when asked to fill in at another post office. Ms. Harley accepted the review.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">On Friday, June 9, 2006, Mr. Jansson gave Ms. Harley her sixty-day review. He was on annual leave that day, but was in the office to assemble a new desk. After Ms. Harley returned from her route and clocked out, Mr. Jansson asked her to come in to his office for the review. When she said she had clocked out, he told her he would add the time to her card. In the review, he told her that she was improving, but he gave her the same ratings as the thirty-day review. Ms. Harley disagreed with the ratings because they did not reflect Mr. Jansson\u2019s statement that she was improving. She refused to sign the review form. She testified that she told Mr. Jansson that they should sit down on Saturday or Monday (when they were both on the clock) to go over the evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The parties have different viewpoints about the end of the review. In Ms. Harley\u2019s view, the meeting was over and she was off the clock, so she left. \u201cThen he had nothing more to say, and I had nothing more to say, and I left to go home.\u201d Aplt.App. at 1044-45. In contrast, Mr. Jansson testified that she left before the end of the review, \u201cright in the middle of me trying to talk to her about things we can do to help.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 769. He stated that she left \u201cin a hurried way\u201d and was \u201cpretty upset.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 765. \u201cFor lack of a better term, she stormed out of the office ... and just left.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ms. Harley worked her normal schedule the next two work days, but on the third work day, June 13, 2006, Mr. Jansson terminated her employment. The termination letter informed her that she \u201cfail[ed] to achieve employment expectations during [her] probationary period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1320. Eventually the Postal Service filled her position with a thirty-two-year-old.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">Ms. Harley brought suit under the AJDEA. Her claim went to a bench trial. At trial, Mr. Jansson testified that he was the sole decisionmaker with regard to terminating Ms. Harley\u2019s employment, and he fired Ms. Harley because \u201cof what she did during the 60-day evaluation,\u201d not because of her performance. <em>Id. </em>at 768. He denied ever telling Mr. Shepard that he wanted someone younger for the position. Ms. Harley testified that she left because the meeting was over and she was off the clock, and she denied walking hurriedly or storming out of the office. She asserted that the termination was because of her age. Both sides presented witnesses and evidence favoring their respective positions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ultimately the district court decided in favor of the Postal Service, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>While Harley\u2019s age was one of many reasons, including the fact that Harley left her sixty day evaluation and Harley was not fast enough, for her termination, Harley has not proved by a preponderance of the evidence that her age was the \u201cbut for\u201d cause of her termination. Harley simply has not shown that her age was <em>the </em>reason for her termination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao2\">Aplt.App. at 587. Ms. Harley appeals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">\u201cIn an appeal from a bench trial, such as in this case, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and its legal conclusions de novo.\u201d <em>Holdeman v. Devine, </em>572 F.3d 1190, 1192 (10th Cir. 2009) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">A. <em>Legal Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">Ms. Harley argues that the district court committed legal error by improperly applying the teachings of <em>Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2343, 174 L.Ed.2d 119 (2009). We address this issue first because \u201c[t]he reviewing court is not bound by the clearly erroneous standard when the trial court has based its findings on an erroneous view of the law.\u201d <em>Valley Improvement Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Corp., </em>129 F.3d 1108, 1123 (10th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-11\">In <em>Gross, </em>the Supreme Court held that the ADEA does not recognize a \u201cmixed motives\u201d discrimination claim. \u201c[T]he ordinary meaning of the ADEA\u2019s requirement that an employer took adverse action \u2018because of age is that age was the \u2018reason\u2019 that the employer decided to act.\u201d 129 S.Ct. at 2350. Therefore, \u201c[a] plaintiff must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence (which may be direct or circumstantial), that age was the \u2018but-for\u2019 cause of the challenged adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2351. \u201cThe burden of persuasion does not shift to the employer to show that it would have taken the action regardless of age, even when a plaintiff has produced some evidence that age was one motivating factor in that decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2352.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-15\">Because \u201c[t]he Tenth Circuit has long held that a plaintiff must prove but-for causation to hold an employer liable under the ADEA,\u201d <em>Gross </em>did not change this court\u2019s approach in ADEA cases. <em>Jones v. Okla. City Pub. Schs., </em>617 F.3d 1273, 1277 (10th Cir.2010). Further, it is well-established in this circuit that the \u201cbut-for\u201d standard does not require a plaintiff to show that age was the employer\u2019s sole motivating factor. <em>See Wilkerson v. Shinseki, </em>606 F.3d 1256, 1266 (10th Cir.2010) (citing <em>EEOC v. Prudential Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>763 F.2d 1166, 1170 (10th Cir.1985)). \u201cInstead, an employer may be held liable under the ADEA if other factors contributed to its taking an adverse action, as long as age was the factor that made a difference.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>617 F.3d at 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-16\">In its conclusions of law, the district court recited the <em>Gross </em>standard. Then, in deciding against Ms. Harley, it stated, \u201c[wjhile Harley\u2019s age was one of many reasons, including the fact that Harley left her sixty day evaluation and Harley was not fast enough, for her termination, Harley has not proved by a preponderance of the evidence that her age was the \u2018but for\u2019 cause of her termination.\u201d ApltApp. at 587. It concluded, \u201cHarley simply has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>shown that her age was <em>the </em>reason for her termination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ms. Harley argues that the emphasis on \u201cthe\u201d in the concluding sentence means that the district court improperly required her to prove that her age was the sole motivating factor in the termination, not the but-for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">We do not agree with Ms. Harley\u2019s suggestion that the district court\u2019s emphasis on \u201cthe\u201d in \u201cthe reason\u201d implicitly, and necessarily, equates to stating \u201cthe sole reason.\u201d The district court properly identified <em>Gross </em>as the controlling legal standard. Just before the sentence emphasizing \u201cthe,\u201d the court specifically found that \u201cHarley has not proved by a preponderance of the evidence that her age was the \u2018but for\u2019 cause of her termination.\u201d Aplt. App. at 587. And with the exception of the emphasis, the final sentence encapsulates <em>Gross\u2019s </em>teaching that \u201c[t]he ordinary meaning of the ADEA\u2019s requirement that an employer took adverse action \u2018because of age is that age was the \u2018reason\u2019 that the employer decided to act.\u201d <em>Gross, </em>129 S.Ct. at 2350. In sum, there is nothing to show that the district court did not understand how to apply the \u201cbut-for\u201d standard. Accordingly, we decline to reverse the judgment on the ground that the district court applied incorrect legal principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">B. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">\u201cThe ultimate question in every employment discrimination case involving a claim of disparate treatment is whether the plaintiff was the victim of intentional discrimination.\u201d <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 153, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). \u201c[A] finding of intentional discrimination is a finding of fact.\u201d <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985). Therefore, it is subject to the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review. <em>See id. </em>\u201cA finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). But</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-10\">[t]his standard plainly does not entitle a reviewing court to reverse the finding of the trier of fact simply because it is convinced that it would have decided the case differently. The reviewing court oversteps the bounds of its duty under Rule 52(a) if it undertakes to duplicate the role of the lower court. In applying the clearly erroneous standard to the findings of a district court sitting without a jury, appellate courts must constantly have in mind that their function is not to decide factual issues <em>de novo. </em>If the district court\u2019s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently. Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 573-74, 105 S.Ct. 1504 (quotation and citation omitted). \u201c[W]e view the evidence in the light most favorable to the district court\u2019s ruling and must uphold any district court finding that is permissible in light of the evidence.\u201d <em>Manning v. United States, </em>146 F.3d 808, 813 (10th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-12\">Ms. Harley argues that the district court found three reasons for the termination: her age, that she left the sixty-day evaluation,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that she was not fast <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>enough in performing the job. She further asserts that the evidence does not support the non-age-related findings. Therefore, she concludes, age is the only reason supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">We agree with Ms. Harley that the evidence does not support the finding that her speed was a reason underlying the termination of her employment. Mr. Jansson, the sole decisionmaker, testified that the termination decision was based only on Ms. Harley\u2019s conduct with regard to the sixty-day review. In follow-up questioning, he specifically confirmed that the termination was not due to her performance. While Ms. Harley\u2019s lack of speed may have been an issue underlying the ratings in the sixty-day evaluation, Mr. Jansson\u2019s testimony precludes finding that speed was a reason for the termination. Thus, the district court clearly erred in finding to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">But discounting the performance factor still leaves two reasons: age and her conduct with regard to the sixty-day review. Ms. Harley asserts that the evidence does not support a finding that the latter reason caused the termination because \u201cHarley\u2019s 60-day evaluation had concluded when Harley left\u201d and \u201cJansson did not tell Harley she could not leave or demand she return.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 30. She also points out that in the many documents Mr. Jansson filled out regarding her termination, he did not assert that she stormed out of his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">These arguments, however, miss the point. First, it appears that the district court based its decision on the fact that Ms. Harley left the review, not the <em>way </em>she left it. Second, Ms. Harley views the evidence in the light most favorable to her, not the light most favorable to the Postal Service. The Postal Service presented evidence that contradicted Ms. Harley\u2019s evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThat the record supports a view of the evidence that is permissible but contrary to the trial court\u2019s findings is not sufficient to warrant upsetting the lower court\u2019s findings.\u201d <em>Holdeman, </em>572 F.3d at 1192. \u201c[Ejvery trial is replete with conflicting evidence, and in a bench trial, it is the district court, which enjoys the benefit of live testimony and has the opportunity firsthand to weigh credibility and evidence, that has the task of sorting through and making sense of the parties\u2019 competing narratives.\u201d <em>Watson v. United States, </em>485 F.3d 1100, 1108 (10th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">\u201cWhere there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>470 U.S. at 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504. \u201c[W]hen a trial judge\u2019s finding is based on his decision to credit the testimony of one of two or more witnesses, each of whom has told a coherent and facially plausible story that is not contradicted by extrinsic evidence, that finding, if not internally in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>consistent, can virtually never be clear error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575, 105 S.Ct. 1504. The Postal Service\u2019s evidence suffers from weaknesses, but Mr. Jansson\u2019s story is facially plausible. At best the documents undermine his credibility rather than fatally contradict his testimony. Thus, we cannot conclude that it was clear error for the district court to accept the Postal Service\u2019s position rather than Ms. Harley\u2019s. And once the court accepted the Postal Service\u2019s position with regard to the end of the sixty-day review, it was not clearly erroneous for it to find that age was not the but-for cause of the termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The clearly erroneous \u201cstandard plainly does not entitle a reviewing court to reverse the finding of the trier of fact simply because it is convinced that it would have decided the case differently.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504. Where \u201cthe factual issue fairly could be decided for either party,\u201d the district court\u2019s findings cannot be clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 581, 105 S.Ct. 1504 (Powell, J., concurring). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b771-9\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b772-7\">. During the litigation, Ms. Harley sought production of her time cards, but the Postal Service did not produce them, stating that they could not be found. Ms. Harley sought sanctions due to spoliation of evidence, requesting that the district court make an adverse-inference finding against the Postal Service. The court held a hearing on the issue just before the trial. Ultimately, the court concluded that the Postal Service's loss of the time cards was \u201cclearly negligent,\u201d but the evidence did \u201cnot support a finding that defendant intentionally, in bad faith, lost or destroyed the time cards.\u201d Aplt.App. at 582. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>Thus, the court declined to make an adverse-inference finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-13\">Ms. Harley's opening brief contains a two-sentence reference, without citation, to the denial of the sanctions motion. Because she fails to present any developed argument regarding the denial, we consider any challenge to it to be waived. <em>See Adler v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>144 F.3d 664, 679 (10th Cir. 1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b774-7\">. Ms. Harley points out that the district court did not make any findings that \"Harley left her 60-day evaluation 'hurriedly' or \u2018stormed out\u2019 of Jansson's office.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 31-32. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>But it appears that, in the district court's view, what was important was not necessarily the <em>way </em>that Ms. Harley left the review, but the <em>fact </em>that she left. <em>See </em>Aplt.App. at 587 (finding as one of the \u201cmany reasons\u201d for the termination \"the fact that Harley left her sixty day evaluation\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b775-8\">. In addition to Mr. Jansson\u2019s testimony, the Postal Service presented the testimony of another Postal Service employee that she was outside the Postmaster\u2019s office during the sixty-day review, she heard a slamming door from the office, Ms. Harley walked out past her, and she got the impression that Ms. Harley was upset. It also presented the testimony of Mr. Jansson\u2019s former supervisor that Mr. Jansson had consulted with him about how to respond to the situation. The former supervisor and four other supervisory- or managerial-level Postal Service employees testified that they would terminate the employment of a probationary employee who walked out of a review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
