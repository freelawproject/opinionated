We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, <em>Santos-Lemus v. Mukasey, </em>542 F.3d 738, 742 (9th Cir.2008), for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s rejection of an untimely brief, <em>Zetino v. Holder, </em>622 F.3d 1007, 1012 (9th Cir.2010), and de novo claims of due process violations in immigration proceedings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number><em>Sandoval-Luna v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 1243, 1246 (9th Cir.2008). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Batres contends the BIA failed to address his religion claim, and that his Christian religion was one central reason for the harm he suffered from gang members. Contrary to Batres\u2019 contention, the BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s finding that Batres failed to demonstrate the requisite nexus to a protected ground, including his religion. <em>See Molino-Estrada v. </em>INS, 293 F.3d 1089,1093 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201cWhere ... the BIA has reviewed the IJ\u2019s decision and incorporated portions of it as its own, we treat the incorporated parts of the IJ\u2019s decision as the BIA\u2019s.\u201d). Further, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Batres failed to demonstrate one central reason for the gang\u2019s attack was his religion because he testified gang members threatened to attack him if he did not join the gang, not if he continued to practice Christianity. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (the petitioner must establish \u201cthat the record also compels the conclusion that he has a \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 that the guerrillas will persecute him <em>because of </em>that political opinion, rather than because of his refusal to fight with them\u201d) (emphasis in original); <em>see also Parussimova v. Mukasey, </em>555 F.3d 734, 740-41 (9th Cir.2009) (\u201c[t]he Real ID Act requires that a protected ground represent \u2018one central reason\u2019 for an asylum applicant\u2019s persecution\u201d). Accordingly, Batres\u2019 asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Ochoa v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 1166, 1172 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s finding that Batres did not establish a likelihood of torture by, at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of the Salvadoran government. <em>See Zheng v. Ashcroft, </em>332 F.3d 1186, 1196 (9th Cir.2003). We reject Batres\u2019 contention that the BIA engaged in factfinding in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in declining to accept Batres\u2019 untimely brief, <em>see Zetino, </em>622 F.3d at 1013 (concluding the applicable regulations indicate the BIA <em>\u201ccould have </em>considered\u201d the brief, but it was under no obligation to do so, and the BIA \u201cdid not act arbitrarily, irrationally, or contrary to the law\u201d in declining to do so), and Batres\u2019 contention that the BIA did not adequately explain its reason for declining to accept the untimely brief is belied by the record, <em>cf. Garcia Gomez v. Gonzales, </em>498 F.3d 1050, 1051 (9th Cir.2007). Finally, we reject Batres\u2019 contention that the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion violated his due process rights because his failure to file a timely brief was not due to the actions of the BIA, and the BIA considered the arguments he raised in his notice of appeal and addressed all claims of relief raised before the IJ. <em>See Zetino, </em>622 F.3d at 1013-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b657-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
