The district court granted the Government\u2019s motion to depart from the advisory Guidelines range under <em>inter alia U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l) (2008). The court then sentenced Adams to a total of 240 months in prison. Counsel for Adams has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues, but questioning whether the district court committed clear error by granting the Government\u2019s motion for an upward departure under USSG \u00a7 4A1.3. Although advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, Adams has not done so. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">In assessing a sentencing court\u2019s decision to depart from a defendant\u2019s Guidelines range, we \u201cconsider whether the sentencing court acted reasonably both with respect to its decision to impose such a sentence and with respect to the extent of the divergence from the sentencing range.\u201d <em>United States v. McNeill, </em>598 F.3d 161, 166 (4th Cir.) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>affirmed, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2218, - L.Ed.2d - (2011). Under USSG \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(1), a court may depart upward based upon its determination that the calculated criminal history category substantially underrepresents either the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes. In the background commentary, the Sentencing Commission recognized that an upward departure may be appropriate for \u201cyounger defendants (e.g., defendants in their early twenties or younger) who are more likely to have received repeated lenient treatment, ... [as they] may actually pose a greater risk of serious recidivism than older defendants.\u201d USSG \u00a7 4A1.3, p.s., cmt. (backg\u2019d). In choosing the appropriate criminal history category for departure, the court should use \u201cas a reference, the criminal history category applicable to defendants whose criminal history or likelihood to recidivate most closely resembles that of the defendant\u2019s.\u201d USSG \u00a7 4A1.3 (a)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-15\">Adams does not identify on what basis the district court may have erred in imposing a departure under \u00a7 4A1.3. We conclude that the district court made specific findings of fact and relied on appropriate factors in determining that a departure was warranted. Adams was twenty-one years old at the time of his sentencing, and the district court determined that he had a history of violent behavior and had repeatedly failed to perform well during his previous probationary sentences. Moreover, certain of Adams\u2019 prior convictions were consolidated, resulting in a more lenient sentence. In addition, the district court noted that Adams was a gang mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>ber and had a number of institutional infractions.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Reliance upon the defendant\u2019s continued criminal conduct during incarceration and supervised release, which demonstrates that the criminal justice system had previously failed to deter, is a proper basis for a USSG \u00a7 4A1.S departure. <em>See McNeill, </em>598 F.3d at 166. In addition, the court correctly relied upon Adams\u2019 relatively young age and relatively long history of \u201cpoor interaction with the criminal justice system.\u201d Accordingly, we find that the district court acted reasonably in granting the departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Next, we must consider the reasonableness of the extent of the departure. Here, in accordance with the Guidelines\u2019 instructions, the district court determined that the criminal history of Category VI defendants most closely mirrored Adams\u2019 criminal background. Adams did not contend below or on appeal that his criminal history was not substantially similar to Category VI defendants. Accordingly, we find that the district court reasonably increased Adams\u2019 Criminal History Category from IV to VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record in this case, and we have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
