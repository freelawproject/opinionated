Wolf, Chief District Judge for the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts, Boston, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b663-17\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-18\">Marteen Moore appeals the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendants, its refusal to continue the summary judgment motion, its denial of her motions for reconsideration of the grant of summary judgment and its denial of her motion for Rule 11 sanctions. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-19\">Summary judgment was proper because Moore failed to establish a \u201cgenuine dispute as to any material fact\u201d regarding whether the defendants caused her harm. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). \u201c[Cjausation must be proven within a reasonable medical probability based upon competent expert testimony. Mere possibility alone is insufficient to establish a prima facie case.\u201d <em>Espinosa v. Little Co. of Mary Hosp., </em>31 Cal.App.4th 1304, 1315-16, 37 Cal.Rptr.2d 541(1995). Viewed in the light most favorable to Moore, the expert testimony before the district court when the summary judgment motion was decided at best established a possibility rather than a probability that the defendants were the cause of her injury. <em>See Neely </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number><em>v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>584 F.2d 341, 345-46 (9th Cir.1978) (\u201cIt is well-settled that proof must be sufficient to raise a reasonable inference that the act or omission complained of was in fact the proximate cause of injury.... That defendant\u2019s negligence could <em>possibly </em>have been the cause is not sufficient.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to continue the summary judgment motion because Moore failed to comply with the Rule 56(f) requirements. \u201c \u2018References in memoranda and declarations to a need for discovery do not qualify as motions under Rule 56(f),\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018[failure to comply with the requirements of Rule 56(f) is a proper ground for denying discovery and proceeding to summary judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>California v. Campbell, </em>138 F.3d 772, 779 (9th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Brae Transp., Inc. v. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, </em>790 F.2d 1439, 1443 (9th Cir. 1986)) (alteration in original). It was also not an abuse of discretion to deny Moore\u2019s motions for reconsideration of the summary judgment. Moore\u2019s \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d does not qualify as such because it could \u201chave been discovered through due diligence\u201d before the summary judgment motion was decided. <em>Jones v. Aero/Chem Corp., </em>921 F.2d 875, 878 (9th Cir.1990). Finally, the district court properly denied Moore\u2019s motion for sanctions. Moore violated the requirements for Rule 11 sanctions motions by filing the motion after summary judgment, and in any event the motion was meritless. <em>See Barber v. Miller, </em>146 F.3d 707, 711 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The district court\u2019s rulings are AFFIRMED. Moore\u2019s February 10, 2011 motion for reconsideration of this Court\u2019s February 4, 2011 denial of her motion to supplement the district court record is DENIED. All other pending motions are DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b663-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
