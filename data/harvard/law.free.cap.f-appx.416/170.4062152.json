Smith appeals that sentence, arguing that the District Court erred when it enhanced her base offense level under \u00a7 3B1.3 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines by two levels based on its conclusion that she abused a position of trust in the course of committing the offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-18\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b193-19\">Smith was employed as a bookkeeper and office manager for a car dealership, Clark Motor Company (\u201cCMC\u201d), where she was responsible for the daily administration of CMC\u2019s finances, including its \u201cfloor plan line of credit loan\u201d and business checking account. Smith used the former to finance the purchase of vehicles for resale; thus, to purchase new inventory, she would first obtain funds from the floor plan line of credit, and then transfer these funds to CMC\u2019s business checking account.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-20\">Between November 2005 and January 2007, Smith fraudulently drew from the floor plan line of credit about $9 million in advances for vehicles that CMC never purchased. She then re-submitted some of this money back to M &amp; T Bank, which administered the line of credit, in order to prevent detection of the scheme. However, Smith did not resubmit all of the money, and M &amp; T Bank ultimately incurred a loss of $1,580,173.50. Additionally, Smith wrote $59,452.37 in fraudulent checks to herself and to the consumer loan companies from which she and her husband had obtained personal auto loans. These funds were drawn on CMC\u2019s accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-21\">After Smith pled guilty, the probation office completed a presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) that recommended, in relevant part, that Smith\u2019s sentence be enhanced by two levels because she had abused a posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>tion of trust in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense. Smith objected to this portion of the PSR, and argued that it was not her bookkeeper position that enabled her to commit the fraud, but rather that her supervisors at CMC had failed to exercise appropriate oversight over her activities. The District Court rejected this argument, reasoning that, even if CMC \u201cplaced misguided trust in Smith,\u201d the position-of-trust enhancement was still appropriate because she accomplished the fraud in her role as bookkeeper.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Smith contends that, as a bookkeeper, she did not occupy a position of trust as contemplated by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review the District Court\u2019s conclusion to the contrary <em>de novo. United States v. Dullum, </em>560 F.3d 133, 140 (3d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">To determine whether a defendant is in a position of trust for sentence enhancement purposes, we consider \u201c(1) whether the position allows the defendant to commit a difficult-to-detect wrong; (2) the degree of authority which the position vests in the defendant vis-a-vis the object of the wrongful act; and (3) whether there has been reliance on the integrity of the person occupying the position.\u201d <em>United States v. Pardo, </em>25 F.3d 1187, 1192 (3d Cir.1994). Further, \u201c[tjhese factors should be considered in light of the guiding rationale of the section \u2014 to punish \u2018insiders\u2019 who abuse their positions rather than those who take advantage of an available opportunity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">On appeal, Smith makes two closely related arguments: first, that her fraud was not \u201cdifficult to detect,\u201d and thus the only reason it was not detected was her manager\u2019s inattention; and second, that she did not possess substantial discretion as to the administration of CMC\u2019s various accounts, nor did she owe CMC a fiduciary duty. They fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">First, it does not help Smith that her fraud was rendered \u201cdifficult to detect\u201d because she was not closely supervised. To the contrary, the relevant inquiry is neither whether the wrong was difficult to detect in any objective sense, nor whether a different employer would have found it easy to detect. Instead, it is whether the \u201creal scope\u201d of Smith\u2019s job \u2014 including the <em>de facto </em>level of supervision that she received \u2014 made it easy for her to conceal her fraudulent conduct. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>315 F.3d 190, 204 (3d Cir.2002) (health aide occupied position of trust visa-vis client because client \u201cdid not monitor Thomas closely and appeared to rely on her judgment and integrity\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Lofink, 564 </em>F.3d 232, 242 n. 20 (3d Cir.2009) (defendant was in a <em>\u201cde facto </em>position of trust\u201d because his employer delegated responsibility to him and did not scrutinize his decisions). Applying that standard, it is apparent that if Smith\u2019s supervisors largely left her to her own devices, that works against Smith\u2019s position, not in favor of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">Second, Smith argues that the position-of-trust enhancement does not apply to her because she \u201coccupied a purely ministerial position with [CMC] as opposed to a fiduciary position.\u201d However, our cases have never indicated that the position-of-trust enhancement applies only to fiduciaries. To the contrary, our cases state only that \u201cone has been placed in a position of trust when, by virtue of the authority conferred by the employer and the lack of controls <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>imposed on that authority, he is able to commit an offense that is not readily discoverable.\u201d <em>United States v. Craddock, </em>993 F.2d 338, 342 (3d Cir.1993) (teller responsible for paying out Western Union orders was in position of trust because crime exploited the fact that employer had delegated to tellers authority to verify identity of those requesting payouts). And, for the reasons outlined above, it is readily apparent here that CMC delegated to Smith the authority to obtain loans for vehicle purchases and to issue checks, and placed no external controls on that authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Accordingly, the District Court did not err in concluding that the abuse-of-position-of-trust enhancement applied to Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">For these reasons, we affirm the sentence imposed by the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b193-16\">. The District Court had subject matter jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b194-8\">. In relevant part, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3 states that \"[i]f the defendant abused a position of public or private trust ... in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense, increase by 2 levels.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
