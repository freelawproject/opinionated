We therefore affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b361-21\">A tan Lexus stopped near the front entrance to the First Bank &amp; Trust in Algi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>ers, Louisiana. Two men simultaneously-jumped out of the car. The driver, disguised with a stocking cap, walked into the bank first. He held out his arm in a shooting position and said, \u201cEverybody on the floor. This is a robbery.\u201d Though witnesses testified that the driver held something dark-colored in his hand, there was no evidence that the driver held a weapon. The passenger followed the driver to the door of the bank and attempted to enter, but it is unclear as to whether he actually entered the bank. The passenger carried an AK-47-type assault rifle. The off-duty police officer providing security for the bank fired his weapon toward the driver. From observing the driver\u2019s reaction to the shots, the officer believed that at least one bullet had hit the driver. Both men fled the bank on foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">The police located and arrested the passenger, Mark Johnson, in the neighborhood of the bank and recovered the rifle from him. After an investigation, the police identified Wix as the driver of the Lexus and obtained a warrant for his arrest. Upon learning of the warrant, Wix turned himself in to law enforcement officials. A law enforcement comparison of DNA in the blood left at the scene by the injured driver and a DNA sample from Wix, as well as a comparison of palm prints recovered from the bank\u2019s door and Wix\u2019s prints, supported the identification of Wix as the driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Following his arrest, the district court granted Wix\u2019s application for a psychiatric examination. A federal grand jury returned a three-count superseding indictment charging Wix with (1) one count of aiding and abetting in an attempted bank robbery, (2) one count of aiding and abetting in the use and carrying of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, and (3) one count of conspiracy to use and carry a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. The district court continued the trial while awaiting the results of the psychiatric evaluations.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">The district court then held a competency hearing, during which the court considered reports evaluating Wix\u2019s competency from a forensic psychologist, who submitted a report at the government\u2019s request, and from a psychiatrist at Tulane University, who submitted a report on Wix\u2019s behalf. The court also heard testimony from Wix himself. The court determined that Wix was competent to stand trial. After a two-day jury trial, Wix was convicted on all three counts in the superseding indictment. The district court later sentenced him to 95 months of imprisonment on the first and third counts, to run concurrently, and 84 months of imprisonment on the second count, to be served consecutive to the time for the first and third counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Wix timely appealed his convictions, claiming three errors by the district court. First, he argues that he was not competent to stand trial. Second, challenging his conviction on the second count of the indictment, he argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of aiding and abetting in the use and carrying of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. Third, he argues that the district court committed reversible error by incorrectly advising him about an evidentiary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">Wix argues that he was not competent to stand trial because he suffered from delusions, the most significant of which was that he believed he was Jesus Christ. The government argues that Wix exhibited both a rational and factual understanding of the proceedings against him. The government asserts that because he was also able to consult with his attorney with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>reasonable degree of rational certainty about the proceedings, the district court did not clearly err in finding him competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">A defendant is not competent to stand trial if he suffers from a \u201cmental disease or defect rendering him ... unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Conversely, a defendant is \u201ccompetent to stand trial if he has the present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding and has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceeding against him.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This court will not reverse the district court\u2019s competency determination \u201cunless it is \u2018clearly arbitrary or unwarranted\u2019 \u2014 a species of clear error review.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201c[TJhis mixed question of fact and law requires us to \u2018re-analyze the facts and take a hard look at the trial judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">We are guided by this court\u2019s analysis of a similar issue in <em>United States v. Doke. </em>In <em>Doke, </em>the district court found the defendant competent despite his supposed memory impairment and anecdotal evidence of memory deterioration, a failed suicide attempt, minor strokes, and an extended hospitalization after carbon monoxide poisoning.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The evidence also included testimony from a defense expert, who testified that the defendant had a significant memory impairment, and an expert for the government, who testified that while the defendant had some \u201cvariability in his memory functioning,\u201d most of his mental functions were reasonably intact.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cAfter a hard look at the facts,\u201d this court held that the district court\u2019s finding of competence was not \u201cclearly arbitrary and unwarranted.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-14\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b363-15\">The district court\u2019s finding that Wix was competent to stand trial was not clearly arbitrary or unwarranted. At the hearing, the district court considered evaluations of Wix\u2019s mental competency by two mental-health experts. One report was produced at the government\u2019s request by Dr. Lisa B. Feldman, a forensic staff psychologist at the Federal Detention Center in Miami. The second report, produced at Wix\u2019s request, was written by Dr. Sarah DeLand, a psychiatrist at Tulane University. Both experts concluded that Wix understood the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-16\">During the hearing, the district court noted other observations shared by both experts, including Wix\u2019s frequent expressions of religious thoughts and that he suffered from polysubstance abuse. The court also noted several differences between the reports, such as the following: (1) DeLand diagnosed Wix as having a psychotic disorder, whereas Feldman did not; and (2) Feldman concluded that Wix suffered from an antisocial disorder with schizotypal and narcissistic features, whereas DeLand deferred her opinion in that area of evaluation. The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>also noted that though the two experts seemed to have observed similar behaviors from Wix, and reached some of the same conclusions about him, their ultimate conclusions differed: Feldman concluded that Wix could \u201cassist his attorney in his own defense, if motivated to do so.\u201d DeLand, on the other hand, concluded that Wix\u2019s \u201cability to assist his attorney in any meaningful fashion is seriously compromised.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">The district court also heard testimony from Wix himself concerning his beliefs and his ability to assist his attorney. Wix stated that he understood the purpose of the competency hearing and his Fifth Amendment right not to testify during the hearing. Wix testified that he was capable of assisting his attorney at trial, despite some communication problems between them. Wix\u2019s attorney, on the other hand, stated that he did not think his client was capable of assisting him at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">On appeal, Wix argues that the district court clearly erred in its finding that his belief that he was Jesus Christ was a religious belief rather than a delusion, implying that a person who suffers from such a delusion is <em>per se </em>incompetent to stand trial. The evidence before the district court on this point was somewhat contradictory. DeLand reported that Wix \u201crelated to [her] that he reads the Bible as though he is Christ and then clarifies to say that he does believe he is Christ.\u201d He also \u201crelated [to DeLand] that he has known that he had a special relationship with God and, in fact, may be Christ since he got off drugs several years ago.\u201d The government\u2019s expert reported that Wix \u201cdescribed himself as a \u2018Christian,\u2019 and placed phonetic emphasis on \u2018Christ.\u2019 \u201d The report went on to state that Wix \u201cmaintains strong belief in Jesus and even stated that he believes that he is Jesus, in that he sacrifices himself for people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">During examination by his own attorney at the competency hearing, Wix explained why he thought he was Christ when he spoke with Dr. DeLand. Wix testified: \u201c[E]ver since I was young, I always wanted to be Jesus, and I always read the Bible as Jesus. As I started to read the Bible like that, I started to receive the revelation that Jesus means He is us, means human beings, means existence.\u201d During cross-examination, the government\u2019s attorney asked: \u201cYou are a child of Jesus Christ\u201d and \u201c[Y]ou are saying that because you are deeply religious and because you feel that you read the Bible and that you meditate, that once you make an appearance, your presence, your presence by itself, will change everything.\u201d Wix answered, \u201cExactly,\u201d to both questions. The government attorney also asked whether, if he, the attorney \u201cread[s] the Bible every day and if [he] truly accepted the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ as being the one and only Lord that [he] can have the same ability [to affect the atmosphere and other people] that\u201d Wix had. Wix responded, \u201cExactly,\u201d to this question, as well. On redirect examination, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Wix\u2019s Attorney: Mr. Wix, on cross-examination by Mr. Evans, it sounded to me as if you\u2019re agreeing with him that you\u2019re simply a strong Christian who is affecting the life of others; is that right?</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Wix: Exactly.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">Attorney: Does that mean that you are not Christ but Christ-like?</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">Wix: I do believe that I am Christ.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">After considering the evidence regarding Wix\u2019s alleged delusion, the district court concluded that Wix\u2019s beliefs, though some might consider them extreme, were not uncommon in some evangelical systems of belief. The district court also concluded that Wix\u2019s concerns about in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>mate or government agents trying to get information from him was logical. In addition, the court found that Wix wanted to assist and would assist his attorney and that he also trusted and would be truthful with his attorney. The court considered the differing expert opinions about whether Wix had the ability to consult with his lawyer and assist with his defense. After a thoughtful, thorough, commonsense consideration of all of the evidence, the district court concluded that Wix was competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Wix argues that the district court was persuaded by the prosecutor\u2019s convincing cross-examination of Wix to classify Wix\u2019s statements about being Christ as \u201cbeliefs\u201d rather than as delusions, and that this reliance and the resulting classification were improper. This argument is unavailing for two reasons. First, the district court had the discretion to credit or not credit any evidence introduced during the hearing \u2014 the court was not incorrect to credit Wix\u2019s responses to the prosecutor\u2019s questions. Second, Wix cites no authority for the proposition that some delusional thinking would make him <em>per se </em>incompetent, and the cases Wix cites are distinguishable from this one.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The finding of competency was not clearly arbitrary or unwarranted.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">Wix next argues that the evidence does not support his conviction for aiding and abetting in the use and carrying of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and thus that the district court erred when it denied his motion for acquittal on this count. There is no dispute that Wix preserved his claim for review by this court; we therefore review it de novo.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In reviewing a claim based on insufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction, we determine whether \u201c <em>\u2018any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> viewing the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the verdict.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The correct analysis is not as to guilt or innocence, but only whether the jury\u2019s de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>cision was rational.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">To convict a defendant for aiding and abetting under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, \u201cthe [government must prove (1) that the defendant associated with the criminal venture, (2) participated in the venture, and (3) sought by action to make the venture succeed.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In order to satisfy its burden of proof for aiding and abetting in the firearm charge, the prosecution must prove that \u201cthe defendant acted with the knowledge or specific intent of advancing the use of the firearm.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \u201c[T]here must also be proof that the defendant performed some affirmative act relating to the firearm\u201d \u2014 that is, \u201cthere must be evidence that the defendant took some action to facilitate or encourage the use or carrying of a firearm,\u201d not merely that the defendant facilitated or encouraged the underlying offense.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We must therefore determine whether there is evidence in the record to support the jury\u2019s determination that Wix took some affirmative action to facilitate or encourage Johnson\u2019s use of the AK-47-type assault rifle during the attempted bank robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The district court was correct in denying Wix\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal. A reasonable juror could infer that Wix acted with the knowledge and specific intent of advancing the use of the firearm by taking action to facilitate and encourage its use. Wix drove himself and Johnson, who carried the AK-47-type assault rifle, to the bank. Johnson was holding the firearm when he and Wix exited the vehicle simultaneously \u2014 Johnson did not have to retrieve the rifle from a separate compartment of the car after they exited. Witnesses testified that though part of the rifle was covered in some sort of wrapping, parts of it were clearly visible, and it was immediately identifiable as the men exited the car. Testimony at trial revealed that after Wix and Johnson exited the car at the same time, Wix reached the door to the bank only slightly ahead of Johnson. When Wix entered the building, he held out his arm as if he were holding a weapon, and exclaimed, \u201cEverybody on the floor. This is a robbery.\u201d His hand was covered with some sort of dark cloth. The robbery attempt was thwarted when the bank\u2019s security officer fired his gun in Wix\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">From this evidence, a rational juror could have found that Wix facilitated the use of the rifle by knowingly transporting it to the bank for use in the robbery. The jury could also have reasonably inferred that Wix\u2019s entrance and announcement were intended to facilitate Johnson\u2019s entrance into the bank with the rifle, which both men intended would be used in the robbery. We conclude that a rational juror could have found that the government had proved all elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The district court did not err in denying Wix\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b366-13\">Finally, Wix argues that the district court erroneously stated the breadth of the federal reciprocal discovery rules and the consequences of arranging for an indepen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>dent comparison of the DNA found at the crime scene with his own DNA. The government responds that there was no error and that Wix\u2019s claim fails under the plain error standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Because Wix failed to object to the error before the district court, we review the proceedings for plain error.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Under this standard, reversal is appropriate only if \u201c(1) there was error, (2) the error was clear and obvious, and (3) the error affected [the defendant\u2019s] substantial rights.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We exercise our discretion to reverse only if all three factors are met and if the \u201cerror seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Wix\u2019s claim arises from an exchange during a pretrial hearing on a motion for continuance. The district court had granted defense counsel\u2019s motion for the appointment of an expert to examine the DNA evidence found at the scene of the attempted bank robbery. Wix opposed continuing the trial, a position which would have precluded the preparation of the defense expert\u2019s report for trial. The government filed a motion for continuance so that the defense expert could finish the DNA analysis before trial. During the hearing, the court advised Wix that he had a right to have his expert either look at the government\u2019s DNA analysis protocols and prepare a report evaluating their validity, or perform a second comparison between the DNA evidence found at the scene and Wix\u2019s DNA, or both. Wix expressed concerns that the analysis performed by his expert would be given to the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">The district court undertook to explain the federal criminal proceeding reciprocal discovery rule to Wix; though the court did not name it specifically, it is clear that the court was referring to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(b). Rule 16(b) requires the defendant to disclose, at the government\u2019s request, documents, objects, and reports of examinations and tests if the defendant made a similar disclosure request of the government, the item is within the defendant\u2019s custody, or control, and the defendant intends to use the item in the defendant\u2019s case-in-chief at trial.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In addition, the defendant must disclose a report of an examination or test in his possession, custody, or control, if the defendant intends to call the expert witness who prepared the report and the report relates to the witness\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Wix contends that the district court erroneously advised him that the reciprocal discovery requirements were broader than those required by the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-13\">The court explained the following to Wix:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-14\">If you elect to give your DNA sample to your expert and your expert comes to the same or similar conclusion as the government\u2019s DNA expert then, yes, that could be used against you.... Just like you\u2019re entitled to get from their expert their conclusions on DNA, they\u2019re entitled to get from your expert\u2019s conclusion on DNA testing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-15\">You have a possibility, which is your right, you have a possibility that you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>would just use a DNA expert to see whether or not the government\u2019s procedures were proper and correct without taking a sample from you. But even then if they decided that, your expert decides that, yes, the government\u2019s procedures and analysis complies with the standards for testing DNA, then that is evidence that again the government would be entitled to receive and could be used against you at trial. Same side of the coin, if the DNA expert hired from your side says that, no, the government\u2019s evidence is faulty, it was improperly obtained or analyzed under the standards, then that\u2019s beneficial to you and that comes out at trial, they\u2019re entitled to that as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the explanations by the district court of the reciprocal discovery rule constituted clear and obvious error, any such error did not affect Wix\u2019s substantial rights: at the end of the hearing, Wix agreed to continue the trial so that the appointed defense expert could analyze the government\u2019s DNA analysis protocols, and then, if necessary, perform an independent comparison of the crime scene DNA to Wix\u2019s DNA. The court\u2019s explanation, if erroneous, did not discourage Wix from seeking the expert\u2019s analysis. Wix claims on appeal that an independent DNA analysis was never performed. The record suggests otherwise. But even if this assertion is correct, it does not change the fact that, at the end of the hearing in which the statements about discovery were made, the district court granted the defense\u2019s motion to appoint an expert and Wix agreed to the trial continuance so that the analysis could be performed. Wix did, in fact, consult a DNA expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the district court did not commit plain error in its explanation of the reciprocal discovery rule; Wix is not entitled to a new trial on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
