The plan requires both \u201ctotal\u201d and \u201cpermanent\u201d disability; that is, in order for Kondratowicz to qualify, she must suffer from a disability that permanently prevents her from being able to perform any job at Northwest. None of the five medical experts who assessed Kondratowicz found her to meet both requirements. Accordingly, the decision to deny her benefits was proper. We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Northwest.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">Kondratowicz, a former customer-service agent for Northwest, is a participant in the Northwest Airlines Pension Plan for Contract Employees, which Northwest administers. After she stopped working for Northwest, she filed an application for disability retirement benefits; her stated bases for her disability were mental disorder, depression, anxiety, stress, chronic neck and back pain, and a bulging disc. The plan defines \u201cdisability\u201d as the \u201ctotal and permanent disability which renders the Participant incapable of any employment with [Northwest].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-13\">Northwest forwarded Kondratowicz\u2019s application to America\u2019s IME, a company that assists Northwest with processing disability benefits. Dr. Thomas Gratzer, a practicing psychiatrist, reviewed Kondratowicz\u2019s medical records but did not examine her in person. Dr. Gratzer issued a report concluding that Kondratowicz\u2019s psychiatric condition did not cause her to be either totally or permanently disabled. After reviewing both Dr. Gratzer\u2019s report and Kondratowicz\u2019s claim, Northwest denied Kondratowicz\u2019s application for disability retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-14\">Kondratowicz instituted an administrative appeal. America\u2019s IME gave Kondratowicz and Northwest the resumes of three physicians and two psychologists so that they could select one physician to assess Kondratowicz\u2019s claim of physical disability and one psychologist to assess her claim of psychological disability. Dr. Joseph Salama, whom the parties selected as the physician, personally examined Kondratowicz and reviewed 167 pages of her medical history. Dr. Salama concluded that Kondratowicz was neither totally nor permanently disabled, and that she could per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>form a job \u201cthat requires no excessive bending or twisting, and no lifting more than 30 pounds repetitively.\u201d For the psychologist, the parties chose Dr. Kenneth Podell. Dr. Podell personally examined Kondratowiez and issued a twelve-page report. Although Dr. Podell concluded that Kondratowiez was <em>totally </em>disabled \u2014 her \u201cstress and anxiety at work\u201d would prevent her \u201cfrom any type of gainful employment with Northwest\u201d \u2014 Dr. Podell also concluded that Kondratowiez was not <em>permanently </em>disabled. \u201c[W]ith the appropriate treatment,\u201d Dr. Podell opined, \u201cshe will be able to return to gainful employment.\u201d Northwest received both Dr. Salama\u2019s and Dr. Podell\u2019s reports, which effectively denied Kondratowicz\u2019s application for disability retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Kondratowiez filed suit in federal district court. She argued that the records of her own two treating physicians, who examined her before she applied for disability benefits, demonstrated her total and permanent disability. One of those treating physicians was Dr. Linda Balogh, who diagnosed Kondratowiez with anxiety, chronic neck pain, and tension headaches, among other things. Dr. Balogh prescribed several medications and gave Kondratowicz a note for work suggesting that she lift nothing heavier than twenty-five pounds. Kondratowicz\u2019s other treating physician, Dr. William Penn, reported that the MRI of Kondratowicz\u2019s spine supported her complaints of pain in her neck and lower back. Dr. Penn opined that \u201cMs. Kondratowiez remains disabled\u201d and that \u201c[her] prognosis for the future appears guarded at best.\u201d But his only specific recommendation was that Kondratowicz \u201cshould not be returned to her previous employment wherein she was required to lift up to 70 pounds of freight and baggage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Northwest moved for summary judgment, which the district court granted after the magistrate judge so recommended. Kondratowiez now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">The ERISA laws permit a plan participant to bring a civil action \u201cto recover benefits due to [her] under the terms of the plan.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). For Kondratowiez to be entitled to disability retirement benefits under her plan, she must satisfy her plan\u2019s definition of \u201cdisability\u201d \u2014 that is, \u201ctotal and permanent disability which renders [her] incapable of any employment with [Northwest].\u201d Accordingly, in order for Kondratowiez to survive summary judgment, there must be a genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether Kondratowiez is both totally and permanently disabled. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">No such genuine dispute exists in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As Kondratowiez conceded at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>oral argument, none of the five medical experts in the record opined that Kondratowicz was both totally and permanently disabled. Both Dr. Gratzer and Dr. Salama expressly concluded that Kondratowicz was neither totally nor permanently disabled. Dr. Podell concluded that Kondratowicz\u2019s stress and anxiety rendered her totally disabled, but he expressly opined that her disability was treatable rather than permanent. Dr. Balogh did not opine as to whether Kondratowicz was totally or permanently disabled, but Dr. Balogh concluded that Kondratowicz could perform any jobs that did not require lifting more than twenty-five pounds. Similarly, although Dr. Penn stated without elaboration that Kondratowicz \u201cremain[ed] disabled,\u201d his one recommendation was that Kondratowicz should not lift more than seventy pounds. Assuming that Northwest has many jobs that do not require heavy lifting, Dr. Balogh\u2019s and Dr. Penn\u2019s opinions imply that Kondratowicz\u2019s disability was not total.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Kondratowicz makes much of the fact that Dr. Salama only opined on her health as of June 15, 2006, the date on which he examined her, rather than July 24, 2003, the date on which she had to be disabled to recover under the plan. Dr. Salama\u2019s refusal to project his opinion backward in time, Kondratowicz argues, prevents his opinion from being \u201cfinal and conclusive.\u201d However, if Dr. Salama believed that Kondratowicz was not permanently disabled in June 2006, then he could not have believed that Kondratowicz was permanently disabled at any time earlier, including in July 2003. Dr. Salama\u2019s opinion on the permanency of Kondratowicz\u2019s condition is no less conclusive because he opined on Kondratowicz\u2019s health as of June 2006 rather than as of July 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Relatedly, Kondratowicz contends that a series of emails between Christina Wolf (the plan administrator) and Sherry Stimson (a representative of America\u2019s IME) indicates that the plan administrator \u201cbreached her duty owed to [Kondratowicz] to protect [Kondratowicz\u2019s] rights under the plan.\u201d In these emails, Ms. Wolf requested that Dr. Salama complete an addendum opining on Kondratowicz\u2019s health as of July 2003. A review of the emails makes clear that no impropriety or breach of duty occurred. By requesting Dr. Salama to opine on Kondratowicz\u2019s health as of the relevant date under the plan, Ms. Wolf was acting to protect Kondratowicz\u2019s interests, not to breach the duty she owed to them. Moreover, there is no indication in the record that Ms. Wolf, or any other Northwest employee, attempted to improperly influence the administrative appeals process.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">In a final effort, Kondratowicz argues that the plan requires the medical expert for administrative appeals to be a \u201cdoctor of medicine,\u201d and that Dr. Podell (one of the two medical experts who reviewed Kondratowicz for her administrative appeal) was a Ph.D. psychologist rather than a physician. Assuming that the plan indeed contemplated a physician rather than anyone with a doctoral degree in a medical field, any technical error here was de minimis. The administrative appeal provided Kondratowicz with two medical experts: a physician to assess her physical pains, and a psychologist to assess her psychological ones. So Kondratowicz was reviewed by one physician during the administrative appeal. Moreover, Kondratowicz agreed to be examined by Dr. Podell, the psychologist, despite full knowledge of his credentials at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">In conclusion, none of the five medical experts in the record found Kondratowicz to be totally and permanently disabled, as she must be in order to recover under her plan. There is no genuine dispute of material fact on an essential element of her case, so Northwest is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. This result obtains regardless of the proper standard of review for the administrative decision to deny benefits or any de minimis flaws that may have occurred during the administrative process. We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for Northwest Airlines.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-6\">. Kondratowicz\u2019s appeal fails under any standard of review, so we need not decide what degree of deference is due where, as here, the administrative benefits determination was made by independent medical experts to whom binding decisionmaking authority was delegated from the plan administrator under the plan, rather than by the plan administrator itself. <em>Compare Moos v. Square D Co., </em>72 F.3d 39, 41 (6th Cir.1995) (holding that the benefits decision made by an ERISA plan administrator must be reviewed under the arbitrary-and-capricious standard when the plan expressly grants the plan administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits), <em>and Solomon v. Med. Mut. of Ohio, </em>No. 09-4152, 2011 WL 13907, at *3 (6th Cir. Jan.4, 2011) (unpublished opinion) (same, even when an independent medical expert\u2019s opinion is an integral component of the benefits determination, so long as the plan\u2019s procedures permit the opinion and the plan retains final decisionmaking authority), <em>with Shelby Cnty. Health Care Corp. v. Majestic Star Casino, </em>581 F.3d 355, 365 (6th Cir. 2009) (holding that a benefits decision made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>by an unauthorized third party must be reviewed de novo).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
