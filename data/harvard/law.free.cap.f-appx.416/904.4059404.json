(RCN) Television\u2019s appeal from the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) as premature and moves for sanctions. RCN Television moves for an extension of time to file its opposition, and opposes. RCN Telecom replies.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">RCN Television appeals the TTAB\u2019s August 26, 2010 decision that, inter alia, dismissed claims to cancel eighteen registered trademarks of RCN Telecom due to allegations of fraud. The Board has not disposed of the portion of RCN Television\u2019s petition for cancellation that asserts fifteen of those trademarks should be canceled pursuant to Section 2(d) of the Lanham Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">RCN Telecom contends that the August 26, 2010 decision is not a final, appealable decision pursuant to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Copelands\u2019 Enter., Inc. v. CNV, Inc., </em>887 F.2d 1065 (Fed.Cir.1989) (en banc). We agree. In <em>Copelands, </em>this court held that it would review decisions of the TTAB only if the decision \u201cput an end to the litigation before the Board.\u201d 887 F.2d at 1068. Thus, a party dissatisfied with a TTAB determination \u201cmust await and raise all claims of error in a single appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because RCN Television prematurely seeks to appeal from a TTAB decision that does not put an end to the litigation before the Board, we grant RCN Telecom\u2019s motion. RCN Telecom may appeal these issues after the Board rules on all claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">It Is Ordered That:</p>\n<p id=\"b927-11\">(1) RCN Television\u2019s motion for an extension of time is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-12\">(2) RCN Telecom\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-13\">(3) RCN Telecom\u2019s motion for sanctions is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-14\">(4) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
