Norman appeals his sentence as being procedurally unreasonable. Specifically, he claims the district court failed to address his request that he serve a term of imprisonment that partially \u201csubstitutes community confinement or home detention\u201d for imprisonment, as United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d or \u201cGuidelines\u201d) \u00a7 5Cl.l(d)(2) (2009) permits. For the reasons below, we DIS<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>MISS Norman\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In September 2005, Norman went to the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s office in the Northern District of Ohio and fraudulently represented that he was a displaced refugee from New Orleans, Louisiana due to Hurricane Katrina. As a result, he procured $2,000 in emergency aid. In January 2010, the government charged Norman with theft of government property in excess of $1,000, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641, and aiding and abetting such theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 642. After a change-of-plea hearing and under a written plea agreement, Norman pled guilty to a violation of only \u00a7 641. In the plea, Norman agreed not to appeal except in certain limited circumstances. At sentencing, the district court calculated Norman to be in Criminal History Category V, Offense Level 6, which placed him in Zone C of the Guidelines with a range of nine to fifteen months of imprisonment. The district court sentenced Norman to twelve months\u2019 imprisonment. Norman timely appealed his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">We determine de novo whether a defendant has waived his right to appeal his sentence through a plea agreement. <em>United States v. Swanberg, </em>370 F.3d 622, 626 (6th Cir.2004). Such a waiver is valid so long as it is knowing and voluntary. <em>Id. </em>at 625. In <em>Swanberg, </em>we found an appellate waiver in a plea agreement to be knowing and voluntary when the defendant acknowledged the waiver\u2019s existence during the plea colloquy, and the district court expressly found the plea to be knowing. <em>Id. </em>at 626. This was so notwithstanding the district court\u2019s erroneous statement during sentencing that the defendant \u201cha[d] a right of appeal from the sentence in this matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">Here, Norman\u2019s waiver was even more clearly knowingly and voluntarily made than in <em>Swanberg. </em>Norman\u2019s plea agreement prominently contained a section called \u201cWaiver of Appeal and Post-Conviction Attack,\u201d which stated that Norman \u201cacknowledges having been advised by counsel of [his] rights, in limited circumstances, to appeal the conviction or sentence ... [and] expressly waives those rights.\u201d (Plea Agreement, Dist. Ct. Docket No. 20, at 6.) During the plea colloquy, Norman confirmed that his counsel had gone over the plea agreement with him, and that he had read and understood it. (Change of Plea Hr\u2019g Tr., Dist. Ct. Docket No. 29, at 6-7.) Moreover, the district court ensured that Norman understood the appellate waiver in particular. The court told Norman: \u201cIn this case, there\u2019s an agreement between yourself and the government that you will waive your right to appeal from your conviction or your sentence in this case.... You\u2019re giving up all of your rights to either appeal or challenge, through some other legal action, called post-conviction proceedings.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 16.) Norman then stated he understood and had no questions. <em>(Id. </em>at 17.) Finally, the district court explicitly found Norman\u2019s plea to be knowing and voluntary. <em>(Id. </em>at 24.) The plea agreement\u2019s language and the transcript of the change-of-plea hearing thus confirm that Norman\u2019s appellate waiver was knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">Our inquiry does not end there, however, because Norman\u2019s appellate waiver contained four exceptions: (1) \u201cany punishment in excess of the statutory maximum\u201d; (2) \u201cany sentence to the extent it exceeds the greater of any statutory mandatory minimum sentence or the maximum of the sentencing range determined under the advisory Sentencing Guidelines in accor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>dance with the stipulations and computations in this Agreement, using the Criminal History found applicable by the Court\u201d; and claims based on (3) ineffective assistance of counsel or (4) prosecutorial misconduct. (Plea Agreement, Dist. Ct. Docket No. 20, at 6-7.) The district court thoroughly explained these exceptions to Norman at the plea colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\">If for some reason, I don\u2019t imagine it happening here, if I were to impose any sentence in excess of the maximum, ten years, obviously, you have a right to appeal that sentence, number one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">Number two, if I impose a sentence greater than the advisory guideline range that\u2019s computed, if it comes out that the sentence is 9 to 12 months, what have you, whatever the guideline range might be, if I impose a sentence above that guideline range, that properly calculated guideline range by 9 to 12 months, by way of example, then you would have a right to appeal that sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">And then lastly, you would have a right to appeal two other matters that would be if it was later shown that the government\u2019s attorneys engaged in some misconduct in this matter, or if your attorney didn\u2019t represent you appropriately, then those are matters that might be subject to appeal as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">(Change of Plea Hr\u2019g Tr., Dist. Ct. Docket No. 29, at 16-17.) Norman then acknowledged that he understood and did not have any questions. <em>(Id. </em>at 17.) In so doing, Norman demonstrated that he understood the waiver\u2019s exceptions as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">Norman here claims that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not consider substituting community confinement or home detention for imprisonment, as U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Cl.l(d)(2) (2009) permits because his Guidelines range is in Zone C of the sentencing table. This procedural-reasonableness challenge does not fall under any of the exceptions to Norman\u2019s appellate waiver. His sentence of one year was less than the statutory maximum of ten years. His sentence fell squarely in the middle of the Guidelines range, and there was no mandatory minimum. Lastly, Norman is not alleging ineffective assistance of counsel or prosecutorial misconduct. Norman\u2019s appeal is therefore barred by his appellate waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we DISMISS Norman\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
