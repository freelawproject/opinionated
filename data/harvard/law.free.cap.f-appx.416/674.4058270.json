Pryce\u2019s subsequent \u00a7 2255 motion constitutes a \u201csecond or successive\u201d motion because (1) his initial \u00a7 2255 motion was dismissed with prejudice and he failed to pursue his appeal of that dismissal, and (2) his subsequent \u00a7 2255 motion in the same matter asserts \u201cclaims that were or could have been adjudicated on the merits.\u201d <em>McNabb v. Yates, </em>576 F.3d 1028, 1029 (9th Cir.2009) (per curiam) (citing <em>Woods v. Carey, </em>525 F.3d 886, 888 (9th Cir.2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">Because Pryce failed to obtain the requisite authorization from \u201ca panel of the ... court of appeals\u201d under \u00a7 2255(h), the district court \u201cnever had jurisdiction to consider [Pryce\u2019s second or successive petition] in the first place.\u201d <em>Burton v.
