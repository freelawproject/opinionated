The district court dismissed his petition because Santivanez could not show that the savings clause in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) applied so that he could file under \u00a7 2241. On appeal, Santivanez argues that: (1) because jurisdiction was allegedly lacking in the court where he was convicted, he is \u201cactually innocent\u201d and can therefore raise his claims under \u00a7 2241, despite having previously filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, and (2) his challenge centers on the \u201cmeans\u201d of his conviction because, if he is actually innocent, then his imprisonment violates the Constitution and laws of the United States. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-14\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents questions of law that we review <em>de novo. Dohrmann v. United States, </em>442 F.3d 1279, 1280 (11th Cir.2006). In reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2241 habeas petition, we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and questions of law <em>de novo. Coloma v. Holder, </em>445 F.3d 1282, 1284 (11th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-15\">In general, a \u00a7 2255 motion will be a federal prisoner\u2019s \u201cprimary method of collateral attack\u201d on his conviction and sentence after that conviction has become final. <em>McGhee v. Hanberry, </em>604 F.2d 9, 10 (5th Cir.1979).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A \u00a7 2241 petition \u201cis not a substitute for a motion under \u00a7 2255____\u201d <em>Id. </em>Only on rare occasions will a federal prisoner be able to attack his conviction and sentence through \u00a7 2241 as opposed to \u00a7 2255. This is so because the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-18\"><em>An application for a writ of habeas corpus </em>in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, <em>shall not be entertained </em>if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, <em>unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-19\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) (emphases added). Thus, a \u00a7 2241 petition attacking custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence may only be entertained if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided by \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1245 (11th Cir.1999). However, the remedy under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>\u00a7 2255 will only be found to be inadequate of ineffective if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-5\">1) [the] claim is based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; 2) the holding of that Supreme Court decision establishes the petitioner was convicted for a nonexistent offense; and, 8) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASk\"><em>Id. </em>at 1244. Accordingly, a petitioner may not avoid the savings clause merely because he \u201chas filed and been denied a previous \u00a7 2255 motion....\u201d <em>Darby v. </em>Hawk-Sawyer; 405 F.3d 942, 945 (11th Cir.2005). Moreover, when a prisoner files a \u00a7 2241 petition, the prisoner bears burden of coming forward with evidence affirmatively showing the inadequacy of ineffectiveness of the \u00a7 2255 remedy. <em>McGhee, </em>604 F.2d at 10. Finally, a petitioner may not argue actual innocence until he has \u201copen[ed] the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding by demonstrating that the savings clause applies to his claim. <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Here, the district court correctly determined that Santivanez failed to demonstrate that the savings clause in \u00a7 2255(e) applied such that he could raise claims attacking his conviction pursuant to \u00a7 2241. Santivanez had previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, and he failed to demonstrate that the remedy provided by \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or ineffective. To the extent that Santivanez attempts to argue actual innocence, he cannot do so because he did not \u201copen the portal\u201d by demonstrating that \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause applied. <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244 n. 3. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b856-10\">. In <em>Bonner v.
