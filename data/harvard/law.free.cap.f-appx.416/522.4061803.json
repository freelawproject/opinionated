For the reasons set forth below, the petition for review is DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b545-14\">Petitioner is a native and citizen of Guatemala who entered the United States without inspection in 1995. Nearly a decade later, on March 29, 2005, Petitioner filed an asylum application based on his claimed membership in a particular social group. This application was referred to the immigration court, and on September 6, 2005, immigration proceedings commenced against Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-15\">During these proceedings, Petitioner conceded removability, but renewed his application for asylum and sought withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture, arguing past and future persecution as a \u201cMayan Indian\u201d based on race, nationality, membership in a particular social group, and political opinion. Petitioner argued that the Guatemalan government persecutes Mayan Indians as leftists, while the guerillas persecute Mayan Indians as pro-government. Petitioner further asserted that he feared returning to Guatemala because he had previously rejected an invitation \u201cto be part of a guerilla group or of a gang.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-16\">On November 13, 2007, during the pendency of these proceedings, Petitioner filed a new asylum application, in which he stated that men who he \u201cbelieved to be guerillas\u201d killed his father in 1987 when Petitioner was seven years old. After the killing, Petitioner\u2019s mother placed him and his siblings on a bus that transported them to a new city, where they lived for seven years. When Petitioner returned home in 1995, \u201canother group of armed men attacked our village, wanting to kill us.\u201d These men \u201c[m]aybe wanted our land or our home and wanted to finish us all off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-17\">In support of his request to remain in the United States, Petitioner submitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>two letters from individuals in Ohio as well as a letter from Sister Honora Felix, a nun who had lived in Guatemala, which stated that \u201cviolent repression of the residents\u201d of Petitioner\u2019s native state had occurred, and most of the victims were \u201cMayan Indian.\u201d At a hearing before the immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), counsel for Petitioner admitted that the nun \u201chad never spoke to Mr. Ixcoy at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">During the removal hearing before the IJ, Petitioner testified that his father was \u201ckilled by the guerrillas,\u201d although Petitioner admitted that he \u201cdo[es]n\u2019t know why they came and killed [his] father.\u201d Petitioner was asleep during the murder and did not see the perpetrators. When asked whether his father was a member of the civil guard, Petitioner responded, \u201cI say no, but I don\u2019t know exactly, because I was still very young in that time.\u201d Even if his father was a member of the civil guard, Petitioner testified that he did not know whether this would have been a reason for the guerillas to kill him.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">After the murder of his father, Petitioner\u2019s mother sent Petitioner and his siblings on a bus \u201cand said just go.\u201d The children ended up in the city of Huehuetenango, where they lived with a woman named Margarita. Petitioner recalls hearing during that time that \u201cpeople were killed,\u201d but remarked, \u201cfortunately nothing happened to us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">After seven years in Huehuetenango, Petitioner and his siblings returned home. Petitioner recalled that the \u201csame day we arrived [home,] a group of men came over and I don\u2019t know if they just want to harm us or they want to take our house away from us or I don\u2019t know.\u201d When asked for the identity of this group \u2014 \u201cWere they army?\u201d; \u201cWere they guerilla?\u201d; \u201cWho were these people?\u201d \u2014 Petitioner responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know.... These people, I don\u2019t know if they have power to do anything. ...\u201d Petitioner testified that he did not see these men talk to his mother, nor did the men \u201cdo anything to us,\u201d but Petitioner \u201csaw they were there so we didn\u2019t even talk to them. We had to leave.... We run because of our lives. We didn\u2019t want to be killed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Petitioner further testified that he is \u201cafraid to go back because there\u2019s still groups in the area that may harm.\u201d When asked about his knowledge about the current situation in Guatemala, Petitioner testified that he \u201ctalked to [his] mother about two months ago,\u201d noting that he does not talk to her very often because she does not have a telephone. His mother reported to him that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of death that is happening here.\u201d When asked about these deaths, Petitioner stated: \u201cThere\u2019s these people \u2014 I don\u2019t know if that they have powers to take over the places do they have powers to take our their people\u2019s properties, houses. I don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">He further testified that his mother warned him that people, including neighbors, were being killed, and as a result, he is \u201cafraid to go back.\u201d This is because Petitioner believes he \u201ccan be tortured or ... harmed. I don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t want to go back to Guatemala. Things can happen to me.\u201d Petitioner further explained that he fears that he will be harmed because \u201cits not so sure in Guatemala now. There\u2019s a lot of insecurities and I\u2019m afraid that anything can happen to me since my village \u2014 in my village there\u2019s no police or anything like that.\u201d For this reason, Petitioner agreed that he \u201ccould not\u201d take his children back to Guatemala.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">The IJ found that Petitioner \u201cfailfed] to establish that he has suffered past persecution on account of any protected ground.\u201d Although acknowledging that the killing of Petitioner\u2019s father was \u201ccompletely reprehensible,\u201d the IJ reasoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>that it \u201cdoes not appear directed at [Petitioner] and/or the members of [his] family other than his father.\u201d The IJ noted that Petitioner did not know the reason for his father\u2019s killing. With regard to the evidence that Petitioner fled perceived threats in his home village in 1995, the IJ dismissed Petitioner\u2019s fear of harm as only \u201csubjective.\u201d Petitioner \u201cdid not know who the men he feared were or why they were after him [and] the men never spoke to him or threatened him directly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">With regard to the probability of future persecution, the IJ found that the record, including the Affidavit of Sister Felix, \u201cshows persisten[t,] ingrained discrimination and bias against indigenous peoples, including Mayans, in Guatemala.\u201d But the IJ found that this evidence \u201cfalls short\u201d of the requisite probability of persecution, noting that Petitioner\u2019s fear of \u201cgeneral gang violence\u201d is an insufficient basis upon which to grant relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The BIA affirmed. With regard to past persecution, the BIA found that even if guerillas killed his father, Petitioner \u201ccannot rely solely on the persecution of family members to qualify for withholding of removal.\u201d (BIA at 2 (citing <em>Akhtar v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 399, 406 (6th Cir.2005).) The BIA further reasoned that Petitioner failed to show that the guerillas harmed his father \u201cto inflict harm on [Petitioner], nor does the evidence reflect that [Petitioner] himself was actually attacked or even verbally threatened before he left Guatemala.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Ali v. Ashcroft, </em>366 F.3d 407, 410 (6th Cir.2004), for the proposition that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept\u201d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">With regard to future persecution, the BIA found that Petitioner feared \u201cgeneralized crime and violence in Guatemala, rather than ... persecution on account of a protected ground.\u201d The BIA further reasoned that Petitioner \u201chas not presented evidence of any specific threats made against him\u201d on any protected ground since leaving Guatemala.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">Petitioner advances numerous arguments in his petition for review: first, that the BIA erred in denying his application for asylum as untimely; second, that procedural defects in the proceedings below require remand; and third, that he is entitled to withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act and/or protection under the Convention Against Torture. After setting forth the standard of review, we consider each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">Where, as here, the BIA affirms the decision of the IJ, but adds additional comments, we review the decisions of both adjudicative bodies. <em>See Gilaj v. Gonzales, </em>408 F.3d 275, 283 (6th Cir.2005). The Court reviews questions of law <em>de novo, </em>with substantial deference given to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which \u201cwill be upheld unless the interpretation is arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\u201d <em>Morgan v. Keisler, </em>507 F.3d 1053, 1057 (6th Cir.2007). The Court reviews agency findings of fact under the substantial evidence standard, which requires that factual findings be supported by \u201creasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Ramaj v. Gonzales, </em>466 F.3d 520, 527 (6th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">II. Denial of Petitioner\u2019s Application for Asylum</p>\n<p id=\"b547-14\">We begin with Petitioner\u2019s argument that the BIA erred in denying his application for asylum as untimely. An alien seeking asylum must file such an applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>tion \u201cwithin 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). Failure to do so may only be excused if the alien demonstrates either \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d affecting eligibility or \u201cextraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Here, it is undisputed that Petitioner failed to file his asylum application within one year of his arrival in the United States. Petitioner arrived in the United States in 1995, at the age of 15, but did not file an application for asylum until 2005, at the age of 25. Although Petitioner provided reasons for his delay \u2014 age, education, and language \u2014 both the IJ and the BIA nonetheless found that Petitioner failed to show \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d to excuse his delay given the approximately 10 years that elapsed between Petitioner\u2019s arrival and his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">On appeal, Petitioner \u201ccontends] that the facts of his childhood and entry into the USA at a young age fall within the orbit of [ ] extraordinary circumstances.\u201d The BIA rejected this argument, and we lack jurisdiction to revisit that decision. Although this Court may review constitutional challenges to the procedures below, the Court \u201cdoes not have jurisdiction to review claims ... that raise discretionary or factual questions.\u201d <em>El-Moussa v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 250, 255 (6th Cir.2009). Because Petitioner challenges only the factual predicate to the timeliness determination below, this Court is without power to review. <em>See, e.g., </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D); <em>Thiam v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>407 Fed.Appx. 873, 876-77 (6th Cir.2010); <em>Abudaya v. Holder, </em>393 Fed.Appx. 275 (6th Cir.2010); <em>Elr-Moussa, </em>569 F.3d at 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Accordingly, this portion of the petition for review is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">III. Claimed Procedural Errors Below</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">Petitioner raises two assignments of error relating to the procedures below. First, Petitioner objects to a pre-hearing colloquy between counsel and the IJ, in which the IJ sought to identify and clarify the issues. Although Petitioner did not object below, he now argues that the \u201cdiscussion was inappropriate because the testimony regarding [Petitioner\u2019s] claims should have been elicited directly from [Petitioner] rather than through counsel.\u201d Second, Petitioner objects to the IJ\u2019s decision to allow into evidence a letter by Sister Felix but not require her testimony. Because Petitioner believes the IJ placed insufficient evidentiary weight on the letter, Petitioner in retrospect would have sought the live testimony of Sister Felix, which Petitioner believes would have \u201cproven\u201d his \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution were he to be returned to Guatemala.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">Because Petitioner makes these arguments in a \u201cperfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,\u201d we deem them to be waived. <em>See United States v. Sandridge, </em>385 F.3d 1032, 1035-36 (6th Cir.2004). The most basic deficiency in Petitioner\u2019s argument is its failure to identify the legal basis for his assignments of error. In fact, the relevant section of Petitioner\u2019s brief is devoid of any legal authority at all, and gives only cursory treatment to the issues.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number><em>Moore v. LaFayette Life Ins. Co., </em>458 F.3d 416, 448 (6th Cir.2006) (noting that appellate courts are not \u201cself-directed boards of legal inquiry and research, but essentially arbiters of legal questions presented and argued by the parties.\u201d) (internal citations omitted); <em>see also Soumare v. Holder, </em>343 Fed.Appx. 75, 83 (6th Cir.2009) (finding waiver where a due process argument was raised \u201cwithout any citation or development of argument\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Accordingly, this portion of the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">IV. Denial of Withholding of Removal Under the Immigration and Nationality Act and/or Protection Under the Convention Against Torture</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">We next turn to Petitioner\u2019s claim that the BIA erred in denying his request for withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act and/or protection under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">A. Denial of Withholding of Removal Under the Immigration and Nationality Act</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">An alien may request withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3), which prevents the removal of an alien to a country in which \u201cthe alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened ... because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). To obtain withholding of removal, the alien must demonstrate a clear probability that he would face persecution in the country of removal on account of a protected grounds. <em>See Mikhailevitch v. I.N.S., </em>146 F.3d 384, 391 (6th Cir.1998). Future persecution may be presumed if the alien establishes past persecution. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(1)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">Here, the immigration courts below found that Petitioner failed to show past persecution or a probability of future persecution. On appeal, Petitioner argues that these findings were not supported by substantial evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-13\">We begin with past persecution. Petitioner argues that he established past persecution by the following record evidence that he cites in his brief: 1) the \u201cviolent death of his father when [Petitioner] was only age 7 at the hands of the (it is believed) \u2014 guerillas\u201d; 2) Petitioner\u2019s \u201cknowledge of the atrocities and witnessing first hand, the behavior of the army and guerillas towards members of his social group, the Mayan Indians and indigenous people of Guatemala \u2014 and all this at a very tender age having been born in 1980, when fighting and brutality was moving toward its peak\u201d; and 3) \u201cthe constant running, hiding, and living in fear, ingrained into [Petitioner] as a child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-14\">Although Petitioner presented evidence of the above-referenced facts, the finding below that Petitioner failed to establish past persecution is nonetheless supported by substantial evidence. Petitioner does not know who killed his father or for what reason his father was killed. Nowhere does Petitioner allege any concrete instances of persecution that he experienced while in Guatemala, either at home or in the city to which he fled. Because the circumstances of the death of Petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>father are unclear, Petitioner\u2019s flight to another city after his father\u2019s death is of limited probative value. Under these circumstances, the record does not compel a finding of past persecution. <em>See, e.g., Mendez-Coronado v. Holder, </em>374 Fed. Appx. 601, 604 (6th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Having failed to establish persecution, Petitioner may obtain relief only by demonstrating a probability of future persecution. <em>See Mikhailevitch, </em>146 F.3d at 391. The IJ and BIA found that Petitioner failed to do so, and the record does not compel a finding to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The IJ agreed with Petitioner that pervasive discrimination against Mayan Indians exists in Guatemala. But, as the IJ noted, this discrimination must rise to the level of persecution to entitle Petitioner to relief. <em>See Morente v. Holder, </em>401 Fed.Appx. 17, 21-22 (6th Cir.2010). The only evidence of ongoing persecution Petitioner sets forth in his brief is citation to Petitioner\u2019s equivocal testimony about general violence in Guatemala, as well as a general citation to hundreds of pages of exhibits for which Petitioner provides no analysis. Although Petitioner believes that he would be \u201cviewed as a traitor on his return\u201d because he did not join the \u201cguerilla forces of criminal gangs,\u201d this argument is speculative and, as the BIA noted, Petitioner \u201chas not presented evidence of any specific threats made against him\u201d on any protected ground since fleeing.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">In light of Petitioner\u2019s testimony and the documentary evidence in the record, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Petitioner feared \u201cgeneralized crime and violence in Guatemala, rather than a fear of persecution on account of a protected ground.\u201d Petitioner himself admits that he is \u201cafraid to go back because of crime and gangs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Accordingly, Petitioner is not entitled to withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b), and his petition for review on this ground is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">B. Denial of Protection Under the Convention Against Torture</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">Petitioner argues that he is entitled to protection under the Convention Against Torture. An applicant seeking relief under the Convention Against Torture has the burden to show that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if removed to the proposed country. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). An applicant need not show torture on any protected grounds; rather,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-11\">[tjorture is defined as any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or her or a third person information or a confession, punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-12\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1208.18(a)(2). In deciding whether an applicant is more than likely to be tortured upon his return, this Court considers \u201cthe possibility of future torture, including any evidence of past torture inflicted upon the applicant and evidence that the applicant is not likely to be tortured in another area of the country of removal.\u201d <em>Ali v. Reno, </em>237 F.3d 591, 596-97 (6th Cir.2001); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-13\">Here, the factual record does not compel a finding contrary to that reached below. Both the IJ and the BIA acknowledged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>that \u201ctorture does occur in Guatemala,\u201d but found that Petitioner \u201chas not shown that it is probable that it will occur with the acquiescence of the Guatemalan government in his case.\u201d This finding was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">As the government argues, Petitioner is \u201cvague about who would torture him.\u201d Indeed, Petitioner\u2019s brief on appeal identifies these individuals broadly as \u201ceither prior guerilla operatives, ex-government soldiers, or [ ] third parties such as criminal gangs.\u201d Although the record is replete with evidence that Guatemala is a dangerous country, and that its government may often be ineffective, nothing referenced in Petitioner\u2019s brief on appeal compels a finding that these groups, with the acquiescence of the government, will torture Petitioner upon his return. <em>See Dominguez-Gonzalez v. Holder, </em>381 Fed.Appx. 511, 517 (6th Cir.2010) (holding that the Guatemalan government\u2019s inability to protect an alien from crime is insufficient to support a claim for relief, where the alien did not present evidence \u2014 apart from his own testimony \u2014 that the government was \u201ccomplicit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Accordingly, Petitioner is not entitled to protection under the Convention Against Torture, and his petition for review on this ground is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">For the reasons set forth above, the petition for review is DISMISSED insofar as it challenges the timeliness ruling below and DENIED as to all other claims.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-6\">. Even if we were to consider the merits of these claimed errors, and to the extent we construe Petitioner as raising procedural due process arguments, we would deny each as without merit. First, nothing in the record suggests that the colloquy between the IJ and counsel rendered the proceedings fundamentally unfair, particularly where Petitioner did not contemporaneously object; Petitioner underwent thorough direct, cross, and redirect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>examinations; and Petitioner failed to identify any prejudice resulting from this claimed error. Second, nothing in the record suggests that the absence of Sister Felix\u2019s testimony violated due process. The IJ gave weight to her letter and Petitioner\u2019s counsel admitted that Sister Felix had no personal knowledge of Petitioner\u2019s circumstances nor had she ever met Petitioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
