The conviction was affirmed on direct appeal, and two petitions for state post-conviction relief were denied. In 2007, Miller filed a third petition for post-conviction relief based upon the Supreme Court of Iowa\u2019s decision changing the Iowa law of felony murder. <em>State v. Heemstra, 721 </em>N.W.2d 549, 558 (Iowa 2006). In November 2009, the Supreme Court of Iowa affirmed the denial of this petition based upon its prior decision that <em>Heemstra </em>was a change in the law and may not be used to collaterally attack a prior conviction. <em>Goosman v. State, </em>764 N.W.2d 589, 545 (Iowa 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Miller then filed this petition <em>for </em>federal habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, arguing that the Supreme Court of Iowa\u2019s refusal to apply <em>Heemstra </em>retroactively violated his federal constitutional right to due process of law. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> dismissed the petition as time-barred under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d), further observing that it was unlikely Miller would have obtained relief on the merits. Miller timely appealed that ruling. While the appeal was pending, we affirmed the denial of habeas relief to another Iowa inmate who sought retroactive application of the <em>Heemstra </em>decision, concluding \u201cthat the Constitution does not require a state\u2019s highest court to make retroactive its new construction of a criminal statute.\u201d <em>Graves v. Ault, </em>614 F.3d 501, 512 (8th Cir.) (quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 508, 178 L.Ed.2d 377 (2010). Our decision in Graves is controlling and requires affirming the district court\u2019s dismissal of Miller\u2019s petition, whether or not it is time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-12\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b600-23\">.
