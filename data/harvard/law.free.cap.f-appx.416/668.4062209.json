Reviewing the BIA\u2019s legal determinations de novo, <em>Garciar-Quintero v. Gonzales, </em>455 F.3d 1006, 1011 (9th Cir.2006), and the BIA\u2019s factual determinations for substantial evidence, <em>Hamazaspyan v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 744, 747 (9th Cir.2009), we grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-22\">When the relevant facts are not in dispute, we have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that a petitioner filed an untimely asylum application. <em>Khunaverdiants v. Mukasey, </em>548 F.3d 760, 765 (9th Cir.2008). Here, the historical facts are not in dispute because the BIA expressly found that Petitioner had successfully relocated within Sri Lanka \u201cuntil he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>departed the country in January 2003.\u201d The asylum application was filed in October 2003. Having found that Petitioner departed Sri Lanka in January 2003 and having received his asylum application in October 2003, the BIA was required under <em>Khunaverdiants </em>to conclude as a matter of law that the asylum application was filed within one year of Petitioner\u2019s arrival in the United States. We therefore remand Petitioner\u2019s asylum claim to the BIA for a determination on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Moreover, as the government concedes, the BIA legally erred in analyzing Petitioner\u2019s withholding of removal claim. Because Petitioner demonstrated past persecution, he is entitled to a presumption \u201cthat [his] life or freedom would be threatened in the future in the country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(l)(i); <em>see Mutuku v. Holder, </em>600 F.3d 1210, 1213 (9th Cir.2010). The BIA expressly found, relying on his testimony, that Petitioner \u201cestablished past persecution on account of a protected ground.\u201d But the BIA then improperly placed the burden of proof as to future persecution on Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Additionally, the BIA legally erred by failing to analyze whether the proposed relocation within Sri Lanka was reasonable, as guided by the considerations listed in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(3). <em>See Afriyie v. Holder, </em>613 F.3d 924, 936-37 (9th Cir. 2010) (remanding because \u201c[t]he BIA failed to discuss the reasonableness factors set forth in [the regulations] or discuss how the government met its burden of showing that relocation was reasonable\u201d). Because of the BIA\u2019s legal errors, we remand Petitioner\u2019s withholding of removal claim for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">In view of these errors concerning asylum and withholding, the BIA\u2019s analysis of the CAT claim may have been affected as well. We therefore remand the entire case for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">Petition GRANTED. REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b690-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
