LUCERO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b722-13\">Fernando Castellanos-Barba appeals the district court\u2019s calculation of his sentence under the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Exercising jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b722-15\">Castellanos-Barba was indicted and pled guilty to a single charge of illegal reentry into the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). His Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) recommended a 16-level increase under Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) because Castellanos-Barba was deported after \u201ca drug trafficking\u201d felony: his 1992 California conviction for \u201cSale or Transportation of Marijuana.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-16\">Castellanos-Barba did not dispute that the 1992 conviction was a drug trafficking felony, but asked the court to diseretionarily reject the 16-level enhancement. The district court denied this request, concluding Castellanos-Barba\u2019s conviction was for \u201csale or transport\u201d of a controlled substance, and such a crime \u201cfits within the intent of [the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) ] enhancement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-17\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b722-18\">On appeal, Castellanos-Barba argues that his 1992 conviction was not a drug trafficking felony. He concedes that we review this new claim for plain error. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez-Jaquez, </em>566 F.3d 1250, 1251-52 (10th Cir.2009). Plain error occurs if: (1) there is error; (2) it is \u201cclear or obvious\u201d; (3) it \u201caffects substantial rights\u201d; and (4) it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Huerta, </em>403 F.3d 727, 732 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The district court committed error. To determine whether a prior conviction qualifies as a drug trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(i), a district court must generally follow the categorical approach adopted in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 600-02, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). <em>See United States v. Torres-Romero, </em>537 F.3d 1155, 1158 (10th Cir.2008). Under the categorical approach, a court looks first to the statute under which the defendant was convicted. <em>Id. </em>If the statute encompasses a broad array of conduct, some of which would trigger the enhancement and some of which would not, the court must apply the \u201cmodified categorical approach,\u201d looking to \u201creliable judicial records\u201d to determine whether a predicate conviction was based on conduct triggering the enhancement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Castellanos-Barba was convicted under a California statute, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHs\">Except as otherwise provided by this section or as authorized by law, every person who transports, imports into this state, sells, furnishes, administers, or gives away, or offers to transport, import into this state, sell, furnish, administer, or give away, or attempts to import into this state or transport any marijuana shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for a period of two, three or four years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11360(a) (1992). The statute thus included drug trafficking offenses (for example, \u201csells\u201d) and non-trafficking offenses (for example, \u201ctransports\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court erred by failing to apply the modified categorical approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">The error was also plain. Our sister circuits evaluating convictions under \u00a7 11360 and similar California statutes have found that the categorical approach is not sufficient to determine if a predicate conviction is for a drug trafficking offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The absence of binding precedent from this court or the Supreme Court is not dispositive: such guidance is not required if the district court\u2019s interpretation was clearly incorrect. <em>United States v. Ruiz-Gea, </em>340 F.3d 1181, 1187 (10th Cir.2003). Given its erroneous interpretation of California law and the significant consensus among other circuits on the matter, the district court\u2019s conclusion was plainly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">However, we are bound by circuit precedent to conclude that the error did not affect substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Zubia-Torres, </em>550 F.3d 1202, 1209 (10th Cir.2008). In <em>Zubicu-Torres, </em>we required a defendant arguing plain error in the application of \u00a7 2L1.2 to make a showing before this court that his earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>conviction did not, in fact, involve drug trafficking conduct. <em>Zubia-Torres, </em>550 F.3d at 1209.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Our approach contrasts with that of the Fifth Circuit, which has held that the appropriate procedure, upon a finding that the district court misapplied the categorical approach, is to remand to the trial court in order to determine whether the documents of conviction support application of the sentencing enhancement. <em>United States v. Bonilla-Mungia, </em>422 F.3d 316, 320-21 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Castellanos-Barba urges us to use the Fifth Circuit\u2019s process when there is a risk that a substantial right has been affected because we, as a court of appeals, are not competent to find facts. <em>See Green v. Post, </em>574 F.3d 1294, 1304 n. 9 (10th Cir. 2009) (\u201c[W]e do not find facts on appeal .... \u201d). Further, he points to the conflict between <em>Zubia-Toires, </em>which <em>requires </em>a defendant to supplement the record on appeal, and Fed. R.App. P. 10(e) and 10th Cir. R. 10.3, which confirm our discretion to deny any attempt to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">But, as Castellanos-Barba concedes, the propriety of this court\u2019s holding in <em>Zubia-Torres, </em>cannot be contested by another panel of this court. <em>See In re Smith, </em>10 F.3d 723, 724 (10th Cir.1993). Because Castellanos-Barba has failed to proffer any evidence showing that his conviction was not based on drug trafficking conduct, we must conclude that his substantial rights were not affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b722-10\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b723-7\">. California has construed the statute to encompass transportation of marijuana for personal use. <em>See People v. Rogers, </em>5 Cal.3d 129, 95 Cal.Rptr. 601, 486 P.2d 129, 132 (1971). And under federal law, mere transportation for personal use is not \"trafficking.\u201d <em>Cf. United States v. Herrera-Roldan, </em>414 F.3d 1238, 1240 (10th Cir.2005); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1), Application Note 1(B)(iv). <em>But see United States v. Millan-Torres, </em>139 Fed. Appx. 105, 110-11 (10th Cir.2005) (unpublished) (interpreting \u00a7 11360 differently, but not considering <em>Rogers </em>or the statute's inclusion of transportation for personal use).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b723-14\">. <em>United States v.
