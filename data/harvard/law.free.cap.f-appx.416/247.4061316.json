The district court sentenced Shine to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment. Shine\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating his opinion that there are no meritorious issue for appeal but raising the issue of whether the district court erred in denying Shine\u2019s motion for a variance. Shine was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not done so. The Government has declined to file a responsive brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">This court reviews a sentence for reasonableness, applying an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). This review requires appellate consideration of both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Id. </em>After determining whether the district court properly calculated the defendant\u2019s advisory Guidelines range, this court considers whether the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, analyzed any arguments presented by the parties, and sufficiently explained the selected sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 346-47, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 330 (4th Cir.2009). Finally, this court reviews the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, \u201ctaking into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guideline range.\u201d <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">In evaluating the sentencing court\u2019s explanation of a selected sentence, this court has consistently held that, while the district court must consider the statutory factors and explain the sentence, it need not explicitly refer to \u00a7 3553(a) or discuss every factor on the record, particularly when the court imposes a sentence within the properly calculated advisory Guidelines range. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006). At the same time, the district court \u201cmust make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586. The reasons articulated by the district court for a given sentence need not be \u201ccouched in the precise language of \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d so long as the \u201creasons can be matched to a factor appropriate for consideration ... and [are] clearly tied [to the defendant\u2019s] particular situation.\u201d <em>United States v. Moulden, </em>478 F.3d 652, 658 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\"> In this case, after properly calculating the Guidelines range, the district court sufficiently explained the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors it had considered and their relation to Shine. The court adequately explained its denial of Shine\u2019s motion for a variance. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s sentence was procedurally reasonable. Moreover, considering the to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>tality of the circumstances, the district court\u2019s sentence was also substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform Shine, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Shine requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Shine.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
