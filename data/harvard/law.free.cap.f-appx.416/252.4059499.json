Martinez was sentenced to seventy months in prison. He now appeals. His attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising four issues but stating that there are no grounds for appeal. Martinez was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not filed such a brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Martinez contends that the district court failed to comply with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 and that there was not a factual basis for the plea. However, counsel in the <em>Anders </em>brief identifies no flaws in the Rule 11 proceeding, and our review of the record discloses that the district court fully complied with Rule 11. Further, sufficient facts supported the guilty plea. Martinez agreed with the government\u2019s summary of its case against him, which demonstrated his membership in the charged conspiracy. Further, Martinez stipulated in his plea agreement and at the Rule 11 hearing that he was responsible for at least five, but fewer than fifteen, kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Martinez also contends that the district court erred because it did not specifically address the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) (2006) sentencing factors when imposing sentence. Because Martinez did not raise this claim below, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Lynn, </em>592 F.3d 572, 577 (4th Cir.2010); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (to constitute plain error, there must be an error that is plain and that affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights). We are not required to correct a plain error unless it \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">In evaluating the sentencing court\u2019s explanation of a selected sentence, we have consistently held that, while the district court must consider the statutory factors and explain the sentence, it need not explicitly refer to \u00a7 3553(a) or discuss every factor on the record, particularly when the court imposes a sentence within the properly calculated advisory Guidelines range. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006). At the same time, the district court \u201cmust make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The reasons articulated by the district court for a given sentence need not be \u201ccouched in the precise language of \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d so long as the \u201creasons can be matched to a factor appropriate for consideration under that statute and [are] clearly tied [to the defendant\u2019s] particular situation.\u201d <em>United States v. Moulden, </em>478 F.3d 652, 658 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">According to the presentence report, Martinez\u2019s base offense level was 32. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(USSG) \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(4) (2008). This was reduced by two levels pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(ll). He received a three-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3E1.1. His total offense level was 27, and his criminal history category was I, resulting in an advisory Guidelines range of 70-97 months. Although Martinez was subject to a ten-year statutory mandatory minimum, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), he received the benefit of the safety valve provision, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) (2006), and his Guidelines range applied. There were no objections to the presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">At sentencing, the government recommended that Martinez be sentenced to seventy months in prison and advised the court that \u201cMartinez would not challenge the reasonableness of that sentence pursuant to any of the factors set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">The district court sentenced Martinez to seventy months in prison. The court stated that it had \u201ccalculated and considered the advisory guidelines and the relevant statutory sentencing factors.\u201d Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>court did not make the individualized assessment required by case law, we conclude that this did not constitute plain error, especially because the sentence fell at the low end of the advisory Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Counsel next contends that defense counsel was ineffective. To allow for adequate development of the record, a defendant ordinarily must raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in a 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2010) motion unless it conclusively appears on the face of the record that counsel provided inadequate assistance. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). Because ineffective assistance does not conclusively appear on the face of the record, this claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for meritorious issues and have found none. We therefore affirm. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
