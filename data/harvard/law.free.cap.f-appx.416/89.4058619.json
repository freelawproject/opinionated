We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Appellate review of a district court\u2019s sentence has two components: procedural review and substantive review. <em>United States v. Cavera, </em>550 F.3d 180, 189 (2d Cir.2008) (in banc). If the appellate court finds no procedural error, the substantive review is done for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 187 (citing <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). Under that standard, an appellate court will vacate the district court\u2019s sentence only in \u201cexceptional cases where the trial court\u2019s decision \u2018cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cavera, </em>550 F.3d at 189 (quoting <em>United States v. Rigas, </em>490 F.3d 208, 238 (2d Cir.2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">\u201cA district court commits procedural error where it fails to calculate the Guidelines range (unless omission of the calculation is justified), makes a mistake in its Guidelines calculation, or treats the Guidelines as mandatory. It also errs procedurally if it does not consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, or rests its sentence on a clearly erroneous finding of fact.\u201d <em>Cavera, </em>550 F.3d at 190 (internal citations omitted). The district court made no such errors. The district court used the applicable Guidelines range as a starting point in its sentencing decision. And in sentencing Nash to 151 months, the district court did not rely in any way (explicitly or implicitly) on the sentencing enhancement for an offense involving ten or more victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">In reviewing the substantive fairness of a district court\u2019s sentencing decision, we \u201ctake into account the totality of the circumstances, giving due deference to the sentencing judge\u2019s exercise of discretion and bearing in mind the institutional advantages of district courts.\u201d <em>Cavera, </em>550 F.3d at 190. If a judge locates his sentence within the Guidelines range, it \u201csignificantly increases the likelihood that the sentence is a reasonable one,\u201d because it shows that both the judge and the Sentencing Commission have reached the same conclusion about the proper sentence. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). We \u201cwill not second guess the weight (or lack thereof) that the judge accorded to a given factor or to a specific argument made pursuant to that factor.\u201d <em>United States v. Pope, </em>554 F.3d 240, 247 (2d Cir.2009) (quoting <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 34 (2d Cir.2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">The district court sentenced Nash within the applicable Guidelines range, and it was well within its discretion to conclude that the elimination of the ten-or-more-victims sentencing enhancement should only reduce Nash\u2019s sentence by four months. The fact that the new sentence is at the top of the recalculated Guidelines range while the previous sentence was near the bottom of the prior Guidelines range is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">The district court committed no procedural error, and the sentence it imposed was reasonable and certainly within \u201cthe range of permissible decisions.\u201d As a result, we hereby AFFIRM the sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
