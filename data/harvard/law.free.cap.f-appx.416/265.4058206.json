He was sentenced to forty-one months\u2019 imprisonment. Rosales-Vaca\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting, in his opinion, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but generally questioning whether Rosales-Vaca\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary. Rosales-Vaca was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. The Government declined to file a response. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-25\">Because Rosales-Vaca did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, we review the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002). \u201cTo establish plain error, [Rosales-Vaca] must show that an error occurred, that the error was plain, and that the error affected his substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Muhammad, </em>478 F.3d 247, 249 (4th Cir. 2007). Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the district court fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>complied with Rule 11, and that RosalesVaea\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary, and supported by an independent factual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Rosales-Vaca, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Rosales-Vaca requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Rosales-Vaca. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
