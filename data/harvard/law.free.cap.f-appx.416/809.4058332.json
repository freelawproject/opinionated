After thorough review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">In a case like this, in which the BIA issued its own opinion, we review \u201conly the decision of the BIA, except to the extent the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 890 (11th Cir.2007). Here, the BIA issued its own opinion, upholding the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief, so we only review the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">We review questions of law, including the BIA\u2019s statutory interpretations, <em>de novo. Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 860 (11th Cir.2007); <em>Jaggernauth v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>432 F.3d 1346, 1350 (11th Cir.2005). However, following the principles of <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), when we review the BIA\u2019s construction of a statute that it administers, we \u201cwill defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of [the] statute if it is reasonable and does not contradict the clear intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Quinchia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>552 F.3d 1255, 1258 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). In reviewing an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute under <em>Chevron, </em>the first step of the analysis is to determine \u201cwhether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778. However, \u201cwhen a court reviews an agency\u2019s construction of the statute which it administers ... and the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Quinchia, </em>552 F.3d at 1258 (quotation and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">Finally, we review findings of fact for substantial evidence to support them. <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009). Under the substantial evidence test, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision. <em>Id. </em>at 1351. This review for substantial evidence is highly deferential: \u201cTo reverse factual findings by the Board, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it. The mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations, alternations, and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">The INA gives the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security discretion to grant asylum to any non-citizen who meets the definition of \u201crefugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). A refugee is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of ... political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Section 101(a)(42)(B) of the INA further provides asylum eligibility for the following persons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APD\">a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization, or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program, shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion, and a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure, refusal, or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory refugee status, and thereby establishing asylum eligibility. <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">\u201cTo establish eligibility for asylum based on a well-founded fear of future persecution, the applicant must prove (1) a subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable fear of persecution, that is (2) on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006) (quotations and citation omitted). The applicant must present \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be singled out for persecution on account of [the protected ground].\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. However, the applicant need not show that she will be singled out if she can establish that her country engages in a pattern or practice of persecution of a group of similarly situated persons on account of a protected ground. <em>Mehmeti v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1196, 1200 (11th Cir.2009). Notably, an alien who fails to establish that she has a well-founded fear of persecution necessarily fails to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">As to what constitutes a well-founded fear, the Supreme Court has explained \u201cthat so long as an objective situation is established by the evidence, it need not be shown that the situation will probably result in persecution, but it is enough that persecution is a reasonable possibility.\u201d <em>I.N.S. v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 440, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987) (quotation omitted). However, the Supreme Court declined to elaborate further and, instead, observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4O\">[t]here is obviously some ambiguity in a term like \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d which can only be given concrete meaning through a process of case-by-case adjudication. In that process of filling any gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress, the courts must respect the interpretation of the agency to which Congress has delegated the responsibility for administering the statutory program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 448, 107 S.Ct. 1207 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-11\">The BIA has determined that there is objective evidence supporting a genuine fear of returning to China if the alien shows (1) \u201cthe details of the family planning policy relevant to [her],\u201d (2) \u201cthe alien violated the policy,\u201d and (3) \u201cthe violation of the family planning policy would be punished in the local area in a way that would give rise to an objective fear of future persecution.\u201d <em>In re </em>J-H-S- 24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 196, 198-99 (BIA 2007), <em>pet. for review denied sub nom. Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138 (2d Cir.2008); <em>see also In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number><em>J-W-S-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 185, 185-89 (BIA 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Here, the BIA did not legally err in requiring Ding to demonstrate that she violated China\u2019s coercive family planning policy because the requirement, as articulated in the BIA\u2019s three-part test for determining whether a genuine fear of returning to China is objectively reasonable, is a reasonable interpretation of the term \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B). Indeed, Ding has not argued that the BIA\u2019s construction of \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B) was unreasonable or at odds with the legislative intent, and thus, has abandoned any argument to that end. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2. Nor did the BIA require Ding to demonstrate that she \u201cnecessarily\u201d would be persecuted in order to establish a well-founded fear of persecution, as Ding argues. Rather, the BIA found that there was no pattern or practice of persecution against respondents in precedential BIA decisions predicated on the birth of U.S. citizen children and that Ding\u2019s documentary evidence was not materially distinguishable from the evidence presented in those cases. Thus, BIA did not legally err in applying <em>J-HS- </em>to Ding.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Further, substantial evidence supports the finding that Ding failed to demonstrate that she has a well-founded fear of forced sterilization or a fine rising to the level of persecution for resisting China\u2019s coercive family planning policies. Although the documentary evidence submitted in this case cites reports of forced sterilizations from Fujian Province, the record as a whole indicates that China\u2019s family planning policy is largely dependent upon economic incentives and penalties and, thus, does not compel the conclusion that there is a pattern or practice in Fuji-an Province of forcibly sterilizing women like Ding or that Ding personally faces forced sterilization if returned to China. Moreover, Ding\u2019s particularized evidence does not alter this conclusion. As a result, she has failed to meet her burden of proof for asylum. Because she failed to meet her burden of proof for asylum, Ding also failed to meet the higher burden required for withholding of removal. Accordingly, we deny the petition in these regards.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b832-6\">. Ding has abandoned her claim for relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment because she fails to make more than a passing reference to the claim on appeal. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
