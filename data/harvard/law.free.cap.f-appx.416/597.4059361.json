He reserved the right to appeal the denial of the suppression motion. The court sentenced him to life imprisonment, to be followed by two consecutive ten-year terms in prison; it also imposed a fine of $30,000 and a lifetime of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-24\">On appeal, Wilson\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the District Court erred in denying the suppression motion because the affidavit for the search warrant did not provide probable cause. We conclude, however, that the court\u2019s factual findings were not clearly erroneous and that its legal conclusion that probable cause existed was correct. <em>See United States v. Stevens, </em>530 F.3d 714, 717 (8th Cir.) (standard of review), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 654, 172 L.Ed.2d 631 (2008); <em>United States v. Grant, </em>490 F.3d 627, 631-32 (8th Cir.2007) (noting that if an affidavit in support of a search warrant sets forth sufficient facts to lead a prudent person to believe there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place, probable cause to issue the warrant has been established; reviewing courts should pay great deference to issuing judge\u2019s probable-cause determination), cer<em>t. denied, </em>552 U.S. 1281, 128 S.Ct. 1704, 170 L.Ed.2d 516 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>We have carefully reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and we have found no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b619-20\">. The Honorable Robert T.
