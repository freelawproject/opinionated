Ybarra contends that (1) the Lufkin Division, Eastern District of Texas, erroneously transferred the cause of action to the Tyler Division, Eastern District of Texas, and he did not consent to the magistrate judge adjudicating his complaint, (2) he was entitled to a jury trial in light of his request for a jury trial, (8) the district court erred in dismissing his complaint \u201cin conjunction with\u201d dismissing his complaint in another cause of action, <em>Ybarra v. Meador, </em>identified by civil action no. 9:09-CV-213, (4) the district court abused its discretion in denying him leave to amend his complaint, (5) the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for the appointment of counsel, and (6) the magistrate judge abused her discretion in refusing to require the defendants to testify at the <em>Spears</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>hearing and, instead, in allowing others to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-17\">The record does not reflect that the cause of action was transferred from the Lufkin Division to the Tyler Division, as Ybarra asserts. Rather, the district court properly referred the case to the magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b). <em>See Carbe v. Lappin, </em>492 F.3d 325, 327 (5th Cir.2007). Moreover, the magistrate judge did not enter judgment pursuant to \u00a7 636(c), which requires consent of the parties, but only made a recommendation pursuant to \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B). Further, Ybarra was not entitled to a trial, jury or otherwise, once his claims were determined to be frivolous. <em>See Spears, </em>766 F.2d at 181-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-18\">To the extent that Ybarra contends that the magistrate judge abused her discretion in conducting a single <em>Spears </em>in his two civil rights actions, Ybarra has not shown that the magistrate judge abused her discretion, especially since the claims were partly intertwined. <em>See Wilson v. Barrientos, </em>926 F.2d 480, 483 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-19\">We also reject Ybarra\u2019s assertion that the district court erred in denying his motion to amend. In general, it is not proper for a district court to dismiss a pro se complaint without affording the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>the opportunity to amend. <em>Bazrowx v. Scott, </em>136 F.3d 1053, 1054 (5th Cir.1998). However, any such error may be ameliorated if the plaintiff has pleaded his \u201cbest case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1054 &amp; n. 7. Here, the magistrate judge conducted a <em>Spears </em>hearing after Ybarra filed his motion to file an amended complaint and before recommending the dismissal of Ybarra\u2019s complaint as frivolous. A review of the testimony reflects that Ybarra was given the opportunity to articulate fully the factual basis for his claims. <em>See Wilson, </em>926 F.2d at 482. Any error in not allowing an amendment of the complaint was harmless. <em>See Bazrowx, </em>136 F.3d at 1054 &amp; n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Ybarra has failed to demonstrate the extraordinary circumstances necessary to justify the appointment of counsel. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212-13 (5th Cir.1982). Thus, he has shown no abuse of discretion in the denial of his motion for the appointment of counsel. <em>See Cupit v. Jones, </em>835 F.2d 82, 86 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Ybarra has not shown that the magistrate judge abused her discretion in not requiring the defendants to testify at the <em>Spears </em>hearing. <em>See Wilson, </em>926 F.2d at 483. Ybarra has not demonstrated that any relevant testimony was excluded or made a substantial showing that the testimony of the defendants was needed. <em>See Cupit, </em>835 F.2d at 86-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Generally, we review the dismissal of a complaint pursuant to \u00a7 1915A as frivolous and for failure to state a claim de novo. <em>See Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir.1998). Ybarra, however, has failed to raise any arguments challenging the district court\u2019s specific reasons for dismissing his claims, which were set forth in the magistrate judge\u2019s report and in the district court\u2019s memorandum. Rather, he suggests, erroneously, that the magistrate judge provided no reasons for recommending the dismissal of his claims. Because Ybarra fails to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis of the substantive claims raised in his \u00a7 1983 complaint, the issues are deemed abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b426-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
