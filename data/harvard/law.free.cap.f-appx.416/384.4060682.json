We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The facts underlying Garcia\u2019s claim are uncomplicated and largely undisputed. Garcia, a store manager at a Best Buy in Houston, claims he was injured while loading a dishwasher into a delivery truck. Best Buy is a non-subscriber to the Texas Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and, as such, has implemented the Plan. The Plan provides benefits for covered injuries suffered by Best Buy employees in the course and scope of employment. Garcia submitted a claim for compensation for his injuries to the Plan administrator, who denied the claim for failing to comply with the Plan\u2019s requirement that injuries be reported within twenty-four hours. Garcia appealed to the Plan\u2019s Steering Committee, arguing 1) that his report of injury was timely; 2) that the twenty-four hour reporting requirement violated Department of Labor regulations; and 3) that the Texas\u2019s notice-prejudice rule should be applied to his claim for benefits. The Steering Committee denied Garcia\u2019s appeal and \u201cdid not address any of Garcia\u2019s three legal arguments\u201d in its decision. <em>Garcia v. Best Buy Stores L.P., </em>No. 4:07-CV-851, 2009 WL 2982788, at *4, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82212, at *10 (S.D.Tex. Sept. 10, 2009). Garcia then brought suit in the district court, advancing the same arguments he made before the Steering Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">The case became \u201ca procedural mess.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at *1, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82212, at *1-2. Eventually, Garcia moved for summary judgment. Best Buy opposed the motion, and Garcia filed a reply. The district court denied summary judgment and gave the parties two weeks to \u201cpresent to the Court any reason why a final judgment should NOT be entered in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *10, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82212, at *30. Garcia filed a motion for reconsideration. Best Buy opposed the motion. The district court denied Garcia\u2019s motion to reconsider and entered final judgment in favor of Best Buy. Garcia timely appealed to this court only as to the issue of whether Texas\u2019s notice-prejudice rule should be applied to his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">\u201cThe grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment is reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d Smith v. Am. Family Life Assur. Co. of Columbus, </em>584 F.3d 212, 215 (5th Cir. 2009). Summary judgment is proper only if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b407-14\">A. Texas\u2019s Notice-Prejudice Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b407-15\">In 2008, the Texas Supreme Court clarified a somewhat-muddled area of Texas law and determined that an insured\u2019s failure to timely notify its insurer of a claim does not defeat coverage under the policy unless the insurer was prejudiced by the delay. <em>PAJ, Inc. v. Hanover Ins. Co., </em>243 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>S.W.3d 630, 636-37 (Tex.2008). In so doing, the Texas Supreme Court affirmed its earlier holding that \u201can immaterial breach does not deprive the insurer of the benefit of the bargain and thus cannot relieve the insurer of the contractual coverage obligation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 631. This court had previously noted that leading treatises recognized \u201ca modern trend in favor of requiring proof of prejudice\u201d and its belief that \u201cthe Texas Supreme Court would follow this modern trend.\u201d <em>Hanson Prod. Co. v. Americas Ins. Co., </em>108 F.3d 627, 631 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Application of Texas\u2019s notice-prejudice rule to Garcia\u2019s claim would require Best Buy to demonstrate that it was prejudiced by Garcia\u2019s failure to report his injury within twenty-four hours. Best Buy did not make any showing of prejudice in either its initial denial of benefits or its denial of Garcia\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">B. ERISA\u2019s Effect on Texas\u2019s Notice-Prejudice Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The parties do not dispute that the Plan is an employee benefit plan subject to ERISA. Generally, ERISA \u201csuperseded] any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan\u201d described in ERISA. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a). \u201cThe pre-emption clause is conspicuous for its breadth.\u201d <em>FMC Corp. v. Holliday, </em>498 U.S. 52, 58, 111 S.Ct. 403,112 L.Ed.2d 356 (1990). \u201cAs an exception, however, ERISA\u2019s so-called savings clause allows state laws \u2018which regulate insurance, banking, or securities\u2019 to survive ERISA preemption.\u201d <em>Ellis v. Liberty Life Assur. Co., </em>394 F.3d 262, 276 (5th Cir.2004) (citing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(b)(2)(A)). For a state law to be deemed a \u201claw ... which regulates insurance\u201d under the savings clause, \u201cit must satisfy two requirements. First, the state law must be specifically directed toward entities engaged in insurance. Second ... the state law must substantially affect the risk pooling arrangement between the insurer and the insured.\u201d <em>Ky. Ass\u2019n of Health Plans, Inc. v. Miller, </em>538 U.S. 329, 341-342, 123 S.Ct. 1471,, 155 L.Ed.2d 468 (2003) (citations omitted). Finally, the \u201cdeemer clause\u201d in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(b)(2)(B) \u201crestricts the savings clause, as it exempts employee benefit plans from state regulation as insurance companies.\u201d <em>Custom Rail Emplr. Welfare Trust Fund v. Geeslin, </em>491 F.3d 233, 235 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">In <em>UNUM Life Insurance Company v. Ward, </em>the Supreme Court determined that California\u2019s notice-prejudice rule is a \u201c \u2018law ... which regulates insurance\u2019 and is therefore saved from preemption by ERISA.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 526 U.S. 358, 364, 119 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>1380, 143 L.Ed.2d 462 (1999). The Court noted that California\u2019s notice-prejudice rule prescribes \u201ca defense based on an insured\u2019s failure to give timely notice [of a claim] requires the insurer to prove that it suffered actual prejudice. Prejudice is not presumed from delayed notice alone. The insurer must show actual prejudice, not the mere possibility of prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366-67, 119 S.Ct. 1380 (alteration in original) (citation omitted). The district court properly determined that Texas\u2019s notice-prejudice rule \u201cis not substantially different from California\u2019s [as described] in Ward\u201d and properly concluded that Texas\u2019s rule \u201c \u2018regulates insurance\u2019 under the savings clause ... and is applicable to ERISA-regulated plans.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>2009 WL 2982788, at *9, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82212 at *28.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The deemer clause, however, provides an important limitation. \u201cWe read the deemer clause to exempt self-funded ERISA plans from state laws that \u2018regulate insurance\u2019 within the meaning of the saving clause.\u201d <em>FMC Corp. v. Holliday, </em>498 U.S. 52, 61, 111 S.Ct. 403, 112 L.Ed.2d 356 (1990). \u201cState laws that directly regulate insurance are \u2018saved\u2019 but do not reach self-funded employee benefit plans because the plans may not be deemed to be insurance companies, other insurers, or engaged in the business of insurance for purposes of such state laws.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court stated that \u201c[i]t is undisputed that Best Buy\u2019s plan is self-insured,\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>2009 WL 2982788, at *10, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82212 at *29, and accordingly concluded that Texas\u2019s notice-prejudice rule was not applicable to Garcia\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">C. Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">On appeal, Garcia argues that the district court erred in entering final judgment in Best Buy\u2019s favor<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and holding that ERISA preempts Texas\u2019s notice-prejudice rule for two reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">1) because \u201c[t]he record does not include, and Best Buy Plan has never cited to, any evidence that the Best Buy is self-insured\u201d; and</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">2) because \u201c[preemption is an affirmative defense, and therefore must be pleaded. Best Buy never pleaded \u2014 indeed, never even argued \u2014 that preemption applies to the Texas notice-prejudice rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-13\">Best Buy argues that Garcia has waived these arguments. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-14\">Garcia has waived these arguments by not raising them before the district court. <em>Martco Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Wellons, Inc., </em>588 F.3d 864, 877 (5th Cir.2009) (\u201c[Ajrguments not raised before the district court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d). Garcia argues that he has relied upon the issue of the application of the notice-prejudice rule throughout this dispute. However, Garcia misapprehends waiver. He \u201cmay not advance on appeal new theories or raise new issues not properly before the district court to obtain reversal of the [final] judgment.\u201d <em>Dunbar </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number><em>v. Seger-Thomschitz, </em>615 F.3d 574, 576 (5th Cir.2010) (citing <em>Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069,1071 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc)). \u201cWe will not consider an issue that a party fails to raise in the district court, absent extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>N. Alamo Water Supply Corp. v. City of San Juan, Tex., </em>90 F.3d 910, 916 (5th Cir.1996). \u201cExtraordinary circumstances exist when the issue involved is a pure question of law and a miscarriage of justice would result from our failure to consider it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Before the district court, Garcia argued that 1) Texas\u2019s \u201cNotice Prejudice Rule applies to the Plan under the savings clause of ERISA\u201d and 2) \u201cthe Notice Prejudice Rule applies as a matter of federal common law.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>2009 WL 2982788 at *9, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82212 at *26. In denying Garcia\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the district court held that, due to the deemer clause\u2019s limitation on the savings clause, \u201cthe Notice Prejudice Rule will not be applicable by virtue of state law to ERISA plans that are self-insured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *10, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82212, at *29. The district court also declined to create federal common law and apply the notice-prejudice rule to all ERISA plans. <em>Id. </em>In the same order denying Garcia\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the district court gave the parties an opportunity to \u201cpresent to the Court any reason why a final judgment should NOT be entered in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *10, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82212, at *30. With the benefit of the district court\u2019s analysis and opinion, Garcia afforded himself this opportunity and moved the district court to reconsider its order. In his motion to reconsider, Garcia argued that <em>Ward, supra, </em>did not \u201cprohibit the application of the notice-prejudice rule to self-insured plans.\u201d He further argued that insured and self-insured plans should be held to the same standard and that \u201c[ajdoption of notice prejudice as a[sic] federal common law would assure a consistency of treatments by the plans, the participates [sic], and the courts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">On appeal, Garcia has abandoned the argument that federal common law should be created to apply the notice-prejudice rule to all ERISA plans. <em>E.g., Cinel v. Connick, </em>15 F.3d 1338, 1345 (5th Cir.1994) (\u201cAn appellant abandons all issues not raised and argued in its <em>initial </em>brief on appeal.\u201d). Instead Garcia now recognizes that, under the deemer clause, \u201c[s]elf-funded plans are merely 'deemed\u2019 to be insurers, and so are exempt from state laws and regulations, such as the notice-prejudice rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">For the first time on appeal, Garcia advances two entirely new theories why Texas\u2019s notice-prejudice rule should be applied to the Plan. He now contends that there is no evidence in the record that the Plan is self-insured and, alternatively, that Best Buy waived preemption as an affirmative defense by failing to raise preemption in its answer. We decline to address these arguments. \u201c \u2018[T]he Court will not allow a party to raise an issue for the first time on appeal merely because a party believes that he might prevail if given the opportunity to try a case again on a different theory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Forbush v. J.C. Penney Co., </em>98 F.3d 817, 822 (5th Cir.1996)). Nowhere in his multiple filings before the district court \u2014 which include a complaint, an amended complaint, a trial brief, a motion for summary judgment, a supplemental motion for summary judgment, a reply brief, and a motion for reconsideration\u2014 does Garcia ever assert the theories he advances on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">In sum, Garcia seeks to try the notice-prejudice issue \u201canew because [he] has discovered a more attractive theory.\u201d <em>Me-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number><em>Donald v. Bd. of Miss. Levee Comm\u2019rs, </em>832 F.2d 901, 909 (5th Cir.1987). But he has \u201cwaived [his] arguments not presented below\u201d and \u201cwe will not disturb [the district court\u2019s] thoughtful decision on the basis of a legal theory asserted for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe trial court cannot have erred as to matters which were not presented to it.\u201d <em>Gabel v. Lynaugh, </em>835 F.2d 124, 125 (5th Cir.1988). Garcia offered no reason why he did not present this theory to the district court and has made no showing that extraordinary circumstances exist such that his new theories should be explored for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-7\">. In <em>Ward, </em>the Supreme Court applied a two-part test first announced in <em>Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. Massachusetts, </em>471 U.S. 724, 105 S.Ct. 2380, 85 L.Ed.2d 728 (1985), to determine whether an insurance law would be saved from preemption by virtue of the ERISA savings clause. <em>Ward, 526 </em>U.S. at 367, 119 S.Ct. 1380. Briefly, that test required the court to determine first whether, \"from a common-sense view of the matter, the contested prescription regulates insurance\u201d and second, to address the \"business of insurance as that phrase is used in the McCarran-Ferguson Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). In <em>Miller, </em>the court made \"a clean break from the McCarran-Ferguson factors\u201d and announced the current test as stated above. <em>Miller, </em>538 U.S. at 341-42, 123 S.Ct. 1471.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">Although <em>Ward </em>was decided under the former test, its holding that the California notice-prejudice rule triggers the savings clause remains sound. The Court observed that the California notice-prejudice rule \"by its very terms, is directed specifically at the insurance industry and is applicable only to insurance contracts\u201d and that the rule \"controls the terms of the insurance relationship.\u201d <em>Ward, 526 </em>U.S. at 368, 119 S.Ct. 1380 (quotations omitted). In <em>Miller, </em>the Court affirmed that \u201c[t]he notice-prejudice rule governs whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>or not an insurance company must cover claims submitted late, which dictates to the insurance company the conditions under which it must pay for the risk that it has assumed. This certainly qualifies as a substantial effect on the risk pooling arrangement between the insurer and insured.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>538 U.S. at 339 n. 3, 123 S.Ct. 1471.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b409-7\">. Garcia\u2019s briefing mistakenly states that the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Best Buy. The record reflects that Best Buy never moved for summary judgment, but rather only opposed Garcia\u2019s own motion for summary judgment and motion for reconsideration. The district court did enter final judgment in Best Buy\u2019s favor, and the court will treat Garcia's appeal of the district court\u2019s (nonexistent) order \u201cgranting summary judgment in favor of Best Buy\u201d as an appeal of the final judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
