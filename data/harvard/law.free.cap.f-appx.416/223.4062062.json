The first denied her request for an extension of the discovery period; the second granted summary judgment in favor of defendant. Finding no error, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-16\">Because we write solely for the parties, we recite herein only the essential facts. Plaintiff, who has worked for The Pennsylvania State University since 1981, brought suit against her employer, claiming that she was denied a promotion in 2006 in retaliation for reporting sexual harassment to the University\u2019s affirmative action office in 2001. She also asserted that defendant breached a contract by using her past performance assessments in evaluating her candidacy for that promotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-17\">After filing her complaint in 2008, plaintiff retained current counsel. This attorney requested, and was granted, three extensions or stays of the discovery deadline, which totaled approximately seven months. The parties had almost eleven months after counsel entered his appearance to conduct and complete discovery. However, several weeks after the final discovery deadline had expired, plaintiffs counsel filed a \u201cMotion for Enlargement of Time to Complete Discovery\u201d and a motion to compel discovery. The District Court denied those motions on May 5, 2010, 2010 WL 1816638. On June 17, 2010, 2010 WL 2521028, summary judgment was entered in favor of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-18\">Plaintiff states that medical issues prevented her attorney from completing dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>covery in accordance with the (thrice-revised) scheduling order. We are not persuaded that the \u201cdenial of discovery \u2018made it impossible [for plaintiff] to obtain crucial evidence,\u2019 \u201d nor has plaintiff satisfied her burden of showing that \u201c\u2018more diligent discovery was impossible\u2019 \u201d under the circumstances. <em>See Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>107 F.3d 1026, 1032 (3d Cir.1997) (quoting <em>In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litig., </em>685 F.2d 810, 818 (3d Cir. 1982)). We therefore find no abuse of discretion. <em>See id. </em>at 1032-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Nor do we find error in the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the plaintiffs retaliation claims. After careful review of the record, we find nothing more than the plaintiffs own speculation supporting her allegation that retaliatory animus was a factor in the denial of her application for promotion. <em>See Watson v. Se. Pa. Transp. Auth., </em>207 F.3d 207, 215 (3d Cir.2000) (discussing showing required for retaliation claim). Mere allegations are not sufficient to establish a genuine issue of material fact for purposes of summary judgment. <em>See Lexington Ins. Co. v. </em>W. <em>Pa. Hosp., </em>423 F.3d 318, 333 (3d Cir. 2005) (\u201cSpeculation does not create a <em>genuine </em>issue of fact\u201d (quoting <em>Hedberg v. Ind. Bell Tel. Co., Inc., </em>47 F.3d 928, 932 (7th Cir.1995))).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">With respect to the plaintiffs breach of contract claim, we have reviewed the Agreement and General Release and find it to be \u201ca contract complete within itself .... representing] the parties\u2019 entire agreement.\u201d <em>Yocca v. Pittsburgh Steelers Sports, Inc., </em>578 Pa. 479, 854 A.2d 425, 436 (2004) (internal quotations omitted). The contract\u2019s silence on the matter of the plaintiffs past performance evaluation scores does not amount to ambiguity. <em>See Seven Springs Farm, Inc. v. Croker, </em>748 A.2d 740, 744 (Pa.Super.2000)(e% <em>banc </em>)(\u201c[W]hen a contract fails to provide for a specific contingency, it is silent, not ambiguous\u201d and court should neither consider extrinsic evidence nor \u201cread into the contract a term ... which clearly it does not contain\u201d). The District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on this claim was, therefore, proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s orders will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
