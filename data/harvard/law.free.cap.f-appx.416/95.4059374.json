The petition contests only the six-month suspension, not his guilt or the f\u00edne. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-19\">We have jurisdiction and discretion to reduce or eliminate sanctions imposed by the SEC. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78y(a)(l); <em>McCarthy v. SEC, </em>406 F.3d 179, 188 (2d Cir.2005). However, we will only do so if we conclude that they are \u201cexcessive\u201d or do not \u201cserve [their] intended purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review such sanctions for abuse of discretion, which occurs only when a sanction is \u201cpalpably disproportionate to the violation\u201d or when the SEC fails \u201cto support the sanction chosen with a meaningful statement of findings and conclusions, and the reasons or basis therefor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-20\">The suspension imposed by the SEC was at the lower end of the range suggested by the FINRA Sanctions Guidelines for non-egregious reckless misrepresentations. The SEC reasonably concluded that Glodek had evinced a pattern of violative conduct (making at least fourteen misrepresentations over a period of six weeks), that his misrepresentations involved promoting a company in which he had a significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>financial interest, and that he did not adequately appreciate the seriousness of his conduct. As a result, the sanctions imposed cannot be described as \u201cexcessive\u201d or \u201cpalpably disproportionate to the violation,\u201d <em>id., </em>and were firmly within the SEC\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Likewise, the SEC\u2019s opinion was thorough and cogent, providing findings and conclusions to support the imposed sanctions and offering reasons and analysis to support those conclusions. The opinion carefully considered the particular facts of Glodek\u2019s case and explicitly analyzed and applied the relevant FINRA Sanctions Guidelines factors. The opinion justified the level of sanctions by the need to protect the general investing public through specific and general deterrence. The sanctions imposed were supported by a \u201cmeaningful statement of findings and conclusions, and the reasons or basis therefor\u201d and were rooted in the \u201cremedial\u201d purpose of protecting investors. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, the SEC did not abuse its discretion in imposing a six-month suspension on Glodek.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">We hereby DENY Glodek\u2019s petition for review of the SEC\u2019s order and opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
