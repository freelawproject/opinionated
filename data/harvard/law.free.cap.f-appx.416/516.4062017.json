MARTIN, JR., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">Allstate Insurance Company denied Douglas Ramsey\u2019s claim after a fire seriously damaged the house that he had inherited from his father. Although the district court correctly found that Douglas did not have an express insurance contract with Allstate, we REVERSE and REMAND for the district court to consider in the first instance whether Allstate received constructive notice of Douglas\u2019s father\u2019s death and is estopped from denying coverage, and whether the parties\u2019 conduct established an implied-in-fact contract between Douglas and Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">Douglas\u2019s father, Ralph Ramsey, purchased homeowner\u2019s insurance from Allstate in September of 1993 and renewed the policy annually until his death in August of 2002. Bank of America had a mortgage on the house and paid the insurance premiums from Ralph\u2019s account. After Ralph died, Bank of America continued to pay the insurance premiums, but did so from Douglas\u2019s account. Allstate continued to renew the insurance coverage but never named Douglas on the policy. The policy states in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b540-12\">Policy Transfer</p>\n<p id=\"b540-13\">You may not transfer this policy to another person without our written consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-14\">Continued Coverage After Your Death</p>\n<p id=\"b540-15\">If you die, coverage will continue until the end of the premium period for:</p>\n<p id=\"b540-16\">1) your legal representative while acting as such, but only with respect to the residence premises and property covered under this policy on the date of your death.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-17\">2) an insured person, and any person having proper temporary custody of your property until a legal representative is appointed and qualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-18\">There is no evidence that Douglas ever directly notified Allstate of Ralph\u2019s passing. Douglas alleges that he informed Bank of America and Bank of America continued to pay the insurance premiums, renewing the policy in Ralph\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-19\">After the fire on June 26, 2008, Allstate took possession of the home, inspected it, and boarded it up. Allstate put Douglas\u2019s salvageable property in storage and paid him $500 to cover initial expenses. However, on July 20, Allstate sent Douglas a letter stating that it would not cover the loss from the fire. There are no allegations of any improprieties, but Allstate dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>covered that the policy was still only in Ralph\u2019s name. Therefore, Allstate determined that it had no obligation to cover the loss to what was now Douglas\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">After Allstate denied coverage, the policy automatically renewed once again in September of 2008. However, Allstate argues that this renewal, after it had learned of Ralph\u2019s death, was inadvertent. Allstate canceled the policy when it discovered the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The district court granted Allstate\u2019s motion for summary judgment holding that under the terms of the insurance contract, coverage ceased at the end of the premium period following Ralph\u2019s death. The district court found that Douglas did not notify Allstate of Ralph\u2019s death before the fire and, even if he had provided notice, the loss is still not covered because the policy is not transferrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">A. Summary Judgment Standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">\u201cThe Sixth Circuit reviews de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Hamilton v. Starcom Mediavest Group, Inc., </em>522 F.3d 623, 627 (6th Cir. 2008). Summary judgment is proper where \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a); <em>see Hamilton, </em>522 F.3d at 627. \u201cThe moving party has the initial burden of proving that no genuine issue of material fact exists,\u201d and the court must draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Vaughn v. Lawrenceburg Power Sys., </em>269 F.3d 703, 710 (6th Cir.2001). When a motion for summary judgment is properly made and supported and the nonmoving party fails to respond with a showing sufficient to establish an essential element of its case, summary judgment is appropriate. <em>See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). Because jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship, the substantive law of Ohio applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">B. Whether There is an Express Insurance Contract Between Douglas and Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">According to the terms of the policy, Ralph\u2019s express insurance contract with Allstate terminated at the end of the first premium period following his death. Douglas could not renew the policy on behalf of Ralph, the named insured, because Ralph had passed away. Additionally, Douglas could not assume the policy because the contract contained an anti-assignment clause, and provisions prohibiting assignment are valid and enforceable, <em>see Pilkington N. Am., Inc. v. Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>2006-Ohio-6551, 112 Ohio St.3d 482, 861 N.E.2d 121, at \u00b6\u00b6 36-39 (noting that an assignment could dramatically alter the insurer\u2019s exposure). Therefore, the district court correctly held that Douglas does not have any viable claim under the express terms of Ralph\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-13\">Douglas argues that he became an insured person under Ralph\u2019s policy when he moved into the house before Ralph died. While Douglas did meet the policy\u2019s definition of an insured person, the express insurance contract terminated at the end of the premium period following Ralph\u2019s death. Therefore, the district court correctly concluded that this is not a basis for finding Douglas covered. Douglas ceased to be an insured person under Ralph\u2019s policy when the policy terminated at the end of the premium period following Ralph\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-14\">C. Whether Allstate Received Constructive Notice of Ralph\u2019s Death.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-15\">The district court correctly found that there is no evidence to suggest that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Douglas directly notified Allstate of Ralph\u2019s passing. However, the district court failed to consider whether Allstate is estopped from denying coverage because it received constructive notice of Ralph\u2019s death. The doctrine of equitable estoppel is not directly applicable but generally prevents a party who made a representation from later denying it if the other party relied on the representation. <em>Hortman v. Miamisburg, </em>2006-Ohio-4251, 110 Ohio St.3d 194, 852 N.E.2d 716, at \u00b6 20 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Although Douglas notified the mortgage holder, the district court appears to have correctly concluded that there is no evidence in the record from which it may conclude that he directly notified Allstate. However, Ralph\u2019s estate went through probate proceedings and Douglas took title to the home, which may have provided Allstate with constructive notice of Ralph\u2019s death. Therefore, we remand for the district court to consider whether Allstate received constructive notice of Ralph\u2019s death and, if it did, whether it is estopped from denying coverage to Douglas.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">D. The Terms of the Policy Do Not Explicitly End All Liability After the Named Insured Dies.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The Ohio Court of Appeals recently provided an informative summary of the procedure to follow when interpreting insurance policies in <em>Allstate Insurance Co. v. Eyster, </em>2010-Ohio-3673, 189 Ohio App.3d 640, 939 N.E.2d 1274, at \u00b6\u00b6 17-20 (2010). Insurance policies are contracts, the proper interpretation of which is a question of law for the court. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 17, 939 N.E.2d 1274 (citing <em>Sharonville v. Am. Emp. Ins. Co., </em>2006-Ohio-2180, 109 Ohio St.3d 186, 846 N.E.2d 833, at \u00b6 6 (2006)). The scope of coverage is determined by construing the contract \u201cin conformity with the intention of the parties as gathered from the ordinary and commonly understood meaning of the language employed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>King v. Nationwide Ins. Co., </em>35 Ohio St.3d 208, 519 N.E.2d 1380, 1383 (1988)) (internal quotation marks omitted). When the contract \u201cis reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation, it will be strictly construed against the insurer and in favor of the insured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Initially, the insured bears the burden of proving that the policy covers the claimed loss. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 20 (citing <em>Chicago Title Ins. Co. v. Huntington Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>87 Ohio St.3d 270, 719 N.E.2d 955, 959 (1999)). However, if an insurer denies coverage based on a policy exclusion, the insurer bears the burden of demonstrating that the exclusion applies. <em>Id. </em>Ohio courts presume that coverage applies unless it is clearly excluded. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">Allstate argues that the policy\u2019s provision describing coverage after the death of the named insured precludes it from any liability in this case. Although the policy specifically describes what happens when the policyholder dies, that provision is for the benefit of the insured. Contrary to Allstate\u2019s position in this case, this provision appears to be designed to clarify that the policy does <em>not </em>automatically terminate on the policy holder\u2019s death. Without this provision, if the insured\u2019s property was damaged shortly after the policyholder died, the insurance company might not be required to cover the loss. However, this term clarifies that the policy continues for as long as it can \u2014 the end of the premium period.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">We agree that this provision terminated Ralph\u2019s express insurance contract with Allstate at the end of the first premium period following his death. However, in light of Ohio\u2019s policy of construing insurance contracts against the insurance company and placing the burden on the insurance company to demonstrate that an exception applies, <em>see, e.g., Andersen v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number><em>Highland House Co., </em>93 Ohio St.3d 547, 757 N.E.2d 329, 332-33 (2001), we cannot conclude that this clause excludes any possibility of Allstate being responsible for coverage on an estoppel or implied contract theory after Ralph\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">E. Whether There Is an Implied Contract Between Douglas and Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The district court did not consider whether the parties\u2019 conduct entitled Douglas to relief based on an implied contract theory. While Douglas has not specifically pled a cause of action based on an implied contract, the complaint appears to sufficiently set forth the basis for and the facts underlying such a claim. <em>Cf. Randleman v. Fid. Nat\u2019l Title Ins. Co., </em>465 F. Supp.2d 812, 818 (N.D.Ohio 2006) (considering cause of action based on an implied contract even though not expressly pled in the complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Ohio recognizes implied-in-fact contracts. <em>Legros v. Tarr, </em>44 Ohio St.3d 1, 540 N.E.2d 257, 263 (1989). In order to find a contract implied in fact, the surrounding circumstances must be such that the court can infer a contract exists as a matter of tacit understanding between the parties. <em>Id. </em>Whether there is an implied contract turns on the facts of the particular case. <em>See Reali, Giampetro &amp; Scott v. Soc. Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>133 Ohio App.3d 844, 729 N.E.2d 1259, 1264 (1999). The Ohio Court of Appeals has noted that \u201c[b]ecause the existence of an implied in fact contract requires crucial factual determinations regarding the intent and thought process of the parties, deference must be paid by a reviewing court to the trial court\u2019s determinations.\u201d <em>Fouty v. Ohio Dep\u2019t Youth Servs., </em>2006-Ohio-2957, 167 Ohio App.3d 508, 855 N.E.2d 909, at \u00b6 57 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">We remand this matter for the district court to consider whether the facts of this case \u2014 particularly Douglas\u2019s continued payment of the insurance premiums, and Allstate\u2019s issuance of renewed insurance policies \u2014 created an implied contract between Douglas and Allstate to insure the house. If the facts warrant, finding an implied contract in this case would not be inconsistent with Ohio cases, which have found implied contracts to exist between parties other than those named on an express contract. <em>Cf. Randleman, </em>465 F.Supp.2d at 816 (holding that the complaint stated a claim for breach of an implied contract where the plaintiffs were not named insureds and could not recover under the express title insurance policy); <em>Capella III, L.L. C. v. Wilcox, </em>2010-Ohio-4746, 190 Ohio App.3d 133, 940 N.E.2d 1026, at \u00b6 18 (2010) (implying contract between a holdover tenant and landlord when original lease had multiple tenants). Here, Douglas paid the annual insurance premiums through Bank of America, and Allstate issued renewed policies. After the fire, Allstate appears to have acted as if the house were insured by taking possession, boarding it up, and writing Douglas a check to cover initial expenses. Therefore, we remand the matter for the district court to determine whether there is a contract implied in fact between Douglas and Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">While Ralph\u2019s express insurance contract prohibits assignment, finding that there is an implied contract between Douglas and Allstate is not an assignment but an entirely new contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">Although Douglas does not have a claim based on an express contract theory, the district court failed to consider fully whether Allstate received constructive notice of Ralph\u2019s death and whether there is an implied in fact contract between Douglas and Allstate. Therefore, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s order dismiss<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>ing the case with prejudice and REMAND the matter for the district court to consider in the first instance whether Allstate received constructive notice of Ralph\u2019s death estopping it from denying coverage, and whether there is an implied-in-fact contract to provide insurance coverage between the parties.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
