For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-27\">Since we write primarily for the parties, we need not set forth the factual history of this case in detail.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Williams filed a motion to suppress all evidence seized during the multiple searches of the house that resulted in him entering a conditional guilty plea to violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e). The plea was entered after the district court partially denied his motion to suppress physical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Williams argues that: (1) the district court erred in finding that the first search warrant was supported by probable cause; and (2) the <em>Leon </em>\u201cgood faith\u201d exception to the exclusionary rule does not apply. <em>See United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 925, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984) (holding that courts can \u201creject suppression motions posing no important Fourth Amendment questions by turning immediately to a consideration of the officers\u2019 good faith.\u201d). However, since the application of <em>Leon </em>is determinative, we need not decide if the warrants were supported by probable cause. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>3 F.3d 69, 73 (3d Cir.1993) (finding that even if an affidavit lacked probable cause, the good faith exception would require reversal of a district court\u2019s suppression order).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">\u201cSuppression ... is inappropriate when an officer executes a search in objectively reasonable reliance on a warrant\u2019s authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74; <em>accord Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 920, 104 S.Ct. 3405. This Court has determined that the exception to the exclusionary rule is appropriate because \u201c[i]n the ordinary case, an officer cannot be expected to question the magistrate\u2019s probable cause determination.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>3 F.3d at 74 (quoting <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 921, 104 S.Ct. 3405).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Nevertheless, the exception does not always apply, even when a search is supported by a search warrant. For example, it does not apply where an affidavit in support of the warrant contains knowingly or recklessly false information. <em>See Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 923, 104 S.Ct. 3405 (\u201cSuppression remains an appropriate remedy if the magistrate or judge in issuing a warrant was misled by information in an affidavit that the affiant knew was false.... \u201d). Similarly, \u201cin cases where the magistrate wholly abandon[s] his judicial role,\u201d or when an affidavit is \u201cso lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable,\u201d the good faith exception does not apply. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">Williams argues that the affidavit was misleading because it included the statement from Paul\u2019s daughter that suggested a gun was in the house. However, the daughter\u2019s statement was not false. To the contrary, the officers\u2019 search did reveal a gun in the master bedroom, which is exactly where the daughter suggested looking.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">Williams also argues that the good faith exception should not apply because the affidavit was \u201cbare bones.\u201d As we have just explained, the good faith exception does not apply when an affidavit is \u201cso lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.\u201d <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 923, 104 S.Ct. 3405. Here, however, the affidavit recounted the officers\u2019 response to the domestic violence call, and explained why the officers believed that evidence of domestic violence would be found inside Williams\u2019 home. Thus, the district court did not err in concluding that the <em>Leon </em>exception negated application of the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Williams\u2019 request to suppress evidence pursuant to the search warrants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-28\">.
