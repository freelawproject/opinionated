He argues that the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d) should apply retroactively to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Congress passed the FSA, Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372, after Alexander had been sentenced and had filed his appeal. As a result of that act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) now requires that a defendant possess over 280 grams of crack cocaine, rather than 50 grams, for the 10-year mandatory minimum to apply. Alexander claims that the act is retroactive and that he should be resentenced under the new statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">This claim is without merit. The FSA does not apply retroactively to defendants, like Alexander, who were sentenced before its enactment. <em>See United States v. Doggins, </em>633 F.3d 379, 384 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b495-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
