Pacific cross appeals on multiple grounds. We affirm the district court\u2019s ruling in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 1021 \u201crecognizes that attorney fees incurred in prosecuting or defending an action may be recovered as costs ... when they are otherwise authorized by statute or by the parties\u2019 agreement.\u201d <em>Santisas v. Goodin, </em>17 Cal.4th 599, 71 Cal.Rptr.2d 830, 951 P.2d 399, 404 n. 4 (1998). When parties contractually allocate attorneys\u2019 fees, California Civil Code \u00a7 1717 ensures that such attorneys\u2019 fees provisions apply reciprocally such that if a party to an action would be entitled to fees under the contract\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees provision if successful, the adverse party must also be eligible for fees if it prevails. <em>T.E.D. Bearing Co. v. Walter E. Heller &amp; Co., </em>38 Cal.App.3d 59, 112 Cal.Rptr. 910, 913-14 (1974). Ensuring mutuality in attorneys\u2019 fees provisions is the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of \u00a7 1717. <em>Id. </em>at 913. By its terms, \u00a7 1717 applies \u201c[i]n any action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that attorney\u2019s fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party.\u201d The MSO Agreement provides for fees incurred to \u201csecure, defend, or protect\u201d rights under the MSO Agreement to be awarded to the \u201cprevailing party,\u201d and thus \u00a7 1717 applies, at minimum,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to all claims in which at least one of the parties is attempting to \u201csecure, defend, or protect\u201d rights under the MSO Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Although Shell prevailed on its breach of contract claim, the district court was within its discretion to find that Shell was not the prevailing party under California Civil Code \u00a7 1717. Section 1717(b)(1) provides that a court \u201cmay ... determine that there is no party prevailing on the contract for purposes of this section.\u201d While this provision does not grant the district judge unlimited discretion, because this case did not result in a \u201csimple, unqualified win\u201d for Shell, the district court was permitted to determine that Shell was not the prevailing party. <em>See Hsu v. Abbara, </em>9 Cal.4th 863, 39 Cal.Rptr.2d 824, 891 P.2d 804, 811-13 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">The district court also did not err in finding Pacific to be the prevailing party under \u00a7 1717. Had Shell prevailed in defending against Pacific\u2019s fraud claim, it would have successfully \u201csecure[d], defended], or protect[ed]\u201d its rights under the MSO Agreement and therefore would have been eligible for attorneys\u2019 fees under the attorneys\u2019 fees provision in the MSO Agreement. Section 1717\u2019s mutuality principle dictates that Pacific\u2019s fraud claims count as \u201con a contract\u201d under \u00a7 1717 and the court was permitted to award attorneys\u2019 fees to Pacific for its successful claim. <em>See Santisas, </em>71 Cal. Rptr.2d 830, 951 P.2d at 407 (\u201c[Section 1717 permits [a] party\u2019s recovery of attorney fees whenever the opposing parties would have been entitled to attorney fees under the contract had they prevailed.\u201d); <em>Dell Merk, </em>33 Cal.Rptr.3d at 702 (\u201cIf Bank would have been legally entitled to fees if it had prevailed, Franzia would be entitled to its fees for defending Bank\u2019s action when Bank lost.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">This result accords with the substantial discretion provided trial courts in allocating attorneys\u2019 fees by both California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>courts and the Ninth Circuit, as well as with courts\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 1717. <em>See Hsu, </em>39 Cal.Rptr.2d 824, 891 P.2d at 813 (\u201c[I]n determining litigation success, courts should respect substance rather than form, and to this extent should be guided by \u2018equitable considerations.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Berkla v. Corel Corp., </em>302 F.3d 909, 920 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201c[I]t is clear from <em>Hsu </em>that a court is entitled to ... evaluate litigation success in light of the party\u2019s overall demands and objectives.\u201d); <em>Dell Merk, </em>33 Cal.Rptr.3d at 703 (\u201cCalifornia courts liberally construe the term \u2018on a contract\u2019 as used within section 1717. As long as the action \u2018involve[s]\u2019 a contract it is \u2018on [the] contract\u2019 within the meaning of Section 1717.\u201d (internal citation and quotations omitted)); <em>Barrientos v. 1801-1825 Morton LLC, </em>583 F.3d 1197, 1216 (9th Cir. 2009) (\u201c[Section 1717\u2019s \u2018action on a contract\u2019] provision is interpreted liberally.\u201d); <em>Pirkig v. Dennis, </em>215 Cal.App.3d 1560, 264 Cal.Rptr. 494, 499 (1989) (upholding attorneys\u2019 fees awarded under \u00a7 1717 for a negligent misrepresentation claim seeking damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">It is well established that a claimant \u201cmay not receive multiple awards for the same item of damage.\u201d <em>Ambassador Hotel Co., Ltd. v. Wei-Chuan Investment, </em>189 F.3d 1017, 1032 (9th Cir.1999); <em>see also Tavaglione v. Billings, </em>4 Cal.4th 1150, 17 Cal.Rptr.2d 608, 847 P.2d 574, 580 (1993) (\u201cRegardless of the nature or number of legal theories advanced by the plaintiff, he is not entitled to more than a single recovery for each distinct item of compensable damage supported by the evidence.\u201d). Whether a jury award is duplicative is a legal question. <em>See DuBarry Intemat., Inc. v. Southwest Forest Industries, Inc., </em>231 Cal.App.3d 552, 282 Cal. Rptr. 181, 189 (1991). Pacific\u2019s claims for concealment and intentional misrepresentation were presented as a single claim, based on the same facts, and based on the same alleged damages. As such, the district court did not err in finding the two awards to be duplicative as a matter of law. <em>See Id. </em>(finding separate awards for breach of contract and bad faith denial of contract both based on lost commissions to be \u201cduplicative as a matter of law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Pacific contends that Shell\u2019s successful affirmative defense of Pacific\u2019s breach of contract claim should be barred under the election of remedies doctrine, arguing that Shell \u201ctwice affirmed\u201d the MSO Agreement \u2014 first by suing Pacific in state court for breach of the MSO Agreement, and second by pursuing its breach of contract counterclaim to recover fees relating to that state court proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">We have held that \u201celection is the exercise of a choice of an alternate and inconsistent right or course of action,\u201d and that \u201c[f]ull knowledge of the nature of the inconsistent rights and the necessity of choosing between them are elements of election.\u201d <em>In re Mann Farms, Inc., </em>917 F.2d 1210, 1213 (9th Cir.1990). Pacific presented no evidence that Shell was aware of the fraud at the time of the state court action. As such, Shell\u2019s pursuit of the state claim did not constitute election. Because its breach of contract counterclaim arose out of that state court proceeding, Shell\u2019s fraud defense was a mere change in remedies, which did not trigger the election of remedies doctrine \u201cunless the change involves a prejudice to the losing party.\u201d <em>California Golf L.L. C. v. Cooper, </em>163 Cal.App.4th 1053, 78 Cal. Rptr.3d 153, 164 (2008). There was no prejudice here. Indeed, it would be unjust to deny Shell fees to which it was contractually entitled in a completed litigation based on a subsequent finding that it had been the victim of fraud. Conversely, it would be unjust to deny Shell an affirmative defense based on that fraud simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>because it asserted its contractual entitlement to attorneys\u2019 fees on its earlier, successful breach of contract suit, executed without knowledge of the fraud. Moreover, it is well established that a party may rescind a contract and still recover attorneys\u2019 fees under the rescinded contract. <em>See Santisas, </em>71 Cal.Rptr.2d 830, 951 P.2d at 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">We understand Pacific\u2019s claim for disgorgement of profits earned under the MSO Agreement to refer to the rule that a rescinding party must \u201c[r]estore to the other party everything of value which he has received from him under the contract or offer to restore the same upon condition that the other party do likewise, unless the latter is unable or positively refuses to do so.\u201d California Civil Code \u00a7 1691(b). There is simply no support for the proposition that a party found to have committed fraud is entitled to the adverse party\u2019s profits. With respect to restoring to the other party everything of value received under the contract, Shell has already been ordered to pay Pacific an amount greater than what it received from Pacific. Moreover, it is not clear that restoration is required when a party rescinds as a defense. <em>See McCauley v. Dennis, </em>220 Cal. App.2d 627, 34 Cal.Rptr. 90, 93 (1963) (\u201c[A] person who has been fraudulently induced to enter into a contract ... may set up the fraud as a partial defense or counterclaim without any offer of restitution.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Pacific is not entitled to pre-judgment interest under either California Rule of Court 3.1802 or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961. For Rule 3.1802 to apply, interest must have been included in the award, which was not the case here. <em>Pellegrini v. Weiss, </em>165 Cal.App.4th 515, 81 Cal.Rptr.3d 387, 403 (2008). While it was once the case that interest accrued from the date of verdict under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 when judgment was delayed after damages had been assessed, <em>see Turner v. Japan Lines, Ltd., </em>702 F.2d 752, 756-57 (9th Cir.1983), that rule has since been overturned by the Supreme Court. <em>Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp. v. Bonjorno, </em>494 U.S. 827, 835, 110 S.Ct. 1570, 108 L.Ed.2d 842 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Because the fees awarded to Shell arising out of the state litigation were awarded by the jury as damages, they need only be supported by substantial evidence. <em>Wilson v. County of Orange, </em>169 Cal.App.4th 1185, 87 Cal.Rptr.3d 439, 442 (2009). California Civil Procedure Code \u00a7 1033.5 and California Rule of Court 3.1072 do not apply. Viewing \u201cthe evidence in the light most favorable to [Shell], giving it the benefit of every reasonable inference and resolving all conflicts in its favor,\u201d we find that there was substantial evidence supporting the jury\u2019s award. <em>Wilson, </em>87 Cal. Rptr.3d at 442. The district court therefore did not err in denying Pacific\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b630-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-7\">. Some authorities suggest that \u00a7 1717 applies to an even broader swath of claims. <em>See, e.g., Dell Merk, Inc. v. Franzia, </em>132 Cal. App.4th 443, 33 Cal.Rptr.3d 694, 703 (2005) (\u201cAs long as the action \u2018involve[s]\u2019 a contract it is \u2018on [the] contract\u2019 within the meaning of Section 1717.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b633-10\">McKEOWN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ABD\">concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">I concur in the majority\u2019s disposition except with respect to the award of attorneys\u2019 fees to Pacific Fuel Company. By its terms, California Civil Code \u00a7 1717 applies only to actions \u201con a contract.\u201d <em>See </em>Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1717 (\u201cIn any action <em>on a contract, </em>where the contract specifically provides that attorney\u2019s fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded ... then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract ... shall be entitled to ... attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d) (emphasis added). California courts have consistently held that a fraud claim seeking damages sounds in tort, and is not \u201con a contract\u201d for the purposes of section 1717. <em>Loube v. Loube, </em>64 Cal.App.4th 421, 74 Cal.Rptr.2d 906, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>906 (1998). A tort claim cannot be converted into a contract claim simply because it is related to a contract. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
