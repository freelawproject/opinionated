In her petition, Arteaga argues that: (1) she is <em>prima facie </em>eligible for a \u00a7 212(h) waiver because she adjusted her status to a lawful permanent resident (\u201cLPR\u201d), rather than being admitted as an LPR; and (2) alternatively, assuming the eligibility requirements apply, she argues that the BIA erred in determining that she was ineligible for \u00a7 212(h) relief as she had not been convicted of an aggravated felony and had lawfully resided in the United States for a continuous seven years before the commencement of her removal proceedings. After thorough review, we grant the petition and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Because the BIA issued its own opinion without expressly adopting the IJ\u2019s opinion or reasoning, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Zhang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir.2009). We review questions of law, including the BIA\u2019s statutory interpretations, <em>de novo. Jaggernauth v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>432 F.3d 1346, 1350 (11th Cir.2005). However, following the principles of <em>Chevron </em>deference, when we review the BIA\u2019s construction of a statute that it administers, we \u201cwill defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of [the] statute if it is reasonable and does not contradict the clear intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Quinchia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>552 F.3d 1255, 1258 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">In general, INA \u00a7 212(a) lists the classes of aliens who are inadmissible to the United States and ineligible to receive visas. It provides that individuals who have committed crimes of moral turpitude are inadmissible. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). Nevertheless, Section 212(h)(1)(B) gives the Attorney General discretion to waive inadmissibility in the case of an alien who is the spouse or parent of a U.S. citizen, if the alien establishes that the denial of her admission will result in extreme hardship to the U.S. citizen. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h)(1)(B). However, \u00a7 212(h) limits that discretion and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-8\">[n]o waiver shall be granted under this subsection in the ease of an alien who has previously been <em>admitted </em>to the United States as an alien <em>lawfully admitted for permanent residence </em>if either since the date of such admission the alien has been convicted of an aggravated felony or the alien has not lawfully resided continuously in the United States for a period of not less than 7 years immediately preceding the date of initiation of proceedings to remove the alien from the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">Section 101(a)(13)(A) of the INA defines the term \u201cadmitted\u201d as \u201cthe lawful entry of the alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(A). \u201cThe term \u2018lawfully admitted for permanent residence\u2019 means the status of having been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the United States as an immigrant in accordance with the immigration laws, such status not having changed.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(20). Finally, INA \u00a7 245\u00ae provides that for adjustment in status of aliens physically present in the United States, but who entered the United States without inspection, the alien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>\u201cmay apply to the Attorney General for the adjustment of his or her status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">We recently held, in <em>Lanier v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>631 F.3d 1363, 1366-67 (11th Cir. 2011), that under the plain language of the statute, \u201c\u00a7 212(h) provides that a person must have physically entered the United States, after inspection, as a lawful permanent resident in order to have \u2018previously been admitted to the United States as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>We therefore concluded that Section 212(h)\u2019s \u201cstatutory bar to relief does not apply to those persons who ... adjusted to lawful permanent resident status while already living in the United States.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">In this case, Arteaga entered the United States without inspection on or about November 27, 1988, and was granted LPR status in the United States on August 27, 1999. Thereafter, Arteaga was convicted of conspiring to commit and committing bank fraud \u2014 which is considered to be a crime involving moral turpitude for purposes of the INA. However, because, as in <em>Lanier, </em>Arteaga adjusted status post entry to that of an LPR, she is not subject to the eligibility requirements of \u00a7 212(h). Accordingly, Arteaga remains eligible for discretionary relief under Section 212(h)(1)(B), which gives the Attorney General discretion to waive inadmissibility in the case of an alien who is the spouse or parent of a U.S. citizen, if the alien establishes that the denial of her admission will result in extreme hardship to the U.S. citizen. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h)(1)(B). We therefore grant Lanier\u2019s petition for review, and remand for the BIA to determine in the first instance whether Arteaga is entitled to \u00a7 212(h) relief as a matter of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">PETITION GRANTED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b844-6\">. As an initial matter, we consider our jurisdiction to review the issues presented. Notably, we issued jurisdictional questions to the parties and both parties responded that we retain jurisdiction to review Arteaga\u2019s petition, as she presents purely legal issues concerning her eligibility for a \u00a7 212(h) waiver. We agree. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
