Following a <em>Fatico </em>hearing, see <em>United States v. Fatico, </em>603 F.2d 1053 (2d Cir.1979), held to resolve disputed factual issues concerning Hernandez\u2019s so-called safety valve eligibility under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f), the district court found Hernandez was an \u201corganizer or leader\u201d of criminal activity under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) and thus ineligible for safety valve relief. The district court subsequently imposed a below-Guidelines concurrent sentence of 150 months\u2019 imprisonment on each count, to be followed by two five-year terms of supervised relief, which also are to run concurrently. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">On appeal, Hernandez argues principally that (1) the district court committed plain error by placing the burden of proof on Hernandez, rather than on the government, to establish that he was not \u201can organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of others in the offense\u201d pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(4); (2) the court also committed plain error by requiring him to testify at the <em>Fatico </em>hearing in violation of his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination; and (3) his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance at the <em>Fatico </em>hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We consider each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">First, we begin by noting the record is not clear as to whether the district court in fact placed the burden on Hernandez to prove his eligibility for safety valve relief. Assuming arguendo the court\u2019s requirement that Hernandez testify at the <em>Fatico </em>hearing did place the burden on him, we conclude that action does not constitute plain error. Hernandez contends that because safety valve eligibility in this case depends exclusively on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(4), which incorporates an enhancement provision of the Sentencing Guidelines, the initial burden should have been on the government to prove the application of the enhancement. Specifically, under the statute it is a prerequisite for safety-valve relief that the \u201cdefendant was not an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of others in the offense, as <em>determined under the sentencing guidelines.\u201d </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(4) (emphasis added). Guideline \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(4) employs the same language, and in an application note explains that it \u201cmeans a defendant who receives an adjustment for an aggravating role under \u00a7 3B1.1.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.1 cmt. n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">\u201cAs a rule, a defendant bears the burden of proving that he has met all five safety valve criteria to qualify for sentencing pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) rather than a mandatory statutory minimum.\u201d <em>United States v. Holguin, </em>436 F.3d 111, 119 (2d Cir.2006) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). On the other hand, \u201c[u]nder the Guidelines, it is the government\u2019s burden to prove [by a preponderance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the evidence] that a defendant qualifies for a leadership role enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although we recognized in <em>Holguin </em>that the cross-reference to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 creates uncertainty about where the burden lies with respect to the fourth criterion for safety valve relief, we did not resolve the issue at that time, and we decline to do so now. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">As this Court has yet to address the issue, the district court\u2019s placing the burden on the defendant to prove eligibility for safety valve purposes cannot constitute plain error. <em>See United States v. Kaiser, </em>609 F.3d 556, 565 (2d Cir.2010) (under plain error standard, defendant must demonstrate that any error is \u201cclear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute\u201d). Moreover, as the government argues, the allocation of the burden is not a determinative factor in this case. In light of the court\u2019s credibility determinations and factual findings, the record evidence amply supports that Hernandez was an \u201corganizer or leader\u201d in the drug conspiracy and thus any burden shifting error did not affect Hernandez\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Marcus, </em>628 F.3d 36, 42 (2d Cir.2010) (stating error affects substantial rights when it affects the outcome of the district court proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Second, we consider Hernandez\u2019s assertion that, regardless of whether he shouldered the burden of proof, the district court violated his Fifth Amendment right not to testify at sentencing when it forced him to take the stand to contest the aggravating role enhancement. <em>See Mitchell v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 314, 322, 326, 119 S.Ct. 1307, 143 L.Ed.2d 424 (1999) (Fifth Amendment provides a \u201csafeguard against judicially coerced self-disclosure\u201d that extends to sentencing (internal quotation marks omitted)). He argues this directive was especially egregious since the court ultimately punished him on the basis of that testimony. We find no error, plain or otherwise, in the district court\u2019s requirement that Hernandez testify at the <em>Fatico </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">In the apparent hope of distinguishing contrary authority, Hernandez argues that because the government objected to safety valve eligibility on the basis of his leadership role, the court had no basis for directing him to take the stand and proffer his knowledge of the charged offense. By grounding his Fifth Amendment argument in the court\u2019s requirement that he testify to challenge the leadership role enhancement and not his safety valve eligibility, Hernandez invites us to lose sight of the forest for the trees. Hernandez requested a <em>Fatico </em>hearing because he wanted to demonstrate that he had \u201ccomplied with the five requisites to get to the safety valve.\u201d The fact that the government argued Hernandez was ineligible for safety valve relief based on his role in the offense does not somehow absolve him from proving his eligibility with respect to the remaining \u00a7 3553(f) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">The law is clear that every defendant seeking the benefit of safety valve relief must meet five specific requirements, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(1) \u2014 (5), including that defendant provide a truthful proffer to the government about \u201call he knows concerning both his involvement and that of any co-conspirators,\u201d <em>United States v. Ortiz, </em>136 F.3d 882, 883 (2d Cir.1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). This proffer requirement clearly includes the defendant\u2019s role in the offense. Additionally, the law is also clear that the safety valve proffer requirement does not contravene the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. <em>See United States v. Cruz, </em>156 F.3d 366, 374-75 (2d Cir.1998). Because Hernandez chose to contest his eligibility for safety valve relief at a <em>Fatico </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>hearing \u2014 a decision we note occurred after much equivocation and the day before sentencing \u2014 the district court did not violate his Fifth Amendment rights by requiring him to testify in order to demonstrate his qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Third, Hernandez argues his former counsel was ineffective at the <em>Fatico </em>hearing for failing (1) to argue the government bore the burden of proving the role enhancement under \u00a7 3553(f)(4); (2) to challenge the court\u2019s determination that Hernandez was required to testify; (3) to object to the court\u2019s consideration of various pro se letters written by Hernandez to the court; (4) to \u201ccall into question\u201d certain statements that co-defendants had made about Hernandez in safety valve proffers with the government; and (5) failing to object to the government\u2019s proffer of the post-arrest Drug Enforcement Agency (\u201cDEA\u201d) interview with Hernandez. A defendant seeking to overturn a conviction on the ground of ineffective assistance must demonstrate both (1) that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); and (2) that counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness prejudiced the defendant such that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">This Court has expressed a \u201cbaseline aversion to resolving ineffectiveness claims on direct review.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>205 F.3d 23, 35 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 885, 121 S.Ct. 203, 148 L.Ed.2d 142 (2000). As the Supreme Court explained, \u201cin most cases a motion brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is preferable to direct appeal for deciding claims of ineffective-assistance,\u201d because the district court is the forum best suited to develop the facts necessary to evaluate such claims. <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504-05, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003). Following <em>Massaro, </em>we observed that ineffectiveness claims should only be resolved on direct appeal \u201cwhen their resolution is beyond any doubt or to do so would be in the interest of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Khedr, </em>343 F.3d 96, 100 (2d Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">In accord with our determinations of Hernandez\u2019s arguments regarding burden of proof and a Fifth Amendment violation, we hold that the first two bases offered by Hernandez in support of his ineffective assistance claim are without merit. Additionally, we hold that his counsel\u2019s failure to object to the court\u2019s consideration of Hernandez\u2019s various letters to the court as well as counsel\u2019s failure to \u201ccall into question\u201d statements co-defendants made about Hernandez also lack merit because Hernandez has failed to show prejudice given the district court\u2019s limited reliance on the letters and statements in reaching its decision. In the absence of a more fully developed record concerning the DEA\u2019s interview with Hernandez, however, we conclude that this issue would be better addressed in the first instance by the district court. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Iodice, </em>525 F.3d 179, 186 (2d Cir.2008). We therefore deny that portion of the appeal asserting this argument but do so without prejudice to it being raised in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">We have considered all of Hernandez\u2019s other contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit. For the reasons stated, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b114-8\">. Hernandez essentially concedes that he neither raised the burden of proof issue under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(4) below nor apprised the court that requiring him to testify at the <em>Fatico </em>hearing violated his Fifth Amendment rights. Because these issues were not raised in the district court, they are deemed forfeited unless our standard for plain error is met. <em>See United States v. Keppler, 2 </em>F.3d 21, 23 (2d Cir.1993); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
