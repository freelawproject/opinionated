R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b679-10\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">Alejandro Martinez Martinez, a native and citizen of Mexico, and his family, natives and citizens of Honduras, petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing their appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision denying their applications for cancellation of removal. Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo constitutional challenges to removal orders, <em>Lopez-Rodriguez v. Mukasey, </em>536 F.3d 1012, 1015 (9th Cir.2008), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-12\">Petitioners\u2019 due process argument regarding an alleged gap in the transcript fails because they have not demonstrated prejudice. <em>See Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (prejudice is required for a due process violation). Petitioners\u2019 argument that the IJ violated due process by failing to conduct a \u201cde novo\u201d evidentiary hearing is also unpersuasive because petitioners have not demonstrated that they were entitled to such a hearing or that any additional evidence would have affected the outcome of the proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-17\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary weighing of the evidence in support of the petitioners\u2019 cancellation of removal application. <em>See Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 775, 779 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that the \u201cmisapplication of case law\u201d may not be reviewed).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-18\">Petitioners\u2019 claim of agency bias is not supported by the record. Petitioners\u2019 contention that the IJ made an ad hoc adverse credibility determination is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b679-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
