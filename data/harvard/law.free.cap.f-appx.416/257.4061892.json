Counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), questioning whether the delay in executing the warrant violates Clark\u2019s right to due process under the Fifth Amendment and his right to a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment and the Speedy Trial Act. Clark has filed a pro se supplemental brief asserting that the Government has waived jurisdiction in this case by turning him over to state custody. Clark also contends that his term of supervised release has expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-20\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and counsel\u2019s and Clark\u2019s contentions on appeal. We find the claims raised to be without merit and have found no other meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying relief. <em>United States v. Clark, </em>No. 7:92-cr-00417-GRA-1, 2010 WL 2871108 (D.S.C. July 21, 2010). This court requires that counsel inform Clark in writing of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Clark requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Clark. Finally, we dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
