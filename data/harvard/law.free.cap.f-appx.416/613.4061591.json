He asserts that the immigration judge\u2019s (IJ) adverse credibility determination rendered at his 2004 hearing was caused in large part by the ineffective assistance of his retained counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">The record on its face amply demonstrates ineffective performance by Baghdasaryan\u2019s counsel, Gloria Weil-Herrera. <em>See Castillo-Perez v. INS, </em>212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir.2000). Corroborating evidence in the form of medical and other records was available before the hearing, yet Weil-Herrera failed to introduce it. The absence of corroboration was a key factor in the agency\u2019s failure to credit petitioner\u2019s testimony. Because ineffective assistance by counsel may have changed the outcome at the merits hearing, petitioner was denied due process. <em>See Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 793-94 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir.2004), <em>as amended, </em>404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">We grant the petition and remand for a new hearing and, therefore, do not reach the issue of credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">PETITION GRANTED AND CAUSE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b636-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
