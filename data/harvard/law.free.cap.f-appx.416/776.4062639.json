O\u2019BRIEN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b799-14\">Gregory D. Crosby appeals from his conviction for attempted bank robbery in violation of the first paragraph of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). He maintains a jury instruction permitted the jury to convict him based on <em>attempted </em>intimidation, without finding <em>actual </em>intimidation. He also claims there was insufficient evidence of actual intimidation to sustain the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-15\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b799-16\">On May 21, 2009, Crosby drove up to the drive-through window at a federally insured bank in Topeka, Kansas, and passed a note to the teller demanding cash. The robbery note read: \u201cThis is a robbery. Give me all large bills. 100s, 50s, no bait money, no alarms, and give note back and do it fast.\u201d R. Vol. 3 at 29-30. The bank lobby was closed. The teller did not dispense any money to Crosby, but discussed the note with his fellow tellers who set off the alarm, called the police, and jotted down Crosby\u2019s license number. When he did not receive any money after waiting for a minute or less, Crosby drove away from the bank. He was soon apprehended in a nearby store parking lot. When approached by police officers, he claimed he had a bomb in his ear and had placed another bomb in the federal courthouse. No bombs were found at either location.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-17\">At the conclusion of a jury trial, Crosby was convicted of two counts: attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), and giving false information, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1038. The district court sentenced him to 240 months on the attempted-robbery count and 22 months on the false-information count, to run consecutively, for a total of 262 months in prison.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-3\">\n<em>Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Crosby first argues Jury Instruction 7 improperly permitted the jury to convict upon proof of an attempt to intimidate the victims, rather than proof of actual intimidation as the statute requires. He did not raise this argument in the district court, however. We review for plain error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Teague, </em>443 F.3d 1310, 1314 (10th Cir.2006) (reviewing for plain error defendant\u2019s challenge to jury instruction where he had failed to object to it in district court).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-5\">To establish plain error, [Crosby] must show: (1) an error, (2) that is plain, which means clear or obvious under current law, and (3) that affects substantial rights. If he satisfies these criteria, this Court may exercise discretion to correct the error if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. The plain error standard presents a heavy burden for an appellant, one which is not often satisfied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-6\"><em>United States v. Hasan, </em>609 F.3d 1121, 1133 (10th Cir.2010) (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>accord United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-11\">The statutory language at issue reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-12\">Whoever, <em>by force and violence, or by intimidation, takes, or attempts to take, </em>from the person or presence of another ... any property or money or any other thing of value belonging to, or in the care, custody, control, management, or possession of, any bank, credit union, or any savings and loan association ... [s]hall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-13\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) (emphasis added). Jury Instruction 7 closely tracks the statute, saying the government was required to prove \u201cthe defendant attempted to take the money, property or thing of value by force and violence or intimidation.\u201d R. Vol. 1 at 56. Further, Jury Instruction 7 said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-14\">The \u201cintimidation\u201d must be caused by an act knowingly and intentionally done or statement knowing and intentionally made by the defendant, which was done or made in such a manner or under such circumstances that would produce such a reaction or such fear of bodily harm in a reasonable person. The government need not prove actual fear on the part of any person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-16\">In addition, Jury Instruction 8 explained, \u201cto prove an attempt, the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>ment must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) the defendant intended to commit the crime; and that (2) the defendant took a substantial step towards commission of that crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 58. Viewing instructions 7 &amp; 8 together, and with all the other instructions, they \u201caccurately state[d] the governing law and provide[d] the jury with an accurate understanding of the relevant legal standards and factual issues in the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Batton, </em>602 F.3d 1191, 1199 (10th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). As there was no instructional error our inquiry ends at the first step of plain error analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Crosby asserts the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for attempted bank robbery because the evidence did not prove actual intimidation. We review the sufficiency of evidence de novo, giving \u201cconsiderable deference to the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Mullins, </em>613 F.3d 1273, 1280 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 582, 178 L.Ed.2d 425 (2010). We view all of the evidence, \u201cas well as the reasonable inferences that could be drawn from it, in the light most favorable to the government. An inference is reasonable if the conclusion flows from logical and probabilistic reasoning.\u201d <em>United States v. Truong, </em>425 F.3d 1282, 1288 (10th Cir.2005) (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). While mere suspicion of guilt will not sustain the jury\u2019s verdict, we will affirm based on \u201cpermissible inferences the jury may draw from the evidence before it ... if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">In deciding whether there is sufficient evidence of intimidation to support a conviction of bank robbery under \u00a7 2113(a), we consider three factors: \u201c(1) whether the situation appeared dangerous, (2) whether the defendant intended to intimidate, and (3) whether the bank personnel were reasonable in their fear of death or injury.\u201d <em>United States v. Farrow, </em>277 F.3d 1260, 1268 n. 7 (10th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">\u201cWe have defined intimidation in the context of \u00a7 2113(a) as an act by defendant reasonably calculated to put another in fear, or conduct and words calculated to create the impression that any resistance or defiance by the individual would be met by force.\u201d <em>United States v. Valdez, </em>158 F.3d 1140, 1143 (10th Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, the two circuits holding \u201cactual intimidation\u201d is required for an attempted bank robbery conviction apply the reasonable-person standard when defining \u201cintimidation.\u201d <em>United States v. Thornton, </em>539 F.3d 741, 748 (7th Cir.2008) (defining \u201cintimidation\u201d as \u201csaying or doing something in such a way as would place a reasonable person in fear\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>United States v. Bellew, </em>369 F.3d 450, 453 (5th Cir.2004) (defining \u201cintimidation\u201d as \u201cwhen one individual acts in a manner that is reasonably calculated to put another in fear\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>The trial evidence concerning intimidation was presented by three bank employees working at or near the drive-through window. First, the drive-through teller who received the robbery note testified that although \u201cthere was no reason to give him any money ... because [the robber] was outside and [the bank employees] were inside,\u201d R. Vol. 3 at 28, the bank employees pulled the bait money to set off an alarm, called 911, and wrote down the license plate number of the robbery car. He also testified that the bank managers had told him the drive-through teller window was bullet-proof glass, he never saw a weapon, and the robber did not speak at all. When asked on cross-examination if the robber threatened him, the teller responded, \u201cNo, other than the note saying it\u2019s a robbery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">The other two bank employees testified similarly that they read the robbery note, and among them, pulled the bait money, called 911, and wrote down the car\u2019s license plate number. The robber drove off after waiting a minute or less. They also testified that they did not see a weapon. In response to a question asking whether the note conveyed any threat, the third employee answered, \u201cJust that he was trying to rob us.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">\u201cWe reverse a conviction only if no reasonable jury could have reached the challenged verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Hooks, </em>551 F.3d 1205, 1212 (10th Cir.2009). If there is a reasonable, not fanciful, basis for the jury\u2019s verdict, we must affirm. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>593 F.3d 752, 760-61 (8th Cir.) (\u201cEven if the evidence allowed another rational explanation, our review is strictly circumscribed by a necessary respect for the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 131 S.Ct. 259, 178 L.Ed.2d 172 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">The jury could have rationally concluded a reasonable person would have felt intimidated under the circumstances, whether or not the bank employees were, in fact, intimidated. The bank employees took seriously Crosby\u2019s robbery threat: they pulled the bait money to set off the alarm, called 911, and wrote down the license number of the car. A person in their position might reasonably have inferred Crosby had a weapon, even though one was not noticed, brandished or referenced, because he was in a vehicle where a weapon could well have been concealed. And even if the tellers were behind bullet-proof glass, as one of them understood, that would not undercut the reasonableness of a reasonable person\u2019s fear because firing a weapon at someone behind bullet-proof glass is \u201creasonably calculated to put life in danger.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>401 F.2d 746, 747 (2d Cir.1968) (per curiam) (holding defendant who shot at drive-up bank teller not entitled to defense that teller\u2019s life was never in danger because bullet failed to penetrate bullet-proof glass at teller window). In any event one need not be in a life-threatening situation to be intimidated. A reasonable fear of injury would be sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">Moreover, it seems quite clear that Crosby intended to intimidate. His later bomb threats confirm his intentions even if his actions at the bank were ambiguous as to his intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-12\">The evidence rationally supports the inferences that the situation appeared dangerous, Crosby intended to intimidate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>bank employees, and the bank employees reasonably feared injury or death. Accordingly, we cannot and will not disturb the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Crosby\u2019s motion to file a pro se supplemental brief is DENIED. Crosby\u2019s convictions and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b799-11\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties' request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b800-7\">. Crosby does not challenge his false-information conviction or his sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b800-8\">.

The government asserts any claimed error in the jury instruction was invited and this court should therefore decline to review it. An unpreserved error, when \"intentionally caused by the party claiming prejudice on appeal,\u201d is waived, and the party is not entitled to appellate relief. <em>United States v. Teague, </em>443 F.3d 1310, 1314 (10th Cir.2006). The record does not support a finding Crosby intentionally caused an error, however. There was no discussion about whether actual intimidation was required during the jury-instruction conference, or elsewhere. Simple neglect, as in failing to object to an instruction or acquiesce in one, is insufficient.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b801-8\">.
