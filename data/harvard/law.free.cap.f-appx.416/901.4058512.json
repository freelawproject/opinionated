At that time, Alford\u2019s case was still pending before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-22\">The court\u2019s jurisdiction over appeals from decisions of the Court of Federal Claims is governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3). Section 1295(a)(3) provides that the court has jurisdiction over \u201can appeal from a <em>final </em>decision of the United States Court of Federal Claims\u201d (emphasis added). \u201cA \u2018final decision\u2019 generally is one which ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u201d <em>Catlin v. United States, </em>324 U.S. 229, 233, 65 S.Ct. 631, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-24\">The Court of Federal Claims had not entered or announced a judgment before Alford filed his appeal. Because the case was still pending in the Court of Federal Claims, we must dismiss the appeal. The court notes that the Court of Federal Claims subsequently entered final judgment in this matter on March 9, 2011, and thus he may file an appeal within 60 days of that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-25\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b923-26\">It Is Ordered That:</p>\n<p id=\"b923-27\">(1) The United States\u2019 motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-28\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
