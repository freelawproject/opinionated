Owens argues that the evidence is insufficient to support his convictions and his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-12\">Owens argues that his convictions are unsustainable because they are based primarily on evidence provided by witness Paul Manning, whose testimony was allegedly too incredible to be believed by a rational juror, but we disagree. To be \u201cincredible as a matter of law,\u201d testimony \u201c\u2018must be unbelievable on its face\u2019 and must relate to \u2018facts that [the witness] physically could not have possibly observed or events that could not have occurred under the laws of nature.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Steele, </em>178 F.3d 1230, 1236 (11th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1325 (11th Cir.1997)). Manning\u2019s testimony about aiding Owens in distributing marijuana and possessing guns to protect the drugs and drug proceeds is not implausible. Manning testified that he packaged and sold marijuana provided by Owens; Owens determined the price and procedure used to sell the marijuana through the back door of his residence; Owens monitored the drug sales; and Owens kept guns to protect the drugs and drug proceeds. Manning\u2019s testimony is consistent with the parties\u2019 stipulations, Owens\u2019s records, and the testimonies of investigating officers and one of Owens\u2019s relatives that Owens rented the house and distributed marijuana from its kitchen. Owens argues that Manning\u2019s admissions about suffering from multiple mental illnesses and abusing alcohol and illegal drugs established that Manning was incapable of \u201cperceiv[ing] reality as to whether Owens was a knowing participant,\u201d but Owens presented this theory to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>the jury, and the jury rejected it. <em>See Steele, </em>178 F.3d at 1236. The district court did not err by denying Owens\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Owens also argues that the district court \u201cunjustifiably relied on\u201d his \u201ccriminal history\u201d to \u201cimpose[] a substantively unreasonable sentence,\u201d but again we disagree. The district court considered the sentencing factors, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, and \u201ctailored the sentence to take into account the facts and circumstances surrounding this particular case.\u201d Based on Owens\u2019s offenses and his lengthy criminal history, which included six prior convictions for possessing and distributing illegal drugs, the district court reasonably concluded that a sentence of 420 months of imprisonment at the low end of the guideline range was \u201cnecessary to punish [Owens] for [his] criminal conduct and [to] serve[] as an adequate deterrent to others.\u201d Owens\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">We AFFIRM Owens\u2019s convictions and sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
