He argues that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6) based on a finding that he intentionally or recklessly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to the alien by transporting her in the trunk of his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The transportation of aliens in the trunk of a vehicle is specifically listed in the comments to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6) as the type of conduct contemplated by the Sentencing Commission in drafting the guideline provision. \u00a7 2L1.1, comment, (n.5). Moreover, the district court determined that the alien being transported in the trunk of Herrera\u2019s vehicle was at an increased risk of death or serious bodily injury in the event of an accident and was at an increased risk of death or serious bodily injury because the weather was hot at the time Herrera committed the offense. <em>See United States v. Zuniga-Amezquita, </em>468 F.3d 886, 889 (5th Cir.2006). The district court did not err by enhancing Herrera\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b453-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
