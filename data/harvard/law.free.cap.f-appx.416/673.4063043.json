We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-22\">The agency determined that petitioner was removable under the aggravated felony ground of deportation, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), based on his 1984 convictions for violating California Penal Code \u00a7 288(a). Subsequent to the agency\u2019s decision in this case, we held in <em>Ledezma-Galicia v. Holder, </em>636 F.3d 1059 (9th Cir. 2010), that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) does not apply to convictions that occurred prior to November 18,1988. We therefore grant the petition for review and remand to the agency in light of <em>Ledezmar-Galicia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b695-23\">In light of our disposition, we need not address Gonzalez-Uribe\u2019s remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b695-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
