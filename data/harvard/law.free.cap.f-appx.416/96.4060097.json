We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">Thompson alleges he became disabled on September 29, 1997 as the result of a car accident that left him with two broken legs. While finding that Thompson suffered from chronic heart failure, a variety of mental impairments and lingering orthopedic troubles, the Administrative Law Judge determined Thompson could perform light work and denied him disability benefits. We find that the ALJ committed error by failing to consider the combined effect of Thompson\u2019s impairments in determining his disability claim. Where, as here, the claimant has more than one impairment, the ALJ must account for the combined effect of all impairments on a claimant\u2019s ability to work, regardless of whether each impairment is severe. <em>Dixon v. Shalala, </em>54 F.3d 1019, 1031 (2d Cir. 1995). The ALJ must \u201cconsider the combined effect of all of [the claimant\u2019s] impairments without regard to whether any such impairment, if considered separately, would be of sufficient severity.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1523, 416.923. Here, the ALJ examined Thompson\u2019s mental and physical impairments separately, and failed to evaluate all of the impairments together. This was erroneous as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court hereby is VACATED and REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
