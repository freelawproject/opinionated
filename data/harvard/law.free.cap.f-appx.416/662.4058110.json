The BIA found that Tan\u2019s conviction for child endangerment under California Penal Code section 273a(a) was an aggravated felony, as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b), precluding her from cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">We need not reach the issue of the BIA\u2019s application of the modified categorical approach to Tan\u2019s conviction under California Penal Code section 273a(a), because the BIA also denied her application for cancellation of removal on the ground that, regardless, she would not receive a favorable exercise of discretion. <em>See, e.g., Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 929-30 (9th Cir.2005) (citing 8 U.S.C. 1229b). By statute, we lack jurisdiction over the BIA\u2019s unfavorable discretionary decision, so Tan cannot obtain relief. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">Petitioner\u2019s arguments with respect to the discretionary decision are factual in nature, although clothed as a legal argument. See <em>Martinez-Rosas, </em>424 F.3d at 930. Even if we addressed her arguments on the merits, they would fail. The BIA did balance all relevant positive and negative factors as required under our case law. <em>Kalubi v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1134, 1139 (9th Cir.2004). Additionally, we lack jurisdiction to consider Tan\u2019s argument about the use of her statements from her bond hearing because she failed to raise it in her brief to the BIA. <em>Abebe v. Mukasey, </em>554 F.3d 1203, 1208 (9th Cir.2009) (en banc) (per curiam), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3272, 176 L.Ed.2d 1182 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-15\">The petition for review is therefore DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b685-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>by 9th Cir.
