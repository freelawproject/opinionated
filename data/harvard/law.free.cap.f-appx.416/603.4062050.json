We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-20\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on the testimony of Boota Singh Basi that the application he prepared for Pelia contained a fabricated claim of persecution and based on the IJ\u2019s observations of Pelia\u2019s demeanor. <em>See Fernandes v. Holder, </em>619 F.3d 1069, 1075 (9th Cir.2010) (Basi was not a biased witness because he was under no obligation to cooperate); <em>Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1151 (9th Cir.1999) (special deference given to IJ\u2019s demeanor finding). We reject Pelia\u2019s contention that the IJ failed to analyze the credibility and reliability of the affidavits and letters he submitted in support of his application. <em>See Kin v. Holder, </em>595 F.3d 1050, 1058 (9th Cir.2010) (it is appropriate for an IJ to examine conflicting evidence and determine the truth); <em>Almaghzar v. Gonzales, </em>457 F.3d 915, 921-22 (9th Cir. 2006) (the IJ does not need to comment specifically on all the evidence). In the absence of credible testimony, Pelia\u2019s asy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>lum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah, </em>348 F.3d at 1156.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Because Pelia\u2019s CAT claim is based on the testimony the agency found not credible, and he points to no evidence showing it is more likely than not he will be tortured if returned to India, his CAT claim also fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b626-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
