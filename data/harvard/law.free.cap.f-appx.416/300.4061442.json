Mandamus relief is a drastic remedy and should be used only in extraordinary circumstances. <em>Kerr v. United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976); <em>United States v. Moussaoui, </em>333 F.3d 509, 516-17 (4th Cir.2003). Further, mandamus relief is available only when the petitioner has a clear right to the relief sought. <em>In re First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>860 F.2d 135, 138 (4th Cir.1988). We have reviewed the record and conclude that Barnes was not entitled to mandamus relief. <em>See In re Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>503 F.3d 351, 353 (4th Cir.2007) (mandamus may not be used as a substitute for appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">However, as the district court dismissed the action without prejudice, it cannot serve as a predicate \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of the PLRA. <em>See McLean v. United States, </em>566 F.3d 391, 396-97 (4th Cir.2009). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the action, but vacate and remand with instructions that the court amend the order to reflect that the dismissal is not a \u201cstrike\u201d under the PLRA. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
