The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> concluded that he was an armed career criminal, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), and sentenced him to 188 months in prison, the bottom of the Sentencing Guidelines range. On appeal, Jett\u2019s counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has moved to withdraw. Jett has filed a pro se supplemental brief. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-14\">In the <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel argues that Jett\u2019s eleven Missouri burglary convictions for first- and second-degree burglary were not \u201cviolent felonies\u201d for purposes of armed-career-criminal status, and Jett argues the same. These convictions qualify as violent felonies, however, as both the statute itself and our precedent make clear. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B); <em>United States v. Bell, </em>445 F.3d 1086, 1090-91 (8th Cir.2006). Further, after reviewing the record independently under <em>Benson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no non-frivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, subject to counsel informing Jett about procedures for seeking rehearing or filing a petition for certiorari.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b613-15\">.
