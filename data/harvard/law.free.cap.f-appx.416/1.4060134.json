Humphrey $1,208,392.55 for Restricted Stock Units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) after he retired from the company. Graphic Packaging claims that it overpaid Humphrey, and seeks to recover the amount of the alleged overpayment of $541,575.08 based on theories of money had and received and, alternatively, unjust enrichment. Graphic Packaging also asserts a claim for attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses pursuant to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 13-6-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-17\">The issue of overpayment hinges on whether Graphic Packaging made a mistake by valuing the RSUs on the date of Humphrey\u2019s retirement rather than on the date the RSUs became payable. In ruling on the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court concluded that Graphic Packaging failed to produce sufficient evidence showing that valuing the RSUs on the date of Humphrey\u2019s retirement was a mistake. Accordingly, the district court denied Graphic Packaging\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted Humphrey\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The district court also concluded that Graphic Packaging was not entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses pursuant to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 13-6-11. After review, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-18\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b24-19\">A. The 2004 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan and Humphrey\u2019s Restricted Stock Units</p>\n<p id=\"b24-20\">Stephen M. Humphrey served as the President and Chief Executive Officer of Graphic Packaging Corporation or one of its corporate predecessors from 1997 through 2006, and served as its Vice Chairman in 2007.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 2004, the shareholders of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Graphic Packaging approved the 2004 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan (the \u201cStock Plan\u201d). This plan, which is not covered by ERISA, provides for the award of various types of stock incentives for eligible employees, including Restricted Stock Units (\u201cRSUs\u201d). Humphrey earned participation rights in the Stock Plan during his career. The Stock Plan provides that actual awards of RSUs are to be made in subsequent Award Agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">Humphrey received four Award Agreements throughout his career, and the material terms of the agreements are the same. Through these four Award Agreements, Humphrey received a total grant of 1,158,186 RSUs. Each of the four Award Agreements provided that the RSUs were to be paid out to Humphrey one-half in cash and one-half in Graphic Packaging common stock. The parties agree that each RSU is intended to be the value equivalent of one share of stock. This appeal concerns when the RSUs should be valued for the cash portion of Humphrey\u2019s RSU award.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">When Humphrey retired on December 31, 2007, all of his RSUs had vested. Although all of Humphrey\u2019s RSUs were vested on the date of his retirement, the four Award Agreements provide that the vested benefits do not become payable until the expiration of the \u201cMandatary Holding Period.\u201d The expiration of the Mandatory Holding Period could occur upon one of several different events, including the participant\u2019s retirement. The Award Agreements also provide, however, that if a participant is a \u201ckey employee\u201d under Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 409A (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 409A), the Mandatary Holding Period extends for six additional months beyond the date of retirement. Humphrey was a \u00a7 409A \u201ckey employee,\u201d so the Mandatory Holding Period did not expire \u2014 and the RSUs thus did not become payable \u2014 until June 30, 2008. The parties agree that the Stock Plan and the Award Agreements are silent as to whether the value of the RSU distribution should be determined at the conclusion of \u00a7 409A\u2019s Mandatory Holding Period, or at another time \u2014 specifically, on the date of Humphrey\u2019s retirement. Because each RSU is the equivalent of one share of the company\u2019s stock, the question in this case is whether the stock should be valued on the date of retirement (December 31, 2007) or the date the stock became payable (June 30, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b25-10\">B. Graphic Packaging\u2019s Past Practice Regarding RSU Payouts Under the Stock Plan</p>\n<p id=\"b25-11\">Humphrey\u2019s retirement on December 31, 2007, marked the first time that Graphic Packaging imposed the six-month holding period mandated by \u00a7 409A following a key employee\u2019s retirement. As a result, there is no historical practice that speaks directly to the proper valuation date for RSUs when a \u00a7 409A holding period is imposed. Nonetheless, both parties cite Graphic Packaging\u2019s historical practice regarding the valuation of RSUs to support their particular valuation date. Graphic Packaging points out that in all prior instances the RSUs were valued on the date they became payable, and Humphrey points out that in all prior instances the RSUs were valued on the date of retirement. Without the six-month holding period mandated by \u00a7 409A, both claims are true because the date of retirement and the date the RSUs become payable are the same date. The only reason these events <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>would happen on different dates is if the \u00a7 409A holding period was applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">C. Humphrey\u2019s Alleged Overpayment</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">A somewhat elaborate series of events preceded the payment of benefits in this case. Shortly after Humphrey\u2019s effective date of retirement, on January 9, 2008, Graphic Packaging\u2019s Director of Compensation Kevin R. Wolff sent Humphrey a letter explaining the impending payout of his RSUs. The letter stated that \u201call vesting restrictions lapsed and all holding periods expired on the date of your Retirement,\u201d and the value of Humphrey\u2019s RSU award was to be determined based upon the closing stock price of the company\u2019s common stock as of December 31, 2007, which was $3.69 per share. (R.2-40, Ex. 7 at 8.) Wolff and his staff failed to take account of the fact that Humphrey was a key employee under \u00a7 409A, and that the payout of his RSUs would therefore need to be delayed by six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">The next day Graphic Packaging\u2019s Senior Vice President of Human Resources Wayne E. Juby sent a second letter to Humphrey. Like the previous letter, the letter indicated that Humprey\u2019s RSUs would be valued as of the date of his retirement on December 31, 2007, and the RSUs would be deposited in Humphrey\u2019s bank account by January 15, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">Shortly after Juby sent the letter to Humphrey, the Graphic Packaging Legal Department brought to Wolffs attention that the payout of Humphrey\u2019s RSUs would need to be delayed for six months because of the requirements of \u00a7 409A and the RSU Award Agreements. Wolff telephoned Humphrey and told him that his award was subject to a six-month holding period beyond his retirement date due to \u00a7 409A because he was a \u201ckey employee.\u201d Wolff did not, however, tell Humphrey anything about recalculating the value of the RSUs.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">Wolff sent Humphrey a third letter on June 24, 2008. This letter again confirmed that Humphrey\u2019s RSUs would be valued as of the date of his retirement on December 31, 2007, and stated that that the money would be direct deposited by June 30, 2008, which was the end of the six-month holding period.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">On June 30, 2008, Graphic Packaging paid Humphrey $1,208,392.55 for the cash portion of his RSUs. This figure was based on valuing the RSUs as of Humphrey\u2019s date of retirement \u2014 December 31, 2007. The price of Graphic Packaging\u2019s common stock on this date was $3.69 per share.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">Several weeks after Graphic Packaging deposited Humphrey\u2019s cash benefits into his bank account, the Graphic Packaging Legal Department questioned the valuation date used to determine Humphrey\u2019s RSU payout. The Legal Department took the position that the proper valuation date for Humphrey\u2019s RSUs was the date of distribution (June 30, 2008) rather that the date of retirement (December 31, 2007). Because the price of the stock had dropped to $2.02 per share on June 30, 2008, the Legal Department concluded that Humphrey had been overpaid by $541,575.08.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-12\">Wolff notified Humphrey of the alleged overpayment by telephone on July 22, 2008, and two days later sent Humphrey a letter stating that he had been overpaid by $541,575.08 due to an \u201cadministrative error.\u201d The letter stated that the amount of cash should have been determined based on the value of Graphic Packaging\u2019s common stock on June 30, 2008, which was $2.02 per share. The letter demanded repayment of the $541,575.08.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-13\">Humphrey declined to refund the money. After the parties failed to resolve the proper valuation date, Graphic Packaging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>submitted the issue to the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Graphic Packaging Board of Directors (the \u201cCompensation Committee\u201d) for a final determination of the proper valuation date for Humphrey\u2019s RSU distribution. The Stock Plan provides that the Compensation Committee \u201cshall be responsible for administering the Plan\u201d and that \u201c[a]ll actions taken and all interpretations and determinations made by the Committee shall be final and binding upon Participants, the Company, and all other interested individuals.\u201d (R.2-40, Ex. 5 at 17.) Humphrey\u2019s four Award Agreements contain similar grants of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">Graphic Packaging notified Humphrey that the Compensation Committee would be resolving the valuation issue and invited him to submit any additional documents or information he wanted the Committee to consider. Prior to the Committee\u2019s meeting, the three Committee members received a collection of documents that included a memorandum outlining the pertinent facts and issues, the relevant agreements, and the correspondence between the Company and Humphrey (or their respective counsel) regarding the dispute. On September 16, 2008, the Committee met and received a presentation from Graphic Packaging\u2019s outside and in-house counsel regarding the dispute. The Committee determined that the proper valuation date was June 30, 2008. Immediately after this meeting, Graphic Packaging informed Humphrey of the Committee\u2019s decision. Humphrey again declined to return the $541,575.08.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">II. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">On September 17, 2008, Graphic Packaging filed this lawsuit in Georgia state court, seeking to recover the amount of the alleged overpayment of $541,575.08 based on theories of money had and received and, alternatively, unjust enrichment. Graphic Packaging also asserted a claim for attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses pursuant to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 13-6-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-10\">Humphrey removed the case to federal court. In his Answer, he asserted a counterclaim against Graphic Packaging for breach of contract in connection with Graphic Packaging\u2019s payout of the stock portion of his RSUs. Humphrey also asserted a counterclaim for attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses pursuant to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 13-6-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-11\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment that the district court granted in part and denied in part. The district court denied Graphic Packaging\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to its claims against Humphrey. The district court granted Humphrey\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to Graphic Packaging\u2019s claims against him and dismissed these claims. With respect to Humphrey\u2019s counterclaims, the district court denied Humphrey\u2019s motion for summary judgment, granted Graphic Packaging\u2019s motion, and dismissed the counterclaims. The district court entered final judgment and ordered that each party bear its own costs. Graphic Packaging filed a timely Notice of Appeal. Humphrey did not appeal the dismissal of his counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-12\">III. Issues on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b27-13\">Graphic Packaging raises the following issues on appeal: (1) whether the district court erred in concluding that Graphic Packaging failed to produce sufficient evidence showing that the company\u2019s valuation of Humphrey\u2019s RSU\u2019s on the date of his retirement was mistaken;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>whether the district court erred in concluding that Graphic Packaging was not entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses pursuant to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 13-6-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">IV. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">A. Money had and received/unjust enrichment</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">An action for money had and received is founded on the equitable principle that no one ought to unjustly enrich himself at the expense of another. <em>Gulf Life Ins. Co. v. Folsom, </em>256 Ga. 400, 349 S.E.2d 368, 370-71 (1986). Recovery in such an action is authorized against one who holds the money of another that he ought in equity and good conscience refund. <em>Time Ins. Co. v. Fulton-DeKalb Hosp. Auth., </em>211 Ga.App. 34, 438 S.E.2d 149, 150-51 (1993) (quotations and citations omitted). A plaintiff prevails on an action for money had and received where (1) a payment was mistakenly made as a result of the plaintiffs lack of diligence and (2) the party receiving payment would not be prejudiced by refunding the payment \u2014 subject to a weighing of the equities between the parties. <em>Folsom, </em>349 S.E.2d at 373. Claims for unjust enrichment brought in an attempt to recover a mistaken overpayment are analyzed by Georgia courts under the same framework as a claim for money had and received. <em>See D &amp; H Constr. Co. v. City of Woodstock, 284 </em>Ga.App. 314, 643 S.E.2d 826, 830 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">The district court denied summary judgment to Graphic Packaging and granted summary judgment to Humphrey on Graphic Packaging\u2019s claims for money had and received and unjust enrichment because it found that Graphic Packaging could not show that it made a mistake by valuing the RSUs as of the date of Humphrey\u2019s retirement. Graphic Packaging contends that the district court erred in reaching this conclusion in the following ways: (1) by failing to defer to the determination of the Compensation Committee regarding the appropriate valuation date; (2) by rejecting and misconstruing Kevin Wolffs undisputed testimony regarding the events leading to the alleged overpayment; and (3) by misinterpreting Graphic Packaging\u2019s past practice regarding RSU valuation. We address each contention in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-11\">Graphic Packaging first argues that the district court erred by failing to give proper deference to the Compensation Committee\u2019s determination that Humphrey\u2019s RSUs should have been valued as of the date they became payable (June 30, 2008). According to Graphic Packaging, this deference is mandated by the language of the Stock Plan and Award Agreements and by Delaware law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b28-12\">The Stock Plan and Award Agreements do not address the appropriate valuation date in the event RSUs vest and are paid out on different dates, as in Humphrey\u2019s case. The documents do, however, give the Compensation Committee \u201cfull and exclusive discretionary authority\u201d to interpret the Stock Plan and Award Agree-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>merits, and provide that the determinations of the Committee are \u201cfinal and binding.\u201d (R.2-40, Ex. 5 at 17.) Delaware law, moreover, requires courts to give deference to a committee that is granted interpretive and decision-making authority under a corporate compensation plan. <em>See, e.g., JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. v. Pierce, </em>517 F.Supp.2d 954, 958 (E.D.Mich. 2007) (quoting <em>Schwartz v. Century Circuit, Inc., </em>163 A.2d 793, 796 (Del.Ch. 1960)) (applying Delaware law and explaining that \u201c[wjhere a contract vests a corporate administrative committee with the authority to make \u2018binding, final and conclusive\u2019 decisions regarding an employee\u2019s eligibility under a corporate compensation plan, a court should accept the committee\u2019s decision as \u2018conclusive in the absence of fraud, bad faith and the like.\u2019\u201d); <em>Lieberman v. Becker, </em>155 A.2d 596, 600 (Del.1959) (\u201cWe must assume that the committee of directors charged with the administration of this plan will do so in the good faith exercise of their considered business judgment.... A decision by responsible businessmen reached after careful consideration ..., without bad faith or fraud, is entitled to weighty consideration by the courts.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Based on the Compensation Committee\u2019s authority to interpret the Stock Plan and Award Agreements and the deference afforded to corporate compensation committees under Delaware law, Graphic Packaging contends that analysis of the Committee\u2019s decision should be limited to assessing whether it was tainted by bad faith or fraud, and, in the absence of both, Delaware law requires deferring to the Committee\u2019s determination that Humphrey was overpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">We cannot agree. In this case, Graphic Packaging has the burden to produce evidence showing that it made a mistake when it valued and paid Humphrey\u2019s RSUs based on the date of his retirement. Graphic Packaging cannot meet this burden by simply pointing to the Compensation Committee\u2019s ultimate conclusion that Humphrey\u2019s RSUs should be valued on the date they became payable. Rather, Graphic Packaging must produce evidence showing why one valuation date is correct and the other date is incorrect. Further, the Delaware cases do not support Graphic Packaging\u2019s argument because those cases did not concern mistaken payments whereby the corporate employer has the burden of proving that a payment was mistaken in order to be entitled to equitable relief. Thus, the district court was correct in analyzing the basis for the Compensation Committee\u2019s conclusion in order to determine whether Graphic Packaging met its burden of submitting evidence of a mistaken payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">Graphic Packaging also argues that the evidence supporting the Compensation Committee\u2019s determination shows that a mistaken payment was made. We disagree. Graphic Packaging has pointed to no specific document or testimony that shows why valuing the RSUs on the date they became payable is correct and valuing the RSUs on the date of retirement is incorrect. While one committee member testified that past practice supported valuing the RSUs on the date they became payable, there was no past practice of valuing RSUs in the context of a \u00a7 409A key employee, like Humphrey.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">Graphic Packaging next argues that the testimony of Director of Compensation Kevin Wolff provides sufficient evidence that the company\u2019s valuation of Humphrey\u2019s RSUs as of the date of his retirement was mistaken. Graphic Packaging contends that the district court refused to credit Wolffs testimony, and this refusal amounted to an impermissible credibility determination. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>The district court correctly concluded that Wolffs testimony did not establish that Graphic Packaging over-valued Humphrey\u2019s RSUs by valuing them as of the date of Humphrey\u2019s retirement (December 31, 2007). While Wolff testified that valuing the RSUs as of the date of retirement was a \u201cmistake,\u201d he did not explain the basis for this conclusion. While Wolff testified that valuing the RSUs as of the date of retirement was not in line with the company\u2019s understanding of its past practice in interpreting the Stock Plan, Graphic Packaging had never previously addressed how RSUs should be valued in the context of a \u00a7 409A key employee, like Humphrey. We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that valuing Humphrey\u2019s RSUs as of the date of his retirement was a reasonable interpretation of the relevant agreements that was confirmed repeatedly through numerous letters and, ultimately, by paying Humphrey accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Graphic Packaging also argues that the district court erred in its assessment of the Company\u2019s past practice regarding the valuation of RSUs. According to Graphic Packaging, prior to Humphrey\u2019s retirement all RSUs paid out under the Stock Plan were valued on the date the RSUs became payable regardless of vesting date.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">We agree with the district court that Graphic Packaging\u2019s past practice does not show that a mistake was made in valuing Humphrey\u2019s RSUs. As the district court correctly noted, in every instance prior to Humphrey\u2019s retirement, the date of retirement was the same date as the date the RSUs became payable under the Award Agreements because the only reason the dates would differ is if the \u00a7 409A holding period was imposed. Since there is no indication in the record that a \u00a7 409A holding period had ever been imposed pri- or to Humphrey\u2019s retirement, there is no historical practice that could show that Humphrey\u2019s RSU valuation was miscalculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">We conclude by noting, as the district court did, that Graphic Packaging\u2019s arguments are notable for what they do not say. First, neither the Stock Plan nor the Award Agreements provide that Humphrey\u2019s RSUs should have been valued on the date the \u00a7 409A holding period expired. Although the \u00a7 409A holding period may postpone the distribution of the payment, there is no indication in the Award Agreements that it operates to alter the value of Humphrey\u2019s vested RSUs. Second, nothing in \u00a7 409A suggests that the proper valuation date should be at the end of the six-month holding period. Since it is clear that if \u00a7 409A had not been applied to delay Humphrey\u2019s RSU distribution the valuation date under the relevant agreements would have been the date of Humphrey\u2019s retirement, there is no basis for the conclusion that \u00a7 409A somehow operates to change the valuation date.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">Accordingly, the district court correctly determined that Graphic Packaging failed to submit evidence showing that its valuation of Humphrey\u2019s RSUs on the date of his retirement was a mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">B. Attorneys\u2019 Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b30-11\">Graphic Packaging argues that the district court erred in granting Humphrey\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Graphic Packaging\u2019s claim for attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses pursuant to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 13-6-11.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In order to prevail on such a claim, a plaintiff must first prevail on its underlying claims. <em>Ellis v. Gallof </em>220 Ga. App. 518, 469 S.E.2d 288, 289 (1996). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Graphic Packaging has not done so in this case, and we thus affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Humphrey on Graphic Packaging\u2019s claim for attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b24-13\">. Graphic Packaging Corporation was the publicly-traded predecessor of Plaintiff Graphic Packaging Holding Company. As the result of a merger with Altivity Inc. in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>March 2008, Graphic Packaging Corporation became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Graphic Packaging Holding Company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b27-8\">. The district court denied Graphic Packaging's motion for summary judgment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>granted Humphrey's motion for summary judgment on the ground that Graphic Packaging failed to submit evidence showing that it made a mistake by valuing Humphrey's RSUs as of the date of his retirement. Because we ultimately affirm on this basis, both motions are discussed together.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b28-9\">. The Stock Plan and the Award Agreements provide that they are to be interpreted in accordance with Delaware law. Graphic Packaging claims that Delaware law governs the interpretation of the Stock Plan and Award Agreements, and Humphrey does not dispute this contention. We therefore assume without deciding that Delaware law is the proper choice of law in interpreting the relevant documents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b30-6\">.
