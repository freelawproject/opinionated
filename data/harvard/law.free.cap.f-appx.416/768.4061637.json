O\u2019BRIEN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b790-15\">In 2004, we affirmed Efrem Zemblish Harris\u2019 drug related convictions and resulting life sentence. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>369 F.3d 1157 (10th Cir.2004). Since then he has repeatedly filed merit-less post-conviction motions and appeals. Consistent with his past practices, he now appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the District Court\u2019s dismissal of his latest motion, which amounted to a request for sentence modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-19\">Harris tried to persuade the District Court he was entitled to be resentenced under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c)(7). In a clear, cogent, and correct Opinion and Order the court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Like most of his other filings this frivolous appeal abuses the court process, justifying summary disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b790-16\"> The parties have waived oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed.

Unpublished decisions may also be cited for their persuasive value. 10th Cir. R. 32.1(A). Citation to an order and judgment must be accompanied by an appropriate parenthetical notation \u2014 (unpublished). <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b790-31\">.
