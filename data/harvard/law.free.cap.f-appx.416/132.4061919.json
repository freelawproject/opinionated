For the reasons that follow, we will reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-21\">We write primarily for the parties and therefore need not recite the. underlying facts or procedural history of this appeal except to note that Parker filed his petition on March 27, 2008, and the district court thereafter dismissed it as untimely. To its very substantial credit, the government now concedes that the petition was not time-barred, and that the Assistant U.S. Attorney erred in arguing that the petition was untimely. <em>See </em>Appellee\u2019s Br. at 10 (\u201c[u]pon consideration of the matter, the government believes that its position before the district court was in error, and now agrees with Parker\u2019s view.\u201d). We agree. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254, and <em>Latham v. United States, </em>527 F.3d 651 (7th Cir. 2008). As the government so candidly states: \u201cthere is no known precedent for the proposition that a criminal defendant who seeks voluntary dismissal of an appeal is foreclosed from filing a petition for certiorari challenging the dismissal.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-22\">Accordingly, we will vacate the order of the district court dismissing the Appellant\u2019s petition as untimely. In doing so, we note that the government\u2019s handling of this appeal is truly exemplary and in the best tradition of prosecutor as an officer of the court and the legal representative of all of the people of the United States, including those convicted of crimes.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
