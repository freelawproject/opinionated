Vandiver on appeal maintains he falls under the imminent danger exception applicable to that provision. We conclude that his pro se complaint, appropriately construed, sufficiently pleads a presently existing imminent danger, and therefore REVERSE.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Vandiver filed a pro se civil rights complaint under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that he was denied medical treatment in retaliation for his Firsb-Amendmenb-protected speech activities while incarcerated at the G. Robert Cotton Correctional Facility in Jackson, Michigan (\u201cJackson facility\u201d). Vandiver, who is diabetic and suffers from Hepatitis C, claimed that he was denied health care in retaliation for speaking out \u201cconcerning prisoners health care needs\u201d and \u201cfor seeking access to the courts.\u201d He named as defendants various officials at the Jackson facility, including its warden, its deputy warden, its health unit manager, and a nurse supervisor. At the time of the filing of the complaint, Vandiver had been transferred to the Earnest C. Brooks Correctional Facility in Muskegon Heights, Michigan (\u201cMuskegon Heights facility\u201d). Nonetheless, his complaint alleges that he still \u201cis not receiving proper treatment\u201d at the new facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Defendants filed a motion to revoke Vandiver\u2019s in forma pauperis status (which the district court initially granted soon after Vandiver\u2019s complaint was filed) and dismiss his complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Defendants argued that Vandiver had filed three previous actions qualifying under the Act as \u201cstrikes\u201d for being dismissed as frivolous or for failure to state a claim (a finding not contested in this appeal), and further that his complaint failed to allege imminent danger sufficient to qualify for the Act\u2019s exception. Defendants\u2019 motion was consolidated with similar motions filed in two other cases also filed by Vandiver within days of this one, and a magistrate judge issued a Report and Recommendation recommending that all three motions be granted and Vandiver\u2019s complaint in this case be dismissed without prejudice. Primarily focusing her analysis of imminent danger on one of the other two cases, the magistrate judge stated as to this case only the general conclusion that \u201cthere is no showing of imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d Over Vandiver\u2019s objection, the district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s Report and Recommendation in full, agreeing that Plaintiff \u201chas shown no such danger.\u201d Vandiver appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-10\">In no event shall a prisoner bring a civil action or appeal a judgment in a civil action or proceeding under this section if the prisoner has, on 3 or more occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facility, brought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, <em>unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACQ\">(Emphasis added.) Vandiver\u2019s first argument on appeal asks us to construe the exception in \u00a7 1915(g)\u2019s final clause quoted above as <em>not </em>requiring the defendant to demonstrate that he is in imminent danger at the time of the filing of the complaint in federal court, as every circuit to have considered the issue (including this one, in an unpublished decision) has read the statute. <em>See Heimermann v. Litscher, </em>337 F.3d 781, 782 (7th Cir.2003); <em>Malik v. McGinnis, </em>293 F.3d 559, 562-63 (2d Cir.2002); <em>Abdul-Akbar v. McKelvie, </em>239 F.3d 307, 314 (3d Cir.2001) (en banc); <em>Medberry v. Butler, </em>185 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir. 1999); <em>Ashley v. Dilvorth, </em>147 F.3d 715, 717 (8th Cir.1998); <em>Banos v. O\u2019Guin, </em>144 F.3d 883, 884-85 (5th Cir.1998); <em>see also Rittner v. Kinder, </em>290 Fed.Appx. 796 (6th Cir.2008) (unpublished decision). His argument begins by contending that an inconsistency between the provision\u2019s tens<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>es \u2014 concerning the \u201cthree strikes,\u201d the statute uses the past tense and the present tense in one phrase when it speaks of an action that <em>\u201cwas </em>dismissed on the grounds that it <em>is </em>frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim\u201d (emphases added) \u2014 renders the statute ambiguous. He then proceeds to suggest that this ambiguity be resolved by reading the statute to require the defendant only to demonstrate that he was in imminent danger at the initiation of administrative remedies, the exhaustion of which are required by the Act in a separate provision. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) (\u201cNo action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">We depart from Vandiver\u2019s argument at its first premise: we cannot agree that the statute is ambiguous. As the other circuits have recognized, the only tense used in the relevant clause \u2014 \u201cunless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury\u201d \u2014 is the present, and so the plain language of \u00a7 1915(g) requires the imminent danger to be contemporaneous with the complaint\u2019s filing. <em>See, e.g., Malik, </em>293 F.3d at 562-63 (\u201cBecause \u00a7 1915(g) uses the present tense in setting forth the imminent danger exception, it is clear from the face of the statute that the danger must exist at the time the complaint is filed.\u201d); <em>Ashley, </em>147 F.3d at 717 (\u201cAs the statute\u2019s use of the present tense ... demonstrates, an otherwise ineligible prisoner is only eligible to proceed [in forma pauperis] if he is in imminent danger <em>at the time of filing.\u201d </em>(emphasis in original)). A prisoner-plaintiff with three strikes falls outside the exception when he <em>was </em>in imminent danger but is no longer at the initiation of proceedings in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Vandiver next contends that, even if \u00a7 1915(g) requires imminent danger to exist at the complaint\u2019s filing, he did in fact plead a presently existing imminent danger, and the district court erred in imposing a heightened \u201cshowing\u201d requirement as to imminent danger at the pleading stage and therefore failed properly to consider the allegations in his complaint. We agree and find that Plaintiffs complaint can be fairly read to allege that he is still receiving improper care as of the complaint\u2019s filing and so qualifies for \u00a7 1915(g)\u2019s imminent-danger exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">The imminent danger exception is essentially a pleading requirement subject to the ordinary principles of notice pleading. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2) (requiring only \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief\u2019); <em>Ciarpaglini v. Saini, </em>352 F.3d 328, 330-31 (7th Cir.2003) (calling the imminent danger exception a \u201cpleading requirement\u201d and recognizing the logical consequence that \u201c[fjrequent filers sometimes allege that they are in imminent danger so they can avoid paying a filing fee\u201d). As a pro se plaintiff, Vandiver is entitled to have his complaint liberally construed. <em>See Erickson v. Pardus, </em>551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007) (noting that \u201ca pro se complaint, however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). With these principles in place, an appropriate reading of his complaint suggests that it alleges, at least in part, a presently existing, continuing imminent danger: he alleges that he <em>\u201cis </em>not receiving proper treatment\u201d (emphasis added). Failure to receive adequate treatment for potentially life-threatening illnesses such as those suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>fered by Vandiver clearly constitutes \u201cimminent danger\u201d under the Act. <em>See Ibrahim v. District of Columbia, </em>468 F.3d 3, 6-7 (D.C.Cir.2006). It is unclear what standard the district court was applying when it stated that Vandiver had not \u201cshown\u201d imminent danger, but we hold that he sufficiently <em>alleged </em>it, and that is all that is required by \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the decision of the district court, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
