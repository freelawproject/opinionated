We vacate the order and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-27\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-28\">Washington sued Newberry Correctional Facility Warden Barry Davis and Deputy Warden Catherine Bauman, claiming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>that they violated his right of access to courts by allowing prison staff to read his legal mail. Washington sought damages and injunctive relief. The district court screened the complaint pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d) and dismissed it for failure to state a claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 1915(e)(2), 1915A; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(c). The court held that the prison\u2019s policy of reviewing Washington\u2019s legal mail before providing him with photocopying services was permissible under <em>Bell-Bey v. Williams, </em>87 F.3d 832 (6th Cir.1996). The court did not address Washington\u2019s other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">We review the district court\u2019s decision de novo. <em>Grinter v. Knight, </em>532 F.3d 567, 571-72 (6th Cir.2008). In reviewing a dismissal for failure to state a claim, we must determine whether the complaint \u201ccon-taints] sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). To state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, Washington must allege the violation of a right secured by the federal Constitution or laws and must show that the violation was committed by a person acting under color of state law. <em>See West v. Atkins, </em>487 U.S. 42, 48, 108 S.Ct. 2250, 101 L.Ed.2d 40 (1988). The main issue on appeal is whether Washington alleged the violation of a constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">Our court \u201chas held that a prisoner has a fundamental interest in preserving the confidentiality of his legal mail.\u201d <em>Bell-Bey, </em>87 F.3d at 837. Thus, prison policies that regulate outgoing legal mail must further \u201can important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of expression,\u201d and may not limit prisoners\u2019 First Amendment freedoms more than necessary to protect the governmental interest involved. <em>Procunier v. Martinez, </em>416 U.S. 396, 413-14, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974); <em>see also Thornburgh v. Abbott, </em>490 U.S. 401, 411, 109 S.Ct. 1874, 104 L.Ed.2d 459 (1989) (clarifying that <em>Martinez </em>does not impose a \u201cleast restrictive means\u201d test).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">Washington\u2019s complaint broadly alleges that the defendants\u2019 custom is to require prisoners to leave their legal mail \u201cwith [prison] library staff for up to three days to read outside the prisoner\u2019s presence when he needs photocopies of legal documents and is indigent.\u201d Thus, taken on its face, the complaint alleges unrestricted review of legal mail, for a lengthy period of time, outside the prisoner\u2019s presence. Those facts, if proven, are enough to trigger the scrutiny described in <em>Martinez. </em>Moreover, because the district court dismissed Washington\u2019s complaint before the defendants were served, there is nothing in the record to show that their putative custom both furthered an important government interest and was not more restrictive than generally necessary to protect the government\u2019s interest. <em>See Martinez, </em>416 U.S. at 413-14, 94 S.Ct. 1800; <em>Bell-Bey, </em>87 F.3d at 838. At this very early stage in the proceedings, therefore, Washington\u2019s allegations support a plausible claim that the policy in question is unconstitutional. <em>See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-12\">The district court did not address Washington\u2019s allegations that prison staff refused to photocopy legal research materials and documents for indigent prisoners. The court should address those issues on remand. In light of our decision, Washington\u2019s remaining arguments on appeal are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>We vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand the ease for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
