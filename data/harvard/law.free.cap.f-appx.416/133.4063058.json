Fake appeals <em>pro se </em>from an order dismissing his petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Because no substantial question is presented by this appeal, we will summarily affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-24\">As the parties are familiar with the background of this case, we will only summarize those facts relevant to the disposition of this appeal. On April 20, 2006, in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, Clifford Fake pleaded guilty to health care fraud resulting in serious bodily injury, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1347, and criminal forfeiture, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 982(a)(7) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2461; he was sentenced to 218 months of imprisonment. Fake appealed his sentence, which was affirmed by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-25\">In November 2008, Fake filed a motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, alleging lack of evidence to convict and ineffectiveness of counsel. Fake also claimed that the Government withheld information regarding victims in violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). The District Court denied his motion, finding his claims proeedurally defaulted or meritless. Fake appealed, and we denied his request for a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>On April 9, 2010, Fake filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the Western District of Pennsylvania, his district of confinement, alleging lack of evidence to convict and ineffectiveness of counsel. The District Court denied the petition, having concluded that the petition attacked the sentence imposed by the Middle District of Pennsylvania and that \u00a7 2255 was not an \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d means to challenge that sentence. Fake appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions, and we apply a clearly erroneous standard to any factual findings. <em>Cradle v. United States, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">\u201cMotions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 are the presumptive means by which federal prisoners can challenge their convictions or sentences that are allegedly in violation of the Constitution.\u201d <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir. 2002). A petitioner, however, may challenge a conviction pursuant to \u00a7 2241 where a \u00a7 2255 motion would be inadequate or ineffective. <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 249 (3d Cir.1997). A motion under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective \u201conly where the petitioner demonstrates that some limitation of scope or procedure would prevent a \u00a7 2255 proceeding from affording him a full hearing and adjudication of his wrongful detention claim.\u201d <em>Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Fake has not made such a showing. He simply states that the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania improperly dismissed his \u00a7 2255 motion. A \u00a7 2255 motion is \u201cnot inadequate or ineffective merely because the sentencing court does not grant relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539. Therefore, the District Court properly denied Fake\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"AkO\">Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
