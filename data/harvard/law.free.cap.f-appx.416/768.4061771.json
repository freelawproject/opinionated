O\u2019BRIEN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b791-14\">Jesus Barcelo-Picaso pled guilty, without the benefit of a plea agreement, to illegal reentry of a removed alien in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b). He was sentenced to 21 months imprisonment. Finding no meritorious issues for appeal, his counsel has submitted an <em>Anders </em>brief and a motion for leave to withdraw as counsel. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel provided Barcelo-Picaso with copies of both documents and we informed him of his right to file a response. <em>See </em>10th Cir. R. 46.4(B)(2). He did not file a response. Because we agree with counsel that there are no meritorious issues, we grant the motion to withdraw and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b791-19\">On June 13, 2001, Barcelo-Picaso, a citizen of Mexico, was convicted of, <em>inter alia, </em>felony aggravated assault in Arizona state court. He was deported on May 27, 2009. Less than four months later, on September 16, 2009, Barcelo-Picaso was found in Luna County, New Mexico. He was charged with illegal reentry of a deported alien. He pled guilty without a plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-20\">The presentence investigation report (PSR) determined the base offense level was 8. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(a). It applied a four-level enhancement because Barcelo-Picaso had previously been deported following a felony conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>USSG <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(D). Applying a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, the total offense level was 10. With a Criminal History Category of V, the advisory guideline range was 21 to 27 months imprisonment. Barcelo-Picaso did not object to the PSR but did file a sentencing memorandum requesting a sentence at the bottom of the guideline range. The government opposed that request, claiming a sentence at the top of the guideline range was appropriate under the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), in particular, Bareelo-Picaso\u2019s extensive criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Two days prior to sentencing, Barcelo-Picaso\u2019s attorney filed a motion to withdraw the guilty plea due to Barcelo-Picaso\u2019s attempts to obtain United States citizenship.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He claimed Barcelo-Picaso was adopted in 1991 by his American stepfather but his stepfather died before he could obtain legal residency or citizenship. At sentencing, counsel reiterated Barcelo-Picaso\u2019s desire to withdraw his guilty plea because it could jeopardize his ability to obtain citizenship. Barcelo-Picaso himself argued for the first time that his adoption papers conferred citizenship upon him retroactive to 1985, the year his mother and stepfather married. The district court denied the motion, concluding there were no just or reasonable grounds for Barcelo-Picaso to withdraw his plea. Proceeding to sentencing, the court determined the PSR had correctly calculated the advisory guideline range. After considering the \u00a7 3353(a) factors, the court sentenced Barcelo-Picaso to 21 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">Under <em>Anders, </em>\u201cif counsel finds his [client\u2019s] case to be wholly frivolous, after a conscientious examination of it, he should so advise the court and request permission to withdraw.\u201d 386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. With his motion to withdraw, counsel must submit \u201ca brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant must have the opportunity to review counsel\u2019s brief and \u201craise any points that he chooses\u201d to the court. <em>Id. </em>The court must then conduct a full examination of the record to determine \u201cwhether the case is wholly frivolous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the court concludes the case is frivolous, it may grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and dismiss the appeal. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Calderon, </em>428 F.3d 928, 930 (10th Cir.2005) (discussing <em>Anders </em>procedure).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-11\">In the <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel identifies only one issue which might arguably support an appeal: \u201c[Bareelo-Picaso\u2019s] stepfather, a United States citizen, adopted [him] while [he] was still a minor. Unfortunately, [the] step-father died before [Barcelo-Picaso] could become a naturalized United States citizen.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Opening Br. at 3.) Barcelo-Picaso raised this issue in the district court as grounds to support his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-12\">A defendant may withdraw a guilty plea before sentencing if he \u201ccan show a fair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B). We consider seven factors to determine if he has satisfied that burden: \u201c(1) whether the defendant has asserted his innocence, (2) prejudice to the government, (3) delay in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>filing defendant\u2019s motion, (4) inconvenience to the court, (5) defendant\u2019s assistance of counsel, (6) whether the plea is knowing and voluntary, and (7) waste of judicial resources.\u201d <em>United States v. Gordon, 4 </em>F.3d 1567, 1572 (10th Cir.1993). We review the denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Wade, </em>940 F.2d 1375, 1376 (10th Cir.1991). \u201cAlthough a motion to withdraw a plea prior to sentencing should be freely allowed, we will not reverse a district court\u2019s decision unless the defendant can show that the court acted unjustly or unfairly.\u201d <em>United States v. Hamilton, </em>510 F.3d 1209, 1213-14 (10th Cir.2007) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Barcelo-Picaso has failed to make the requisite showing. He admitted guilt at his change of plea hearing. While he later claimed he was a citizen of the United States via his 1991 adoption (i.e., he is actually innocent), he could not provide any legal authority supporting that claim. Indeed, it appears the adoption was only a step in his <em>attempt to become a citizen; </em>he did not in fact obtain citizenship because his stepfather died before he could do so. Barcelo-Picaso also delayed filing his motion to withdraw until two days before sentencing, even though he admitted he was aware of the argument supporting his motion to withdraw six months prior to sentencing. He never informed the magistrate judge who took his guilty plea that he had reservations about pleading guilty. Additionally, he told the district court he was satisfied with his counsel\u2019s performance and the magistrate judge properly informed him of his rights during the change of plea colloquy. There is no indication that Barcelo-Picaso\u2019s plea was not freely or voluntarily made.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">After a careful review of the record, we agree with counsel \u2014 there are no arguably meritorious claims. We GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b791-15\"> Oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). We have decided this case on the briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-16\">This order and judgment is an unpublished decision, not binding precedent. 10th Cir.

USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1) provides for an enhancement to a defendant\u2019s base offense level if he was previously deported following a felony conviction. The level of enhancement (four, eight, twelve or sixteen) depends on the nature of the previous felony conviction. The probation officer reviewed the elements of Arizona\u2019s aggravated assault statute and con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>eluded it did not qualify for an enhancement greater than four levels.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b792-7\">.
