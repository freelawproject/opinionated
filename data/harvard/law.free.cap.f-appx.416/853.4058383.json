On appeal, Morales argues that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not adequately address his arguments at sentencing or take into consideration the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Morales also argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to meet the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41,128 S.Ct. 586, 591,169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Under the abuse of discretion standard, the sentence will be affirmed \u201cunless we find that the district court has made a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1259 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we conduct a two-step review, first ensuring that the sentence was procedurally reasonable, meaning the district court properly calculated the guidelines range, treated the guidelines range as advisory, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, did not select a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, and \u201cadequately explain[ed] the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. When revoking a defendant\u2019s term of supervised release, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) instructs courts to consider certain 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors in determining an appropriate sentence. Specifically, sentencing courts must consider (1) \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d; (2) the need to adequately deter criminal conduct; (3) the need \u201cto protect the public from further crimes of the defendant\u201d; (4) the need \u201cto provide the defendant with educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment\u201d; (5) the applicable sentencing range; (6) any pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (7) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (8) \u201cthe need to provide restitution to any victims.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)-(D), (a)(4)-(7), 3583(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">At the time of sentencing, the court shall state its reasons for imposing the particular sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c). However, the court is not required \u201cto state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Rather, it is within the district court\u2019s \u201cown professional judgment\u201d to determine the detail necessary in its statement of reasons. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). It may be clear from the circumstances of the case that the district court rests its \u201cdecision upon the Commission\u2019s own reasoning that the Guidelines sentence is a proper sentence (in terms of \u00a7 3553(a) and other congressional mandates) in the typical case, and that the [court] has found that the case before [it] is typical.\u201d <em>Id., </em>551 U.S. at 357, 127 S.Ct. at 2468. Thus, the court\u2019s acknowledgment that it has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors together with the parties\u2019 arguments is sufficient. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">Once we determine that a sentence is procedurally sound, we must examine whether the sentence was substantively reasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>The district court is required to impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, adequately deter criminal conduct, protect the public from further criminal conduct by the defendant, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In imposing a particular sentence, the court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guidelines range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(3)-(7). We expect a sentence within the guidelines range to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Alfaro-Moncada, </em>607 F.3d 720, 735 (11th Cir.2010). The party challenging the sentence has the burden of establishing that the sentence was unreasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm. First, Morales\u2019s sentence was procedurally reasonable. The district court correctly calculated the guidelines range, gave the parties the opportunity to address the court, considered the parties\u2019 statements and the violation report, and determined that a sentence within the guidelines range was appropriate. Morales argues that the district court erred by not considering his principle arguments. However, Morales himself chose not to make any arguments at his revocation, and his attorney merely asked for a sentence at the low end of the guidelines range because Morales was serving a life sentence in Alabama. Immediately after Morales\u2019s attorney made that request, the court stated that it had \u201ccarefully considered the statements of all parties.\u201d Therefore, the record indicates that the court did consider Morales\u2019s principle arguments, and Morales\u2019s sentence was procedurally reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">Morales\u2019s sentence was also substantively reasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court\u2019s 33-month sentence was within the guidelines range, and we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>See Alfaro-Moncada, </em>607 F.3d at 735. The sentence also met the goals encompassed within 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Morales served twelve years in prison after he pleaded guilty to nine drug-related counts in this case, and, within a year of his release, Morales had already violated his supervised release and trafficked cocaine and marijuana. He has shown a disregard for the laws of the United States, and his guidelines sentence was necessary to promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, and deter him from future criminal activity. Furthermore, Morales has not pointed to any facts to support his claim that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. Therefore, the district court\u2019s sentence was substantively reasonable. Accordingly, we affirm Morales\u2019s 33-month sentence. Morales\u2019s request for oral argument is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
