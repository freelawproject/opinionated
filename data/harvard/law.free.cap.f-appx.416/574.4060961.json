The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied his motion to suppress identification evidence and, after a jury found him guilty on all three counts, sentenced Mays to a total of 480 months in prison and 5 years of supervised release. He appeals. His counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the district court erred in denying the suppression motion and in overruling Mays\u2019s objection under <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-23\">We find no error in the denial of the motion to suppress because we agree with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>the district court that the government\u2019s evidence at the suppression hearing showed that the photographic lineups used to obtain the identifications were not impermissibly suggestive and that the identifications were reliable. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>535 F.3d 886, 889-91 (8th Cir. 2008). Further, the district court did not clearly err in finding that the government\u2019s reasons for striking two venire persons were legitimate and nondiscriminatory, and therefore the <em>Batson </em>challenge fails. <em>See United States v. Blaylock, </em>421 F.3d 758, 769-70 (8th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Having reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b596-15\">. The Honorable J.
