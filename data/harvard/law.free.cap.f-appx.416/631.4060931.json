We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915A and 1915(e). <em>Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Barren v. Harrington, </em>152 F.3d 1193, 1194 (9th Cir.1998) (order). We may affirm on any ground supported by the record, <em>Thompson v. Paul, </em>547 F.3d 1055, 1058-59 (9th Cir.2008), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-25\">Contrary to Appellant\u2019s contentions, his equal protection claims concerning property restrictions in administrative segregation and protective custody were properly dismissed because he failed to allege facts showing that he was a member <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>of a protected class, or that similarly-situated inmates outside that class were treated less severely. <em>See Thornton v. City of St. Helens, </em>425 F.3d 1158, 1166-67 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Appellant\u2019s claim that the property restrictions violated his due process rights was properly dismissed because he failed to allege facts implicating a constitutionally-protected liberty or property interest. <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995) (protected liberty interest arises only when a restraint exceeds an inmate\u2019s sentence in \u201can unexpected manner\u201d or imposes \u201catypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The district court properly dismissed the claim challenging the prison\u2019s grievance policies because \u201c[tjhere is no legitimate claim of entitlement to a grievance procedure.\u201d <em>Mann v. Adams, </em>855 F.2d 639, 640 (9th Cir.1988) (order); <em>see also Brown v. Valoff, </em>422 F.3d 926, 935 (9th Cir.2005) (the Prison Litigation Reform Act \u201cdoes not require exhaustion when <em>no </em>pertinent relief can be obtained through the internal process\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">We do not consider matters not specifically and distinctly raised and argued in the opening brief. <em>See Padgett v. Wright, </em>587 F.3d 983, 985 n. 2 (9th Cir.2009) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Appellant\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b654-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
