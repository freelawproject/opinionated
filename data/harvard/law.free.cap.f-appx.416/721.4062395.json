The district court denied plaintiffs\u2019 myriad motions and dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 other filings which were designed to achieve this end. We take jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b744-13\">This appeal stems from plaintiffs\u2019 failed investment in a Chinese gold mining venture. The relevant facts of this protracted litigation are long, detailed, and well-explained in this court\u2019s prior opinion in this matter. <em>See Orient Mineral Co. v. Bank of China, </em>506 F.3d 980 (10th Cir.2007). We summarize the lengthy factual history here only to the extent that it is relevant to the issues now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-14\">In 1996, plaintiffs deposited $3 million into an account at the Bank for the purpose of funding a gold mining operation in China\u2019s Henan Province. A Chinese citizen, David Yue, served as the intermediary and sole interpreter between plaintiffs and the Bank for this transaction. Plaintiffs directed Mr. Yue to place a restriction on the account, under which any transfer in excess of $25,000 had to be approved by Preston Jones, a member of Orient Mineral\u2019s Board of Directors. Mr. Yue, however, never informed the Bank of plaintiffs\u2019 desired restriction. Instead, he established himself as the primary signatory on the account and embezzled nearly all of plaintiffs\u2019 funds through multiple transfers. Each of Mr. Yue\u2019s surreptitious transfers was in an amount greater than $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-15\">Plaintiffs eventually sued the Bank in federal district court in Utah, asserting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>breach of contract and tort claims. Essentially, plaintiffs alleged that the Bank breached its contractual, tort, and fiduciary duties by allowing Mr. Yue to make multiple transfers in excess of $25,000 from plaintiffs\u2019 account without Mr. Jones\u2019 permission. The Bank asserted its immunity as a foreign sovereign under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (\u201cFSIA\u201d). Additionally, the Bank asserted a counterclaim against plaintiffs for its litigation costs and attorney\u2019s fees. The Bank, however, expressly made its counterclaim contingent on the district court\u2019s finding that it could exercise jurisdiction over plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">At trial, plaintiffs argued and presented evidence that the Bank was subject to suit in the United States courts under all three clauses of the FSIA\u2019s commercial activity exception. Additionally, in support of plaintiffs\u2019 theory that the Bank was complied in Mr. Yue\u2019s embezzlement, Stephen Harner testified at trial that the Bank permitted two foreign exchange transfers from plaintiffs\u2019 account \u2014 one for $40,000 and one for $50,000 \u2014 in -violation of Chinese banking law. Specifically, Mr. Harner testified that Chinese banking law required regulatory approval for the two transfers in question and that the Bank failed to obtain the requisite approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The Bank argued that the FSIA\u2019s commercial activity exception was inapplicable to all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims, and it presented expert testimony from two of the Bank\u2019s employees that conflicted with Mr. Harness testimony. Specifically, the Bank\u2019s experts testified that a Chinese banking regulation in effect at the time expressly did not require regulatory approval for foreign exchange transfers of less than $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Following trial, the district court held that the commercial activity exception only applied to plaintiffs\u2019 claims which were predicated on a single $400,000 transfer to a bank in Utah (\u201cthe Utah transfer\u201d). Accordingly, the district court exercised jurisdiction over those claims and dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claims stemming from other transfers for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On the merits of the claims stemming from the Utah transfer, the district court ruled in favor of the Bank. Finally, the district court awarded the Bank costs and dismissed the Bank\u2019s counterclaim with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">Plaintiffs appealed, challenging various aspects of the district court\u2019s jurisdictional and substantive rulings. The Bank cross-appealed, challenging both the district court\u2019s decision that it had jurisdiction over plaintiffs\u2019 claims stemming from the Utah transfer, as well as the dismissal of its counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">On appeal, we affirmed the district court\u2019s jurisdictional ruling in its entirety, providing a detailed analysis of the FSIA\u2019s commercial activity exception. We also affirmed the district court\u2019s decision in favor of the Bank on the merits of the claims arising from the Utah transfer. We reversed, however, the dismissal of the Bank\u2019s counterclaim and remanded that claim to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">On remand, the district court granted the Bank\u2019s request to file an amended counterclaim. In its order, which is dated March 13, 2008, the district court mandated that plaintiffs \u201cshall have twenty days from the date of this Order to file and serve [their] response to the Amended Counterclaim.\u201d On April 2, 2008, plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss the Bank\u2019s counterclaim. Plaintiffs did not, however, file any other responsive pleadings within the district court\u2019s prescribed twenty-day window. The district court heard argument on plaintiffs\u2019 motion to dismiss on June 9, 2008 and took the matter under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Four days later, and roughly three months after the district court\u2019s March 13, 2008 order, plaintiffs filed a purported counterclaim to the Bank\u2019s counterclaim (hereinafter \u201ccounterclaim-in-reply\u201d). In the counterclaim-in-reply, plaintiffs sought to revive the claims which had been previously dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and they raised new claims against the Bank for abuse of process. With respect to jurisdiction, plaintiffs reasserted their earlier argument that jurisdiction was appropriate under the FSIA\u2019s commercial activity exception, and they asserted, for the first time, jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1607(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">The Bank filed a motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs\u2019 counterclaim-in-reply, arguing that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not contemplate a counterclaim to a counterclaim and that plaintiffs should not be allowed to relitigate their previously dismissed claims. Plaintiffs opposed the motion, and then, on October 22, 2008, they filed a \u201cCross-motion for Default Upon [Plaintiffs\u2019] Counterclaim and for Relief From Judgment.\u201d In that filing, plaintiffs asked the court to enter a default judgment in plaintiffs\u2019 favor on their counterclaim-in-reply, or, in the event that the court found default was not appropriate, to order additional discovery and hold a trial on plaintiffs\u2019 previously dismissed claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Additionally, in the October 22, 2008 filing, plaintiffs sought relief from the district court\u2019s prior judgment based on a fraud on the court which was allegedly perpetrated by the Bank\u2019s attorneys and witnesses at trial. As is relevant to this appeal, plaintiffs alleged that the Bank\u2019s attorneys suborned false testimony that the Bank was not required to obtain regulatory approval for foreign exchange transfers under $100,000. To support their fraud on the court claim, plaintiffs attached an opinion from a Chinese lawyer practicing in Shanghai, which states, in relevant part, that the lawyer was unable to find a Chinese regulation permitting foreign exchange transfers of less than $100,000 without regulatory approval. Plaintiffs also pointed to the Bank\u2019s inability or unwillingness to produce the regulation in question at trial or on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">On March 18, 2009, just two days before a scheduled hearing on all pending motions, plaintiffs filed a pleading styled as an \u201cAnswer and Counterclaim of Orient Mineral to Bank of China\u2019s Amended Counterclaim.\u201d This filing essentially reiterated the claims contained in plaintiffs\u2019 October 22, 2008 filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">On March 20, 2009, the district court heard argument on the various pending motions and filings and took them under advisement. On February 18, 2010, the district court issued an order resolving all of the pending matters. As is relevant to this appeal, the district court: (1) granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion to dismiss the Bank\u2019s counterclaim; (2) dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 counterclaim-in-reply because, among other reasons, it was not filed within the district court\u2019s prescribed twenty-day window; and (3) refused to otherwise reconsider plaintiffs\u2019 previously dismissed claims because plaintiffs did not produce sufficient evidence that a fraud on the court had infected the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">Plaintiffs now appeal the district court\u2019s February 18, 2010 order. The Bank does not appeal the dismissal of its counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">On appeal, plaintiffs persist in their attempt to revive various claims which were dismissed in prior proceedings. First, plaintiffs argue that, on remand, the Bank\u2019s assertion of its counterclaim opened the jurisdictional door to plaintiffs\u2019 previously dismissed claims. Second, plaintiffs contend that we should reconsider our prior opinion in this case because our analysis of the FSIA\u2019s commercial activity exception is clearly erroneous. Third, plaintiffs further argue that we should reconsider our prior opinion in this case based on clear and convincing evidence that a fraud on the court occurred at trial. Fourth, and finally, plaintiffs request that we remand the case for a new trial before a \u201cnew and unbiased\u201d district court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">As for the first claim, we need not delve into plaintiffs\u2019 contention that, under \u00a7 1607(b), the Bank\u2019s assertion of its counterclaim on remand opened the jurisdictional door to plaintiffs\u2019 counterclaim-in-reply and all of the previously dismissed claims contained therein. Indeed, because plaintiffs did not file their counterclaim-in-reply within the district court\u2019s prescribed twenty-day window, the district court correctly dismissed that filing as untimely. <em>See United States v. Elmes, </em>532 F.3d 1138 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201c[T]he plain language of Rule 12(a)(4) specifies that the district court may alter by order the specified time period for a party to file a responsive pleading.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Next, even if we were persuaded that the prior panel\u2019s opinion in this case was clearly erroneous, \u201c[w]e are bound by the precedent of prior panels absent en banc reconsideration or a superseding contrary decision by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>In re Smith, </em>10 F.3d 723, 724 (10th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">Lastly, we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that plaintiffs\u2019 fraud on the court argument is entirely without merit. \u201cFraud on the court ... is fraud which is directed to the judicial machinery itself and is not fraud between the parties or fraudulent documents, false statements or perjury.\u201d <em>Bulloch v. United States, </em>763 F.2d 1115, 1121 (10th Cir.1985) (en banc). To establish fraud on the court, one must prove that \u201cthe impartial functions of the court have been directly corrupted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, the party alleging fraud on the court bears a heavy burden to prove the fraud by clear and convincing evidence, and \u201call doubts must be resolved in favor of the finality of the judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, a party alleging fraud on the court must demonstrate \u201cconscious wrongdoing [, which] can properly be characterized as a deliberate scheme to defraudf,] before relief from final judgment is appropriate.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Audi Aktiengesellschaft, </em>56 F.3d 1259, 1267 (10th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">We take allegations of fraud on the court very seriously because any time a judgment is procured by fraud it greatly undermines the legitimacy of the entire judicial system. Plaintiffs maintain that the Bank\u2019s attorney suborned false expert testimony that a Chinese banking regulation permitted foreign exchange transfers of less than $100,000 without regulatory approval. In support of this accusation, plaintiffs point to their own experts\u2019 testimony that no such regulation exists and to the Bank\u2019s inability or unwillingness to produce the actual regulation at trial or on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">This paucity of evidence is grossly insufficient to establish a fraud on the court. Rather, plaintiffs\u2019 evidence merely demonstrates that, as is often the case, the parties\u2019 experts disagreed at trial about a matter which was within their area of expertise. We admonish plaintiffs\u2019 counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>that it is inappropriate to level such a serious charge against opposing counsel with little more than conflicting expert testimony to support it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the order of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b744-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-6\">. Section 1607(b) provides that \"[i]n any action brought by a foreign state, or in which a foreign state intervenes ... the foreign state shall not be accorded immunity with respect to any counterclaim ... arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the claim of the foreign state.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b748-16\">. Because we affirm the district court in all respects, we need not consider in detail plaintiffs\u2019 request that we remand for a new trial before a \"new and unbiased\u201d district court judge. Nevertheless, we note that plaintiffs have produced no meaningful evidence in support of their claim that the district court judge who presided over this case harbored any prejudice against them. We admonish plaintiffs' counsel that it is inappropriate to make accusations impugning the integrity and honesty of judges without solid evidence to support such serious charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
