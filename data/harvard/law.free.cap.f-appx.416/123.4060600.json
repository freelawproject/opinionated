On appeal, Adebayo challenges the reasonableness of the prison sentence imposed for these crimes \u2014 concurrent terms of 60 months for the mail fraud counts and 97 months for the unlawful re-entry count \u2014 on the ground of procedural error, specifically, the district court\u2019s failure to recognize its discretion pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) to assign mitigating weight to Adebayo\u2019s substantial assistance even in the absence of a government motion under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. <em>See United States v. Sanchez, </em>517 F.3d 651, 661-62 (2d Cir.2008) (error in determining authority to vary from Guidelines may be procedurally unreasonable). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-14\">In considering Adebayo\u2019s argument, we must \u201cpresume, in the absence of record evidence suggesting otherwise, that a sentencing judge has faithfully discharged his duty to consider the statutory factors enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Malki, </em>609 F.3d 503, 512 (2d Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 33-34 (2d Cir.2006) (applying presumption even where district court failed explicitly to discuss defendant\u2019s argument for sentencing consideration); <em>United States v. Fleming, </em>397 F.3d 95, 100 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that district court is \u201cpresumed to be aware of departure authority in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>absence of record evidence to the contrary or a novel issue unlikely to have been fully appreciated\u201d (citing <em>United States v. Siting, </em>311 F.3d 557, 561 (2d Cir.2002))).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Nothing in the record of this case overcomes this presumption. Indeed, the record indicates that defense counsel specifically urged that Adebayo be given sentencing consideration for his substantial assistance despite the government\u2019s decision not to move for a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure. Nowhere in the record did the government argue that the district court lacked discretion to afford such consideration. Moreover, in addressing Adebayo\u2019s various arguments for mitigation of sentence, the district court never indicated a misunderstanding of its \u00a7 3553(a) discretion; to the contrary, the first fact it identified in its \u00a7 3553(a) analysis as taking Adebayo\u2019s case out of the ordinary was his assistance to the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">In urging otherwise, Adebayo points to the district court\u2019s comment that, \u201chad [Adebayo] not fled\u201d while on bail awaiting sentence, \u201che most likely or most certainly would have received or been the beneficiary of an application by the government for a downward departure. But, he threw that out the window when he took off for Nigeria.\u201d Sentencing Tr. at 15. In context, this comment does not suggest the district court misunderstood its sentencing discretion. Rather, it identified one reason \u2014 flight\u2014among <em>others </em>\u2014 e.g., persistent recidivism \u2014 why the district court declined to exercise its discretion to afford Adebayo more leniency than a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines range. On this record, we identify no procedural error rendering the challenged sentence unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">We have considered Adebayo\u2019s other arguments on appeal and conclude that they are without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b146-11\">. We need not address the question of whether Adebayo\u2019s appeal was timely filed, because even assuming that it was, Adebayo would not be entitled to the relief he seeks. <em>See Abimbola v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 173, 180 (2d Cir.2004) (noting that we may exercise hypothetical jurisdiction where jurisdictional question is statutory, not constitutional).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
