Under the aggravated identity theft count, Baker faced a mandatory minimum sentence of two years. The Government moved for a downward departure under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1 based on Baker\u2019s substantial assistance. The court granted the Government\u2019s motion and sentenced Baker to fifteen months\u2019 imprisonment. Baker appeals her sentence. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">On appeal, Baker argues that the district court should have considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, and not merely the value of her assistance, in determining the extent of the departure below the statutory minimum sentence. This court has previously rejected a similar challenge, <em>see United States v. Hood, </em>556 F.3d 226 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 321, 175 L.Ed.2d 212 (2009), thus establishing circuit authority binding on subsequent panels. <em>United States v. Collins, </em>415 F.3d 304, 311 (4th Cir.2005) (\u201cA decision of a panel of this court becomes the law of the circuit and is binding on other panels unless it is overruled by a subsequent en banc opinion of this court or a superseding contrary decision of the Supreme Court.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, this claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
