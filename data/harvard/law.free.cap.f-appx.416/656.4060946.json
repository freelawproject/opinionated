We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-17\">Gomez contends that Amendment 591 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, clarifying the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.2, authorizes the district court to resentenee him. The record reflects that Gomez\u2019s base offense level was calculated under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l), rather than \u00a7 2D1.2; therefore Amendment 591 does not apply to him. Accordingly, Gomez cannot demonstrate that his sentence is based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission, as required by \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Leniear, </em>574 F.3d 668, 673 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-21\">Gomez also contends that he is entitled to relief under Amendment 591 because the drug quantity used to calculate his base offense level was determined by the sentencing court, rather than a jury. This argument is foreclosed. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2692, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010) (proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) do not implicate the Sixth Amendment right to have essential facts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b678-33\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
