Bey appeals from an order of the District Court dismissing his complaint for failure to comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8. For the following reasons, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-24\">Appellant filed his complaint against the United States Department of State, the State of New Jersey, the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, the United States Library of Congress, Newark Municipality, and Hallmark Properties, Ltd., based on \u201c[djefendant(s) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>failure] to acknowledge the 4th <em>&amp; </em>5th Amendments Rights, Organic Nationality Proclamation, Organic Name Change, and or Common Law Copyrights of Plaintiff.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Compl. 2.) The additional paragraphs of the complaint do not shed any light on the nature of his claims. Additionally, appellant attached several documents to his complaint, including a 94-page constitution entitled \u201cAbyssinian Pangaean Afrimerican Nation\u2019s Catechetical Constitution &amp; Sunna\u201d that he authored.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The District Court ordered appellant to show cause as to why his complaint should not be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and/or failure to comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8. Appellant responded with an \u201caffidavit of jurisdiction\u201d that neither established a logical basis for any of his claims nor elucidated how the District Court possessed jurisdiction over them. Accordingly, the District Court dismissed the complaint with prejudice for failure to comply with Rule 8. Appellant timely appealed that order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires a pleading to contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the grounds for the court\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d and \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d A district court may sua sponte dismiss a complaint for failure to comply with Rule 8, but dismissal \u201cis usually reserved for those cases in which the complaint is so confused, ambiguous, vague, or otherwise unintelligible that its true substance, if any, is well disguised.\u201d <em>Simmons v. Abruzzo, </em>49 F.3d 83, 86 (2d Cir.1995) (quotations omitted). However, a district court should generally give leave to amend, especially when the plaintiff is proceeding pro se and the claims do not appear frivolous. <em>Id. </em>at 87. This Court reviews a district court\u2019s dismissal of claims under Rule 8 for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Westinghouse Sec. Litig., </em>90 F.3d 696, 702 (3d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">The District Court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the complaint for failure to comply with Rule 8. None of appellant\u2019s submissions provide an ascertainable factual or legal basis for his claims. The District Court notified appellant of its intent to dismiss his complaint and provided him with an opportunity to respond. After considering appellant\u2019s complaint and his response to the order to show cause, the District Court concluded that providing appellant with further opportunity to remedy his defective complaint would be futile. Given the incomprehensible nature of appellant\u2019s filings, that is an understandable conclusion within the District Court\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>substantial question is presented by appellant\u2019s appeal, we will summarily affirm. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4; 3d Cir. IOP 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b160-7\">. Although the docket identifies multiple plaintiffs, it appears that appellant is the only plaintiff and that he was simply using various names to refer to himself in the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b160-8\">. The District Court did not enter an order separate from its opinion in accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58. <em>See In re Cendant Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>454 F.3d 235, 244 (3d Cir.2006). Accordingly, appellant had 210 <em>days </em>\u2014 150 for the judgment to be considered \"entered\u201d under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(B) plus the usual 60 afforded by that rule \u2014 from the date that the District Court entered its opinion on the docket to appeal. <em>See LeBoon v. Lancaster Jewish Cmty. Center Ass\u2019n, </em>503 F.3d 217, 223 (3d Cir.2007); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 58(c)(2); Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B) &amp; (a)(7)(ii). Since his notice of appeal was filed in that time frame, his appeal is timely and we have jurisdiction over it. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b160-13\">. That conclusion is bolstered by appellant\u2019s filing in support of his appeal, which appears to be an amended complaint. Appellant now describes his cause of action as \"continuous Trespasses of Discrimination as per 1. Conspiracy against Plaintiff\u2019s rights as a Dual National 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 141-143, \u00a7 145-174 &amp; \u00a7 211 a212 which demonstrates Plaintiffs Most appropriate Moroccan Jurisdiction Birth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Rights to U.S. of A.
