Having carefully considered the parties\u2019 briefs, the record and after oral argument, we affirm the district court\u2019s summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">As to Dominguez\u2019s claims that his rights under USERRA were violated because of the MDFRD\u2019s decisions to (1) delay or deny him the right to take missed promotional exams, (2) give him negative evaluations and counseling, (3) delay promotional pay increases,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (4) and dock his pay, we find no genuine issues of material fact disputing that any of these actions were fully remedied or that the MDFRD\u2019s actions were not on account of his military status. As to his termination, we find no genuine issue of material fact to support Dominguez\u2019s claim that the MDRFD terminated him on account of his military status rather than for the reason given in his Disciplinary Action Report of conduct unbecoming an employee of the County due to his arrest for grand theft from the Miami-Dade County\u2019s Tuition Refund Program. Dominguez has not met his burden showing that there were any similarly-situated employees, not in the military, who received more favorable treatment than he did regarding the discipline imposed as a result of the fraudulent receipt of funds through the Tuition Refund Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b907-6\">. As to Dominguez\u2019s claim that he was denied a longevity increase in October 2005, the district court found that it was undisputed that Dominguez eventually received his retroactive increase but granted summary judgment to Dominguez as to the interest owed on the retroactive payment. The parties stipulated to the fact that the amount of interest owed was $225.24, which amount was subtracted from MDFRD\u2019s recovery of $21,705.00 on its counterclaim and after accounting for $6,256.86 in restitution that MDFRD already recovered from Dominguez resulted in the entry of a Final Judgment in favor of MDFRD of $15,222.90.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
