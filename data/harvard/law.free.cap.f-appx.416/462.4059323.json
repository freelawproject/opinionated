The district court dismissed the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A after determining that Flemings\u2019s complaint was frivolous, failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, or sought monetary relief from an immune defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-14\">Flemings\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP is a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). This court\u2019s inquiry into whether the appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-15\">Flemings fails to provide argument that addresses the district court\u2019s rationale for dismissing his complaint and for determining that his appeal was not in good faith. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9). Although this court liberally construes the briefs of pro se appellants, arguments must be briefed to be preserved. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). By failing to adequately brief a challenge to the district court\u2019s determinations, Flemings has failed to demonstrate that his appeal is taken in good faith. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-20\">Flemings\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and therefore is frivolous. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Flemings has had two other IFP civil actions dismissed pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). <em>See Flemings v. 282nd Judicial District Court, </em>No. 3:10-CV-700-D, 2010 WL 4282165 (N.D.Tex. Oct. 28, 2010); <em>Flemings v. City of Dallas, </em>No. 3:10-CV-1188, 2010 WL 3938378 (N.D.Tex. Oct. 7, 2010). Those two dismissals, as well as the district court\u2019s dismissal in this case and our dismissal of Flemings\u2019s appeal as frivolous all count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g); <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Accordingly, Flemings is now barred under \u00a7 1915(g) from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-22\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b485-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
