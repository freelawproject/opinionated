One of them is that interest accrues on the unpaid amount. Sometimes it takes a while for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to determine that taxes should have been paid that were not. Section 6404(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code permits the Secretary of the Treasury to abate interest \u2014 to forgive it, partially or in whole \u2014 if the assessment of interest on a deficiency is attributable to unreasonable error or delay on the part of the IRS. Section 6404(h) allows for judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s decision not to grant such relief. The question presented in this case is whether this review may be obtained only in the Tax Court, or may also be secured in the district courts and the Court of Federal Claims. We hold that the Tax Court provides the exclusive forum for judicial review of a refusal to abate interest under \u00a7 6404(e)(1), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b843-19\">The Internal Revenue Code provides that if any amount of assessed federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2014\">*2014</page-number>income tax is not paid \u201con or before the last date prescribed for payment,\u201d interest \u201cshall be paid for the period from such last date to the date paid.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6601(a). Section 6404 of the Code authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to abate any tax or related liability in certain circumstances. As part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Congress amended \u00a7 6404 to add subsection (e)(1), which, as enacted, provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-4\">\u201cIn the case of any assessment of interest on ... any deficiency attributable in whole or in part to any error or delay by an officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service (acting in his official capacity) in performing a ministerial act ... the Secretary may abate the assessment of all or any part of such interest for any period.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6404(e)(1) (1994 ed.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">In the years following passage of \u00a7 6404(e)(1), the federal courts uniformly held that the Secretary\u2019s decision not to grant an abatement was not subject to judicial review. See, <em>e.g., Argabright v. United States, </em>85 F.3d 472, 476 (C.A.9 1994); <em>Selman v. United States, </em>941 F.2d 1060, 1064 (C.A.10 1991); <em>Horton Homes, Inc. v. United States, </em>936 F.2d 548, 554 (C.A.11 1991); see also <em>Bax v. Commissioner, </em>13 F.3d 54, 58 (C.A.2 1993). These decisions recognized that \u00a7 6404(e)(1) gave the Secretary complete discretion to determine whether to abate interest, \u201cneither indicating] that such authority should be used universally nor providing] any basis for distinguishing between the instances in which abatement should and should not be granted.\u201d <em>Selman, supra, </em>at 1063. Any decision by the Secretary was accordingly \u201ccommitted to agency discretion by law\u201d .under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2), and thereby insulated from judicial review. See, <em>e.g., Webster v. Doe, </em>486 U.S. 592, 599, 108 S.Ct. 2047, 100 L.Ed.2d 632 (1988); <em>Heckler v. Chaney, </em>470 U.S. 821, 830, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">In 1996, as part of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights 2, Congress again amended \u00a7 6404, adding what is now subsection (h). As relevant, that provision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-9\">\u201cReview of denial of request for abatement of interest.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-0\">\u201c(1) In general. \u2014 The Tax Court shall have jurisdiction over any action brought by a taxpayer who meets the requirements referred to in section 7430(c) (4) (A) (ii) to determine whether the Secretary\u2019s failure to abate interest under this section was an abuse of discretion, and may order an abatement, if such action is brought within 180 days after the date of the mailing of the See-retary\u2019s final determination not to abate such interest.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6404(h)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">Section 7430(c)(4)(A)(ii) in turn incorporates 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(B), which refers to individuals with a net worth not exceeding $2 million and businesses with a net worth not exceeding $7 million. Congress made subsection (h) effective for all requests for abatement submitted to the IRS after July 30, 1996, regardless of the tax year involved. \u00a7 302(b), 110 Stat. 1458.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b844-13\">In 1986, petitioner John Hinck was a limited partner in an entity called AgriCal Venture Associates (ACVA). Along <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2015\">*2015</page-number>with his wife, petitioner Pamela Hinek, Hinek filed a joint return for 1986 reporting his share of losses from the partnership. The IRS later examined the tax returns for ACVA and proposed adjustments to deductions that the partnership had claimed for 1984, 1985, and 1986. In 1990, the IRS issued a final notice regarding the partnership\u2019s returns, disallowing tens of millions of dollars of deductions. While the partnership sought administrative review of this decision, the Hincks, in May 1996, made an advance remittance of $93,890 to the IRS toward any personal deficiency that might result from a final adjustment of ACVA\u2019s returns. In March 1999, the Hincks reached a settlement with the IRS concerning the ACVA partnership adjustments, to the extent they affected the Hincks\u2019 return. Shortly thereafter, as a result of the adjustments, the IRS imposed additional liability against the Hincks: $16,409 in tax and $21,669.22 in interest. The IRS applied the Hincks\u2019 advance remittance to this amount and refunded them the balance of $55,811.78.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The Hincks filed a claim with the IRS contending that, because of IRS errors and delays, the interest assessed against them for the period from March 21, 1989, to April 1, 1993, should be abated under \u00a7 6404(e)(1). The IRS denied the request. The Hincks then filed suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims seeking review of the refusal to abate. That court granted the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss, 64 Fed.Cl. 71, 81 (2005), and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed, 446 F.3d 1307, 1313-1314 (2006), holding that \u00a7 6404(h) vests exclusive jurisdiction to review interest abatement claims under \u00a7 6404(e)(1) in the Tax Court. Because this decision conflicted with the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Beall v. United States, </em>336 F.3d 419, 430 (2003) (holding that \u00a7 6404(h) grants concurrent rather than exclusive jurisdiction to the Tax Court), we granted certiorari, 549 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1055, 166 L.Ed.2d 797 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">Our analysis is governed by the well-established principle that, in most contexts, \u201c \u2018a precisely drawn, detailed statute pre-empts more general remedies.\u2019 \u201d <em>EC Term of Years Trust v. United States, </em>550 U.S.-,-, 127 S.Ct. 1763, 1764, 167 L.E.2d 729 (2007) (quoting <em>Brown v. GSA </em>425 U.S. 820, 834, 96 S.Ct. 1961, 48 L.Ed.2d 402 (1976)); see also <em>Block v. North Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and School Lands, </em>461 U.S. 273, 284-286, 103 S.Ct. 1811, 75 L.Ed.2d 840 (1983). We are also guided by our past recognition that when Congress enacts a specific remedy when no remedy was previously recognized, or when previous remedies were \u201cproblematic,\u201d the remedy provided is generally regarded as exclusive. <em>Id., </em>at 285, 103 S.Ct. 1811; <em>Brown, supra, </em>at 826-829, 96 S.Ct. 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-13\">Section 6404(h) fits the bill on both counts. It is a \u201cprecisely drawn, detailed statute\u201d that, in a single sentence, provides a forum for adjudication, a limited class of potential plaintiffs, a statute of limitations, a standard of review, and authorization for judicial relief. And Congress enacted this provision against a backdrop of decisions uniformly rejecting the possibility of any review for taxpayers wishing to challenge the Secretary\u2019s \u00a7 6404(e)(1) determination. Therefore, despite Congress\u2019s failure explicitly to define the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction as exclusive, we think it quite plain that the terms of \u00a7 6404(h) \u2014 a \u201cprecisely drawn, detailed statute\u201d filling a perceived hole in the law \u2014 control all requests for review of \u00a7 6404(e)(1) determinations. Those terms include the forum for adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2016\">*2016</page-number>The Hincks\u2019 primary argument against exclusive Tax Court jurisdiction is that by providing a standard of review \u2014 abuse of discretion \u2014 in \u00a7 6404(h), Congress eliminated the primary barrier to judicial review that courts had previously recognized; accordingly, they maintain, taxpayers may seek review of \u00a7 6404(e)(1) determinations under statutes granting jurisdiction to the district courts and the Court of Federal Claims to review tax refund actions. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1846(a)(1), 1491(a)(1); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422(a). Or, as the Fifth Circuit reasoned: \u201c[T]he federal district courts have always possessed <em>jurisdiction </em>over challenges brought to section 6404(e)(1) denials^] they simply determined that the taxpayers had no <em>substantive right </em>whatever to a favorable exercise of the Secretary\u2019s discretion ... .[I]n enacting section 6404(h), Congress indicated that such is no longer the case, and thereby removed any impediment to district court review.\u201d <em>Beall, supra, </em>at 428 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">It is true that by providing an abuse of discretion standard, Congress removed one of the obstacles courts had held foreclosed judicial review of \u00a7 6404(e)(1) determinations. See, <em>e.g., Argabright, </em>35 F.3d, at 476 (noting an absence of \u201c \u2018judicially manageable standards\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Heckler, </em>470 U.S., at 830, 105 S.Ct. 1649)). But in enacting \u00a7 6404(h), Congress did not simply supply this single missing ingredient; rather, it set out a carefully circumscribed, time-limited, plaintiff-specific provision, which also precisely defined the appropriate forum. We cannot accept the Hincks\u2019 invitation to isolate one feature of this \u201cprecisely drawn, detailed statute\u201d \u2014 the portion specifying a standard of review\u2014 and use it to permit taxpayers to circumvent the other limiting features Congress placed in the <em>same </em>statute \u2014 restrictions such as a shorter statute of limitations than general refund suits, compare \u00a7 6404(h) (180-day limitations period) with \u00a7 6532(a)(1) (2-year limitations period), or a net-worth ceiling for plaintiffs eligible to bring suit. Taxpayers could \u201ceffortlessly evade\u201d these specific limitations by bringing interest abatement claims as tax refund actions in the district courts or the Court of Federal Claims, disaggregating a statute Congress plainly envisioned as a package deal. <em>EC Term of Years Trust, supra, </em>at -, 127 S.Ct., at 1767-1768; see also <em>Block, supra, </em>at 284-285, 103 S.Ct. 1811; <em>Brown, supra, </em>425 U.S., at 832-833, 96 S.Ct. 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">. The Hincks\u2019 other contentions are equally unavailing. First, they claim that reading \u00a7 6404(h) to vest exclusive jurisdiction in the Tax Court impliedly repeals the preexisting jurisdiction of the district courts and Court of Federal Claims, despite our admonition that \u201crepeals by implication are not favored.\u201d <em>Morton v. Mancari, </em>417 U.S. 535, 549, 94 S.Ct. 2474, 41 L.Ed.2d 290 (1974) (internal quotation marks omitted). But the implied-repeal doctrine is not applicable here, for when Congress passed \u00a7 6404(h), \u00a7 6404(e)(1) had been interpreted not to provide <em>any </em>right of review for taxpayers. There is thus no indication of any \u201clanguage on the statute books that [Congress] wishe[d] to change,\u201d <em>United States v. Fausto, </em>484 U.S. 439, 453, 108 S.Ct. 668, 98 L.Ed.2d 830 (1988), implicitly or explicitly. Congress simply prescribed a limited form of review where none had previously been found to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">Second, the Hincks assert that vesting jurisdiction over \u00a7 6404(e)(1) abatement decisions exclusively in the Tax Court runs contrary to the \u201centire structure of tax controversy jurisdiction,\u201d Brief for Petitioners 30, under which the Tax Court generally hears prepayment challenges to tax liability, see \u00a7 6213(a), while postpayment actions are brought in the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2017\">*2017</page-number>courts or Court of Federal Claims. In a related vein, the Hincks point out that the Government\u2019s position would force taxpayers seeking postpayment review of their tax liabilities to separate their \u00a7 6404(e)(1) abatement claims from their refund claims and bring each in a different court. Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that we were inclined to depart from the face of the statute, these arguments are undercut on two fronts. To begin with, by expressly granting to the Tax Court <em>some </em>jurisdiction over \u00a7 6404(e)(1) decisions, Congress has already broken with the general scheme the Hincks identify. No one doubts that an action seeking review of a \u00a7 6404(e)(1) determination may be maintained in the Tax Court even if the interest has already been paid, see, <em>e.g., Dadian v. Commissioner, </em>87 TCM 1344 (2004), \u00b62004-121 RIA Memo TC, p. 790-2004, 2004 WL 1118291; <em>Miller v. Commissioner, </em>79 TCM 2213 (2000), 112000-195 RIA Memo TC, p. 1120-2000, 2000 WL 863155, aff'd, 310 F.3d 640 (C.A.9 2002), and the Hincks point to no case where the Tax Court has refused to exercise jurisdiction under such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">In addition, an interest abatement claim under \u00a7 6404(e)(1) involves no questions of substantive tax law, but rather is premised on issues of bureaucratic administration (whether, for example, there was \u201cerror or delay\u201d in the performance of a \u201cministerial\u201d act, \u00a7 6404(e)(1)(A)). Judicial review of decisions not to abate requires an evaluation of the internal processes of the IRS, not the underlying tax liability of the taxpayer. We find nothing tellingly awkward about channeling such discrete and specialized .questions of administrative operations to one particular court, even if in some respects it \u201cmay not appear to be efficient\u201d as a policy matter to separate refund and interest abatement claims. 446 F.3d, at 1316.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">Last, the Hincks contend that Congress would not have intended to vest jurisdiction exclusively in the Tax Court because it would lead to the \u201cunreasonable\u201d result that taxpayers with net worths greater than $2 million (for individuals) or $7 million (for businesses) would be foreclosed from seeking judicial review of \u00a7 6404(e)(1) refusals to abate. Brief for Petitioners 46; see also <em>Beall, </em>336 F.3d, at 430. But we agree with the Federal Circuit that this outcome \u201cwas contemplated by Congress.\u201d 446 F.3d, at 1316. The net-worth limitation in \u00a7 6404(h) reflects Congress\u2019s judgment that wealthier taxpayers are more likely to be able to pay a deficiency before contesting it, thereby avoiding accrual of interest during their administrative and legal challenges. In contrast, taxpayers with comparatively fewer resources are more likely to contest their assessed deficiency before first paying it, thus exposing themselves to interest charges if their challenge is ultimately unsuccessful. There is nothing \u201cunreasonable\u201d about Congress\u2019s decision to grant the possibility of judicial relief only to those taxpayers most likely to be in need of it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2018\">*2018</page-number>The judgment of the' United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b844-6\">. The Taxpayer Bill of Rights 2 also modified 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6404(e)(1)(A) to add the word \"unreasonable\u201d before the words \"error or delay\u201d and to change \"ministerial act\u201d to \"ministerial or managerial act.\u201d \u00a7 301(a), 110 Stat. 1457. These changes, however, only apply to interest accruing on deficiencies for tax years beginning after July 30, 1996, see \u00a7 301(c), <em>ibid.., </em>and thus are not implicated in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b847-6\">. We note that the Hincks sought only interest abatement in the Court of Federal Claims, thus failing to implicate the \"claim-splitting\u201d and efficiency concerns they condemn. See Brief for Petitioners 49.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b847-7\">. The Hincks also argue that the net-worth limitations on \u00a7 6404(h) review violate the due process rights of those taxpayers who exceed them. The court below did not pass upon this constitutional challenge, nor do we, for as the Hincks concede, the record contains no findings concerning their own net worth, Brief for Petitioners 44, and they offer no reasons to deviate from our general rule that a party \"must assert his own legal rights and interests, and cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties,\u201d <em>Kowalski v. Tesmer, </em>543 U.S. 125, 129, 125 S.Ct. 564, 160 L.Ed.2d 519 (2004) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2018\">*2018</page-number>(quoting <em>Worth v.
