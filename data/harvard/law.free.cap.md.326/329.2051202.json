Merling is an independent insurance agent, and, as such he may place his clients with one of several insurance companies, depending upon the best interests of those clients. Merling had entered into an agency agreement with the defendant insurance companies, who are the Travelers Indemnity Company, the Charter Oak Fire Insurance Company, and the Phoenix Insurance Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>pany (hereinafter collectively referred to as \u201cTravelers\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The agency agreement authorized Merling to solicit, bind and issue Travelers\u2019 insurance policies for certain types of risks. In exchange for selling Travelers\u2019 insurance policies, Merling was entitled to receive as commissions a percentage of the premiums paid on all policies originated or renewed through Merling. The agency agreement also provided for termination of the agency relationship upon 120 days notice by either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">On September 19, 1986, Travelers notified Merling by letter that he was to be terminated effective January 30, 1987. A subsequent letter extended this date to February 20, 1987. The reason for his termination, as stated in the original letter, was Merling\u2019s inability to produce any quantity of certain types of business. Although Merling complained to Maryland\u2019s Insurance Commissioner, the Commissioner concluded that his termination was lawful under the Insurance Code, Maryland Code (1957, 1991 Repl.Vol.), Art. 48A, \u00a7 234B. Merling did not seek judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision pursuant to Art. 48A, \u00a7\u00a7 40 and 234C. Merling has not, and indeed could not, collaterally challenge that administrative determination by the Insurance Commissioner in the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Travelers\u2019 termination letter advised Merling that, \u201cin line with contract provisions [of the agency agreement] we will offer to renew all existing business which meets our current underwriting standards for one year after the effective date of this termination.\u201d Travelers, in accordance with that agreement, paid Merling the renewal commissions for the one year from February 20, 1987, to February 20, 1988. During that one year period, Merling was able to place some of his clients with other insurance companies, either directly or through another agent. Nevertheless, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>many of Merling\u2019s clients chose to remain with Travelers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Merling wrote a letter to these clients stating that Travelers \u201chas discontinued its business relationship with\u201d Merling, that Merling had originally placed the clients with Travelers as it was in their best interests, and that it was in their best interests to stay with Travelers.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">After February 20, 1988, Travelers notified Merling\u2019s clients directly that the business relationship between Travelers and Merling had ended. The letter also stated that, as required by law, their policies would continue to be renewed. The letter, however, informed the insureds that Merling was \u201cin the best position to handle your insurance needs, including placing your insurance with another company.\u201d The letter further stated that \u201c[w]e urge you to contact your insurance agent for counseling ... or if you wish to continue insuring with The Travelers, a bill will be sent to you shortly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Those insureds deciding to remain with Travelers had their policies recoded to a house account, with no agent listed on the policy. The policies were renewed directly through Travelers. No renewal commissions on these policies were paid to Merling or to any other agent after February 20, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">On December 13, 1988, Merling instituted in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City the present action against Travelers, alleging that Travelers had committed various torts with regard to Merling\u2019s property rights and contract rights. The complaint initially set forth in detail the facts as summarized above. Th\u00e9reafter, count one of the complaint, labeled \u201cConversion,\u201d asserted that the defendants had converted Merling\u2019s \u201cpersonal property by appropriating to their own exclusive use and ownership the expira<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>tions entrusted to them by Plaintiff.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Count three, labeled \u201cIntentional Interference With Property Rights,\u201d asserted that Merling \u201cwas the sole and exclusive owner of his work product, called \u2018expirations,\u2019 \u201d and that the \u201c[defendants interfered with and deprived Plaintiff of his property right to his expirations.\u201d The substance of both count one and count three was the same, namely that Merling\u2019s expirations were \u201cconverted\u201d or \u201cinterfered with\u201d by Travelers\u2019 action in sending renewal policies and premium invoices to Merling\u2019s former clients in such a manner that the business was not renewed through Merling and was renewed as house accounts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">The second count of Merling\u2019s complaint asserted that Travelers had intentionally interfered with the contractual or economic relations between Merling and his clients, and the fourth count alleged that Travelers had violated the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1968 (\u201cRICO\u201d). Merling sought both compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Travelers filed a motion to dismiss, and Merling filed a motion for summary judgment with regard to liability. The circuit court granted Merling\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the first three counts, concluding that Merling was \u201centitled to his commissions ad infinitum ... [a]s long as that customer continues the business with that company____\u201d The circuit court conditioned Merling\u2019s entitlement to damages upon Merling\u2019s continued servicing of those policies. The circuit court granted Travelers\u2019 motion to dismiss with respect to the RICO count and the request for punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>A separate trial was then held before a different judge on Merling\u2019s damages. At the conclusion of the trial on damages, the circuit court entered judgment against Travelers in the amount of $59,892.02 plus interest. Both parties appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, and, prior to oral argument in the Court of Special Appeals, both sides petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari. We granted both petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">In the circuit court and in this Court, Merling argued that common law principles gave him exclusive ownership of his expirations. He contended that Travelers\u2019 use of those expirations to contact his insureds tortiously violated his property rights and amounted to a conversion of his property. In this Court, Merling insists that \u201c[t]he claims below were not predicated upon a right to renewal commissions based on contract. Rather, the claims below were in tort, for the conversion of an independent agent\u2019s expirations, for intentional interference with his contractual relations with his clients (the insureds), and for the intentional interference with his property rights.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Merling\u2019s brief, pp. 1-2). Consequently, as Merling\u2019s counsel conceded at oral argument, the case primarily turns on the nature of Merling\u2019s expirations as a property right.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>The term \u201cexpirations\u201d has a definite meaning and, as stated in <em>V.L.

The cases refer to this custom and usage in the insurance trade as the \u201cAmerican Agency System.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Fred Miller Co. v. Empire Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co., supra, </em>503 F.2d at 754-755; <em>Spier v. Home Insurance Company, supra, </em>404 F.2d at 898; <em>Woodruff v. Auto Owners Ins.

Farmers Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, supra, </em>139 F.Supp. at 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Under American common law principles, <em>i.e., </em>under the American Agency System, if an insurance company terminated an agent, the company was prohibited from interfering with the agent\u2019s property right in the expirations. This meant that the company could not use the expirations to directly solicit the insureds or to refer them to other agents who represented the company. <em>V.L. Phillips &amp; Co. v. Pennsylvania Threshermen, Etc., supra, </em>199 F.2d at 248 (\u201cThe [company] had no right to solicit directly from the insured nor could it do so indirectly by appointing plaintiffs\u2019 former agents and thereby acquire through them the expirations and use them to the prejudice of plaintiffs\u201d); <em>Woodruff v. Auto Owners Ins. Co., supra, </em>300 Mich, at 60, 1 N.W.2d at 453 (\u201cthe so-called clientele ... of an insurance agent may be preserved to him as far as possible upon the termination of his agency\u201d). <em>See also Calley v. United States, supra, </em>220 F.Supp. at 114. The result was that, upon termination of the agent, a majority of the policies which originated from that agent were not renewed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Even though the American Agency System gave the agent a property right in his expirations, several courts concluded that the insurance company was permitted, if not required, to contact the insureds directly after an agent\u2019s termination. <em>See Spier v. Home Insurance Company, supra, </em>404 F.2d at 899 (it was the company\u2019s duty to inform its insureds of the termination, and the American Agency System did not change that duty); <em>Hedlund v. Farmers Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., supra, </em>139 F.Supp. at 537 (letter to the insureds was sent without malice and had no ulterior purpose other than to provide the insureds with important information); <em>Woodruff v. Auto Owners Ins. Co., supra, </em>300 Mich, at 60, 1 N.W.2d at 453 (American Agency System \u201cdoes not cut off all right of the insurer to contact persons to whom its policies have been issued through the discontinued agency\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">The above-cited cases indicate that even under common law principles, the agent\u2019s right to his expirations was not absolute. Moreover, Maryland, like many other states, has legislatively changed the common law American Agency System.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">By Ch. 417 of the Acts of 1970, the General Assembly added \u00a7\u00a7 234A, 234B and 234G to the Insurance Code, Art. 48A. Section 234A was enacted to prohibit insurance companies from engaging in numerous underwriting practices deemed arbitrary or discriminatory, including the practice of what is called \u201credlining,\u201d whereby insurers would refuse to renew or write policies based on the geographic area in which the insureds or applicants lived. Section 234A, <em>inter alia, </em>required insurers to renew existing policies unless the insurers could demonstrate certain economic or business reasons for the refusal to renew. Section 234B <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>protected insurance agents from arbitrary or discriminatory termination by insurers. Section 234C granted to the Insurance Commissioner the power to order an insurance company either to accept the risk of an insured or the business from an agent if the Commissioner finds a violation of either \u00a7 234A or \u00a7 234B.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Sections 234A, 234B, and 234C, as originally enacted in 1970, still did not completely prevent the nonrenewal of insurance policies for reasons unrelated to legitimate underwriting considerations. Under the American Agency System, the insurance companies could not use the expirations of a terminated agent to renew the policies of insureds. Therefore, when an agent in a particular geographic area was terminated for a legitimate reason, the effect was that the insurance policies of that agent\u2019s clients were not renewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">By Ch. 73 of the Acts of 1972, the General Assembly amended \u00a7 234B so that a compromise was reached between the agent\u2019s right to his expirations following termination and the State\u2019s interest in protecting the insureds from cancellations or nonrenewals. As amended in 1972, the statute guarantees that the policies produced by the agent will be renewed through the agent for one year following the agent\u2019s termination.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The statute also per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>mits the agency agreement to set forth a longer period.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Thus, the agent is given the benefit from his expirations for at least a year after termination; he is guaranteed at least a year\u2019s worth of renewal commissions. During that year the agent may, as Merling did, place his clients with other insurance companies or broker his clients through another agency. The agent may also sell his expirations outright to another agency, as they are a marketable asset.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At the end of that one year period, or whatever longer period might be set forth in the agency agreement, the insurance company is required by \u00a7 234B to renew the policies of those insureds who decide to stay with the company, unless there exist valid grounds for nonrenewal other than the termination of the agent. Section 234B(c) states: \u201cNo insurer shall cancel or refuse to renew the policy of the insured because of the termination of the agent\u2019s or broker\u2019s contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Section 234B(c), therefore, requires the insurer to use the former agent\u2019s expirations to renew the policies of those insureds choosing to remain with the insurer. The statute obviously modifies an agent\u2019s property right in his expirations. Travelers was simply complying with the mandate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>the statute, rather than interfering with Merling\u2019s property rights or converting Merling\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Merling also points to paragraph 14 of his agency agreement with Travelers as confirming his property right in his expirations. Paragraph 14 recognizes Merling\u2019s \u201ccontrol of [his] expirations,\u201d provides that Travelers will not use them in a way \u201cwhich shall abridge the Agent\u2019s rights,\u201d and that Travelers will not \u201crefer or communicate this expiration information or work product to any other Agent or Broker.\u201d Merling does not argue however, that paragraph 14 grants him greater rights in his expirations than he would otherwise have, and that such contractually granted greater rights continue even after the expiration of the agency agreement. Moreover, nothing in the language of paragraph 14 would support such an argument. In addition, paragraph 13 of the agreement appears to embody the one-year post termination period guaranteed by \u00a7 234B(b) for renewals through the agent, as it provides that, after termination, all policies expiring \u201cmay, at the option of the Agent, be renewed for one additional year, at the rate of commission and upon the terms in effect at the time of termination.\u201d Paragraph 14 of the agency agreement simply recognizes the agent\u2019s common law property right in his expirations. That property right, however, has been modified by Art. 48A, \u00a7 234B.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Travelers\u2019 alleged actions in this case, being entirely in accordance with \u00a7 234B, did not constitute a conversion of or interference with Merling\u2019s property rights. The circuit court erred in granting Merling\u2019s motion for summary judgment on counts one and three of his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">The circuit court also granted Merling\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the count asserting an intentional interference with the contractual or economic relations between Merling and his clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Merling appears to recognize that, to the extent that the contractual or economic relations among the clients, Merling, and Travelers are reflected in the insurance policies, Travelers cannot be guilty of the tort of wrongful interference with contractual or economic relations because it is a party to the insurance policies. For the tort to lie, the defendant tortfeasor cannot be a party to the contractual or economic relations with which he has allegedly interfered. <em>See, e.g., K &amp; K Management v. Lee, </em>316 Md. 137, 154-156, 557 A.2d 965, 973-974 (1989); <em>Sharrow v. State Farm Mutual, </em>306 Md. 754, 763, 511 A.2d 492, 497 (1986); <em>Natural Design, Inc. v. Rouse Co., </em>302 Md. 47, 69, 485 A.2d 663, 674 (1984); <em>Wilmington Trust Co. v. Clark, </em>289 Md. 313, 329, 424 A.2d 744, 754 (1981) (\u201cthere is no cause of action for interference with a contract when suit is brought against a party to the contract\u201d); <em>Shrewsbery v. National Grange Mut. Ins., supra, </em>395 S.E.2d at 748 (\u201cno one can be liable for tortious interference with his own contract\u201d). Merling contends, however, that \u201c[t]he contract here interfered with is the personal services contract between the independent agent and his client, rather than the contract of indemnity issued by the insurer____\u201d (Merling\u2019s brief, p. 22).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Assuming arguendo that there existed contracts between Merling and the insureds which were separate from the insurance policies and that Travelers interfered with those contracts by renewing the policies of the insureds as house accounts instead of through Merling, Merling still would not be entitled to recover tort damages for Travelers\u2019 interference. For one to recover for tortious interference with contractual or economic relations, the interference must have been wrongful or unlawful. <em>K &amp; K Management v. Lee, supra, </em>316 Md. at 155-170, 557 A.2d at 973-981; <em>Sharrow v. State Farm Mutual, supra, </em>306 Md. at 765, 511 A.2d at 498; <em>Natural Design, Inc. v.

Therefore Travelers did not tortiously interfere with Merling\u2019s contractual or economic relations with his clients. The circuit court erroneously granted Merling\u2019s motion for summary judgment on count two of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">In his cross appeal, Merling challenges the circuit court\u2019s dismissal of the count alleging a violation of RICO, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1968.

Imrex Co., Inc., </em>473 U.S. 479, 481-482, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3277, 87 L.Ed.2d 346, 349-350 (1985), explained the term \u201cracketeering activity\u201d in RICO as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-11\">\u201cRICO takes aim at \u2018racketeering activity,\u2019 which it defines as any act \u2018chargeable\u2019 under several generically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>described state criminal laws, any act \u2018indictable\u2019 under numerous specific federal criminal provisions, including mail and wire fraud, and any \u2018offense\u2019 involving bankruptcy or securities fraud or drug-related activities that is \u2018punishable\u2019 under federal law. \u00a7 1961(1).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">Merling argues that Travelers\u2019 actions in mailing \u201chundreds of deceptive letters to Merling\u2019s policyholders, by which the Travelers Companies appropriated the expirations,\u201d constituted a \u201cfraudulent appropriation to one\u2019s own use of another\u2019s property entrusted to him.\u201d (Merling\u2019s brief, p. 39). According to Merling, this conduct by Travelers amounted to \u201cmail fraud\u201d in violation of the federal mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, and, therefore, amounted to \u201cracketeering\u201d in violation of RICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Whatever may be the scope of RICO and the federal mail fraud statute in other contexts,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> it is obvious that the alleged actions of Travelers, upon which Merling relies, do not constitute a violation of the federal mail fraud statute. The Supreme Court in <em>McNally v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 350, 358, 107 S.Ct. 2875, 2881, 97 L.Ed.2d 292, 302 (1987), quoting from <em>Hammerschmidt v. United States, </em>265 U.S. 182, 188, 44 S.Ct. 511, 512, 68 L.Ed. 968 (1924), pointed out with respect to the mail fraud statute that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfM\">\u201cthe words \u2018to defraud\u2019 commonly refer \u2018to wronging one in his property rights by dishonest methods or schemes,\u2019 and \u2018usually signify the deprivation of something of value by trick, deceit, chicane or overreaching.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The Court went on to say \u201cthat the statute reache[s] false promises and misrepresentations as to the future as well as other frauds involving money or property.\u201d <em>McNally v. United States, supra, </em>483 U.S. at 359, 107 S.Ct. at 2881, 97 L.Ed.2d at 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>As outlined in Part I of this opinion, Travelers\u2019 actions were not wrongful. Travelers did not obtain Merling\u2019s property by \u201ctrick, deceit, chicane or overreaching\u201d or by any \u201cfalse promises and misrepresentations.\u201d The insurer\u2019s letters to the insureds were truthful and accurate. Travelers\u2019 actions were entirely lawful under the Maryland Insurance Code; in fact, the actions about which Merling complains were required by the Insurance Code, Art. 48A, \u00a7 234B.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Since Merling\u2019s allegations failed to set forth any wrongful acts by Travelers, the circuit court correctly dismissed the RICO count. For the reasons previously discussed, however, the circuit erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Merling on the other counts. The court should have granted Travelers\u2019 motion to dismiss those counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY IN FAVOR OF BERNARD W. MERLING IS REVERSED. THE ORDER OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY DISMISSING COUNT FOUR OF THE COMPLAINT IS AFFIRMED. THE CASE IS REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY WITH DIRECTIONS TO DISMISS THE ENTIRE COMPLAINT. COSTS TO BE PAID BY BERNARD W. MERLING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b421-8\">.

According to Merling, some of his clients had no choice but to remain with Travelers as the underwriting standards for new business are much higher than for renewal business. Thus, no new carrier would insure these clients as new business, while Travelers was obligated by statute to renew their policies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b423-7\">. \"Expirations\u201d refers to an agent\u2019s work product or the information collected by the agent with regard to his clients.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b423-8\">.

This prohibition against the insurance companies\u2019 use of the agent\u2019s expirations to directly solicit the insureds did not prohibit the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>sureds from seeking out the company on their own in order to renew their policies. <em>See V.L.

Other states which have enacted similar mandatory renewal provisions also recognize the tension between the provision and an agent's right to his expirations. Of those states, most of them have provided the agent with at least a year\u2019s worth of renewal commissions following termination. <em>See </em>Cal.Ins.Code \u00a7 769(d) (West Cum.Supp.1992); Del.Code Ann. tit. 18 \u00a7 529 (1975, 1989 Repl.Vol.); Kan.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 40-2, 107(b) (1986); Mass.Ann.Laws ch. 175, \u00a7 163 (Law.Co-op.

The terminating insurance company may even choose to purchase the expirations itself, as it may wish to eliminate the agent\u2019s involvement immediately.
