The narrow question presented is whether an award of the health claims arbitration panel in favor of the claimant on the merits can be subdivided into an award finding liability and an award assessing damages, permitting the claimant to seek judicial review of only the amount of damages awarded. We shall answer that question in the negative and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">Helen Denise Crawford alleged that she was injured as a result of malpractice by Dr. William R. Leahy and his professional association, Neurological Medicine, P.A. (collectively \u201cDr. Leahy\u201d). Mrs. Crawford and her husband<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Crawfords), filed a claim against Dr. Leahy, pursuant to the Act. After a hearing before a health claims arbitration panel, the Crawfords obtained an award of $37,768 against Dr. Leahy. The panel\u2019s decision was rendered on a preprinted form which compelled the arbitrators to set forth separately their decisions regarding liability, damages, and costs, as required by the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Dissatisfied with the amount of damages, the Crawfords filed a pleading in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County entitled \u201cNotice of Action to Nullify Award as to Damages Only,\u201d attempting to reject the award of the panel as it related to damages only in an effort to prevent <em>de novo </em>judicial review of the arbitration panel\u2019s liability determination. The Crawfords simultaneously filed a complaint, as required by Maryland Rule BY4, alleging that Dr. Leahy had been negligent in his care and treatment of Mrs. Crawford. The Crawfords demanded a jury trial \u201con all issues herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">In response, Dr. Leahy filed a \u201cMotion to Strike or, in the Alternative, for Complete Rejection of the Arbitration Award.\u201d In that pleading, Dr. Leahy asserted that the Act required that the Crawfords reject the liability finding in their favor as well as the damages determination or, alternatively, that the Crawfords\u2019 notice of rejection should be deemed to have rejected the entire award. Concluding that there is \u201cno authority to allow an appeal from Health Claims Arbitration on the issue of damages alone,\u201d Judge William H. McCullough granted Dr. Leahy\u2019s motion to strike, giving the Crawfords leave to file an amended notice of action to nullify award and complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Thereafter, the Crawfords filed an \u201cAmended Notice of Action to Nullify Award,\u201d stating that they \u201creject the award of the Health Claims Arbitration panel as it relates to liability and damages.\u201d The Crawfords also filed an \u201cAmended Complaint\u201d that was identical to the originally filed complaint; both pleadings contained allegations of negligence. Dr. Leahy answered, denying liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Ten months later, after extensive discovery regarding matters relevant to both liability and damages, and ten days before trial, the Crawfords, in another attempt to limit the trial solely to the issue of damages, moved for reconsideration of the court\u2019s earlier decision. The Crawfords suggested that \u201c[t]he \u2018all or nothing\u2019 approach adopted by Judge McCullough requires plaintiffs to prove a <em>non sequitur, </em>that is, that the liability finding in their favor is \u2018not correct.\u2019 \u201d Dr. Leahy opposed this motion, noting that once the award is rejected by either party, the case proceeds <em>de novo, </em>so that the jury necessarily considers the issue of Dr. Leahy\u2019s liability. Dr. Leahy reiterated his prior arguments that neither the statute nor the rules permit piecemeal rejection of an award as asserted by the Crawfords. Judge James P. Salmon, who was to preside at the trial, denied the motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The case proceeded to trial before a jury. In support of their claims, the Crawfords presented evidence which included not only the arbitration award, but also extensive expert testimony on the issue of Dr. Leahy\u2019s alleged negligence. The case was submitted to the jury on specific issues pursuant to Md.Rule 2-522. The jury returned a special verdict finding that Dr. Leahy was not negligent with regard to his care and treatment of Mrs. Crawford.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The Crawfords timely appealed to the Court of Special Appeals from the judgment entered on that special verdict. We issued a writ of certiorari on our own motion, prior to argument before the Court of Special Appeals, to consider the important issue raised by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">When the General Assembly originally adopted the Act by Ch. 235 of the Acts of 1976, it mandated that all claims for medical malpractice be submitted to an arbitration panel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>prior to pursuing them by an action in court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\">\u201cThe mandatory arbitration requirement does not divest courts of subject matter jurisdiction over health claims, but rather \u2018 \u201ccreates a condition precedent to the institution of a court action.\u201d \u2019 <em>Tranen [v. Aziz </em>], 304 Md. [605] at 612, 500 A.2d [636] at 639 [(1985)] (quoting <em>Oxtoby v. McGowan, </em>294 Md. 83, 91, 447 A.2d 860, 865 (1982)). Upon fulfillment of the condition precedent, malpractice claims may be heard in court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-6\">\u201cThe final step in the arbitration process, an essential prerequisite to institution of judicial proceedings, is the filing of a notice of rejection with the director of the Arbitration Office. <em>Tranen, </em>304 Md. at 612, 500 A.2d at 639; \u00a7 3-2A-06(a). Failure to file notice of rejection permits the arbitration award to become final and binding. <em>Tranen, </em>304 Md. at 613, 500 A.2d at 640; \u00a7 3-2A-05(h).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">\u201cThe 'exclusive step by which the aggrieved party may initiate proceedings in court,\u2019 <em>Tranen, </em>304 Md. at 612, 500 A.2d at 639, is the action to nullify the award. Section 3-2A-06(b). Although called an action to nullify, the proceeding is not analogous to an appeal from an administrative decision. Rather, the action is essentially a separate common law tort action with the added element that the arbitration process must be complete. <em>See Attorney General v. Johnson, </em>282 Md. 274, 385 A.2d 57, <em>appeal dismissed, </em>439 U.S. 805, 99 S.Ct. 60, 58 L.Ed.2d 97 (1978).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-8\"><em>Ott v. Kaiser-Georgetown Health Plan, </em>309 Md. 641, 645-46, 526 A.2d 46, 49 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Whether the Act permits rejection of the panel\u2019s award soley as to damages is an issue of statutory construction and as such is ordinarily determined by reference to legislative intent. When we seek to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent, \u201cwe look first to the words of the statute, read in light of the full context in which they appear, and in light of external manifestations of intent or general purpose available through other evidence.\u201d <em>Cunningham v. State, </em>318 Md. 182, 185, 567 A.2d 126, 127 (1989). <em>See State v. Bricker, </em>321 Md. 86, 92, 581 A.2d 9, 12 (1990); <em>Davis v. State, </em>319 Md. 56, 60, 570 A.2d 855, 857 (1990); <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 513, 525 A.2d 628, 632 (1987). In doing so, we give the language of the statute its natural and ordinary signification, bearing in mind the statutory aim and objective. <em>Harford County v. University, </em>318 Md. 525, 529, 569 A.2d 649, 651 (1990); <em>NCR Corp. v. Comptroller, </em>313 Md. 118, 124-25, 544 A.2d 764, 767 (1988); <em>Boulden v. Mayor, </em>311 Md. 411, 414, 535 A.2d 477, 479 (1988); <em>In Re Ramont K., </em>305 Md. 482, 484, 505 A.2d 507, 508 (1986). Moreover, we approach the analysis of the language from a \u201ccommonsensical,\u201d rather than a technical perspective, <em>United States v. Universal Corp., </em>344 U.S. 218, 221, 73 S.Ct. 227, 229, 97 L.Ed. 260, 264 (1952); <em>Dickerson v. State, </em>324 Md. 163, 171, 596 A.2d 648, 652 (1991), always seeking to avoid giving the statute a strained interpretation or one that reaches an absurd result. <em>Potter v. Bethesda Fire Dep\u2019t, </em>309 Md. 347, 353, 524 A.2d 61, 64 (1987); <em>Schweitzer v. Brewer, </em>280 Md. 430, 438-39, 374 A.2d 347, 352 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Applying these principles to the language of the Act, the arbitration award on the merits clearly is comprised of two essential and related determinations: liability and damages. \u00a7 3-2A-05(e), (h). These combined determinations on the merits constitute the \u201caward\u201d of an arbitration panel as defined by the Act. <em>Id. </em>Under \u00a7 3-2A-05(e) of the Act, the health claims arbitration panel issues an \u201caward\u201d consisting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>of \u201cdeterminations\u201d regarding liability and, if applicable, damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-4\"><em>\u201cDeterminations. </em>\u2014 The arbitration panel shall first determine the issue of liability with respect to a claim referred to it. If the arbitration panel determines that the health care provider is not liable to the claimant or claimants <em>the award </em>shall be in favor of the health care provider. If the arbitration panel determines that a health care provider is liable to the claimant or claimants, it shall then consider, itemize, assess, and apportion appropriate damages against one or more of the health care providers that it has found to be liable. <em>The award shall itemize ... any damages ...\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\u00a7 3-2A-05(e) (emphasis added). Thus, the language of the Act carefully differentiates not only between the singular and the plural, but also between the liability and damage determinations and the award. The Act consistently and repeatedly refers to the panel\u2019s determinations on the merits as \u201can award.\u201d The ordinary and reasonable meaning of the explicit use of the term \u201caward\u201d in this statute is that the panel\u2019s award on the merits is a single award, which includes both a determination of liability and a determination of damages. The Crawfords\u2019 construction would make the terms \u201cdeterminations\u201d and \u201caward\u201d synonymous and interchangeable. Nothing in the statute supports such a construction. <em>See Board of Educ., Garrett Co. v. Lendo, </em>295 Md. 55, 63, 453 A.2d 1185, 1189 (1982) (a court may not insert, omit, or ignore words to make a statute express intentions not evident in its original form). Finally, \u00a7 3-2A-06(a) of the Act states that \u201c[a] party may reject an award ... for any reason.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>The Crawfords\u2019 construction also would require us to construe the word \u201can\u201d preceding \u201caward\u201d as surplusage. Notwithstanding the plain and unambiguous language of the statute, the Crawfords contend that the \u201carbitration panel\u2019s determination is comprised of multiple awards,\u201d and that a party may limit its rejection to the panel\u2019s determination of damages alone. The Crawfords offer no statutory analysis in support of their position. Their contention that the Act permits piecemeal rejection of one or more portions of the arbitration award would require judicial amendment of the Act to read: \u201cAny party may reject either the panel\u2019s liability determination or the panel\u2019s damages determination, or both, for any reason.\u201d No language in the statute supports such an amendment. According to \u00a7 3-2A-06(a) of the Act, it is only the arbitration panel\u2019s \u201caward\u201d that may be rejected and, as such, there is no basis in law for a rejection of only the damages determination portion of the award on the merits. Simply stated, once an award is rejected by either party, regardless of the specific determination that is disputed, \u201cthe matter is tried all over.\u201d <em>Maryland Civil Pattern Jury Instructions </em>\u00a7 27:2, at 595 (2d ed. 1984), <em>quoted in Newell v. Richards, </em>323 Md. 717, 734, 594 A.2d 1152, 1160-61 (1991).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In sum, the plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>language of the Act supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the panel\u2019s award is indivisible for purposes of judicial review. Consequently, when the award is rejected, the action to nullify that award must present the issue of liability as well as the issue of damages for determination in the malpractice action in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">In addition to the lack of support in the language of the Act for its construction as urged by the Crawfords, there is no case law permitting rejection of only the damage determination of an arbitration award. Nevertheless, the Craw-fords take solace in our recent decision in <em>Central Collection v. Gettes, </em>321 Md. 671, 584 A.2d 689 (1991). <em>Gettes, </em>however, provides no support for segregating an award on the merits into an award finding liability and an award assessing damages. In fact, in <em>Gettes </em>we explicitly avoided either deciding or intimating a decision on the specific issues raised by the Crawfords here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">\u201cBy treating an adverse allocation of costs as a separate award against a party who prevails on the merits, we do not intimate any view on whether awards on the merits may be segregated into awards finding liability and awards assessing damages. We are mindful of Chief Judge Gilbert\u2019s dictum for the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Osheroff v. Chestnut Lodge, </em>Inc. [62 Md.App. 519, 490 A.2d 720]: \u2018Once the arbitration process has concluded, any party to the proceeding may, for any reason, reject the panel\u2019s determination of liability, damages, or both, and invoke court review.\u2019 Ultimate resolution of that question must await another day when the issue is squarely presented. For example, a claimant may reject the award and file an action to nullify, complaining only of inadequate damages, while the health care provider does not reject and bring any action to nullify the adverse award that determines liability as well as damages. Query: In the action to nullify in the circuit court, may the health care provider insist, over objection, on intro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>ducing evidence exculpatory as to liability? May the health care provider have the issue of liability submitted to the jury?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 680 n. 3, 584 A.2d at 693 n. 3 (citation omitted).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\"><em>Gettes </em>was a collection action brought by the State against a health care provider to recover the costs of arbitrating a health care claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although Dr. Gettes prevailed on the merits both in arbitration and at trial, the arbitration panel assessed one-half of the arbitration costs against him. Dr. Gettes \u201cdid not seek any form of direct judicial review of the panel\u2019s adverse award of partial costs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 673, 584 A.2d at 690. Eight years later, after repeated demands for payment of the arbitration costs, the State filed suit against Dr. Gettes in the District Court. On appeal, we held that \u201cfor purposes of judicial review of a panel\u2019s allocation of costs, an adverse allocation of costs should be treated under the Act as an award, separate from the determination of the merits of the malpractice claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 679-80, 584 A.2d at 693 (footnote omitted). We reasoned that \u201c[cjonceptualizing the panel\u2019s determination as comprising multiple awards is consistent with principles of justiciability, and particularly with the adversariness requirement for an action in court,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 678, 584 A.2d at 692, because those principles require that the party aggrieved by an adverse panel decision take affirmative steps to overturn it.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The Crawfords concede that the holding in <em>Gettes </em>is inapposite to the instant case, but contend that \u201creversal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>the judgment in favor of Dr. Leahy is compelled by the same \u2018principles of justiciability/ ... that led the <em>[Gettes </em>] Court to hold that a health claims arbitration panel\u2019s determination is comprised of multiple awards, at least as to its costs and merits decisions.\u201d The Crawfords\u2019 reliance on the rationale of <em>Gettes </em>is misplaced. First, the Crawfords\u2019 stated concerns for \u201cjusticiability\u201d and \u201cadversariness\u201d ignore that, unlike Dr. Gettes, Dr. Leahy immediately and successfully challenged the Crawfords\u2019 novel attempt at rejection of the damages award only to ensure that the issue of Dr. Leahy\u2019s liability would be submitted to the jury. In contrast, Dr. Gettes made no attempt by an action to nullify or otherwise to challenge the panel\u2019s allocation of costs against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Additionally, the Crawfords entirely fail to consider how the \u201cnature and scope of review\u201d applicable to decisions on the merits \u201caffect the conceptual number of awards.\u201d <em>Gettes, </em>321 Md. at 679, 584 A.2d at 693. Although <em>Gettes </em>does construe the costs allocation as separate from the award on the merits, we in no way suggested by our reasoning that the award on the merits is divisible into separate awards of liability and damages. Rather, <em>Gettes </em>rests on and in fact highlights the substantive distinction between an assessment of costs and an award by the arbitration panel on the merits. Our rationale was based squarely on the statutory and practical differences between an \u201caward allocating costs\u201d and an \u201caward on the merits\u201d: \u201c[I]n arbitrations under the Act, we do not deal with a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">system in which costs follow the result____ There is no automatic connection between the obligation for arbitration costs, as determined by the panel, and the result on the merits, either in arbitration or in any subsequent malpractice action in court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 676, 584 A.2d at 691. Further, we emphasized that \u201cthe arbitration costs allocation in arbitrated claims under the Act is a discretionary function of the arbitration panel,\u201d and, as such, costs assessments are subject to judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>review \u201conly on very limited grounds.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 679, 584 A.2d at 693. Significantly, the costs assessment \u201ccannot be submitted to a jury trying the malpractice case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">These distinctions between the assessment of costs and the award on the merits form the basis for the decision in <em>Gettes:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">\u201cBecause the award of arbitration costs by the arbitration panel is distinct from the merits of the malpractice claim in arbitration, any review and reallocation of arbitration costs cannot automatically follow the result of the malpractice action in the circuit court, even if that action is tried nonjury. For these reasons we hold that for purposes of judicial review of a panel\u2019s allocation of costs, an adverse allocation of costs should be treated under the Act as an award, separate from the determination of the merits of the malpractice claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 679-80, 584 A.2d at 693 (footnote omitted). No analogous distinction reasonably can be made to segregate the panel\u2019s determination of negligence from its determination of the damages necessary to compensate for that negligence. One of the fundamental principles of tort law is that damages are an integral element of negligence liability. <em>See, e.g., B.N. v. K.K., </em>312 Md. 135, 141, 538 A.2d 1175,1178 (1988) (traditional elements of a negligence cause of action are a duty, a breach of that duty, causation, and damages). A determination of damages in a tort action is neither discretionary nor an administrative function and is entirely dependent on the corresponding determination of liability. Indeed, to evaluate damages fairly, the jury will necessarily be influenced by the very facts underlying the issue of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Finally, <em>Gettes </em>does not engage in the statutory reconstruction advocated by the Crawfords. <em>Gettes\u2019 </em>construction of \u201can award\u201d to mean either the allocation of costs or the award on the merits (liability and damages) was entirely consistent with the language of the Act. The Act\u2019s distinctions between \u201cassessment of costs\u201d and \u201cdeterminations\u201d on the merits strongly indicate that the General Assembly perceived an \u201caward of costs\u201d as a separable award that bears no relationship to the \u201caward on the merits.\u201d <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 3-2A-05(f) (subtitled <em>\u201cAssessment of costs\u201d) </em>with \u00a7 3-2A-05(e) (subtitled \u201cDeterminations\u201d). The natural and probable conclusion underlying these provisions is that the assessment of costs is a discretionary function of the health claims arbitration panel that does not depend on or relate to the substantive award on the merits. Accordingly, if the rationale of <em>Gettes </em>has any application to the instant case, it supports the conclusion that the Crawfords may not reject only the damages determination of an arbitration award because, in contrast to allocations of administrative costs, there is no statutory basis for concluding that the arbitration panel\u2019s determination of damages is a separable award independent of its liability determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The Crawfords also cite dicta in several other cases as additional support for the contention that the rejection of damages only is allowed. For example, in <em>Osheroff v. Chestnut Lodge, </em>62 Md.App. 519, 490 A.2d 720, <em>cert, denied, </em>304 Md. 163, 497 A.2d 1163 (1985), the Court of Special Appeals stated that \u201c[o]nce the arbitration process has concluded, any party to the proceeding may, for any reason, reject the panel\u2019s determination of liability, damages, or both, and invoke court review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 523, 490 A.2d at 722. As we noted in <em>Gettes, </em>however, <em>Osheroff </em>did not reach or analyze this question.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See Gettes, </em>321 Md. at 680 n. 3, 584 A.2d at 693 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Neither does <em>Hahn v. Suburban Hosp. Ass\u2019n, </em>54 Md.App. 685, 461 A.2d 7 (1983), provide any support whatsoever for the Crawfords\u2019 position. <em>Hahn </em>involved \u201cthe sufficiency of evidence necessary to rebut the statutory presumption of correctness of an arbitration award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 686, 461 A.2d at 8. As Judge McCullough observed below, the only reference to separating the damages and liability determinations of the panel appears in the syllabus of the case that precedes the published opinion. Like <em>Osheroff, Hahn </em>neither decides, suggests, nor analyzes whether a party may limit its rejection to the panel\u2019s damage determination alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Finally, our comment in <em>Su v. Weaver, </em>313 Md. 370, 380, 545 A.2d 692, 697 (1988), \u201cthat there may be multiple issues of liability ... is more consistent with the purpose of the Act,\u201d merely explains our holding that the panel\u2019s award may include multiple determinations on alternative theories of liability advanced by a claimant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Su </em>did not mention or decide the issue presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The trial court rested its decision to strike the Crawfords\u2019 original notice and complaint upon its conclusion that neither the Act nor the case law provided for rejection of \u201conly the damages part of the arbitration award.\u201d That ruling is entirely consistent with the express purposes of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">When adopted, the Act was intended to hasten determination of medical malpractice claims, resulting in reduced costs and an improved system of justice. In adopting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Act, the Legislature clearly anticipated that cost and time savings would result if parties frequently accepted the panel determination, either as the final decision or as the basis for payment. <em>See </em>K. Quinn, <em>The Health Care Malpractice Claims Statute: Maryland\u2019s Response to the Medical Malpractice Crisis, </em>10 U.Balt.L.Rev. 74, 93-94 (1980). The Act\u2019s presumption that the arbitration award is correct is specifically intended to deter rejection of panel decisions. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3-2A-06(d); J. MacAlister &amp; A. Scanlan, Jr., <em>Health Claims Arbitration in Maryland: The Experiment Has Failed, </em>14 U.Balt.L.Rev. 481, 501-02 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">Permitting rejection of damages alone, however, would have the opposite effect. If a plaintiff may reject only the damage portion of the award, then defendants will likely reject every panel determination or risk losing the right to a judicial determination of their liability. If rejection becomes matter of course, and court action routine, there is no prospect of achieving the Act\u2019s fundamental purpose of more economical justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Moreover, actions to nullify the award by all parties to a health claims arbitration would become routine in medical malpractice cases because the Act contains no provisions for \u201ccross-rejection\u201d similar to the \u201ccross-appeals\u201d available pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-202(e). In circumstances such as this case, when the claimant obtains a favorable determination of liability, but is dissatisfied with the damage determination, the claimant must now weigh the risks of retrying liability, albeit aided by the presumption of correctness of the award, against the possibility of obtaining more damages. If the claimant is permitted to reject only damages, however, the incentive to accept the amount of the arbitration award is dramatically diminished, given that at trial, liability would be a certainty, and not merely presumed correct. Thus, \u201cthe rule urged by [the Crawfords] encourages resort to the courts by providing a claimant with an unfair advantage.\u201d <em>Su v. Weaver, </em>313 Md. at 381, 545 A.2d at 697. With no risk of an adverse jury verdict on liability, rejection of damages by the claimant becomes a certainty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>and settlement resulting from the arbitration award a rarity. These consequences defeat the primary purpose of the Act: to reduce costs by creating a reliable and acceptable alternative to a medical malpractice action in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">In addition, the impact of parsing the award into separate portions of liability and damages would be unwieldy and expensive. If the claimant is allowed to reject only the damage determination of the arbitration award, the health care provider must either reject the award as a matter of course or weigh the risks of waiting to see whether and what the claimant rejects. Under the latter circumstances, the health care provider would be required to post an attorney at the courthouse door on the 30th day after the award is served on the parties to ensure that, if the claimant rejects only the damage portion of the award, the health care provider also may reject the panel\u2019s determination of liability. Surely the Act does not contemplate such an unworkable and costly result.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">In conclusion, the trial court properly applied the Act and preserved all parties\u2019 rights to a judicial determination of liability and damages on the merits. This ruling not only satisfies justiciability and adversariness requirements, but also preserves and promotes the General Assembly\u2019s goal of establishing a reliable and economical system for resolution of malpractice claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>PETITIONS FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI 177 [326 Md. 177 (1992).] PETITIONS FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI AND DISMISSALS OF APPEALS September Term, 1991 604 A.2d 444 PETITIONS FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI <em>Decided April 9, 1992 </em>Baltimore Sun v.

Thus, the health care provider\u2019s burden of proof relates only to an item of evidence, <em>Le., </em>that the panel award is not, in fact, correct. An arbitration panel award in favor of a claimant is admissible and presumed correct, but it does not shift the common law burden of proof to the health care provider.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 733-34, 594 A.2d at 1160.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b258-8\">.
