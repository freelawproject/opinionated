ORTH, Jr., Judge, Specially Assigned.</author>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">Several years ago two happenings inflamed the public and gave serious concern to Maryland law enforcement authorities. An Anne Arundel County couple sold their child for $3,500 and three ounces of cocaine. A Pennsylvania couple, through an advertisement in a Baltimore newspaper, offered to place their child for adoption upon payment of compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-13\">Maryland Code (1984, 1991 RepLVol.) \u00a7 5-327 of the Family Law Article (FL), under the heading \u201cProhibited compensation,\u201d in effect at the time of the happenings and today, declares in subsection (a)(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-14\">An agency, institution, or individual who renders any service in connection with the placement of an individual for adoption may not charge or receive from or on behalf of either the natural- parent of the individual to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>adopted, or from or on behalf of the individual who is adopting the individual, any compensation for the placement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Subsection (a)(2) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2J\">[t]his subsection does not prohibit the payment, by any interested person, of reasonable and customary charges or fees for hospital or medical or legal services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Subsection (b) exempts the Social Services Administration from subsection (a)(1) as to reimbursement for certain costs connected with adoption. Subsection (c) calls for the State\u2019s Attorney to prosecute any violation of the section. Subsection (d) makes a person who violates the section guilty of a misdemeanor and subjects a violator upon conviction to <em>\u201ca </em>fine not exceeding $100 or imprisonment not exceeding 3 months, or both, for each offense.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Prosecution for the sale of the child by the Anne Arundel Couple proceeded under FL \u00a7 5-327 in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge held that the sale was not within the contemplation of the statute. He dismissed the case. The adoption advertisement was pursued in Pennsylvania with the assistance of Maryland enforcement authorities. A conviction was obtained under a Pennsylvania law comparable to that of Maryland, but authorizing a much harsher penalty than does the law of this State proscribing such conduct. The Maryland law enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>authorities were disturbed because the Maryland statute called for a much more lenient penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The public clamor resulting from the dismissal of the prosecution for the sale of the child, and the concern regarding the adequacy of the existing law, led to the enactment of remedial legislation by the General Assembly of Maryland. Acts 1989, ch. 300 (Senate Bill 58) appears in the Maryland Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol.). Article 27, \u00a7 35C, under the heading \u201cChild Selling.\u201d It declares, in subsection (a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">A person may not sell, barter, or trade, or offer to sell, barter, or trade a child for money or property, either real or personal, or anything else of value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Subsection (b) makes a person who violates the section guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction subjects the person to \u201ca fine not exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment in the penitentiary not exceeding five years or both for each offense.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">Shortly .after the effective date of Article 27, \u00a7 35C, the State called upon the new statute in a criminal information filed in the Circuit Court for Carroll County. The circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>stances which prompted the information were brought out at the trial. Involved were</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aoi\">Jason Seymour, a child, six years of age;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-4\">JoAnn Bauerlien, the child's mother;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">Warren Seymour, the child\u2019s grandfather;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">Allen Runkles, the live-in boyfriend of the child\u2019s mother; Lanny Harchenhorn, attorney at law, representing the grandfather.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The second count of the information charged that Runkles</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkL\">on or about the 18th day of August, 1989, at [Carroll] County ... did then and there sell/barter/trade/offer to sell/offer to barter and offer to trade a child, to wit: Jason Seymour, for money/real property/personal property and anything of value, in violation of Article 27, section 35B of the Annotated Code of Maryland____<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">Runkles waived a trial by jury and elected to be tried on an agreed statement of facts. We give an apergu of the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">The child, his three year old brother, and Runkles lived with the mother, the child\u2019s legal custodian as his natural parent. The grandfather had attempted, unsuccessfully, to obtain custody of the child in the past. Runkles approached the grandfather with the proposition that for $4,000 he would persuade the mother to grant custody of the child to the grandfather. The plan, as devised by Runkles, was that the grandfather\u2019s attorney would prepare a \u201cConsent to Custody Order\u201d for the transfer of the custody of the child to the grandfather. Runkles would persuade the mother to sign the order, so that when the grandfather came to the mother\u2019s residence for his usual visit to see the child, the mother would execute the consent order. Then, out of the presence of the mother, Runkles would turn the executed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>order over to the grandfather upon payment of $4,000. The grandfather had his attorney prepare the order and brought it with him on his visit to see the child. Sure enough, without further ado, the mother signed it. Runkles and the grandfather left the house and walked toward the garage. Out of the presence of the mother, Runkles turned over the custody papers to the grandfather, and the grandfather gave Runkles a white envelope. Runkles reentered the house, holding the white envelope.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">After hearing Runkles\u2019s proposition, however, the grandfather had gone to the police. By means of a covert surveillance, the police observed the entire transaction between Runkles and the grandfather. When Runkles reentered the house, the police pounced. The white envelope contained $4,000. Runkles was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">It was conceded at the very beginning of the agreed statement of facts that the grandfather paid Runkles $4,000 \u201cfor persuading [the mother] into signing custody of the child over to the [grandfather].\u201d The mother admitted that she was so persuaded by Runkles, but she disavowed any knowledge of the payment of money. She said that she was \u201chaving trouble with [the child] \u2014 having difficulties with [the child] and her younger son____\u201d The child \u201chad just recently hurt [his brother].\u201d The mother told the police that \u201cshe just couldn\u2019t take it anymore and that the child would be better off\u201d with the grandfather. That was why, she explained, \u201cshe signed the custody over.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">After hearing the statement of facts, the trial judge denied Runkles\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal. Counsel argued on the merits and were in agreement that \u201cit is a new statute and there\u2019s absolutely no law.\u201d The judge requested counsel to submit written memoranda, and held his decision <em>sub curia. </em>Upon consideration of the memoranda, the judge issued a \u201cMemorandum Opinion.\u201d He found Runkles guilty of violating the \u201cchild selling\u201d statute, Art. 27, \u00a7 35C. The judge observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>[Runkles] argues that [the statute] does not extend to this scenario, where [he] promised to have the mother of the child \u201csign over\u201d custody for the sum of $4,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">He continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">The State contends that the statute was not intended to be limited to only adoption situations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">He ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">The court is in agreement with the State\u2019s position. The act of signing over custody in this matter is tantamount to the beginning of adoption proceedings and no less significant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">He declaimed:</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">The child is still being traded for money!</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">Runkles appealed. His only contention was that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the conviction. Two judges of the three judge panel of the Court of Special Appeals agreed with him and reversed the judgment of the circuit court. <em>Runkles v. State, </em>87 Md.App. 492, 590 A.2d 552 (1991). As we construe the opinion of the court, the crux of the decision was that Art. 27, \u00a7 35C applies only to adoption proceedings. Inasmuch as Runkles\u2019s conduct did not relate to adoption of the child, the evidence was deemed to be insufficient. The third member of the panel disagreed. He would affirm, he said, because he believed that the statute was not limited to adoption proceedings but reached \u201cany commercial trafficking in children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 502, 590 A.2d 552. He thought that the evidence was sufficient to establish that the conduct of Runkles violated the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 502-508, 590 A.2d 552 (Moylan, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">The State filed a petition for the issuance of a writ of certiorari. It asked us to decide whether</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_I\">the Court of Special Appeals err[ed] in concluding that Maryland\u2019s child selling statute is limited to proscribing for-profit adoptions, as opposed to any for-profit exchange of child custody.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>We granted the petition and ordered the issuance of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Although terse and concise in phrasing, and, at first glance, not defiled by tergiversation, the reach of Art. 27, \u00a7 35C is questioned. We do not find, however, that the statute is so clear on its face as to make unnecessary further inquiry concerning the intent of the Legislature. There is a significant difference of opinion among those learned in the law as to exactly what the statute covers. Therefore, once again we are called upon to probe the mind of the Legislature to determine the legislative intent. Over one thousand Maryland appellate opinions since 1965 have addressed \u201cone aspect or another of legislative intent or history, statutory interpretation or construction.\u201d <em>See </em>M. Miller, <em>Ghost Hunting: Finding Legislative Intent in Maryland, a Checklist of Sources </em>p. 2 (1984) (unpublished manuscript available in the Maryland State Library). We are guided by certain rules in bringing the ghost of legislative intent to bay. We have announced, explicated and applied those rules so often in the past that there is no point in repeating them.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We shall apply them once again in determining the legislative intent here, emphasizing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atb\">our endeavor is always to seek out the legislative purpose, the general aim or policy, the ends to be accomplished, the evils to be redressed by a particular enactment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-8\"><em>Morris v.

We have perused all of the items in the legislative file on SB 58, the bill which became Acts 1989, ch. 300 and was codified as \u00a7 35C of Art. 27. They provide an insight into the evolution of the statute. The file contained copies of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">(1) newspaper clippings reporting the two incidents of \u201cchild selling\u201d and stating that \u201coutrage grows over penalties for baby sales.\u201d The articles noted that authorities were demanding that harsher punishment be authorized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">(2) a letter from the Deputy State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore County to Senator Paula Hollinger stating that more severe penalties for violating FL \u00a7 5-327 were \u201csorely needed\u201d and requesting that she sponsor legislation to that effect. Enclosed were copies of proposed legislation as drafted by the Deputy State\u2019s Attorney and by the Maryland State\u2019s Attorneys\u2019 Association. Both drafts called for the penalty permitted by FL \u00a7 5-327 to be increased to a fine not exceeding $10,000 and imprisonment not exceeding 5 years, or both. The prosecutor said that he and the State\u2019s Attorney had discussed the matter \u201cin light of the recent case of \u2018baby selling\u2019 involving a Maryland \u2018broker\u2019 and a Pennsylvania \u2018baby seller\u2019, the case having been initially investigated by Maryland law enforcement officers as a result of an ad in a local publication.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>(3) a letter from Senator Hollinger to the Department of Legislative Reference enclosing a copy of the bill prepared by the Deputy State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore County and requesting that legislation be drafted for submission to the 1989 session of the General Assembly \u201cincorporating this language.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">(4) a transcript of the testimony of Senator Hollinger before the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee on \u201cSenate Bill 58, Adoption \u2014 Prohibited Compensation\u2014 Penalty.\u201d She told the committee that it \u201cstiffens the penalty for natural parents, or a broker attempting to gain illegal compensation in return for allowing adoption of their child.\u201d She called attention to the dismissal of the Anne Arundel County case and the advertisement in a Baltimore newspaper by a Pennsylvania couple \u201casking for compensation in exchange for their baby.\u201d She said, \u201cState Police together with Pennsylvania authorities agreed to buy the baby for $30,000. The exchange was made in Pennsylvania so the couple is being tried there. Had the trial been held in Baltimore County and the couple found guilty, their maximum fine would be only $100 and/or a maximum 3 month jail sentence.\u201d She declaimed, \u201cSelling a baby on the open market is a practice which must be stopped and the only way to stop it is to increase the penalty.\u201d She asked for a favorable report on SB 58.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">(5) a \u201cBill Analysis\u201d on SB 58 by the Committee Report System of the Department of Legislative Reference. It summarized the bill:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">This bill increases the penalties for the misdemeanor of charging or receiving prohibited compensation in connection with an adoption. The bill increases the maximum fine from $100 to $10,000 and increases the maximum prison term of imprisonment from 3 months to 5 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">The analysis gave the bill\u2019s background:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-9\">Under current law, the penalty for the misdemeanor of charging or receiving prohibited compensation in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>nection with an adoption is a fine of up to $100, a prison term of up to 3 months, or both. The increase in penalties is intended to appropriately address the seriousness of the offense of selling or brokering the sale of a child and to bring Maryland\u2019s penalties in line with those of its sister state, Pennsylvania.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">(6) a copy of a letter from the executive secretary of the Maryland Judicial Conference informing Senator Walter M. Baker, Chairman of the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, that the executive committee of the conference \u201centhusiastically supported SB 58 ...\u201d and that it \u201cfavors severe penalties for those who violate the laws concerning compensation in adoption cases.\u201d In handwriting on the letter appears \u201cConcurrences 4/5/89.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">(7) a copy of a letter from the Department of Human Resources informing Senator Baker that although SB 58 \u201cwill have no direct impact on local department practice ... increasing the penalty, for \u2018baby selling\u2019 ... is certainly in the best interest of children, of adoptive parents, and even of birth parents.\u201d The letter concluded, \u201cIt is something the Department has been interested in seeing happen for years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">(8) a document addressed to the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee stating that the position of the Department of Human Resources as to SB 58 was \u201cSupport,\u201d and repeating the language in the Department\u2019s letter to Senator Baker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\">(9) an unsigned, undated, handwritten document entitled \u201cExplanation of Concurrence.\u201d It reads:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-9\">SB 58 \u2014 Adoption\u2014Prohibited Compensation \u2014 Penalty Recommendation: Concur</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFx\">\n<em>Amendments #1 and 2</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azs\">Technical</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqI\">\n<em>Amendment #3</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-10\">This strikes the original language of the bill and substitutes language expressly prohibiting baby selling\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>(The amendment addresses the concerns of Senators Cade and Jimeno about the baby selling case that was dismissed in Anne Arundel County \u2014 I checked with both of them.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Apparently, the document was from Senator Baker.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">(10) SB 58 as originally drafted and as amended and passed. As first drafted, the bill merely increased the penalty authorized by FL \u00a7 5-327(d). Section (1) of the bill was thrice amended. Amendment (1) changed the title of the bill from \u201cAn ACT concerning Adoption\u2014 Prohibited Compensation \u2014 Penalty\u201d to \u201cAn ACT Concerning Children \u2014 Sale\u2014Barter, or Trade \u2014 Penalty.\u201d It also changed the purposes of the bill. As originally drafted, it stated that it was \u201cfor the purpose of altering the penalties for charging or receiving prohibited compensation in connection with an adoption.\u201d As amended the purposes of the bill were said to be to make \u201cit a misdemeanor subject to certain penalties for a person to sell, barter, or trade or offer to sell, barter or trade a child for money, property, or anything of value; and generally relating to prohibitions against a sale, barter, or trade or an offer to sell, barter, or trade a child for anything of value; and generally relating to baby selling and baby brokering.\u201d By amendment (2) the statute was taken out of the Family Law Article and added to Article 27, Crimes and Punishments as \u00a7 35B (later \u00a7 35C, <em>see </em>note 3, <em>supra) </em>\u201cunder the new subheading \u2018Child Selling.\u2019 \u201d Amendment (3) struck all the provisions of FL \u00a7 5-327(a), (b), (c) and (d) and substituted in lieu thereof the provisions of Art. 27, \u00a7 35C(a) and (b) as presently written. Section (2) of the bill provided that it takes effect 1 July 1989. Stamped on copies of the amended bill were statements indicating that the amendments were checked by the Department of Legislative Reference and that the bill passed the House and the Senate.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">(11) a Floor Report by the Department of Legislative Reference setting out a summary of the bill:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>This bill increases the penalties for the misdemeanor of charging or receiving prohibited compensation in connection with an adoption. The bill increases the maximum fine from $100 to $10,000 and increases the maximum prison term of imprisonment from 3 months to 5 years.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">The bill, as amended, also prohibits a natural or adoptive parent, or anyone acting on behalf of the parent, from either offering to or actually selling, bartering, or trading the parent\u2019s child for money, property, or anything else of value. A violation of this prohibition would be a misdemeanor subject to the same penalties for baby brokering.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The Report discussed the three amendments. It observed that the third amendment</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">prohibits a natural or an adoptive parent or <em>anyone acting on behalf of a parent </em>from selling, bartering, or trading or offering to sell, barter, or trade the parent\u2019s child for money, property or anything else of value. <em>The amendment is intended to address a concern raised by a representative of the Maryland State\u2019s Attorneys\u2019 Association </em>that current law does <em>not explicitly prohibit baby selling by a parent, </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">(12) a letter from a constituent to Senator Baker voicing support of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">(13) a revised Fiscal Note from the Department of Fiscal Services, Division of Fiscal Research. It indicated that the amended bill would have little effect on State revenues and no effect on local revenues and State and local expenditures.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>(14) a letter from the Attorney General of Maryland to the Governor stating that he approved SB 58 for constitutionality and legal sufficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">(15) a transcript of the testimony of Senator Hollinger before the House Judiciary Committee expressing her support of the amended bill. She referred to the baby selling incident in Anne Arundel County and the dismissal of the case. She said, \u201cIf SB 58 had been enacted, language in the law would have been adequate____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">The legislative history of SB 58 trees the ghost of legislative intent which haunted Art. 27, \u00a7 35C and lays it to rest. The history depicts clearly how the intent at the time the bill was conceived had been transformed into an entirely different intent by the time the bill was delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">There is no question that the original objective of the bill was to do no more than increase the permissible penalty for violation of FL \u00a7 5-327 prohibiting compensation for adoption. The Deputy State's Attorney for Baltimore County, who initiated the crusade, was motivated primarily by the action of the Pennsylvania couple which plainly constituted a violation of the adoption compensation statute. So he was focused on FL \u00a7 5-327 and disturbed by the lenient penalty it authorized. He proposed a harsher penalty for violation of the statute. For a time, everyone enthusiastically went along with his proposal, including the bill\u2019s original sponsor Senator Hollinger, (Senator Barbara Hoffman was later added as a sponsor), the Maryland State\u2019s Attorneys\u2019 Association, and the Maryland Judicial Conference. As the bill traveled the road to passage, however, there came the realization that it did not accomplish what was actually desired \u2014 a prohibition against \u201cbaby selling.\u201d As Senator Hollinger observed in her testimony before the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, \u201cSelling a baby on the open market is a practice which must be stopped....\u201d And it dawned on those concerned that \u201cthe only way to stop it,\u201d was not, as Senator Hollinger at first suggested, \u201cto in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>crease the penalty\u201d authorized by FL \u00a7 5-327. No matter what the penalty may have been for that statute, the Anne Arundel County couple, who sold their child for money and dope, could not have been found guilty under FL \u00a7 5-327 under the ruling of the circuit court. Baby selling, other than as it may relate to adoption, was simply not within the ambit of FL \u00a7 5-327. So SB 58 was amended and the amendments were draconian. All of the provisions of the original draft were jettisoned; the bill was rewritten in its entirety. The amendments divorced the bill from FL \u00a7 5-327; they severed any and all connections with that statute; they made plain that they washed out any indication or suggestion that the bill was intended to supplement or complement, or relate to, or affect in any way, the adoption-compensation statute. The amendments removed the bill from the Family Law Article and placed it in the Crimes and Punishments Article. The fact is that the amendments not only resulted in entirely new provisions, but in the creation of an entirely new crime, aptly titled \u201cChild Selling.\u201d We remind that the \u201cExplanation of Concurrence\u201d stated <em>(see supra, </em>document 9) that the third amendment, going to the substance of the bill,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">strikes the original language of the bill and substitutes language expressly prohibiting baby selling____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The \u201cExplanation\u201d noted that the amendment addresses the concern of certain senators \u201cabout the baby selling case that was dismissed in Anne Arundel County.\u201d The declaration of purpose was amended to read that it was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUH\">a misdemeanor subject to certain penalties for a person to sell, barter, or trade or offer to sell, barter, or trade a child for money, property, or anything of value ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">The declaration of purpose continued that, as amended, the bill</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">generally relat[ed] to baby selling and baby brokering. The Department of Legislative Reference in its Floor Report interpreted the amended bill, as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_W\">intended to address a concern raised by a representative of the Maryland State\u2019s Attorneys\u2019 Association that cur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>rent law does not explicitly prohibit baby selling by a parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The short of it is, that, as amended, the only remaining part of the bill as originally drafted was its designation as SB 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">It is of particular significance that SB 58 left FL \u00a7 5-327 absolutely untouched. FL \u00a7 5-327 exists today exactly as it was before the passage of SB 58. The Legislature did not alter FL \u00a7 5-327 an iota; it remained unchanged in every respect, even as to the criticized penalty provision. So now there are two statutes in effect, one intended to prohibit the sale of the adoption of a child, and the other intended to prohibit generally the sale of a child. Neither one is tied to the other one. <em>See In re Adoption No. 9979, </em>323 Md. at 45-48, 591 A.2d 468. Also, Judge Eldridge dissenting, joined by Judge Rodowsky, expressed the belief that Art. 27, \u00a7 35C was enacted as a separate statute from FL \u00a7 5-327. <em>Id. </em>at 62-63, 591 A.2d 468. He pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abl\">Moreover, in House Bill 491 of the 1990 session, the language of Art. 27, \u00a7 35C, would have been added to the adoption subtitle of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. House Bill 491, however, was not enacted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">IY</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">The question presented by the State\u2019s petition for certiorari and accepted by us in our grant of the petition, has two facets. The first is whether Art. 27, \u00a7 35C \u201cis limited to proscribing for-profit adoptions____\u201d When this facet of the question is viewed in the glare cast by the legislative history of the statute, it is obvious that the answer is that there is no such limitation. As we have seen, Art. 27, \u00a7 35C ended up with no tie to FL \u00a7 5-327; the two statutes are separate and distinct. The answer to the first facet of the question is that the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that Art. 27, \u00a7 35C is limited to for-profit adoptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">In asking whether Art. 27, \u00a7 35C is limited \u201cto proscribing for-profit adoptions,\u201d the State posed its question in terms of \u201cas opposed to any for-profit exchange of child custody.\u201d This raises the second facet of the question. Given that the statute\u2019s prohibitions are not limited to \u201cfor-profit\u201d adoptions, the second facet calls for a determination of what the Legislature intended that the statute cover.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">We have no doubt whatsoever that when the Legislature declared that a person may not sell, or offer to sell,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> a child for anything of value, it intended that the prohibition have a broad reach. We arrive at this conclusion not only from the manner in which, and the reason why, the bill as originally drafted was amended, but from the tenor of the testimony of the original sponsor of SB 58, the comments of the chairman of the Senate committee considering the bill, the summary of the amended bill by the Department of Legislative Reference and other documents in the legislative file. We determined, <em>supra, </em>that the reach of the statute was not limited to adoption proceedings. In the light of the clear general aim of the Legislature, which as expressed by the bill\u2019s sponsor, was that \u201cselling a baby on the open market must be stopped,\u201d and considering the ends the statute sought to accomplish, namely, to stop baby selling, and the evils it sought to redress, that is, trafficking in children, to say that the Legislature intended other than that the statute reach far and wide would not only be unreasonable and illogical, but inconsistent with common sense. But the Legislature did not define what it meant by \u201csell, barter or trade a child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Regardless of all that may be encompassed in the phrase \u201csell, barter or trade a child,\u201d we are only called upon in this case to determine whether consent to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>relinquishment of the custody of a child upon payment of money is within the ambit of Art. 27, \u00a7 35C. The full sweep of the statute must await another day; we do not now mark the precise boundaries of the entire area which the Legislature intended to cover.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Judge McAuliffe, speaking for the Court in <em>Taylor v. Taylor, </em>306 Md. 290, 508 A.2d 964 (1986) explained \u201ccustody.\u201d He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">Embraced within the meaning of \u201ccustody\u201d are the concepts of \u201clegal\u201d and \u201cphysical\u201d custody. Legal custody carries with it the right and obligation to make long range decisions involving education, religious training, discipline, medical care, and other matters of major significance concerning the child\u2019s life and welfare. Physical custody, on the other hand, means the right and obligation to provide a home for the child and to make the day-to-day decisions required during the time the child is actually with the parent having such custody.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 296, 508 A.2d 964 <em>(see </em>cases cited therein).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">In the light of the legislative intent that Art. 27, \u00a7 35C have a broad reach, we find it patent that ordinarily a consent to the transfer of legal and physical custody of a child for money is proscribed by the statute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">Our determination that Art. 27, \u00a7 35C ordinarily reaches the consent to a transfer of the physical and legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>custody of a child for money, does not resolve this appeal. We do not find in the record before us the \u201cConsent to Custody Order\u201d which the mother signed. But we glean from the comments of the trial judge and the mother that the consent included both the legal and physical custody of the child. Runkles advances no suggestion to the contrary. In other words, the trial judge and the parties were content that the mother consented to the relinquishment of all of her rights and obligations with respect to the child by way of the transfer of his custody to the grandfather. <em>See Frye v. Frye, </em>305 Md. 542, 558-561, 505 A.2d 826 (1986). The mother\u2019s conduct, however, was in nowise criminal. According to the agreed statement, she knew nothing about the payment of money for her consent. Thus, she did not violate Art. 27, \u00a7 85C because her conduct lacked an essential element of that statute \u2014 the intent that the exchange of custody be for \u201cmoney or property, either real or personal, or anything else of value.\u201d She did not violate FL \u00a7 5-327, even though her consent to custody may have led to adoption by the grandfather, because she had no intent that the child be sold, bartered or traded for compensation. She did not desert or wilfully fail to support the child, a misdemean- or under FL \u00a7 10-203. Nor, charged with the care, custody, and control of the child, did she desert the child with the intent that the child became a public charge or without providing for the child\u2019s support for three years, a misdemeanor created by FL \u00a7 10-219. No matter how the mother may be judged morally, she was legally blameless; she was an innocent party in the affair. The question boils down to whether the evidence was legally sufficient to establish that Runkles committed the crime created by Art. 27, \u00a7 35C.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The test for the legal sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction of a crime is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeX\">\u201cwhether the evidence either shows directly or supports a rational inference of the facts to be proved, from which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>the trier of fact could fairly be convinced, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offense charged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-5\"><em>Wilson v. State, </em>261 Md. 551, 564, 276 A.2d 214 (1971), quoting <em>Williams and McClelland v. State, </em>5 Md.App. 450, 459, 247 A.2d 731 (1968). The facts to be proved are those necessary to establish the corpus delicti of the offense charged and the criminal agency of the defendant. The corpus delicti of the offense charged here is that of the crime created by Art. 27, \u00a7 35C, namely, the sale, barter or trade of a child for anything of value. The criminal agent alleged is Runkles. We start with our determination that the consent to the transfer of the legal and physical custody of a child in exchange for money is ordinarily the sale, barter, or trade of a child proscribed by Art. 27, \u00a7 35C. The evidence supplied by the agreed statement of facts was legally sufficient to establish that a child was involved, that the child was sold, bartered, or traded in that the consent of the mother paved the way for the transfer of the custody of the child to the grandfather, and that something of value, namely money, was paid therefor. Thus, the corpus delicti of Art. 27, \u00a7 35C was proved. There remains whether the evidence was legally sufficient to show the criminal agency of Runkles.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Of course, Runkles himself did not have the right or authority to consent to the transfer of the custody of the child. But he brought the consent about by acting through an innocent human agent, the mother. Inasmuch as we have determined that the consent to transfer custody of a child for money in the circumstances here is a misdemeanor under Art. 27, \u00a7 35C, Runkles\u2019s participation made him a principal therein. <em>Stebbing v. State, </em>299 Md. 331, 372, 473 A.2d 903 (1984); <em>Novak v. State, </em>214 Md. 472, 478, 136 A.2d 256 (1957). As a principal acting through an innocent human agent, he was culpable. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>303 Md. 487, 510, 495 A.2d 1 (1985); <em>Tichnell v. State, </em>297 Md. 432, 444, n. 5, 468 A.2d 1 (1983); <em>State v.

It is otherwise, however, when the crime is accomplished by the use of an innocent or irresponsible agent, as where the defendant causes a child or mentally incompetent or one without a criminal state of mind (most likely because the defendant has misled or withheld facts from him) to engage in conduct. In such a case the intermediary is regarded as a mere instrument and the originating actor is the principal in the first degree. The principal is accountable for the acts or omissions of the innocent or irresponsible person, and the principal\u2019s liability is determined on the basis of that conduct and the principal\u2019s own mental state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALo\">LaFave &amp; Scott, <em>Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 6.6 (2d ed. 1986) (footnotes omitted). \u201cOne may incur criminal guilt by procuring the harm to be done by the hand of another whether the other is also culpable or acts as an innocent agent.\u201d Perkins &amp; Boyce, <em>Criminal Law </em>Ch. 6, \u00a7 6 (3d ed. 1982). \u201cA person may also be guilty himself as the sole perpetrator ... if he procures the commission of an offense by an innocent human agent____\u201d Clark &amp; Marshall, <em>A Treatise on the Law of Crimes </em>\u00a7 4.00 (Barnes rev. (1967)). <em>See </em>also <em>1 Bishop on Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 629 (9th ed. 1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Runkles\u2019s conduct renounced the legislative purpose of the statute; it denigrated the general aim and policy of the Legislature; it was contrary to the ends intended to be accomplished; it mocked the evils to be redressed. We are not dissuaded from our view by the argument that Runkles sold only his influence. The loophole Runkles seeks is simply not viable. It was because of him that the mother agreed to relinquish her custody of the child; she had resisted the grandfather\u2019s previous attempts to obtain custody. Despite her rationalization, after the fact, to explain why she allowed herself to be persuaded by Runkles, the child would have remained with her except for Runkles\u2019s intervention. Certainly, the grandfather so believed; he offered to pay Runkles $4,000 to intervene. Runkles, to all intent and purpose, \u201csold\u201d the child within the contempla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>tion of the statute, and the evidence was legally sufficient for the trial judge as trier of fact to so find. The evidence supplied by the agreed statement of facts was enough to prove the corpus delicti of the crime charged and the criminal agency of Runkles. The trial judge could fairly be convinced, on the evidence before him, of Runkles\u2019s guilt.

Consequently, we need not look beyond the statute to discover the intention of the Legislature in enacting it. <em>See Bacon v. State, </em>322 Md. 140, 147, 586 A.2d 18, 22 (1991); <em>State v.

In my view, it intended to reach the situation in which a parent, or other person covered by the statute, sought to transfer parental rights and responsibilities with respect to the child for money, property, or anything else of value. I do agree with the Court of Special Appeals, moreover, that the statute was not intended, in any event, to reach the petitioner\u2019s conduct in this case; it does not prohibit influence peddling, <em>i.e., </em>persuading an innocent person to relinquish custody of a child. That is all that the record reflects the petitioner agreed to do and did. It follows, therefore, that that is all he was paid to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">ELDRIDGE, J., has authorized me to say that he joins in the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b495-6\">. The majority sees it differently. In its view, the language is not so clear and unambiguous \"as to make unnecessary further inquiry concerning the intent of the Legislature.\" [Op. at 392, 605 A.2d at 115] Assuming that the majority is correct, my position remains the same. The legislative history of the statute makes clear that the Legislature was very much aware of how to fashion a statute that met the needs it perceived to exist. In fact, that history demonstrates that the Legislature did just that in this case. It had the opportunity explicitly to prohibit the exchange of custody of a child for money or anything of value; it chose not to do so, opting instead for very specific language, <em>i.e. </em>\"sale,\u201d \"barter,\u201d or \u201ctrade.\u201d That it did so speaks volumes as to what it intended.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b495-7\"><em>. </em>The State and the majority, consistent with the dissenting opinion in <em>Runkles, </em>focus on the phrase \"commercial trafficking in children\" as being the prohibited conduct. There is nothing in the statute nor the legislative history that indicates that was the object of the statute. Indeed, as the opinion of the intermediate appellate court points out, the impetus for the statute was otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b495-8\">. Without so much as a supporting citation, the majority mischaracterizes the \u201ccrux\u201d of the majority opinion of the Court of Special Appeals as holding that \"\u00a7 35C applies only to adoption proceedings,\u201d [Op. at 391, 605 A.2d at 115] perhaps to set up a strawman for its legislative history argument. The Court of Special Appeals held, on the contrary, that the conduct with which the petitioner was charged was not covered by \u00a7 35C, <em>Runkles v. State, </em>87 Md.App. 492, 501, 590 A.2d 552, 556 (1991), that that section \u201ccannot be read to proscribe the transfer of custody for consideration.\u201d <em>Id., </em>87 Md.App. at 498, 590 A.2d at 555.
