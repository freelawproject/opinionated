BELL, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">Sterling Russell Hare, Sr. (\u201cHare\u201d), petitioned for certiorari, requesting that we consider whether it was fundamentally unfair for his driver\u2019s license to be suspended for his refusal to take a chemical test for alcohol concentration when he was not advised that if he took the test and failed, but met certain conditions, the Motor Vehicle Administration (\u201cMVA\u201d), could modify the suspension or issue a restrictive license. We granted the petition and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">Hare was stopped on suspicion of driving while intoxicated and subsequently arrested on that charge. Having refused to take a chemical test for alcohol concentration, he requested a hearing to show cause why his license should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>not be suspended. At that hearing, the following facts were developed. Officer Howard Jones, Jr. observed Hare driving erratically, almost striking several parked cars. He stopped Hare and, at that time, made certain observations which led him to place Hare under arrest. He noticed that there was a strong odor of alcohol on Hare\u2019s breath, that Hare staggered when he walked, that his speech was slurred, and that he had \u201cwet\u201d his pants. At the Central District Police Station, Officer Jones read from the DR-15 advice of rights form, advising Hare that, as relevant to this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-4\">You have the right to submit to the test. Your refusal shall result in an administrative suspension of your Maryland driver\u2019s license or your driving privilege if you are a nonresident. The suspension by the Motor Vehicle Administration shall be for 120 days for a first offense and one year for a second or subsequent offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">If you submit to a test which indicates an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more, it shall result in an administrative suspension of your Maryland driver\u2019s license or your driving privilege if you are a non-resident. The suspension by the Motor Vehicle Administration shall be for 45 days for a first offense and 90 days for a second or subsequent offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-6\"><em>See </em>Maryland Code (1977, 1987 Repl.Vol., 1991 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 16-205.1 <em>et seq. </em>of the Transportation Article.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This form did not refer to \u00a7 16-205. l(m),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which permits the Motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Vehicle Administration to modify a suspension or issue a restrictive license. Nor did Officer Jones, who was himself unaware that a driver who refused the test was ineligible for modification of suspension or a restrictive license, advise Hare of that consequence of refusal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hare testified that he, too, was unaware of that consequence of refusing the test and that, had he known, he probably would have taken the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Following the hearing, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) made the findings required by \u00a7 16 \u2014 205. l(f)(8)(i), that: (1) Officer Jones had reasonable grounds to believe Hare was driving while intoxicated; (2) there was evidence of alcohol consumption, (3) Hare was \u201cfully advised of the administrative sanctions that shall be imposed\u201d; and (4) Hare refused the test. Consequently, pursuant to \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(8)(v), he suspended Hare\u2019s license for 120 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">On appeal to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Hare argued that he had not been fully advised of the \u201cadministrative sanctions that shall be imposed\u201d when he refused to take the chemical test. Specifically, he urged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>that non-eligibility for a modification of suspension or a restrictive license of a person who refuses the test is \u201can administrative sanction\u201d of which he should have been advised pursuant to \u00a7 16 \u2014 205. l(b)(2)(iii)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that he was denied due process when he was not so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">We have today held that \u00a7 16 \u2014 205. l(b)(2)(iii) does not require a police officer to advise a driver of the mere possible eligibility for a modification of suspension or a restrictive license should that driver take and fail a chemical test. <em>Motor Vehicle Administration v. Chamberlain, </em>326 Md. 306, 316-17, 604 A.2d 919, 923-24 (1992). The only advice that the officer must give the driver, we said, is that which is specifically set out in \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(l).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 326 Md. at 317, 604 A.2d at 924. To the extent that Hare\u2019s argument depends upon the construction of \u00a7 16-205.1, <em>Chamberlain </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>is dispositive.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Hare\u2019s principal argument is that it is fundamentally unfair, hence, a denial of due process, to suspend a driver\u2019s license without first advising the driver \u201cfully\u201d of the applicable administrative sanctions. The MVA characterizes this argument as seeking to require advice as to \u201call of the different possible outcomes of a hearing, depending on whether the licensee takes the test and fails or refuses the test.\u201d However characterized, the argument is not persuasive. Accordingly, we hold that Hare was not denied due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">\u201cThe continued possession of a driver\u2019s license ... may become essential to earning a livelihood; as such, it is an entitlement which cannot be taken without the due process mandated by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Sites v. State, </em>300 Md. 702, 717, 481 A.2d 192, 200 (1984), citing <em>Dixon v. Love, </em>431 U.S. 105, 97 S.Ct. 1723, 52 L.Ed.2d 172 (1977) and <em>Bell v. Burson, </em>402 U.S. 535, 91 S.Ct. 1586, 29 L.Ed.2d 90 (1971). <em>See also Brosan v. Cochran, </em>307 Md. 662, 672, 516 A.2d 970, 975 (1986). Under \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(8)(v), if certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>conditions, not here relevant, are met, <em>see </em>\u00a7 16 \u2014 205. l(f)(8)(i), whether a driver refuses to take a chemical test for alcohol concentration, or takes it and fails, <em>i.e., </em>the test results reveal an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more, the driver\u2019s license will be suspended. There is, however, a significant difference between the length of the suspension depending upon whether the test was refused or failed: the suspension for refusal is more than twice as long as for failing the test. But there are other consequences attendant to a test refusal that do not apply to a test failure. A driver who refuses the test may not have his or her license suspension modified or be issued a restrictive license. \u00a7 16-205. l(m)(2). Furthermore, that driver\u2019s insurance company could consider the suspension in increasing the driver\u2019s insurance premiums, Maryland Code (1957, 1991 Repl.Vol.) Art. 48A \u00a7\u00a7 242(c)(7)(iv) and 244D(e)(4); <em>see </em>\u00a7 16-117(b)(2), or to reject or cancel the driver\u2019s policy. Section 243D(a) and (c). As under the old law, the Maryland statute does deliberately give a driver a choice between potential sanctions affecting vitally different interests. <em>Sites, </em>300 Md. at 717, 481 A.2d at 200. \u201cThus, drunk driving suspects have a significant interest at stake in deciding whether to submit to the State-administered chemical sobriety test.\u201d <em>Brosan, </em>307 Md. at 672, 516 A.2d at 975. If they refuse the test, as we have seen, their licenses will be suspended, without possibility of modification or of obtaining restrictive licenses, and the suspensions may be considered by insurance companies in setting insurance premiums. If, on the other hand, they take the test and fail, their licenses will be suspended for a shorter period, but the suspensions could be modified or restrictive licenses issued and, if it is for a first offense of driving with an alcohol concentration of 0.10, the suspension may not be considered by an insurance company in setting insurance premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">We have already held that \u00a7 16-205.1 requires only that the driver be informed of the certainty, and length, of suspension for refusal, as well as for failure, of the test. The critical inquiry, therefore, is whether due process re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>quires the officer also to advise a refusing driver of either or both of the other consequences we have identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">What process a defendant is due is, of course, dependent upon the facts and circumstances of the case. <em>Sites, </em>300 Md. at 716, 481 A.2d at 199 (\u201cthe exact contours of the due process right are not definable with precision\u201d); <em>see also Hewitt v. Helms, </em>459 U.S. 460, 472, 103 S.Ct. 864, 871, 74 L.Ed.2d 675, 688 (1983); <em>Brosan, </em>307 Md. at 671, 516 A.2d at 975. To make that determination, we have to \u201cexamine the importance of the life, liberty, or property interest at stake and the extent to which the questioned procedure might produce the possibility of uninformed decision-making. Against the individual\u2019s interest, [we] must weigh the State\u2019s legitimate competing interest, which necessarily includes the avoidance of the increased administrative or fiscal burdens resulting from the requested procedure.\u201d <em>Brosan, </em>307 Md. at 671-72, 516 A.2d at 975, citing <em>Matthews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 903, 47 L.Ed.2d 18, 33 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">As we have seen, Hare\u2019s interest in his driver\u2019s license is an important one. Juxtaposed against that interest is the State\u2019s interest in protecting its citizens from drunk drivers and, as a means of doing so, encouraging suspected drunk drivers to take the test, thus facilitating their prosecution. <em>See State v. Werkheiser, </em>299 Md. 529, 533, 474 A.2d 898, 900 (1984). <em>See also Motor Vehicle Administration v. Shrader, </em>324 Md. 454, 464, 597 A.2d 939, 944 (1991). The final factor to be considered is whether the procedure chosen enhances informed decision-making.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The statute, as we have seen, mandates that a driver be given advice which contrasts the consequence of a refusal of the test with that for a failure of the test. That contrast is stark enough \u2014 the length of the suspension in the former case being twice as long as in the latter \u2014 to be an incentive, by itself, to take the test. Hare suggests that, because \u00a7 16-205.1(m) provides a further incentive for taking the test \u2014 by taking the test the driver remains eligible for a modification of suspension or a restrictive license \u2014 as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>matter of due process, he should have been advised of it. Interestingly, he does not argue that the insurance considerations ought be treated similarly. Nor does he explain why they should not.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Although an interesting argument, we do not believe that due process, either under the Fourteenth Amendment or under Art. 24 of the Declaration of Rights of the Maryland Constitution requires that result. A driver need not be told of every conceivable incentive for taking a chemical test for alcohol or, for that matter, even one additional incentive not required by the statute. This conclusion is, we think, buttressed both by Maryland law and common sense. As to the latter, when it is once determined that a driver must be apprised of additional incentives, there is no rational basis for determining which of those additional incentives must be covered and which are not of sufficient value to merit inclusion in the advice given the arrestee. <em>See Chamberlain, </em>326 Md. at 319, 604 A.2d at 925.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Our cases teach that due process does not always require the State affirmatively to inform a def\u00e9ndant of the availability of options that might influence decision-making. It requires no more than that the State not mislead the defendant or construct road blocks, thus unduly burdening that decision-making. <em>See McAvoy v. State, </em>314 Md. 509, 551 A.2d 875 (1989). <em>See also Sites </em>and <em>Brosan, </em>both <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">In <em>Sites, </em>we found a violation of the fundamental fairness aspect of due process when a police officer refused the defendant\u2019s request to telephone his attorney, when that would not have \u201csubstantially interfere[d] with the timely and efficacious administration of the testing process.\u201d 300 Md. at 717-18, 481 A.2d at 200. That holding was extended in <em>Brosan </em>to permit a face-to-face consultation between attorney and client, and the administration of a private test for alcohol concentration by the attorney, so long as it did not interfere with the State\u2019s testing process. 307 Md. at 673-74, 516 A.2d at 976.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number><em>McAvoy, </em>on the other hand, recognized the limits of the <em>Sites </em>and <em>Brosan </em>holdings. In that case, we characterized the <em>Sites </em>holding as a recognition of \u201ca deprivation of the right of due process by the unnecessary denial of a specific request for counsel,\u201d 314 Md. at 519, 551 A.2d at 880, explaining: \u201cMcAvoy did enjoy the due process rights we recognized in <em>Sites </em>and refined in <em>Brosan. </em>Those rights did not, however, entitle him to advice of his right to counsel____\u201d 314 Md. at 520, 551 A.2d at 880. Thus, we refused to place an additional affirmative duty on the State. <em>See also Darrikhuma v. State, </em>in which the Court of Special Appeals, following <em>McAvoy, </em>rejected an argument that due process required the State to advise a defendant of the <em>Sites </em>and <em>Brosan </em>holdings. 81 Md.App. 560, 573-74, 568 A.2d 1150, 1157, <em>cert, denied, </em>319 Md. 581, 573 A.2d 1337 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Courts in other jurisdictions take the same approach. <em>Com. v. Crowell, </em>403 Mass. 381, 529 N.E.2d 1339, 1342 (1988) (due process does not require advice of consequences of failure of breath test over and above that required by statute); <em>Hess v. Turner, </em>129 N.H. 491, 529 A.2d 386, 387 (1987) (implied consent law does not require police to inform driver arrested for driving under the influence of the imposition of a non-concurrent additional penalty to revocation); <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>128 N.H. 672, 517 A.2d 1182, 1184 (1986) (due process does not require, as part of the implied consent warning, that a defendant arrested for driving under the influence be told all potential consequences of submitting to a chemical test for alcohol); <em>State v. Mercer, </em>211 N.J.Super. 388, 511 A.2d 1233, 1235 (1986) (due process does not require the police officer to inform defendant of the right to an independent blood alcohol test); <em>State v. Newton, </em>291* Or. 788, 636 P.2d 393, 407 (1981) (\u201cFreedom from interference with liberty ... is different from entitlement to a right. The state is barred from unlawfully restricting liberty, but it is not obliged to itemize to a person all the actions he is free to take nor to provide an indigent person with the means to exercise his freedom as a precondition to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>the state\u2019s taking action.\u201d); <em>Provo City v. Werner, </em>810 P.2d 469, 473 (Utah App.1991) (due process does not require the police to assist in obtaining an independent chemical test unless expressly required to do so by statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Having provided the advice mandated by the statute, the police officer was not required to anticipate, or guess at, what incentive would have caused the driver to take the chemical test. Nor was he, as a matter of due process, required to provide any advice other than that the statute prescribed. Indeed, had he undertaken to provide additional information and it turned out to be misleading or inaccurate, that, in itself, may have been a denial of due process. Cf. <em>Morales v. State, </em>325 Md. 330, 335, 600 A.2d 851, 853 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Due process does not require the officer to weigh the relative merits, for encouragement value, of particular consequences flowing from the decision whether to take or refuse a chemical test.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">ELDRIDGE, J., concurs in the result only.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-7\">.

Previously, the Motor Vehicle Administration retained the discretion to modify the suspension of a driver\u2019s license or issue a restrictive license whether that driver took the test, or refused it. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1977, 1987 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(5) of the Transportation Article.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b387-10\">.

Hare makes an argument that was not presented in <em>Chamberlain. </em>He asserts, notwithstanding the requirement of \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(f)(8)(i) that the Administration suspend the driver\u2019s license if it finds all four of the prerequisites, \u2018\u2018if the test is taken and failed, the suspension of 45 days provided in the statute is <em>not </em>mandated because the Administrative Judge may modify the suspension.\" (Emphasis in original). In other words, he maintains that the possibility of modification renders the license suspension nonmandatory. We reject that argument. Unless there is a license suspension, there is nothing to modify or any need to issue a restrictive license. Consistent with the provisions of \u00a7 16-205.l(m), Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986), p. 1452, defines \"modify\u201d as \u201cto make more temperate and less extreme: lessen the severity of: moderate.\u201d In Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, (5th ed.) the definition is: \u201cTo alter; to change in incidental or subordinate features; enlarge, extend; amend; limit; reduce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Nor is Hare\u2019s position improved because \u00a7 16-405 allows \u201cthe hearing officer [to] decline to order the suspension or revocation.\u201d That section excepts \u00a7 16-205.1, in which, as we have seen, subsection (m) speaks only in terms of \u201cmodification.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
