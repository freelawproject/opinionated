On December 5, 1989, after a hearing, the Board found that Novik was permanently incapacitated as a result of her accidental injury and that the accident occurred while she was in the \u201cactual performance of duty\u201d within the contemplation of \u00a7 9(j) of Article 22 of the Baltimore City Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">The Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Ward, J.) affirmed the Board\u2019s decision. It focused on cases decided under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Maryland Code (1985 Repl. Vol.), Article 101, \u00a7 15, in which employees, injured on the employer\u2019s parking lot while going to or coming from work, were found to have been injured in the course of their employment. It concluded that the standard of compensability under \u00a7 15 of that Act \u2014 that the accident \u201c[arose] out of and in the course of [the worker\u2019s] employment\u201d \u2014 was the legal equivalent of the standard set forth in \u00a7 9(j) of Article 22, namely, that the injury occurred \u201cwhile in the actual performance of duty.\u201d The court rejected the City\u2019s argument that \u00a7 9(j) of Article 22 \u201csets up a stricter standard than that applied to workmen\u2019s compensation parking lot cases under Article 101, \u00a7 15.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the circuit court\u2019s judgment. It concluded that the evidence established that Novik\u2019s injury occurred \u201cwhile in the actual performance of duty.\u201d <em>Board of Trustees v. Novik, </em>87 Md.App. 308, 589 A.2d 976 (1991). Specifically, the intermediate appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>court declined the City\u2019s invitation \u201cto define the \u2018actual performance of duties\u2019 test strictly and literally, to preclude disability benefits unless the disabling injury occurred while the employee was physically at her work station.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314-15, 589 A.2d 976. If this were so, the court said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_q8\">\u201cno recovery would be permissible if the injury occurred even during a temporary interruption \u2014 going to the restroom, sipping a cup of coffee, chatting momentarily with a co-worker. Such a construction, we think would be not only unreasonable but extremely difficult to administer. The \u2018actual performance\u2019 test must contemplate the reality of the workplace and include conduct that is permissible, commonly engaged in by employees, and reasonably incidental to the performance of the employees\u2019 duties. An employee\u2019s presence on the employer\u2019s property while proceeding to or from his or her work station could fairly be regarded as being within that test.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 315, 589 A.2d 976.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">We granted the City\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari to determine whether the standard of compensability under \u00a7 9(j) of Article 22 of the Baltimore City Code was the same as that mandated by \u00a7 15 of Article 101 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, injuries sustained by employees while going to or coming from work do not, as a general rule, \u201carise out of and in the course of their employment, as the hazards they encounter ... are ordinarily not incidents to the employer\u2019s business.\u201d <em>Rumple v. Henry H. Meyer Co., Inc., </em>208 Md. 350, 357, 118 A.2d 486 (1955). This so-called \u201cGoing and Coming\u201d rule is subject to several exceptions, one of which \u2014 the \u201cpremises\u201d exception \u2014 provides that an employee who is accidentally injured on the employer\u2019s premises while going to or coming from work is considered to have been in the course of employment. <em>Saylor v. Black &amp; Decker Mfg. Co., </em>258 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>605, 608, 267 A.2d 81 (1970). More specifically, we said in <em>Salomon v. Springfield Hospital, </em>250 Md. 150, 155, 242 A.2d 126 (1968) that although \u201can employee who has arrived on his employer\u2019s premises as usual, in preparation for beginning his day\u2019s work, is considered to be on the premises and therefore covered by workmen\u2019s compensation even though his actual employment has not begun, ... [the] \u2018premises\u2019 does not necessarily include all property owned by an employer.\u201d In this regard, we noted in <em>Saylor, supra, </em>258 Md. at 609, 267 A.2d 81, that \u201cthere must be a work association between the part of the employer\u2019s property where the employee was injured and the area in which [the employee] worked.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">In <em>Proctor-Silex v. DeBrick, </em>253 Md. 477, 252 A.2d 800 (1969), we approved payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits for injuries to an employee occurring on a parking lot provided by the employer for the use of the employee. In that case, the employee parked her vehicle on the parking lot provided by her employer, which was located across the street and down slightly from the employer\u2019s building. The employee walked diagonally across the street in question and then on the pavement provided for pedestrian traffic in front of her employer\u2019s plant to a point somewhere between the entrance to the office of the plant and the entrance for the employees. At this location, she injured herself when she slipped and fell on the ice. In holding that the employee was entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">\u201cWhere, as here, the claimant had arrived on the premises of her employer and was proceeding without deviation of any kind directly to her work, it would by unreasonable to hold that injuries sustained by her on the parking lot or between the building entrance and the time clock would be compensable, but injuries sustained between the parking lot and the building entrance would not be compensable. Therefore, we hold the injuries sustained by Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>DeBrick to have arisen out of and in the course of her employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 489, 252 A.2d 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">1 Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 15.11 and .42(a) (1990 ed.), cites the general rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">\u201cThe course of employment is not confined to the actual manipulation of the tools of the work, nor to the exact hours of work. On the other hand, while admittedly the employment is the cause of the workman\u2019s journey between his home and the factory, it is generally taken for granted that workmen\u2019s compensation was not intended to protect him against all the perils of that journey. Between these two extremes, a compromise on the subject of going to and from work has been arrived at, largely by case law, with a surprising degree of unanimity: for an employee having fixed hours and place of work, going to and from work is covered <em>on the employer\u2019s premises.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">\u2666 * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-8\">\u201cAs to parking lots owned by the employer, or maintained by the employer for his employees, practically all jurisdictions now consider them part of the \u2018premises,\u2019 whether within the main company premises or separated from it. This rule is by no means confined to parking lots owned, controlled, or maintained by the employer. The doctrine has been applied when the lot, although not owned by the employer, was exclusively used, or used with the owner\u2019s special permission, or just used, by the employees of this employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Consistent with Larson, our cases have clearly extended employer liability for workers\u2019 compensation benefits \u201cat least as far as the parking lot boundaries.\u201d <em>Saylor, supra, </em>258 Md. at 609, 267 A.2d 81. <em>See May Dept. Stores v. Harryman, </em>307 Md. 692, 517 A.2d 71 (1986); <em>Wiley Mfg. Co. v. Wilson, </em>280 Md. 200, 373 A.2d 613 (1977); <em>Giant Food Inc. v. Gooch, </em>245 Md. 160, 225 A.2d 431 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">The City argues that the standard of compensability for pension benefits is not legally equivalent to the standard for workers\u2019 compensation. It states that because the language of the statutes \u201cclearly differs ... [,] it follows that the standards must differ as well.\u201d This is so, the City claims, because workers' compensation serves a purpose \u201cmarkedly distinct\u201d from that of pension benefits. It says that workers\u2019 compensation statutes are designed primarily to enable the employee to receive the treatment needed to recover and return to work, while accidental disability retirement benefits are designed to compensate in a more comprehensive way the employee who is permanently disabled by an injury which occurred in the actual performance of the employee\u2019s duties. Consequently, the City argues that it is reasonable to conclude that a stricter standard is intended under the disability pension benefits system than under workers\u2019 compensation. While conceding that Novik\u2019s injury is compensable under the workers\u2019 compensation statute, it is the City\u2019s position that her injury is not compensable under \u00a7 9(j) of Article 22 because, even though she was on her way to work and on a City-owned parking lot at the time of her accident, she was not engaged \u201cin the actual performance of duty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Novik contends that the standard of compensability for pension benefits is legally equivalent to the standard for workers\u2019 compensation. According to Novik, the basic similarity of the workers\u2019 compensation and pension benefits statutes \u201ccompel[s] the Courts to view the two as analogous, when factually there is no legal distinction ... [a]nd in doing so, apply the principles of the former to the latter.\u201d She maintains that both statutes must be liberally construed and that our cases have \u201ceffectively eliminated the proposition of a stricter standard of interpretation, giving greater credence to the position that the language [of the statutes] is legally equivalent.\u201d Finally, Novik posits that she sustained her injuries while \u201cin the actual performance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>of duty\u201d because the accident occurred on the premises of her employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Our prior decisions have \u201crecognized a striking analogy between the terms \u2018in the actual performance of duty\u2019 and \u2018out of and in the course of his employment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Police Comm\u2019r v. King, </em>219 Md. 127, 134-35, 148 A.2d 562 (1959). For example, in <em>Heaps v. Cobb, </em>185 Md. 372, 45 A.2d 73 (1945), the Chief Engineer of Baltimore City died in an automobile accident while driving to a work-related appointment. Although the City provided the employee with a car to transport himself to and from appointments, on this occasion he had substituted his own vehicle for the City-owned car. In granting the claim for accidental death benefits under Baltimore City Code, Article 30, \u00a7 6(9),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Court held that the employee was engaged in the \u201cactual performance of duty\u201d at the time the accident occurred because his duties included driving himself to work-related appointments. The Court noted the existence of the \u201cfurnished transportation\u201d exception to the \u201cGoing and Coming\u201d rule in workers\u2019 compensation cases, <em>i.e., </em>that \u201cwhere an employee is furnished transportation by his employer in connection with the latter\u2019s business, ... the employee is to be considered on duty while using this transportation.\u201d 185 Md. at 383. In analogizing workers\u2019 compensation cases with pension disability cases, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">\u201cWhile the adjudicated cases in which this principle has been applied are mostly those under workmen\u2019s compensation statutes, dealing with accidental injuries \u2018arising out of, and in the course of, employment,\u2019 the analogy between them and the pension cases like the one at bar is so close on the point at issue that we find no legal distinction in applying the principle. The test in both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>classes of cases is whether the transportation was furnished by the employer as an incident of the employment, and the nature of the mission on which the employee was engaged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383, 45 A.2d 73.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><em>Rumple v. Henry H. Meyer Co., Inc., supra, </em>involved a workers\u2019 compensation claim for injuries sustained while the employee drove home in a truck provided by the employer as an incident to the employment. In applying the furnished transportation exception to the \u201cGoing and Coming\u201d rule, the Court held that the employee sustained an injury arising \u201cout of and in the course of his employment\u201d and that he was deemed to be on duty during such transportation. <em>Id. </em>208 Md. at 359, 118 A.2d 486. The Court, citing <em>Heaps v. Cobb, supra, </em>again pointed out that the phrase \u201cactual performance of duty\u201d has been \u201ctreated as legally the same\u201d as the above-quoted language of the workers\u2019 compensation statute. <em>Id. </em>at 357, 118 A.2d 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">In <em>Police Comm\u2019r v. King, supra, </em>the widow of a deceased police officer sought accidental death benefits under a Baltimore City police pension ordinance that provided such benefits where the officer was killed \u201cwhile in the actual performance of duty.\u201d The officer was accidentally killed by his own revolver when he apparently slipped while descending the stairs in his home while preparing to go to work; at the time, he was partially dressed and was carrying police equipment, including his revolver in his hands. Police regulations required that officers be on duty, or ready for duty, at all times and suitably armed. After recognizing the \u201cstriking analogy\u201d between the terms \u201cin the actual performance of duty,\u201d as used in the police pension ordinance, and \u201carising out of and in the course of employment,\u201d as used in the workers\u2019 compensation statute, we said that both laws should be liberally construed. <em>Id. </em>219 Md. at 133-35, 148 A.2d 562. The Court noted the general rule that injuries sustained by employees while going to or returning from their regular place of work do not arise out of and in the course of employment. It held that a police officer \u201cwho is dressing himself prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>starting on his trip to work is [not] \u2018in the actual performance of duty\u2019 or \u2018in the discharge of duty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 135,148 A.2d 562. We said that affording a reasonable and liberal construction to the provisions of the ordinance, the officer was \u201coff-duty and not performing or discharging any actual police duty at the time of his unfortunate accident\u201d and thus was not in the actual performance or discharge of his police duties. <em>Id. </em>at 136, 148 A.2d 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">In <em>Board of Trustees v. Grandinetti, </em>269 Md. 733, 309 A.2d 764 (1973), a Baltimore City employee sought accidental disability retirement benefits under a city ordinance which required that the member be permanently incapacitated for duty as a result of an accident \u201coccurring while in the actual performance of duty.\u201d The issue before the Court was whether the employee\u2019s incapacity was caused by an \u201caccidental\u201d injury sustained in the performance of duty. <em>Id. </em>at 735, 309 A.2d 764. The evidence showed that the employee suffered a heart attack following a physical assault upon him by a co-worker and subsequent threats of bodily harm. We said that \u201cwhile analogies to workmen\u2019s compensation cases are frequently helpful in pension cases, ... any analogy must be drawn keeping clearly in mind the difference between the workmen\u2019s compensation test [an accidental personal injury sustained by the employee arising out of and in the course of his employment]\u201d and the test under the ordinance, namely, an accident occurring in the actual performance of duty. <em>Id. </em>at 738, 309 A.2d 764. We noted that an injury, to be accidental under the workers\u2019 compensation law, required some unusual condition in the employment \u2014 an unusual strain, exertion, or condition not customarily encountered in the employment. <em>Id. </em>at 739, 309 A.2d 764. We reviewed a number of pension disability cases which applied a like rationale in determining whether the injury was \u201caccidental.\u201d We also reviewed several workers\u2019 compensation cases. The first <em>Yellow Cab Company v. Bisasky, </em>11 Md.App. 491, 275 A.2d 193 (1971), involved a cab driver who, following an armed holdup, suffered a permanently disabling stroke. The court there</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>found the injury to be accidental and work related. The second case, <em>Giant Food, Inc. v. Gooch, </em>245 Md. 160, 225 A.2d 431 (1967), involved a claimant who was shot while at work in the employer\u2019s parking lot by the willful act of a third person; we found that the injury was \u201caccidental.\u201d Similarly, in <em>Grandinetti, </em>we found that the employee\u2019s injuries, having resulted from a work-related assault and threats, were \u201caccidental\u201d and occurred in the actual performance of duty, thereby equating that standard with the test applied in workers\u2019 compensation cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><em>Cicala v. Disability Review Bd., </em>288 Md. 254, 418 A.2d 205 (1980), involved a county police pension plan which provided service-connected accidental disability retirement benefits for an employee injured \u201cas a result of his performance of his duties.\u201d The claimant-officer was denied benefits under the plan when the county disability review board determined that his disability, although permanent, was not service connected. In an earlier proceeding before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, it was found that the officer\u2019s accidental injury arose out of and in the course of his employment. The officer asserted that under applicable principles of res judicata, it was conclusively established that his disability was the result of an injury suffered in the performance of his police duties. While we recognized that the issue before both the Commission and the board appeared to be identical, we declined to apply the res judicata doctrine in the case. At the same time, we explained that although our cases had drawn analogies between the phrase \u201cperformance of his duties\u201d in the police retirement and pension plans, and the similar standard in workers\u2019 compensation cases, the tests were not identical. <em>Id. </em>at 266, 418 A.2d 205. Consequently, we held that because the issues before the Commission and the board were not identical, \u201cit was not reversible for the Board to refuse to consider the findings of the Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 267, 418 A.2d 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Affording a liberal construction to \u00a7 9(j) of Article 22, <em>Police Comm\u2019r v. King, supra, </em>219 Md. at 133-35, 148 A.2d 562, we conclude that the language of the ordinance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>and that of the workers\u2019 compensation statute is substantially legally equivalent. Novik was upon her employer\u2019s premises at the time of her accident and, therefore, under the premises exception to the \u201cGoing and Coming\u201d rule, was in the \u201cactual performance of duty.\u201d We thus share the view of the Court of Special Appeals that, in the circumstances of this case, Novik\u2019s accident was \u201csufficiently incidental to the actual performance of her duties\u201d to justify the award of accidental disability benefits under \u00a7 9(j). 87 Md.App. at 315, 589 A.2d 976. As that court held, in applying the \u201cactual performance\u201d test under \u00a7 9(j), a liberal construction of that provision does not require that the employee be injured on the employer\u2019s premises only after reaching her actual work station.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">Accordingly, we reject the argument that Novik was not in the actual performance of her duties when she was accidently injured on the employer\u2019s parking lot. Our cases, particularly <em>Heaps v. Cobb, Rumple, </em>and <em>King, </em>all <em>supra, </em>made applicable in accidental disability pension cases the exceptions to the \u201cGoing and Coming\u201d rule honed in workers\u2019 compensation cases. As in <em>Heaps v. Cobb, </em>185 Md. at 383, 45 A.2d 73, we find the analogy between the workers\u2019 compensation and accidental disability pension statutes \u201cso close on the point at issue that we find no legal distinction in applying the principle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b540-9\">. Section 9(j) provides that the injury must permanently incapacitate the employee from the further performance of duty.
