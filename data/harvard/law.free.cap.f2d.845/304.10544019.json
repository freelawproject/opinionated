Fischer, </em>821 F.2d 557 (11th Cir.1987), in which we held the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 32, standing alone, does not provide the district court with jurisdiction to hear a motion making a post-judgment collateral attack on one\u2019s sentence for a Rule 32 violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-30\"><em>Id. </em>at 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-31\">Nor can we consider appellant\u2019s application as a motion to correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner under Fed.R. Crim.P. 35(a) because it was not filed within the required 120 days. If we were to treat the application as a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 we would have to find that Velez-Rendon\u2019s claims are not cognizable in a habeas corpus proceeding because the errors Velez-Rendon complains of do not qualify as <em>\u201c </em>\u2018fundamental defect[s] which inherently result[J m a complete miscarriage of justice.\u2019 <em>\u201d Davis v.
