A jury subsequently convicted Sammons of firearms possession.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-18\">The government filed a complaint for forfeiture of the firearms pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(d). Sammons sought to defeat the government\u2019s forfeiture action by contending that error occurred in his criminal trial and in the commitment proceedings. The district court treated Sammons\u2019s motion as a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Noting that Sammons did not deny his conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(h)(4), the district court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-19\">After Sammons answered the complaint, the government filed its motion for summary judgment, and Sammons moved for denial of the motion. Again, Sammons\u2019s response attacked the criminal conviction and his involuntary commitment. The district court granted the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment finding no genuine issue as to a material fact. The district court noted that Sammons did not dispute his conviction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(h)(4), thereby justifying the government\u2019s forfeiture action. On appeal, Sam-mons asserts that the district court erred in granting the government's motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-20\">We resolve two issues: (1) whether the district court erred in granting the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment; and (2) whether Sammons\u2019s motion to supplement the record should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-21\">The district court failed to comply with the notice requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. It is well settled in this circuit that proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>summary judgment notice must be afforded the non-moving litigant. Once again, this court is compelled to return to a busy district court a case for failure to adhere to rule 56(c). <em>See Griffith v. Wainwright, </em>772 F.2d 822 (11th Cir.1985). This circuit has established a \u201cbright-line\u201d test requiring strict ten-day advance notice to the adverse party. The notice requirement guarantees that the non-moving party will be afforded the opportunity to marshal its resources, file affidavits in opposition to the motion, and become aware of the consequences of default. Following proper notice, the court may properly take the motion under advisement and rule consistent with procedural requirements set forth in rule 56. <em>Wainwright, </em>772 F.2d at 825.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">We have repeatedly emphasized that care must be exercised to ensure proper notice to a litigant not represented by counsel. <em>Herron v. Beck, </em>693 F.2d 125 (11th Cir.1982). Litigants without counsel lack formal legal training and \u201coccupy a position significantly different from that occupied by litigants represented by counsel.\u201d <em>Wainwright, </em>772 F.2d at 825 (citing <em>Herron, </em>693 F.2d at 127). A motion for summary judgment should only be granted against a litigant without counsel if the court gives clear notice of the need to file affidavits or other responsive materials and of the consequences of default. In this case, the record does not indicate that the district court adequately advised Sammons of the ten-day notice requirement or of the consequences of default. <em>See Wainwright, </em>772 F.2d at 825.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Although we do not mandate a ten-day notice requirement when a complaint is dismissed for failure to state a claim pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b), such notice is required when a 12(b) motion is converted into a summary judgment motion. <em>Milburn v. United States, </em>734 F.2d 762, 765 (11th Cir.1984); <em>see also Madison v. United States, </em>752 F.2d 607 (11th Cir.1985). In <em>Madison </em>and <em>Milbum, </em>the government filed a \u201cMotion to Dismiss or in the Alternative Motion for Summary Judgment,\u201d pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 56, respectively. In both cases, we noted that a complaint may be dismissed for \u201cfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted [when] it appears beyond doubt that [litigant] can prove no set of facts that would entitle him to relief.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b); <em>Milburn, </em>734 F.2d at 765; <em>Madison, </em>752 F.2d at 609. This lack of notice exception only applies when a complaint is dismissed for failure to state a claim, not when the court converts the 12(b) motion into one for summary judgment. When a litigant moves pursuant to rule 56 for summary judgment or when the district court converts a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment, the \u201cbright-line\u201d ten-day notice requirement is stringently enforced. <em>Wainwright, </em>772 F.2d at 825; <em>Milburn, </em>734 F.2d at 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">The disposition of a case on summary judgment grounds represents a final decision on the merits and forecloses subsequent litigation. Given this harsh reality, it is important that proper notice be given so as to ensure a litigant adequate opportunity to present factual and legal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Because we find procedural defects in this case, we do not address the merits of the forfeiture action. Likewise, Sam-mons\u2019s request to supplement the record is denied as moot. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand this case for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-16\">. Although the government indicted Sammons prior to die 1986 amendment to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922, the amendment did not substantively change the applicable law. The relevant section in this case is 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(h)(4), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AY0\">(h) It shall be unlawful for any person\u2014 (4) who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or who has been committed to any mental institution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-22\">to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b384-23\">. Sammons possessed: (1) a .357 caliber Colt Python revolver; (2) a .38 caliber- Smith and Wesson revolver; (3) a Winchester 30/30 rifle; and (4) 79 rounds of assorted ammunition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
