Under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(2)(B)(ii), the district court was required to sentence Murillo-Guzman to imprisonment for not less than five years, followed by a term of supervised release for not less than four years. Murillo-Guzman received the minimum sentence permitted by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-26\">Murillo-Guzman argues that the statutory minimum sentence violates the eighth amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments and the fifth amendment\u2019s guarantee of due process. These arguments are without merit. In <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number><em>States v. Holmes, </em>838 F.2d 1175 (11th Cir.1988), a panel of this court rejected similar constitutional challenges to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(ii)(II), which requires a term of imprisonment of not less than five years for the possession with intent to distribute of 500 grams or more of cocaine. Applying the analysis of <em>Solem v. Helm, </em>463 U.S. 277, 292, 103 S.Ct. 3001, 3010, 77 L.Ed.2d 637 (1983), the <em>Holmes </em>panel concluded that the sentences authorized by section 841(b)(1)(B) were not disproportionate to the gravity of the offense. We cannot distinguish this case from <em>Holmes </em>in any relevant fashion. Accordingly, we hold that a prison term of five years followed by four years of supervised release for the importation of more than 500 grams of cocaine does not violate the eighth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Nor does the statutory minimum deprive the appellant of due process or equal protection. Heightened scrutiny is inappropriate because the statute does not discriminate on the basis of a suspect classification or the exercise of a fundamental right. <em>See United States v. Holmes, supra, </em>at 1177-78. Congress could rationally have concluded that the importation of large quantities of controlled substances posed a particularly great risk to the welfare of society warranting heavy sentences, regardless of the individual offender\u2019s particular position in a drug operation\u2019s hierarchy. Moreover, as explained in <em>Holmes, </em>the district court has wide discretion to sentence a defendant within a range above the statutory minimum and may take into account factors such as the role of a particular offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
