Because binding precedent of this court holds that the prisoner must exhaust those remedies, the district court did not have jurisdiction over the case. Thus, we remand the case with instructions that the district court vacate its order denying Mitchell\u2019s petition and enter an order dismissing the petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">Mississippi state authorities arrested Mitchell on state charges on December 6, 1984. Federal authorities in Alabama also wanted Mitchell, and they filed a federal detainer with the Mississippi authorities on March 20, 1985. The federal authorities subsequently took custody of Mitchell and brought him to Alabama to stand trial on the federal charges. Mitchell was convicted of the federal charges on August 22, 1985, and sentenced to fifteen years on September 25, 1985. On September 27, 1985, the federal authorities returned Mitchell to state custody in Mississippi. On November 7, 1985, the Mississippi state court sentenced Mitchell to seven years to run concurrently with the federal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-13\">On December 8,1986, Mitchell filed a pro se motion seeking credit for his jail time.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court summarily denied this motion on January 15, 1987. Mitchell now appeals this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-14\">Our decision in this case is controlled by <em>United States v. Mathis, </em>689 F.2d 1364 (11th Cir.1982). In <em>Mathis, </em>this court held that a federal district court does not have jurisdiction to entertain a federal prisoner\u2019s petition for jail time credit until the prisoner has exhausted his administrative remedies with the Attorney General under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3568.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mitchell has made no showing that he has exhausted these remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-15\">We are aware that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3568 was repealed effective November 1, 1987.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On that date, the new 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585 replaced 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3568.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Unfortunately, although the new provision still provides for credit for jail time, it does not specify who shall give such credit. However, that problem need not concern us here. On December 7, 1987, the Sentencing Act of 1987 was enacted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 2(a) of that Act amended the effective date section of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (\u00a7 235(a)(1)) to make it clear that the new 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585 applies only to crimes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>committed after November 1, 1987.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because Mitchell\u2019s crimes occurred in 1983 and 1984, we hold that the old 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3568 is still applicable to his case. Therefore, we continue to follow our holding in <em>Mathis </em>that the district could does not have jurisdiction to entertain Mitchell\u2019s petition until he has exhausted his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-4\">The case is REMANDED for the district court to vacate its order denying appellant\u2019s petition and to enter an order dismissing the petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1048-7\">. Mitchell also filed motions for reduction of sentence under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35, for pretrial transcripts at government expense, and for appointment of counsel. The district court denied all of these motions, and Mitchell has not appealed them. Mitchell does request counsel on appeal, but because of the simplicity of the issue involved, we deny the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1048-8\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3568 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-9\">The sentence of imprisonment of any person convicted of an offense shall commence to run from the date on which such person is received at the penitentiary, reformatory, or jail for service of such sentence.
