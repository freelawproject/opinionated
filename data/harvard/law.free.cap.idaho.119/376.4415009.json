Secondly, Snyder cites I.C. \u00a7 67-5101, and argues that although the State has assumed jurisdiction over motor vehicles operated on roads within Indian reservations that are maintained by the State of Idaho or a political subdivision, it does not have jurisdiction over motor vehicles operated on roads that it does not maintain.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-24\">I. STATEMENT OF FACTS/COURSE OF PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b414-25\">The factual background of this action was stipulated by the parties. On April 16, 1989, Snyder was driving his motor vehicle in the Whitebird Housing Area which is within the Nez Perce Indian Reservation near Lapwai, Idaho. The road upon which Snyder was driving is not maintained by the State, county or a political subdivision of the State of Idaho.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-26\">Snyder was initially stopped by a law enforcement officer employed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs on a possible war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>rant service. Shortly thereafter, an Idaho State Police patrolman arrived at the scene and requested that Snyder perform several standard field sobriety tests. Snyder was arrested and charged for driving under the influence in violation of I.C. \u00a7 18-8004.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">Snyder filed a motion to dismiss the charge on the grounds that the State of Idaho did not have jurisdiction to arrest and charge him with driving under the influence on a road within the reservation that is not maintained by the State. The magistrate court denied the motion and Snyder entered a conditional plea of guilty pursuant to I.C.R. 11(a)(2). On appeal the district court affirmed the magistrate\u2019s decision and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">II. THE STATE OF IDAHO HAS JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">\n<em>DUI Not a Crime Against an Indian or the Indian Populace</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Snyder argues that his crime of driving under the influence on an Indian reservation is a crime against the Indian populace and as such the State of Idaho does not have jurisdiction. We disagree and hold that a non-Indian driving under the influence of alcohol on a road within the boundaries of a reservation is not a crime against an Indian or the general Indian populace, and is subject to the jurisdiction of the State of Idaho.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">In <em>United States v. McBratney, </em>104 U.S. 621, 26 L.Ed. 869 (1882), the United States Supreme Court held that because the federal government did not specifically reserve the authority to punish an offense committed by a non-Indian against a non-Indian in Indian Country, the state of Colorado had exclusive criminal jurisdiction. This rule, now commonly referred to as the \u201cMcBratney Rule,\u201d provides that a state has jurisdiction over a crime committed in Indian Country by a non-Indian against a non-Indian for a crime which does not affect Indians, and has been repeatedly applied and affirmed. <em>United States v. Wheeler, </em>435 U.S. 313, 98 S.Ct. 1079, 55 L.Ed.2d 303 (1978); <em>New York ex rel. Ray v. Martin, </em>326 U.S. 496, 66 S.Ct. 307, 90 L.Ed. 261 (1946); <em>State v. Burrola, </em>137 Ariz. 181, 669 P.2d 614 (Ct.App.1983); <em>Ryder v. State, </em>98 N.M. 316, 648 P.2d 774 (1982); <em>Goforth v. State, </em>644 P.2d 114 (Okla.1982); <em>Vialpando v. State, </em>640 P.2d 77 (Wyo.1982); <em>United States v. Cleveland, </em>503 F.2d 1067 (9th Cir.1975); <em>State v. Griswold, </em>101 Ariz. 577, 422 P.2d 693 (1967); <em>State v. Roedl, </em>107 Utah 538, 155 P.2d 741 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">In <em>Duro v. Reina, </em>495 U.S. -, 110 S.Ct. 2053, 109 L.Ed.2d 693 (1990), the United States Supreme Court recently cited <em>United States v. McBratney </em>and noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab-\">For Indian country crimes involving only non-Indians, longstanding precedents of this Court hold that state courts have exclusive jurisdiction despite the terms of [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1152. See <em>New York ex rel. Ray v. Martin, </em>326 U.S. 496, 90 L.Ed. 261, 66 S.Ct. 307 (1946); <em>United States v. McBratney, </em>104 U.S. 621, 26 L.Ed 869 (1882).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-12\"><em>Id. </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 110 S.Ct. at 2057, 109 L.Ed.2d at 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-14\">In <em>United States v. Antelope, </em>430 U.S. 641, 97 S.Ct. 1395, 51 L.Ed.2d 701 (1977), the \u201cMcBratney Rule\u201d was further explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-15\">Not all crimes committed within Indian country are subject to federal or tribal jurisdiction, however. Under <em>United States v. McBratney, </em>104 U.S. 621, 26 L.Ed. 869 (1882), a non-Indian charged with committing crimes against other non-Indians in Indian country is subject to prosecution under state law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-16\"><em>Id. </em>at 430 U.S. 642 n. 2, 97 S.Ct. 1397 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-17\">In <em>Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe, </em>435 U.S. 191, 98 S.Ct. 1011, 55 L.Ed.2d 209 (1978), the United States Supreme Court further clarified this jurisdictional issue when it held that Indian tribes do not have inherent jurisdiction to try and to punish non-Indians for crimes committed in Indian country.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-18\">Although the United States Supreme Court has not ruled on the precise issue presented in the instant case concerning a state\u2019s jurisdiction to prosecute a non-Indian for drunken driving while on a reservation, it has been addressed by several state appellate courts. In <em>State v. Warner, </em>71 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>N.M. 418, 379 P.2d 66 (1963), the New Mexico Supreme Court was presented with the issue of whether the state had jurisdiction to try a non-Indian for driving while under the influence within the boundaries of the Navajo Indian Reservation. After the trial court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, the state appealed. In reversing the trial court the New Mexico Supreme Court stated, \u201cwe conclude that the New Mexico State Courts have jurisdiction over criminal offenses committed on an Indian reservation within this state, by non-Indians, which are not against an Indian nor involving Indian property.\u201d 379 P.2d at 68-69. Similar reasoning was applied by the Nevada Supreme Court in <em>State v. Jones, </em>92 Nev. 116, 546 P.2d 235 (1976), which reversed the district court\u2019s dismissal of charges against a non-Indian for possession of marijuana on an Indian reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">In <em>State v. Herber, </em>123 Ariz. 214, 598 P.2d 1033 (1979), the conviction of a non-Indian for possession of marijuana on an Indian reservation was upheld. In holding that the defendant was legally arrested by state officials while he was on the Indian reservation, the Arizona Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">Jurisdiction of Arizona to prosecute and punish non-Indians for crimes against non-Indians committed on an Indian reservation is beyond dispute. <em>United States v. McBratney, </em>104 U.S. 621, 26 L.Ed. 869 (1881); <em>State v. Griswold, </em>101 Ariz. 577, 422 P.2d 693 (1967); and <em>see United States v. Wheeler, </em>435 U.S. 313, 324 n. 21, 98 S.Ct. 1079, 1087 n. 21, 55 L.Ed.2d 303, 313 n. 21 (1978). Conversely, Indian tribal courts lack criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians. <em>Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe, </em>435 U.S. 191, 98 S.Ct. 1011, 55 L.Ed.2d 209 (1978). In the absence of any potential conflict of jurisdiction, we see no reason to extend the rule of <em>Francisco </em>[that the arrest of an Indian on an Indian reservation by state law enforcement officials was illegal] to preclude the arrest of a non-Indian by state law enforcement officers who have pursued him onto an Indian reservation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 598 P.2d 1035.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">In <em>State v. Thomas, </em>233 Mont. 451, 760 P.2d 96 (1988), the Montana Supreme Court was presented with the issue of whether the state had jurisdiction to prosecute a non-Indian for failure to report a traffic accident occurring on an Indian reservation. The Montana Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3U\">The difficulty here is in classifying an offense under \u00a7 61-7-108, MCA, [failing to immediately notify authorities of an accident involving injury, death, or property damage in excess of $250] as one by a non-Indian against an Indian or an Indian\u2019s property. The State argues that the offense constitutes a victimless crime because it makes the perpetrator culpable irrespective of injury to person or property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 760 P.2d 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">In holding that the state had jurisdiction to prosecute a non-Indian, the Montana Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-11\">Other courts facing inquiries concerning \u201cvictimless\u201d crimes, such as DUI or possession of marijuana, have analyzed the issue in a similar manner. <em>See State v. Warner, </em>(1963), 71 N.M. 418, 379 P.2d 66; <em>State v. Herber, </em>(App.1979), 123 Ariz. 214, 598 P.2d 1033. And one authority has explained that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-12\">\u201cUnder the logic of <em>United States v. McBratney </em>and <em>Draper v. United States, </em>victimless crimes by non-Indians appear to be subject to state jurisdiction. Those cases held that jurisdiction over crimes by non-Indians against non-Indians in Indian country rests with the state. However, their reasoning and their holdings appear broad enough to encompass non-Indian victimless offenses as well. <em>McBratney </em>concluded that the state maintained jurisdiction over all white persons on the Ute reservation and <em>Draper </em>held that the state had not been deprived of the power to punish crimes committed on a reservation \u201cby other than Indians or against Indians.\u201d In practice, victimless offenses by non-In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>dians have been treated in a number of cases as subject to state jurisdiction under <em>McBratney </em>and <em>Draper, </em>on the theory that neither Indians nor their property are affected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-4\">M.B. West, <em>Manual of Indian Criminal Jurisdiction </em>99 (1977 &amp; Supp.1982).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 760 P.2d 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">In <em>State v. Thomas, </em>the Montana Supreme Court acknowledged that federal, tribal, and state interests regarding jurisdiction for acts committed within the boundaries of an Indian reservation should be examined and considered, but held that the state\u2019s interest in traffic safety was the more compelling policy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">In determining jurisdiction for victimless crimes, we agree that federal, tribal, and state interests should be examined. <em>Burrola, </em>669 P.2d at 615. We hold here that the federal and tribal interests in providing a federal forum fail to outweigh the State\u2019s strong interest in traffic safety. Our reasoning is based on the fact that the policy of providing a federal forum where criminal prosecutions pit the interests of non-Indian offenders against Indian victims is not furthered where, as here, the connection to destruction of Indian property is only tangential to the crime charged. Under these circumstances, the State\u2019s interests in highway safety control the issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 760 P.2d 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">While it is not necessary that we determine whether driving under the influence is a \u201cvictimless\u201d crime, we expressly hold that a non-Indian driving under the influence on a road within the boundaries of a reservation is not a crime against an Indian or the general Indian populace. As such, the State of Idaho has jurisdiction to prosecute Snyder.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">It is settled beyond dispute that the state of Idaho has jurisdiction over certain acts, including the operation of motor vehicles, occurring on an Indian reservation. <em>State v. McCormack, </em>117 Idaho 1009, 793 P.2d 682 (1990); <em>State v. Michael, </em>111 Idaho 930, 729 P.2d 405 (1986). Accordingly, we hold that the State\u2019s interests in maintaining traffic safety and protecting the traveling public, Indian and non-Indian alike, controls the issue regardless of whether the motor vehicle is being operated on a road maintained by the State or a political subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-13\">Accordingly, we affirm the order denying Snyder\u2019s motion to dismiss and affirm the judgment of conviction entered pursuant to the conditional plea of guilty.</p>\n<judges id=\"b417-14\">BAKES, C.J., and McDEVITT, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b417-15\">BISTLINE, Justice,</author>\n<p id=\"ALE\">concurring in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-16\">The majority opinion holds that Idaho state courts have jurisdiction over the crime of a non-Indian driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, I.C. \u00a7 18-8004 (1987), within the boundaries of an Indian reservation on a road not maintained by the state. The majority finds two alternative bases for this jurisdiction: an extension of <em>United States v. McBratney, </em>104 U.S. 621, 26 L.Ed. 869 (1882), and a judicial expansion of I.C. \u00a7 67-5101 (1989). While <em>McBratney </em>is a proper basis for state jurisdiction, I.C. \u00a7 67-5101 is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-17\">I. <em>UNITED STATES V. MCBRATNEY </em>JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b417-18\">When determining issues of jurisdiction in Indian country one must begin with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152 (1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-19\">Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the general laws of the United States as to the punishment of offenses committed in any place within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, except the District of Columbia, shall extend to the Indian country.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-20\">This section shall not extend to offenses committed by one Indian against the person or property of another Indian, nor to any Indian committing any offense in the Indian country who has been punished by the local law of the tribe, or to any case where, by treaty stipulations, the exclusive jurisdiction over such offenses is or may be secured to the Indian tribes respectively.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>The federal government\u2019s jurisdiction over Indian country derives from its constitutional treaty-making and commerce powers, and from the judicially created theory of the federal government as trustee of the Indian people and Indian lands. Clinton, <em>Criminal Jurisdiction Over Indian Lands: A Journey Through a Jurisdictional Maze, </em>18 Ariz.L.Rev. 503, 504 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">An exception to the federal jurisdiction defined by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1152 was carved out in <em>United States v. McBratney, </em>104 U.S. 621, 26 L.Ed. 869 (1882), which held that states have jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians against non-Indians in Indian country. In creating this exception</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">[t]he Court paid scant attention to the language of section 1152, relying instead on the inherent jurisdiction exercised by the states over Indian lands within their borders as a consequence of their admission to the Union without an express disclaimer of jurisdiction. Although this logic would apply equally well to interracial or even intra-Indian crimes committed on Indian lands, the Supreme Court has applied the <em>McBratney </em>analysis only to crimes committed on Indian lands between non-Indians. Indeed, dicta in later cases suggest that the non-ward status of the accused and victim divests the federal government of any interest in .prosecution despite the occurrence of the crime in Indian country. Accordingly, <em>McBratney </em>and its progeny are expressly limited in application to crimes between non-Indians on Indian lands.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7E\">Clinton, 18 Ariz.L.Rev. at 525 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Whether states have jurisdiction over \u201cvictimless\u201d crimes committed by a non-Indian in Indian country has yet to be addressed by the United States Supreme Court. Several state courts, to which the majority has cited in today\u2019s opinion, have decided that states do have jurisdiction over these crimes. Of these, only <em>State v. Thomas, </em>233 Mont. 451, 760 P.2d 96 (1988), has offered a rationale for making the jurisdictional leap from non-Indian against non-Indian crimes to victimless crimes committed by a non-Indian: \u201cIn practice, victimless offenses by non-Indians have been treated in a number of cases as subject to state jurisdiction under <em>McBratney </em>and <em>Draper [v. United States, </em>164 U.S. 240, 17 S.Ct. 107, 41 L.Ed. 419 (1896)], on the theory that neither Indians nor their property are affected.\u201d 760 P.2d at 98 (quoting M.B. West, <em>Manual of Indian Criminal Jurisdiction </em>99 (1977 &amp; Supp.1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">The key to the <em>McBratney </em>exception to federal jurisdiction in Indian country, and the key to resolving the issue of extending <em>McBratney </em>to victimless crimes by non-Indians, is whether the principle of federal protection of Indians and tribal interests is violated by replacing federal with state jurisdiction. Thus in the present case, the pivotal question is whether allowing the state of Idaho to exercise jurisdiction over a DUI offense by a non-Indian on an Indian reservation will affect Indians, Indian property, or tribal interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">The defendant asserts that the DUI offense on the Nez Perce Indian Reservation is a crime against the general Indian populace. The purpose of the DUI statute is to protect bystanders and other drivers, as well as the intoxicated driver himself, from the intoxicated driver. The people who are primarily affected by a person driving under the influence on the reservation are the Indians who live on the reservation. In some sense then, this offense must be considered a crime by a non-Indian against Indians.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">The primary rationale for federal jurisdiction over interracial crimes in Indian country is that a local state court or jury might be prejudiced in favor of the non-Indian defendant or victim and prejudiced against the Indian defendant or victim. While this danger of prejudice is clear in a murder trial, for example, it is not so evident in a prosecution for driving under the influence. In the case of a DUI prosecution, it can be reasonably assumed that the state court or jury will approach a DUI offense committed on a reservation with the same seriousness and concern with which they would approach a DUI offense committed off a reservation. Therefore, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>the narrow instance of a non-Indian driving under the influence in Indian country, state court jurisdiction is not improper and can be taken through a limited extension of the <em>McBratney </em>holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">II. I.C. \u00a7 67-5101 JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In the concluding paragraph of its opinion the majority asserts that the state has jurisdiction over the operation of motor vehicles in Indian country on roads not maintained by the state. A quick reading of I.C. \u00a7 67-5101 shows that this is incorrect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqy\">67-5101. State jurisdiction for civil and criminal enforcement concerning certain matters arising in Indian Country. \u2014 The state of Idaho, in accordance with the provisions of 67 Statutes at Large, page 589 (Public Law 280) hereby assumes and accepts jurisdiction for the civil and criminal enforcement of state laws and regulations concerning the following matters and purposes arising in Indian country located within this state, as Indian country is defined by title 18, United States Code 1151, and obligates and binds this state to the assumption thereof:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">A. Compulsory school attendance</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">B. Juvenile delinquency and youth rehabilitation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">C. Dependent, neglected and abused children</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-9\">D. Insanities and mental illness</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-10\">E. Public assistance</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-11\">F. Domestic relations</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-12\">G. Operation and management of motor vehicles upon highways and roads <em>maintained by the county or state, or political subdivisions thereof.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-13\">(Emphasis added). Idaho\u2019s jurisdiction over the operation of motor vehicles on roads in Indian county is expressly limited to those roads maintained by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-14\">In 1953, Congress enacted Public Law 280, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1162 (1984), which empowered states to assume jurisdiction over Indian affairs by affirmative legislative action. Pursuant to P.L. 280, Idaho assumed jurisdiction over Indian affairs in certain substantive areas by the enactment of I.C. \u00a7 67-5101. In 1968, Congress passed the Indian Civil Rights Act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1321(a) (1983), which amended P.L. 280 to require formal tribal consent to the assumption of any additional state jurisdiction over Indians. In addition to the federal statute which requires tribal consent to additional state jurisdiction, Idaho itself has a statute which requires tribal consent for the assumption of additional state jurisdiction. I.C. \u00a7 67-5102 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-16\">Despite all of this, the majority opinion states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-17\">It is settled beyond dispute that the state of Idaho has jurisdiction over certain acts, including the operation of motor vehicles, occurring on an Indian reservation. <em>State v. McCormack, </em>117 Idaho 1009, 793 P.2d 682 (1990); <em>State v. Michael, </em>111 Idaho 930, 729 P.2d 405 (1986). Accordingly, we hold that the State\u2019s interests in maintaining traffic safety and protecting the travelling public, Indian and non-Indian alike, controls the issue <em>regardless of whether the motor vehicle is being operated on a road maintained by the State or a political subdivision.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARn\">Op. at 379, 807 P.2d at 58 (emphasis added). While the state does have jurisdiction over the operation of motor vehicles in Indian country on roads maintained by the state, it does not have jurisdiction over roads not maintained by the state. Neither <em>McCormack </em>nor <em>Michael </em>purport to expand jurisdiction over roads not maintained by the state. Such expansion of state jurisdiction contravenes the tribal consent requirements of the Indian Civil Rights Act and I.C. \u00a7 67-5102, and impermissibly erodes tribal sovereignty. The state legislature cannot expand state jurisdiction over Indian affairs without tribal consent \u2014 and this Court most certainly cannot do so on its own and without tribal consent, even if it believes that the state has an overriding interest in protecting the travelling public.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b419-18\">JOHNSON, Justice,</author>\n<p id=\"A5t\">concurring specially.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-19\">I concur in all of the Court\u2019s opinion, except that portion which states that the state of Idaho has jurisdiction over the operation of a motor vehicle on an Indian reservation, regardless of whether the ve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>hide is being operated on a road maintained by the state or a political subdivision.
