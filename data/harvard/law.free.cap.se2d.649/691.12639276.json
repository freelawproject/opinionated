KINSER.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this appeal, we once again address the sudden emergency doctrine and decide what, if anything, an instruction on that subject must include with regard to a defendant's evidentiary burden. Because we conclude that the circuit court did not err by giving a sudden emergency instruction that contained no reference to the defendant's evidentiary burden, we will affirm the judgment of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Toktam Vahdat filed an amended complaint in the circuit court against Anthony Wayne Holland, seeking damages for personal injuries she allegedly sustained as a result of an automobile accident. The case proceeded to a jury trial. Vahdat testified that, while driving her vehicle in the left, southbound lane of traffic, she noticed the vehicle operated by Holland following too closely behind her vehicle. According to Vahdat's testimony, Holland, while attempting to pass her by driving in the center turning lane, accelerated across the two northbound lanes of traffic and struck a utility pole. As a result, the utility pole toppled over, and the cables attached to the pole fell onto the hood of Vahdat's vehicle, damaging it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Testifying in his own defense, Holland claimed that, while accelerating after a traffic signal changed in favor of southbound traffic, he experienced a \"blackout\" from which he did not regain consciousness until after the accident. Holland denied tailgating Vahdat prior to losing consciousness. Holland testified that he was diagnosed with Type II diabetes in 1995, but that he had never experienced a \"blackout\" as a result of his condition either before or since the day of the motor vehicle accident at issue. Holland stated that, on the day of the accident, he followed his routine practice of checking his blood sugar level several times throughout the day. According to Holland, he noticed nothing unusual about his blood sugar level prior to the accident, but medical personnel attending to Holland after the collision administered\n   glucose gel as a means of correcting his low blood sugar level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the conclusion of all the evidence, each party tendered jury instructions relating to the sudden emergency doctrine. The instruction submitted by Vahdat stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendant contends that he was confronted with a sudden emergency. A sudden emergency is an event or a combination of circumstances that calls for immediate action without giving time for the deliberate exercise of judgment. Foreseeable events do not give rise to a sudden emergency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendant bears the burden of proving that, at the time of the accident, he had a diabetic blackout, and that he did not foresee such a blackout as a possibility. If you believe from the evidence that it is more likely than not that the defendant either did not have a diabetic blackout or had sufficient notice of an impending blackout so that he could have stopped the car prior to causing the accident complained of here, but did not stop the car, then the defendant was negligent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Holland's version of the sudden emergency instruction read:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant contends that he was confronted with a sudden emergency. A sudden emergency is an event or a combination of circumstances that calls for immediate action without giving time for the deliberate exercise of judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   If you believe from the evidence that the defendant, without negligence on his part, was confronted with a sudden emergency and acted as a reasonable person would have acted under the circumstances of this case, he was not negligent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Vahdat argued before the circuit court that the evidence did not support an instruction on the \"sudden emergency\" doctrine at all, but offered her own \"precautionary instruction\" on sudden emergency in case the circuit court decided one was merited. In support of her tendered instruction, Vahdat asserted that Holland, as the defendant, has the burden to prove a sudden emergency occurred at the time of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The circuit court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to warrant an instruction on the sudden emergency doctrine. The court, however, refused Vahdat's version of the sudden emergency instruction and, over Vahdat's objection, granted the one submitted by Holland. The court reasoned that a defendant does not have the burden to prove the occurrence of a sudden emergency. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Holland, upon which the circuit court entered final judgment. We awarded Vahdat this appeal limited to the question whether the circuit court erred by granting an instruction on the sudden emergency doctrine that did not include language \"imposing a burden of proof, production, or persuasion\" on Holland \"to substantiate that defense.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The sudden emergency doctrine provides that \"[w]hen the driver of an automobile, without prior negligence on his part, is confronted with a sudden emergency and acts as an ordinarily prudent person would have done under the same or similar circumstances, he is not guilty of negligence.\"\n   <em>\n    Pickett v.

Although Vahdat does not contend that the doctrine of sudden emergency is an affirmative defense, she asserts that, based on our prior case law, a defendant has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the existence of a sudden emergency.

None of these cases, however, stands for that proposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Gaines,\n   </em>\n   the trial court instructed the jury \"that[,] in order to excuse the defendant, [it] must believe from a preponderance of the evidence that [a] sudden emergency did, in fact, exist, and that the emergency was brought about through no fault of the defendant himself.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4855290\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/159/504/\">\n    159 Va. at 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=166%20S.E.%20704\">\n    166 S.E. at 711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court found no error either in that instruction or in other instructions that were challenged on appeal. It is evident, however, from the Court's opinion that the question now before us was not at issue in\n   <em>\n    Gaines.\n   </em>\n   Furthermore, the instruction did not actually state that the defendant bore the burden of proving the existence of a sudden emergency by a preponderance of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Carolina Coach,\n   </em>\n   the defendant tendered an instruction with almost identical language as the instruction in\n   <em>\n    Gaines.\n   </em>\n   In relevant part, the instruction stated that the defendant could not be held liable if the jury \"believe[d] from a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant . . . was confronted with a sudden emergency.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2133554\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/219/135/\">\n    219 Va. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   141 n. 2,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=244%20S.E.2d%20788\">\n    244 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   792 n. 2.

Thus, as in\n   <em>\n    Gaines,\n   </em>\n   the actual language of the instruction was not at issue. In other words, neither in\n   <em>\n    Gaines\n   </em>\n   nor in\n   <em>\n    Carolina Coach\n   </em>\n   did we express any opinion about whether the respective instructions were correct statements of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Finally, in\n   <em>\n    Pickett,\n   </em>\n   we held that the trial court erred by instructing the jury \"that if [it] believed from the evidence that `it is as likely as not that the left rear tire blew out,' producing without defendant's fault a sudden emergency in which he operated his car as a reasonable person would have done under the same or similar circumstances, they should find for the defendant.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"563213\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/202/60/#p63\">\n    202 Va. at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20S.E.2d%2048\">\n    116 S.E.2d at 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The fact that it was there made a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of negligence for the plaintiff. The burden was then on the defendant to produce evidence to show why it was there. His evidence was that his tire blew out, creating an emergency and causing him to lose control. If the jury could reasonably believe from his evidence that the tire did blow out and create the emergency claimed by the defendant, the burden then was on the plaintiff to show by a preponderance of the whole evidence that there was negligence on the part of the defendant which was a proximate cause of her injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20S.E.2d%2048\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This holding, like that in\n   <em>\n    Daniels,\n   </em>\n   requires a defendant only to produce evidence of a reasonable explanation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Thus, we conclude that, based on our prior cases, a defendant does not have the burden of proving the existence of a sudden emergency by a preponderance of the evidence.
