When he is employed to buy or sell goods, he is not intrusted with the custody or possession of them, and is not authorized to sell them in his own name. He is a middleman, and for some purposes is treated as the agent of both parties. Where he is employed to buy and to sell goods, it is the custom to give to the buyer a note of the sale, called a sold note, and to the seller a like note, called a bought note, in his own name, as agent of each, whereby they are respectively bound, if he has not exceeded. his authority.
