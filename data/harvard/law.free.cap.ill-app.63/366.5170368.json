It is not disputed but that her home when living with her husband was in Lake county, and had been for ten or a dozen years, but we think it was sufficiently established that after she left her husband for his alleged and proved cruelties to her, she took up a legal residence in Cook county and resided there at the time her suit was begun.</p> <p id=\"b364-13\" pgmap=\"364(31) 365(51)\">The more serious question is that concerning the allowance of seven hundred dollars alimony in gross, that was made by the decree, and the question is made a serious one because of the paucity of evidence upon the subject of the property and income possessed by the plaintiff in error, so far as the same is made to appear by the certificate of evidence that was brought before us by the transcript filed in this court in the first instance.</p> <p id=\"b365-4\" pgmap=\"365\">\u2022 By a supplemental record in the nature of an amendment to the original certificate of evidence, the trial judge certifies to us that on the hearing of the cause before him upon the question of alimony, it was stated to him in open court by the respective solicitors of both parties that \u201c there has been an agreement between solicitors for complainant and defendant that a gross sum of seven hundred (700) dollars should be allowed as alimony for complainant,\u201d</p> <p id=\"b365-5\" pgmap=\"365\">Such amendment to the original certificate of evidence was made at the February term, A. D. 1896, whereas the cause was heard and the decree entered at the November term, A. D. 1895, two terms of court having intervened between the decree and the amendment, and the point is made that upon the authority of Dougherty v. People, 118 Ill. 160, and Angus v. Backus, 58 Ill. App. 259, the amendment is not properly before us, because it does not appear that there was anything in the record from which the amendment was made, or could have been made.</p> <p id=\"b365-6\" pgmap=\"365\">We are relieved from deciding the point because of the condition in which the original record is certified to us.</p> <p id=\"b365-7\" pgmap=\"365\">The transcript originally certified to this court by the clerk of the Circuit Court is certified as being \u201c a true, perfect and complete transcript of the record prepared according to prsecipe filed January 16, 1896, except Exhibit \u2018 A \u2019 to answer.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b365-8\" pgmap=\"365\">The prsecipe referred to in such certificate by the clerk is signed by counsel for plaintiff in error, and directs the clerk to prepare a transcript of the record of the case \u201c and insert the following papers:</p> <blockquote id=\"b365-9\" pgmap=\"365\">1st. Bill.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b365-10\" pgmap=\"365\">2d. Answer.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b365-11\" pgmap=\"365\">3d. Certificate of evidence.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b365-12\" pgmap=\"365\">4th. Decree.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b366-4\" pgmap=\"366\">It has been many times decided that a record so certified is not a complete one, and is insufficient to justify the reversal of the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. Springer v. Maddock, 59 Ill. App. 40; Tolman v. Wheeler, 57 Ill. 342, and cases there cited.</p> <p id=\"b366-5\" pgmap=\"366\">But looking back into the record to see what it is that by the certificate of the clerk is expressly excepted from his copy of the answer, we find, by an inspection of the answer, that Exhibit \u201cA\u201d therein referred to and stated as being attached to and made a part of the answer, is what is stated in the answer to have been an agreement \u201c entered into between the parties as an adjustment of their property rights,\u201d and is what was alleged in the bill of complaint to be an agreement entered into between the parties settling their respective property rights, and which had been fraudulently procured by the plaintiff in error from the cashier of a certain bank, with whom it had been left by the parties to hold until plaintiff in error should pay a certain sum of money to the defendant in error.</p> <p id=\"b366-6\" pgmap=\"366\">Lengthy argument would not make it any plainer than the statement that has been made, that the paper filed, Exhibit \u201cA,\u201d which is omitted from the record, may, quite probably\u2014in fact, and in law must\u2014be presumed to have afforded sufficient evidence to support that part of the decree concerning alimony.</p> <p id=\"b366-7\" pgmap=\"366\">It therefore becomes unnecessary to decide whether or not the supplemental or amended record is entitled to be considered by us, for the decree must be affirmed entirely irrespective of the fact thereby certified to us, upon the ground that, in the absence of what purports to be a complete record, the presumption exists, and must control, that the omitted parts of the record furnish sufficient grounds to support the decree.</p> <p id=\"b366-8\" pgmap=\"366\">The decree of the Circuit Court is therefore in all respects affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
