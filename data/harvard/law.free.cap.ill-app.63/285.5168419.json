If either is wanting, the whole proceeding is coram non judice. Miller v. Glasson, 14 Ill. App. 177; Johnson v. Johnson, 30 Ill. 215; Campbell v. McCahan, 41 Ill. 45; Sercomb v. Catlin, 128 Ill. 556.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-8\" pgmap=\"281\">The special appearance on the part of the respondents and answer filed by their attorneys gave the court no jurisdiction\", for a special appearance denying the jurisdiction of the court does not confer jurisdiction where none existed. Graves v. Whitney, 49 Ill. App. 435.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-9\" pgmap=\"281\">The court had no jurisdiction to enter the order compelling the non-resident officers of the defendant corporation to come to Chicago and testify. The statute requires that a subpoena should be issued by the commissioner before whom a cause is pending, and that the witnesses should be tendered their proper fees and expenses, before they are bound to appear and testify. Chapter 51, R. S., Secs. 36, 37.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-10\" pgmap=\"281\">In the absence of the requirements of the statutes, they are not bound to appear, and on their failure so to do they will not be punished for contempt of court.
