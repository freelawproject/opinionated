The bill alleges that the defendant is a corporation, a collection agency; that Geo. W.

W. Cole was killed by the cable cars, October 29, 1895, and complainant and defendants Cole are his sole heirs and representatives, and have no experience in the business, and pray that a receiver be appointed to take charge of the business.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-10\" pgmap=\"448\">O.

Cole, the said Bankers &amp; Merchants\u2019 Association ceased to do the business for which it was organized, within the terms of section 25 of the statute entitled \u201c Corporations,\u201d and that it is for the best int\u00e9rests of the creditors that the receiver heretofore appointed be continued in said receivership.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-4\" pgmap=\"449\">It is further ordered, however, that said receiver do not proceed to wind up or dissolve said Bankers &amp; Merchants\u2019 Association, but shall carry on the same as heretofore, until such time as the contest over the alleged will of George W.
