It was his duty as such to make return of the execution within the time fixed by statute. It has been repeatedly held by our courts that every public officer is presumed to have done his duty, and this until the contrary is clearly established. Conwell v. Watkins, 71 Ill. 488; The People ex rel. v. Newberry, 82 Ill. 41; Hertig v.

No part paid or satisfied.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b425-7\" pgmap=\"425\">A. H. Gully, Constable.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b425-8\" pgmap=\"425\">There was nothing to show when this return was made, other than what the plaintiff claimed to be evidence that it had not been made May 19, 1894. This claim of the plaintiff was based upon the following transcript:</p> <blockquote id=\"b425-9\" pgmap=\"425\">\u201c J. A. Gipsen ] vs. ' &gt; J. F. Wilson, j</blockquote> <p id=\"b425-11\" pgmap=\"425\">It is considered by the court that said plaintiff have and recover of the said defendant seventy-five dollars and costs of suit, and judgment ordered and entered therefor. Execution ordered and issued to Constable McCuddy, and returned by him September 9, 1893, no property found and no part satisfied. Alias execution ordered and issued to Constable McCuddy, September 21, 1893, and returned by him indorsed \u201c No property found and no part satisfied, on the 9th day of September, 1893; November 24, 1893, alias execution ordered and issued to constable. (Plaintiff\u2019s attorney.)</p> <blockquote id=\"b425-12\" pgmap=\"425\">(Last execution not returned to court.) Certificate dated the 19th day of May, 3894. [Seal] John C. Evebett, Justice of the Peace.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b425-16\" pgmap=\"425\">While the statute required the justice to make a written memorandum of all process issued and returned, it did not require that' he make any record or certify or include in a transcript anything concerning a failure to return process; and there is no statute making a certificate or transcript by him evidence of what process has not been returned.</p> <p id=\"b426-5\" pgmap=\"426\">The extra-judicial certificate of the justice, in this regard, was not evidence, more especially, against persons who were not parties to the cause, of the proceedings in which the transcript was made.</p> <p id=\"b426-6\" pgmap=\"426\">The judgment of the County Court is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
