That is its policy and the policy of our law. It has been held that the clause of the Federal constitution prohibiting the enactment of ex post facto laws applies to the by-law of a corporation. People v. Fire Department, 31 Mich. 458; Howard v. Savannah, T. U. P. Charlt. (G. A.), 173.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-7\" pgmap=\"444\">The right of counsel in a civil suit has never been denied. To allow such has always been the policy of the law. To prohibit a party appearing by proper counsel has always been deemed an error sufficient to reverse a cause. And no doubt, where no right of appeal lay from the judgment to be rendered on a trial held by an inferior court, a refusal to allow proper counsel to appear for a party would be sufficient cause to justify the interference of a court of superior jurisdiction. See Gebhard v. New York Club, 21 Abb. N. C. 252; In re Monckton, 3 Notes of Cases, Ecclesiastical Supp. 62; 2 Stephens\u2019 Law of Clergy, 977 (Ed. 1848); Murdock v. Phillips Academy, 12 Pick.

L. 457.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-9\" pgmap=\"444\">A by-law made in pursuance of an express power to make such laws, if contrary to the common law, or to a legal enactment, is void. Every by-law must be reasonable and lawful. State v. Union Merchants\u2019 Exchange, 2 Mo. App. 96.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-10\" pgmap=\"444\">The power to enact by-laws is limited by the nature of the corporation and the laws of the country. It can make no rule which is contrary to law, good morals, or public policy. Sayre v. Louisville, etc., Asso., 1 Duval (Ky.) 143; S. C., 83 Am. Dec. 613.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-3\" pgmap=\"445\">A by-law must not be contrary to a policy of the law. Goddard v. Merchants\u2019 Exchange, 9 Mo.

Tailors, etc., Union, 75 Cal. 308.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-7\" pgmap=\"445\">Courts of chancery have supervision and control of all unincorporated societies or associations. With respect to them they have the power of prevention of acts contrary to law and prejudicial to the interests of the community or the rights of individuals, and can afford specific relief where a recovery in damages would be an inadequate remedy for the wrong.

Harlow v. Dehon, 111 Mass. 195; 1 Thompson on Corp., Sec. 913.</p><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-5\" pgmap=\"446\">A court of chancery can not enj'oin the mayor and aldermen of a city from removing a party from office, because the remedy is complete at law, by mandamus after removal, to restore to office. Delehanty v. Warner, 75 Ill. 185.</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-6\" pgmap=\"446\">A member of the Board of Trade can not repudiate or complain of the judgment rendered by a tribunal of his own choosing, and under rules by which he pledged himself to abide. Pitcher v. Board of Trade, 121 Ill. 412.</p><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-7\" pgmap=\"446\">After trial a court of law can not, by mandamus, interfere with the disciplinary powers of the Board of Trade over its members. People ex rel. Rice v. Board of Trade, 80 Ill. 134.</p><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-8\" pgmap=\"446\">How far the courts can interfere after a hearing with the exercise of the disciplinary powers of the Board of Trade over its members, has been the subject of controversy, but even in such case it has been uniformly held by our Supreme Court that chancery has no jurisdiction. Fisher v. Board of Trade, 80 Ill. 85.</p> <opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b446-9\" pgmap=\"446\">Mr. Justice Waterman</author> <p id=\"Aor\" pgmap=\"446\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p> <p id=\"b446-10\" pgmap=\"446\">This proceeding is in effect to restrain the appellee from proceeding to try a member whom it is alleged has violated the law of such board. It is not claimed that the board is about to try appellant in a manner not in accordance with its rules and regulations. It is the rules themselves of which appellant complains.</p> <p id=\"b446-11\" pgmap=\"446\">Appellant, of his own free will and accord, became a member of the board; voluntarily agreed to be bound by its laws, of which he now complains. If its regulations for the trial of alleged offenders are, as he urges, oppressive and unjust, he might have avoided the effect of such tyranny by keeping outside its fold, as do the great mass of merchants and traders in the city of which he is a citizen.</p> <p id=\"b446-12\" pgmap=\"446(18) 447(20)\">Appellant complains that three members of the directory having, in accordance with the rules of the board, invest\u00edgated complaints against him, have preferred charges, and are themselves to sit, with others, among the number of his judges.</p> <p id=\"b447-4\" pgmap=\"447\">As to such proceeding, appellant cites the case of People v. McCoy, 20 Ch. Legal News, 151; 37 Albany, L. J. 131, in Avhich it was said: \u201c It can not be tolerated that among a free people, a board, combining within themselves the functions of accuser, prosecutor, judge and jury, should exercise such power.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b447-6\" pgmap=\"447\">The quoted declaration was not made as to a trial of one who had voluntarily become and was a member of a society in accordance Avith whose rules he was about to be tried.</p> <p id=\"b447-7\" pgmap=\"447\">Appellant is entitled to a fair trial, to one whose proceedings are not repugnant to natural justice; but we do not think that this includes a right to be defended by counsel. Whatever may be the right in this regard of an accused in an ecclesiastical court or in one of the common tribunals of the land, we see no reason for holding that the by-law of the Board of Trade, denying the privilege of defense by counsel, is invalid.</p> <p id=\"b447-8\" pgmap=\"447\">Whether appellant will or will not receive by the directors of the Board of Trade a fair trial, as likewise the effect of such trial, can not be known in advance.</p> <p id=\"b447-9\" pgmap=\"447\">The result of the allowance of injunctions such as was sought in this case, would be to transfer to the chancery court the trial of alleged offenses against the rules of clubs, churches, and societies in which the membership had pecuniary value, and the complaining member charged that he could not receive a fair trial in such organization.</p> <p id=\"b447-10\" pgmap=\"447\">We regard the case of Sturges v. Board of Trade, 86 Ill. 441, and Baxter v. Board of Trade, 83 Ill. 146, as decisive of this.</p> <p id=\"b447-11\" pgmap=\"447\">The decree of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
