Track-Laying\u2014-Permit a Prerequisite. Be it ordained by the city council of the city of Chicago. Sec. 1. Hereafter it shall not be lawful for any person or corporation to lay any railroad track or tracks in or upon any of the streets, avenues, alleys or other public places within the city of Chicago, without first procuring a permit, in writing, therefor, from the commissioner of public works.</p> <p id=\"b468-6\" pgmap=\"468\">2090. Permit\u2014How Issued\u2014Contents\u2014Fee. Par. 2. Such permit shall be issued by the commissioner of public works in accordance with the terms of the respective ordinances under which the said tracks may be authorized to be laid, and shall specify in full the terms and conditions under which the same shall be constructed. For every such permit there shall be paid to the city the cost of issuing the same and the expense of causing the construction under said permit, to be superintended by the department of public works.</p> <p id=\"b468-7\" pgmap=\"468\">2091. Penal Clause. Par. 3. Any person or corporation laying any track or tracks in violation of this ordinance, or without complying with the terms of the permit herein required, shall be subject to a fine of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than two hundred dollars, and to a further fine of one hundred dollars a day for every day any such track or tracks shall remain in any such street, avenue, alley, or other public place, where the same shall have been laid without said permit or in violation of the terms thereof.</p> <p id=\"b468-8\" pgmap=\"468(78) 469(55)\">And your orator further shows unto your honors that before the filing of this bill it caused application to be made to said West Chicago Street Railroad Company to desist from its aforesaid wrongful encroachment upon the right of way, franchises, privileges, licenses and property of your orator, and to remove said track from said right of way; and also caused notice to be given to West Chicago Street Railroad Company that your orator desires forthwith to proceed with the building and construction of said second track along the southerly half of its said right of way, but said West Chicago Street Railroad Company wholly neglected and refused so to remove its said track and cease the obstruction, occupancy and use thereby caused of the right of way of your orator.</p> <p id=\"b469-4\" pgmap=\"469\">And your orator further shows unto your honors that it has also caused application to be made to the department of public works of the said city of Chicago, for information of the right or pretense under which said pretended permit was issued to said West Chicago Street Railroad Company; and your orator thereupon demanded of said department that said pretended permit be wholly revoked and annulled and that said department do take immediate measures to cause the removal of said track from the right of way of your orator, but said department of public works did not nor would in anywise comply with that request of your orator, but wholly neglected and refused so to do.</p> <p id=\"b469-5\" pgmap=\"469\">Wherefore, and because your orator is without remedy by the strict rules of the common law, and can only obtain adequate relief in this honorable court of equity, it prajTs that said West Chicago Street Eailroad Company may be duly summoned to appear and answer this bill of complaint, and all and singular the matters and things herein contained, but not under oath or seal, its answer under such oath and seal being hereby expressly waived.</p> <p id=\"b469-6\" pgmap=\"469(129) 470(66)\">And your orator further prays that upon the hearing of this cause, it may be ordered, adjudged and decreed by the court that said pretended permit to said West Chicago Street Railroad Company was and is wholly void and of no force and effect; and that the said West Chicago Street Railroad Company has not any right or authority to enter upon, use or occupy any part of the right of way so as aforesaid granted to your orator; and said West Chicago Street Railroad Company has not any right or authority to lay down any such track as has been constructed by it upon said right of w&amp;y of your orator; and that said West Chicago Street Railroad Company shall, within some shoit fine, to be fixed by the court, wholly take up and remove its said track from the right of way of your orator; and that said West Chicago Street Railroad Company do also wholly desist and abstain from all and any future obstruction or any interference with your orator\u2019s said right of way, and the construction of its said railway tracks, and the transportation of passengers in railway cars thereon.</p> <p id=\"b470-5\" pgmap=\"470\">And your orator further prays that if occasion shall require at any time during the pendency of this suit, or at the conclusion of the same, your orator may have and obtain, upon the proper application, the proper order and writ of injunction to enjoin and restrain the said West Chicago Street Railroad Company from its aforesaid encroachment upon the right of way of your orator; and that your orator may have all such further or other relief as the nature of the case may require and equity and good conscience approve,\u201d etc.</p> <p id=\"b470-6\" pgmap=\"470\">The plat, \u201c Exhibit B,\u201d attached to the bill, shows what the bill states that it shows.</p> <p id=\"b470-7\" pgmap=\"470\">This is not a case in which the court is asked to enjoin or remove additional facilities for travel in a street, but to remove impediments to travel. If the bill be true, the plaintiff in error had the right to continue its double track upon the street \u2014 a right which the defendant in error has, without right, at least seriously impaired.</p> <p id=\"b470-8\" pgmap=\"470\">Property in a street railway is entitled to protection against wrong doing to the same extent as other property. Central City Ry. v. Ft. Clark Ry., 81 Ill. 523.</p> <p id=\"b470-9\" pgmap=\"470\">One hundred and eighty feet of track, connecting with nothing at either end, does not come within the principle of Phelps v. Lake Street Elevated R. R., 60 Ill. App. 471.</p> <p id=\"b470-10\" pgmap=\"470\">The demurrer was wrongly sustained. On the face of the bill the acts of the defendant in error would seem to have been for the purpose of preventing the plaintiff in error from the exercise of its rights.</p> <p id=\"b470-11\" pgmap=\"470\">The decree sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the bill is reversed, and the cause remanded, with directions to overrule the demurrer.</p> <p id=\"b471-3\" pgmap=\"471\">Mr. Justice Waterman.</p> <p id=\"b471-4\" pgmap=\"471\">Neither of the contending street railways have, merely for their own accommodation, profit or pleasure, any right to lay tracks in the public streets. The privilege in this regard given to them is for the accommodation and benefit of the public, and their undertaking to serve it.</p> <p id=\"b471-5\" pgmap=\"471\">Each corporation is bound to exercise its right to place and maintain railway tracks in such manner that the same shall be an accommodation to the public, and shall not unnecessarily interfere with its right of passage.</p> <p id=\"b471-6\" pgmap=\"471\">Where there has been given to two corporations the right to place rails in and use the same street, each is bound to place its rails and use the street in such manner that the public may have the benefit which can be derived from such joint use.</p> <p id=\"b471-7\" pgmap=\"471\">Neither can be permitted to unnecessarily interfere with the right of the other.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
