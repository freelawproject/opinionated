Appellee then filed a similiter. The cause was subsequently, by agreement of the parties, submitted to the court and tried (without a jury) before one of the judges of said Circuit Court, who, after hearing the evidence and the arguments of counsel, found the issues for appellee, assessed its damages at $739.40, and, after overruling appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial, rendered judgment in favor of appellee and against appellant for said sum of $739.40, to reverse which judgment this case is now presented to this court on appeal.</p><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b17-9\" pgmap=\"17\">Richards &amp; Addington, attorneys for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b17-10\" pgmap=\"17\">Alfred D.
