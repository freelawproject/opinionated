Ambiguities\u2014Latent, Appearing in Instruments.\u2014Where a latent ambiguity appears in a certificate of a fraternal beneficiary association as to the beneficiary intended, and an attempt is made to identify such beneficiary, the testimony of the person who drew the application for membership in such association is admissible to show the circumstances under which the certificate was made, but testimony as to what the deceased member, after the making of the certificate, said as to his intentions is not.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-8\" pgmap=\"381\">Bill of Interpleader.\u2014Appeal from the Superior Court of Cook County; the Hon.

Hogan, and the appellee, l\u00edate Hogan Wallace.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-6\" pgmap=\"382\">The complainant is a fraternal and benevolent organization, the object of which is \u201c to give charitable and moral aid to its members,' and to secure pecuniary aid to the widows, orphans, heirs and devisees of deceased members of said order.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-7\" pgmap=\"382\">On August 6, 1884, it issued its certain benefit certificate in the sum of $1,000 to one Michael Hogan, now deceased, said sum being payable at his death to \u201c Mrs. Kate Hogan, his wife.\u201d In 1872, Michael Hogan married the appellant, Ellen B. Hogan, who lived with him continuously as his wife from that date until his death in February, lb95. Six children were born of that marriage, one of whom is dead, and five of whom are now living with appellant.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-8\" pgmap=\"382\">Kate Hogan Wallace is a sister of the said Michael Hogan, deceased. She was married to her husband, James Wallace, in 1878, six years before the issuance of the certificate in question. She has lived with him as his wife from that date to the present time. She has never lived with Michael Hogan since her marriage. She was never dependent upon him. Mr. Wallace has always supported his family, and he is now living.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-9\" pgmap=\"382\">Kate Wallace styles herself Kate Hogan Wallace, and claims to be the beneficiary intended to be named in \u2022 the certificate.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-10\" pgmap=\"382\">It appears that a written application was made by Michael Hogan for the insurance. He signed that application by his mark, and Mrs. Wallace testifies that he could neither read nor write. The application referred to contains a direction that all benefit be paid to \u201cKate Hogan, related to me as wife, subject to my future disposal of the benefit to my widow, orphans, heirs or devisees, as I may hereafter direct, in compliance with the laws of the order.\u201d It also bears the indorsement, \u201c Pay to Katie Hogan, wife.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-11\" pgmap=\"382(9) 383(64)\">Dr. James Lawless, a witness for Mrs. Wallace, testified that the application is in his handwriting; that he filled it out at Michael Hogan\u2019s dictation; that witness then asked him to whom he wished the benefit payable, and he said, \u201c Kate Hogan;\u201d that he asked him if that was his wife\u2019s name, and he did not answer, so that the witness \u201c supposed it was his wife,\u201d and so described her.</p><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b383-4\" pgmap=\"383\">Stillman &amp; Martyn, attorneys for appellant,</attorneys><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxM\" pgmap=\"383\">contended that in construing ariinsurance policy it should be treated, as far as possible, as a will.

Decker v. Decker, 121 Ill. 341-350; Harris v. The Bishop of Lincoln, 2 P. Wms. 137; Thomas v. Thomas, 6 T. R. 671.</p> <p id=\"b384-9\" pgmap=\"384\">The testimony as to what the deceased, after the making of the certificate, said he had intended and promised was improperly received. The question before the court was, to whom did Michael Hogan, when he made application for the certificate, intend it should be made payable; not what he intended or said the next day or year; or what he promised his son or his wife. His intentions, afterward, may have been very different from what they were when he obtained the certificate.</p> <p id=\"b384-10\" pgmap=\"384\">It is highly improbable that Michael Hogan can, when directing that the certificate be made payable to Kate Hogan, have thought that he had directed that it be paid to Mrs. Ellen Hogan, his wife.</p> <p id=\"b384-11\" pgmap=\"384\">Hogan being unable to read or write, the testimony of Dr. Lawless, by whom the certificate was written, shows how the mistake occurred.</p> <p id=\"b385-3\" pgmap=\"385\">From this testimony it appears that Michael Hogan did not mention his wife, or say anything concerning her when the certificate was written; bub that, after directing that it be made payable to Kate Hogan, in answer to the question, \u201cWell, is that your wife? \u201d he again said \u201cKate Hogan,\u201d and Doctor Lawless, supposing that was the name of Michael\u2019s wife, wrote \u201c Mrs. Kate Hogan, his wife.\u201d It also appears that at the time the certificate was made, he was indebted to his sister, Kate Hogan, in the sum of \u00a71,000.</p> <p id=\"b385-4\" pgmap=\"385\">The reservation in the certificate, \u201c subject to my future disposal of the benefit to my Avidow, * * * as I may hereafter direct,\u201d indicates that Michael Hogan did not then think that he had directed payment to be made to his Avife.</p> <p id=\"b385-5\" pgmap=\"385\">From the circumstances surrounding the making of the certificate, Ave think that the chancellor rightly found that the words \u201c Kate Hogan \u201d correctly described the person to whom it was by Michael intended the insurance should be, and to whom it Avas, made payable, and the words \u201c his wife \u201d are to be rejected.</p> <p id=\"b385-6\" pgmap=\"385\">Kate Hogan then Avas a possible heir of her brother, Michael, and the one to whom the certificate was, by his designation, made payable; this is all the charter in this regard required.</p> <p id=\"b385-7\" pgmap=\"385\">The decree of the Superior Court directing the payment of the insurance to Kate Hogan Wallace is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
