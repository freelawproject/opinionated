The plaintiff declared, \u201c for that, whereas, the said Andrew, on the 12th day of August, 1816, at &amp;c. made his certain promissory note in writing, bearing date the day and year aforesaid, and thereby then and there promised to pay said H.

The cases cited shew that such averment is unnecessary. In cases of this kind, the plaintiff is never put to prove how he came into possession of the note: why then should he be held to aver it ?
