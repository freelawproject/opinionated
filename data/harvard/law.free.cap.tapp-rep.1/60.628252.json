The general principle of law, that a man cannot be a witness for himself, has, in this State, a single exception by virtue of this statute. I am not willing to extend this statute, by construction, beyond the letter of it. The defendant must first produce a book account; what this is, is a question for the court to determine. When the book is produced, if any items of not more than eighteen months\u2019 standing are contested, then the party may be sworn and examined touching the validity of such account; he cannot be examined to any other facts in the case. The paper offered does not appear to be part of the book. Make it so, by disinterested testimony; then, and not until then, can you offer it in evidence.\u2014 Rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
