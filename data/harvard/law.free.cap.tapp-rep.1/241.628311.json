If the delay can be accounted for, if the defendant has merits, and will be content to pay costs including a jury fee, we will hear an application ; but this motion, unsupported by affidavit of any kind, must be denied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-14\">Harris stated that his client was not in court, so that it was not in his power to file affidavit instantly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-15\">President. \u2014 The inquiry must proceed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b237-16\">Goodenow for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnP\">The action was brought on an appearance hail bond against the bail. It appeared in evidence that, in the suit against the principal, the plaintiff proceeded to judgment and execution, and that the execution, a <em>Ca sa, </em>was returned by the sheriff, that <em>\u201c </em>he had taken the body of the defendant named therein, and had discharged him by order of tbe plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b237-17\">President.</author>\n<p id=\"AFo\">Filing a declaration in tbe original suit was a waiver</p>\n<p id=\"A0p\">of bail, and might have been placed in bar of tbis action; so the discharge of the principal, when taken on a <em>ca sa </em>issued on the judgment obtained in the suit to compel an appearance, in which this bond was .taken, is a discharge of the demand secured by it. It is evident, therefore, that the plaintiff ought not to recover, and could not recover, had not the defendant neglected making any defence, and by his default left tbe question to be how much, and not whether any, damages. The verdict ought to be for mere nominal damages. Verdict for 6 cents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
