The plea denies the execution of the note, and\u2019is notice to the plaintiff to come prepared on that point \u2014 but it is no notice whatever, to him, that you intend to prove a payment. If your payment is within either branch of the notice of set-off, proceed with the evidence of it; if it is not, it cannot be received.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-21\">Yerdict for plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
