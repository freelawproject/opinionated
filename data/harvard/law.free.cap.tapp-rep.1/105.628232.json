The witness answered, that it was all written by himself, then read over to Stiers, and by him signed and sworn to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-13\">Harper then objected to the putting of any questions to the witness, concerning the matter of that complaint; and insisted that he was bound to produce it, if he wished to shew a variance between the testimony of Stiers before the magistrate, and here in court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-14\">Herrick, admitting that the question could not be put on an examination in chief, contended that it was proper, on a cross examination, to draw from the -witness the contents of any writing like this in possession of the witness at a distance from court, previously unknown to the defendant, and wholly out of his power to produce.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b101-15\">President.</author>\n<p id=\"AHl\">The complaint sworn to by Stiers, the witness before the magistrate, was the first step in this proceeding against Lent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Upon complaint made on oath, a warrant issues; the complaint is a judicial proceeding; any person has a right to have a copy of it, and to have such copy certified by the magistrate. It is, therefore, in the power of every man. A copy, so certified, would be received as evidence in this court. It can no more be proven by parole, than the records of courts can be. And as to this, there is no distinction between an examination in chief and a cross examination, for in neither may illegal evidence be given. *</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">There can be no surprize here, upon the defendant; he must have known that a complaint was made; he must have heard it on his examination; there is not, therefore, any reason for admitting this evidence.- \u2014 -Verdict, guilty.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
