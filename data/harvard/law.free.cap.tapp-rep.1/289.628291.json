The defendant covenanted \u201c to use the utmost of his endeavors to teach and instruct the said apprentice or cause him to be instructed, in the trade of a wheel wright and Windsor chair maker, and procure for him sufficient meat and drink, and find him washing, lodging and mending, two linen shirts and two pairs of browsers, one pair of shoes, and one pair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>soc^s ea\u00b0h aia(l every year, during the said term, and one pair 0f ijngey trowsers each year, and send said apprentice three months to school any time in the said \u00a3ernij sci1ooling to be all together.\u201d Signed, \u201cWalter Francis\u201d and seal. \u201cJas. W. Thompson\u201d and seal. \u201cConsented to by John Francis.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-5\">The breach assigned was, \u201c that the defendant did not use the utmost of his endeavors to teach and instruct, or cause the plaintiff to be instructed, in the trade and mystery of a wheel wright and Windsor chair maker; but on the contrary thereof], caused, &amp;c. the plaintiff to be generally, principally, and almost entirely, to be employod in labour for the defendant at agricultural pursuits and other labour and business of the defendant, having no relation or connection with said trade, to wit, for the space of two years in the term,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-6\">The defendant demurred to the declaration specially. 1st. For \u201c that there is no clause or covenant in the said indenture that the said James should at least cause the said Walter to be taught and instructed to read and write.\u201d 2d. That the age of the said Walter is not inserted in said indenture. 3d. That said Indenture was and is void in law.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b286-7\">Wright, in support of the demurrer,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Asz3\">contended that the statute law made it necessary that the age of the apprentice should be inserted in the indenture, and also that there should be a covenant, on the part of the master, that the appi entice should at least be taught to read and write \u2014 that the indenture is void in law, being a deed under seal of an infant \u2014 that an infant could only be bound apprentice by a parent, guardian, or overseer of the poor. To prove that the indenture was void, he cited 2d Bl. Rep. 1133, 2d Salk. 675, 1 H. Bl. Rep. 75, and 1st Johns. Gas. 127.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b286-8\">Beebe and Hammond, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqJl\">that the bond of \"an infant was voidable only \u2014 cited 1st Johns. Cas. 127. That infancy was a personal privilege, of which the party only can avail himself, 2d John. 279, 5th John. 160.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b286-9\">President.</author>\n<p id=\"ApYJ\">The first objection to this indenture is, that the defendant did not covenant that the plaintiff should be taught to read and write. After the plaintiff has served the defendant three years, the latter claims to be released from <em>all </em>his covenants, because they were not as onerous upon him as they ought to have been; this is a most knavish objection, one that can receive no support from the law, or countenance in a court of justice. The \u201cact concerning apprentices and servants,\u201d section 1st, enacts, \u201c that all indentures made by. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>overseers of tbe poor, by and with the consent of a justice of the peace in any township in this state, or by any parents or guardians for binding or putting out any child as an apprentice or servant, shall, among the covenants in such indenture made and agreed upon between the parties, always have a clause to the following effect, that every master or mistress to whom such child shall be bound as aforesaid, shall at least cause such child to be taught and instructed to read and write.\u201d If this direction of the statute is not observed, the minor, who is injured by the omission of such covenant, may perhaps avoid, on that account, the obligation of the covenant on his part, to serve. The statute does not, indeed, determine what effect such omission shall have upon the indenture; it does not say that it shall, in such case, be void, or voidable. If it is voidable, it can only be so at the instance of the party injured; and when the contract is executed on the part of the minor, he is entitled to damages for all the covenants which have been broken on the part of the master. It does not appear on this record, that the plaintiff was a minor at the time of executing this indenture. It may be conjectured that he was, from the circumstance of his binding himself \u201cby and with the consent of his father,\u201d and from his father having signed his consent subjoined to the indenture \u2014 but this is not conclusive, or even preponderating evidence, of such fact; and, as we cannot assume any facts not stated, the demurrer must fail altogether. But if this difficulty was obviated, the second cause of demurrer would stand on the same principle as the first: the same section of the statute directs, that \u201c the age of the person so bound, shall be inserted in the indenture,\u201d &amp;c. That there may be no question as to when he is free, it should be inserted for the benefit of the minor; but the omission does not make the indenture either void in law, or voidable at the instance of the master. Admitting that the plaintiff was an infant at the time of executing this indenture, it does not follow \u201cthat the indenture was and is void in law\u201d \u2014 for \u201can infant may maintain covenant upon mutual covenants though he himself is not bound by his covenant on the other part,\u201d 3 Com. Dig. 618 \u2014 \u201c <em>A fortiori </em>where the money or consideration on the part of the infant is paid, and the consideration executed,\u201d ib. The bond of an infant is voidable only, 1 Johns. Cas. 12\", and infancy is a personal privilege, of which the party alone can avail himself, 2d Johns. 279, 5 Johns. 160, 2d. Hen. Black. 511. The question, what acts of infants are void and what voidable only, was very ably discussed by Lord Mansfield in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>case of Zouch vs. Parsons, 3 Burr. 1794, 1 Black. 575. qq,e as laid down by Perkins, section 12, that \u201call such gifts, grants, or deeds, made by infants, which do not take effect by delivery of his hand, are void; but all gifts, grants or deeds made by infants, by matter in deed or in writing, which do not take effect by delivery of his hand, are voidable by himself, by his heirs, and by those who have his estate \u201d is recognised as the correct doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">The privilege of infants is intended for their protection; that is the object which must be kept in view in all cases. The defendant here, is not setting up this objection to the indenture as a protection to the plaintiff, but as a fraud upon him; now there is not any case to be found, where the other party to a deed has avoided it on the ground of infancy; it is very certain that it cannot be done. <em>Demurrer overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
