Harrison, fecit,\u201d </em>which wag omitted in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-21\">President. \u2014 The note offered in evidence, must agree in words and figures, with the indictment, and in that every part of the no te must be described; there are many things on a bank note, which are not considered as parts of the note, requiring to be thus described, such as the vignette, and the ornaments usually printed on the ends of such notes; the note is complete, as an obligation, without them; so the engraver\u2019s name is no part of the note, and the omitting to describe it, does not, for that reason, occasion a variance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
