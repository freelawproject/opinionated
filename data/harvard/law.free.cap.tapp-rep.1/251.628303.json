The magistrate then went into an examination of witnesses, and, \u201cafter hearing the proofs and allegations of both parties, was of opinion that there was no ground for binding the parties over to court; therefore, judgment rendered against John Woodburn, the prosecuting witness, for the cost of suit.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-11\">On this judgment, an execution was issued to the defendant Bruce, and the plaintiff\u2019s cow was taken and sold.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AMrI\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by the</p>\n<author id=\"A8m\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>President.</author>\n<p id=\"Ao-\">Justices of the peace had not the power of awarding a judgment for costs in any criminal proceeding, by the common law. Whenever they have ^hat p0werj y\u00a1 js given them expressly, by statute. Our statute law allows justices, constables and witnesses, certain fees in criminal cases, but no where authorizes a justice to render a judgment, or issue an execution for such fees; so that the proceedings against Woodburn, for the cost of his complaint, were void. Where application for sureties of the peace, appears to be malicious and groundless, the parties making such application, have been ordered to pay the costs of it; such orders may be enforced by attachment, but a judgment cannot be awarded against one who is no party on the record; if) therefore, the justice had jurisdiction to order the payment of costs by the complainant, a judgment and execution for them, was illegal \u2014 the case is considered as though all these matters of defence were specially pleaded; they would, in that way, clearly be no sufficient justification. Judgment is, therefore, given for the plaintiff, for the agreed value of his cow.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
