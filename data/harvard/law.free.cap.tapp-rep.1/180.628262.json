Nothing is said, in the note, about interest; and the question is, whether this is a fatal variance in the description of the note. It is urged that the words, <em>with </em>interest, maybe rejected as surplussage; but it must be recollected, that this allegation is part of the description of the instrument which the law requires to be literally proven; it is not repugnant to any other part of the declaration, if even allegations of description could be rejected for repugnancy as surplussage. The plaintiff declares on <em>p, </em>note, by which the defendant has promised to pay him, three months after the date of the note, the sum of thirty-one dollars, with interest; the note, offered, cannot be read in evidence to prove this allegation, for it is not the note described.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-13\">Plaintiff suffered a non-suit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
