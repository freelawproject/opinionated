Moreland, and not J ohn Moreland the obligee, so that, in fact, the said obligee, in the said supposed writing obligatory, has never assigned the same: 4th, that it is not shewn, by any averment or otherwise, that the said Patrick ever had notice of the last aforesaid assignment of said supposed writing obligatory.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b253-15\">Wright, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AsGL\">Goohenow, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Au7\">cited 1st Chitty, 110, 324; 1 Saund. 33, n. 2 7.

A demand need not be averred or proven, because a demand or request is no part of the contract between the parties; the case of Thomas vs. Roosa, 7th Johns. 462, cited by the defendant\u2019s counsel, is directly in point to shew that this cause of demurrer is untenable. 3d. The case of Franklin and others vs. Talmadge, 5 Johns. 84, decided that the letter <em>T </em>between the Christian and surname of one of the plaintiffs, was no part of his name, for that \u201c the law knows only of one Christian name,\u201d on the authority of Co. Litt. 3 a \u2014 1 Ld. Ray. 562, and Vin. tit. misnomer, c. 6, pi. 5 and 6. If the law was otherwise, the objection could not prevail in this case, because the endorsement is averred to have been made by the payee of the obligation. 4th. This cause of demurrer stands on the same ground, or nearly so, with the second; the promise in the writing is to pay \u201c to John Moreland or order; \u201d on the obligation being endorsed, the promise of payment attaches to the endorsee immediately; John Moreland has ordered the money to be paid to the plaintiff. It was not a part of the contract, that the defendant, the maker of the obligation, should have notice of such order being drawn, nor can we add such qualification to his undertaking.
