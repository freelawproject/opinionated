The right to this security may be waived; and, so far as respects the sheriff, it may fairly be considered as waited in this instance. But the security is to the defendant for his own benefit, as well as for that of the officers of the court; and as he has done no act which can be construed into a waiver of his right, he may now, with propriety, require such security to be given. Let the writ be endorsed then by the opening of the court to-morrow, or a non-suit will then be ordered,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
