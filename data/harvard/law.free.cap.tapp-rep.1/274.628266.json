The plaintiff in attachment must see that he has his advertisement made -out in the prescribed form, and inserted in the proper newspaper within thirty days from the return o\u00ed the writ \u2014for no other form or time subsequent can be considered as complying with the directions of the law; it would be useless and nugatory to allow the return to be amended, when, notwithstanding such amendment, the suit must be dismissed. The law requires that an inventory and appraisement of tlfe property attached, shall be made out, signed by the officer and appraisers, and be annexed to, and returned with the writ, and it provides that \u201csuch writ, when served, shall bind the property and estate of the defendant, so as aforesaid attached, from the time of executing the same,\u201d it is very doubtful whether any .property was bound by this attachment: the amendment asked for, is intended to relate back, and bind the property from the 26th of August, 181?. \u2014 there may be judgments since that time against the defendant which are lien upon this property, we are told there are such; can we, by granting this motion, remove such lien? I incline to think, that the amendment could not be allowed, if the advertisement had been such as the law requires. Attachment dismissed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
