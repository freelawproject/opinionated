And that on the filth day of September, in the year of our Lord 1816, at the township of Steubenville, in said county of Jefferson, Jehiel Carman, of said township, labourer, with force and arms a certain fence of rails of four rails in height, and at the length of ten feet, did erect and cause to be erected, at and upon part of said common highway, running past the plantation of Bezaleel Wells; and with like force and arms, did then and there suffer the said fence to be, continue, and remain, as a common nuisance, from the said fifth day of September, A. D. 1816, until the finding of this bill of indictment, whereby the said common highway was, during all that time, so much obstructed and stopped up, that the citizens of this state and others, during all that time were, and still are, hindered, detained, and obstructed, .in passing and re-passing, to, upon, and along, the said common highway, there, to the great damage and common nuisance of all the good people of this state, in going, returning, passing, repassing, riding, and labouring, to the evil example,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-14\">Plea \u2014 not guilty.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b190-15\">On the trial, IIallock, for the state,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtE\">offered in evidence a Book from which he proposed reading to the jury the following entries, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>viz. \u201c Monday, 2d June 1806, commissioners met, to-wit, Andrew Anderson, John Jackson, and Benj.

Wells\u2019 saw mill, being returned and publicly read, on two different days of the same meeting, and no objections being made thereto; and the viewers having reported that said road, if opened, will be a public convenience, the commissioners order, that said road be opened thirty feet wide, and made in other respects convenient for the passage of travellers; and also that the same be recorded as a public highway, the corners and distances of which are as follows, to-wit: beginning,\u201d &amp;c. The corners and distances were set down in words' and figures, signed by the viewers and .surveyor \u2014 under which was entered\u2014 \u201c Recorded, 2d Sept. 1806.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b191-8\">Weight, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASp\">objected to the entries being read in evidence to the jury. The averment, in the indictment, \u201cthat there was, and yet is, a certain common highway,\u201d &amp;c., can only be proven by producing the record of the road; bhe book offered in evidence, is not a book of record, but the journal of the commissioners; the entries made in it, are of the various business transacted by them, and the parts offered to be read, but short minutes of their proceedings; beside, the highway described in the indictment, and the one mentioned in the entries offered, is altogether different,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b191-9\">Hallock, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYs\">stated, that he had enquired of the commissioners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>ers\u2019 atl&lt;^ ^1&lt;3^ inf\u00b0rme(l h\u2122- that this was the \u00b0nly record -^hey eTer made of roads; that, should it be decided that what is now offered, is not a record of a road within meaniDg 0f the law, the consequence will be, that we have no established highway in the county.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b192-6\">President.</author>\n<p id=\"Ax7\">If this is to be received as a record of a road duly laid out and established, it is of a different road from the one mentioned in the indictment; the latter describes the road as \u201cfrom the township of Steubenville, towards Boyd\u2019s mill,\u201d the former \u201c beginning at the mouth of Long Liclc run, thence through the lands of Robert Iiill to intersect the road leading down McMahon\u2019s run to Steuben-ville, a little above Bez\u2019l Wells\u2019 saw mill.\u201d \u2014 These are totally irreconcilable, even if there could be a road from a township to a place or towards a place (as Boyd\u2019s mill) within the same township. The mouth of Long Lick run, the lands of Robert Hill, and the road leading down M\u2018Mahon\u2019s run, are all within the township of Steubenville. The indictment is for erecting a nuisance on an highway running <em>from </em>the township of Steubenville, and of course wholly without that township.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">But this is not such record of a road as the law requires to be made; the statute in force at the time these proceedings were had before the commissioners, is in the 4th vol. of the statute laws, by <em>that, </em>section 2d, \u201c every application for any road, shall be by petition, specifying particularly where such road begins, the remarkable places by which such road is intended to pass, if any, and where the same shall end, signed by at least twelve landholders of the county\u201d \u2014 it is only on the petition of twelve landholders of the county, that the Commissioners can proceed to cause to be laid out and surveyed a public highway; it is analagous to a petition in Chancery, or a declaration at law; on such petition being presented to the commissioners, and on their being satisfied that legal notice had been given, they are to appoint viewers and a skilful surveyor, who \u201c shall survey such road according to the view of said landholders or a majority of them, conspicuously marking the same throughout and truly noting the courses and distances thereof, and at every mile\u2019s end shall erect a monument expressing the number thereof, and shall protract the survey of said road, which, together with the proceedings of the said viewers, shall be certified respectively, and returned to said commissioners\u201d \u2014 and if the commissioners are satisfied, that the proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>road will be of public utility they shall \u201c cause a record thereof to be made, which shall thenceforth be deemed a public highway\u201d \u2014 any person\u2019s land may be taken for the use of the public, (on compensation being made,) for roads and highways.; the manner in which it may be taken and the amount of compensation adjusted, are fully provided for; but the transfer from the individual to the state is incomplete, until such transfer is recorded; the record, then, is the only evidence of title in the state; such transfer is not like a bargain and sale of land between two individuals, if is a compulsory change of possession, not the deed of a grantor to be expounded most strongly against him, but a matter of mere legal right to be expounded according to the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">There is no difficulty in determining what is a record in any case; a record of a deed is an exact copy of the deed, a record of a suit at law, or in Chancery, is a like copy of the whole proceedings m such suit. When, then, the law requires a record of the laying out and establishing of a road to be made, before it shall become a public highway, it requires that the whole proceedings shall be copied into a book prepared for that purpose, to remain as permanent evidence of the public right and title. As well might that be called the record of a suit at law, which should omit the pleadings, as these minutes can be called a record of the proceedings in laying out and establishing an highway, with the omission of the petition and plat of the road.-</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">If such loose minutes are the only evidence we have of the laying ,out and establishing of highways, it is time a more correct course was adopted by the county commissioners : that they have neglected their duty is no reason why we should receive their journal for a record; the public interest requires that full and complete record evidence should be kept of their right to, and interest in, the highways; as there is no such evidence offered in this case, the indictment cannot be supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Verdict for defendant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b193-7\">Judge Anderson declined giving an opinion, having been one of the county commissioners.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
