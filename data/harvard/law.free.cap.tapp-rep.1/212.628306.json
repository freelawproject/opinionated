The objection is, that there is no privity of contract between the endorsee and maker: by the \u201c act making certain instruments of writing negociable\u201d \u2014 \u201call bonds, promissory notes, bills of exchange, foreign and inland, drawn for any sum or sums of money, or other property certain, and made payable to any person or persons, or to his, her, or their order, or unto bearer, shall be negociable, by endorsement thereon, so as absolutely to transfer and vest the property therein, in each and every endorsee or endorsees successively.\u201d The act then goes on to authorise the endorsee to sue, in his own name, the maker or endorser; the property in this note is transferred, by the endorsement, to the plaintiff, and he is authorised to sue the defendants for it in his own name. I do not see how the plaintiff is to avail himself of the right to sue in his own name, the makers of a sealed instrument but in this form of action. It may be said in this case, as was said in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>case of Peirce vs. Crafts, 12 Johns. 90 \u2014 \u201cthere is a legal privity of contract between the maker of a negotiable note and the assignee; it is a contract to pay the money to whoever may become entitled to it by transfer, and such privity commences as soon as the endorsee becomes so entitled.\u201d overruled. Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
