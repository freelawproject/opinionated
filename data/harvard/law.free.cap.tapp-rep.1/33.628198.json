The dogs had before been seen chasing plaintiff\u2019s hogs, and the plaintiff had given the defendant some notice of it. It was doubtful, however, from the evidence, whether the defendant actually <em>Icneio </em>that his dogs were accustomed to chase and worry hogs.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"Az\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>The President observed to the iury \u2014 That there seemed but little room to doubt, from the evidence, but that the defendant\u2019s dogs had killed the plaintiff\u2019s hog; that the principal point in dispute was, whether the defendant knew that his dogs were accustomed to do such mischief; it was necessary that such knowledge should be averred and proven, to support this form of action \u2014 but how proven ? The presumption of law is, that every man is acquainted with the habits and disposition of his domestic animals, so that to make out the fact of knowledge, nothing more is necessary than to prove that the dogs were the property of the defendant and domesticated by him. Verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
