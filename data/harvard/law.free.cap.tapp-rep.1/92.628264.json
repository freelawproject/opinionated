It was admitted by the defendant, without proof. The whole amount of the plaintiff\u2019s charges against the defendant was $200; the plaintiff had credited the defendant divers payments, amounting to $140; and he claimed to recover the balance of $60. The defendant\u2019s set-off was all the items credited in the plaintiff\u2019s book.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b88-13\">Goodenow, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0z\">contended that he was entitled to judgment for $80, being the amount of his set-off proven by plaintiff\u2019s book, over the damages sued for by the plaintiff. The plaintiff has thought proper to sue for a part of his account, he must be taken to have abandoned the residue of it; he claims only sixty dollars; this we are willing to allow him; but he appears to owe the defendant a greater sum than that; we are, therefore, entitled to judgment for the balance due to us, with costs.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b88-14\">Wright, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b88-15\">President,</author>\n<p id=\"Aq0\">to the defendant\u2019s counsel: \u2014 Are the sums credited by the defendant correct, and as much as you claim P</p>\n<p id=\"b88-16\">Goodenow. \u2014 They are. Wo take the plaintiff\u2019s book to prove our set-off.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-17\">President. \u2014 The credits given on the plaintiff\u2019s book are of so much paid him by the defendant. Payment extinguishes a debt. The payment of $140, in this case, has extinguished so much of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and reduced it within the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace. It seems that the defendant wishes to avail himself of his payments twice over. It would be strange if the law countenanced such knavery, or could be made use of for so fraudulent a purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-18\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
