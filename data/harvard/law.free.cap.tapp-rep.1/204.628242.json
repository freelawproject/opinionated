The complaint in writing, is to be the foundation of the whole proceedings; upon that alone, are the justices authorised to issue their warrant; it does not appear by the return to this Certiorari, that any such complaint was made: there is, therefore, on the return, an apparen t want of jurisdiction in the magistrates. \u2014 It is not only necessary that a complaint should be made in writing to the justices, but such complaint should be a part of the return to the writ of O\u00e9rtiorari; for without having the complaint before us, we cannot judge of the correctness of the proceedings below; as in this case we cannot know, from the return of the justices, what property it was which the plaintiff sought to recover possession of, nor where situated; so that, if we were to affirm the judgment of the justices, it would be impossible to award a writ of restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-14\">Judgment of the justices reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
