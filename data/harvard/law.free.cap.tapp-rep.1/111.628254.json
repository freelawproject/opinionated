The decision, in this cause, can be of no use to him, whether it be in favor of the plaintiff or defendant. His claim, if he ever brings a suit on it, must be supported by other evidence than the record in this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">To exclude a witness on the ground of interest, it must appear that he is directly interested in the\u2019 event of the suit; standing in a similar situation with the party by whom he is <em>called; </em>and the possibility that the decision obtained by his evidence may influence the minds of a jury in his own case, furnish arguments against his credibility, but do not affect his competency; he is, therefore, a competent witness.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
