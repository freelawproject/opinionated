It is certified by the proper officer, to be a copy of the record in the case, and the authentication is admitted to be such as the law requires. Certified to us as. a copy of a record of another state, according to the act of congress we are bound to receive it as such, whether we approve of the manner in which records are made up in Delaware or not, and to give full faith and credit to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">But it is strongly urged, in support of this demurrer, that admitting the evidence to be sufficient proof that one Jonathan Nottingham did, in the court of Common Pleas of Sussex county, DeLaware, confess a judgment to the plaintiff; still, there is no evidence that the defendant was the person who confessed such judgment. To this it may be answered, that the defendant, being of the same name, is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of his being the same person; and on a demurrer to evidence, such sameness of name is a sufficient identification of the person.
