Major argues that the district court\u2019s upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 was an abuse of discretion and unreasonable in light of the factors that must be considered under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court determined that Major\u2019s offense level was 19, her criminal history category was VI, and her guideline range was 63-78 months. The district court departed upward to an offense level of 24 and imposed a sentence of 120 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-15\">The district court explained that it was moving up incrementally to the higher offense level because Major\u2019s criminal history score under-represented the seriousness of her criminal history and likelihood for recidivism under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. The court determined that Major has a consistent and persistent history of fraudulent conduct, that she had previously been on probation or supervised release on three occasions, that she was on supervised release when she committed the instant offense, and that she continued to be deceptive by lying to investigating officers even after confessing to the instant offense. The court indicated a belief that Major\u2019s behavior was unlikely to change in the future and that Major had abused a position of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-16\">We conclude that the district court\u2019s decision to depart was consistent with the objectives of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347-48 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v.
