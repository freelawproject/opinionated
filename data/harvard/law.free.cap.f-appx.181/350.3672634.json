Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), to 360 months imprisonment. Counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but raising the issues of whether the district court plainly erred in denying as moot Billings\u2019 motion to withdraw his guilty plea and whether the court plainly erred in determining Billings\u2019 relevant conduct. Billings has also filed a pro se supplemental brief challenging the district court\u2019s determination of his relevant conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">We find that Billings\u2019 guilty plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered after a thorough hearing pursuant to Fed. R.Crim.P. 11. The record discloses that Billings was properly advised of his rights, the offense charged, the maximum sentence for the offense, and the mandatory minimum sentences applicable. The court also determined that there was an independent factual basis for the plea and that the plea was not coerced or influenced by any promises. <em>See North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 31, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970); <em>United States v. De-Fusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 119-20 (4th Cir.1991). Although Billings initially moved to withdraw his guilty plea, he later withdrew the motion after informing the court that he merely wished to withdraw his stipulation as to drug quantity, and was allowed to do so. Accordingly, we find no plain error in the district court\u2019s acceptance of Billings\u2019 guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">At sentencing, the district court concluded that Billings was responsible for a total of 239.7 grams of crack cocaine, based on the testimony of several witnesses. This resulted in a base offense level of 38 under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1 (2004). The court also increased Billings\u2019 offense level by two levels for possession of a firearm, USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), and by one level because the offense occurred near a protected location, USSG \u00a7 2D1.2(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-14\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s factual findings in support of sentencing enhancements for clear error. <em>See United States v. Sayles, </em>296 F.3d 219, 224 (4th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>272 F.3d 228, 234 (4th Cir.2001). Further, this court gives due regard to the district court\u2019s opportunity to judge the credibility of witnesses and does not ordinarily review credibility determinations. <em>United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1989). Applying this standard, we find the district court did not err in determining the drug quantity attributable to Billings for sentencing purposes. Further, because the court recognized the guidelines to be advisory, it properly made findings at sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>ing by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Dalton, </em>409 F.3d 1247, 1252 (10th Cir.2005) <em>CBooker\u2019s </em>remedy demonstrates that judicial fact finding by a preponderance of the evidence is unconstitutional only when it results in a mandatory increase in the defendant\u2019s sentence); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Billings\u2019 sentence was both within the guideline range of 360 to 480 months, and within the statutory maximum of forty years imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (2000). Because the district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory, and properly calculated and considered the guideline range and the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we find the sentence reasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Counsel has moved to withdraw from further representation. We deny the motion at this juncture. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation at that time. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
