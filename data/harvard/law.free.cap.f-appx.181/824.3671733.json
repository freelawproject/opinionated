After review, we vacate and remand this case to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Ferro filed a \u00a7 2255 motion in which he raised the following five claims: (1) trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file an appeal of Ferro\u2019s conviction and sentence after he instructed counsel to do so; (2) trial counsel was ineffective for failing to make a constitutional objection to the drug quantity attributed to him for purposes of sentencing; (3) trial counsel was ineffective for advising him to withdraw his objection to the drug quantity finding and to stipulate that the offense involved 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine; (4) the government violated the terms of the plea agreement by threatening to withdraw its recommendation of an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 or to not file a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for a downward departure if Ferro contested drug quantity attributed to him at sentencing; and (5) trial counsel was ineffective in negotiating an appeal waiver as part of his plea agreement because it now prevents him from appealing the drug quantity attributed to him at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">In denying Ferro\u2019s motion, the district court distilled all of Ferro\u2019s claims down to a single issue: whether trial counsel was ineffective in failing to make a proper objection to the drug quantity attributed to Ferro at sentencing so that the issue could be preserved for appellate review. The district court concluded that Ferro\u2019s sworn statements at his sentencing that he did not want to turn the drug quantity issue into an \u201cadversarial situation\u201d belied his claim of ineffective assistance and denied Ferro\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">Ferro filed a notice of appeal. We granted a certificate of appealability on the following issue only: \u201c[wjhether the district court violated <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en </em>banc), by failing to address all of the claims raised in appellant\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b849-13\">On appeal, Ferro argues, and we agree, that the district court did not address all of the claims raised in his \u00a7 2255 motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Clisby, </em>we instructed the district courts to resolve all claims for relief raised in a petition for writ of habeas corpus prior to granting or denying relief. 960 F.2d at 936. We concluded that when a district court fails to address all claims in the habeas petition, \u201cwe will vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 935.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-14\">Upon review of the record, and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court failed to address two of Ferro\u2019s claims, namely: (1) whether trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file an appeal as allegedly instructed by Ferro; and (2) whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>government violated the terms of Ferro\u2019s plea agreement by threatening to withdraw favorable sentencing recommendations if Ferro contested the drug quantity attributed to him at sentencing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The record shows that the district court did not address Ferro\u2019s allegations that he asked his attorney to file an appeal. Similarly, the district court failed to address Ferro\u2019s allegation that the government engaged in threatening and improper conduct prior to sentencing, in violation of the plea agreement, and that, as a result, Ferro stipulated to an increased drug quantity at sentencing. Because the district court did not address the merits of these two claims, we vacate the judgment and remand the remaining claims for consideration by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b849-8\">. In reviewing a district court's denial of a \u00a7 <em>2255 </em>motion, we review findings of fact for clear error and questions of law <em>de novo. Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 891, 125 S.Ct. 167, 160 L.Ed.2d 154 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b849-9\">. Although <em>Clisby </em>involved a petition brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, the primary concern motivating this Court's decision to require district courts to address all issues in the first instance was the piecemeal litigation that necessarily ensues when only some claims are addressed in the first instance. <em>Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 935. (\"We ... seize this opportunity to express our deep concern over the piecemeal litigation of federal habeas petitions filed by state prisoners____\"). Likewise, a district court is required to address all issues raised in a \u00a7 2255 motion in the first instance. <em>See Gay v. United States, </em>816 F.2d 614, 616 n. 1 (11th Cir.1987) (\"[T]he principles developed in habeas cases also apply to \u00a7 2255 motions.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b850-13\">. We reject Ferro\u2019s argument that the district court failed to address Ferro\u2019s claim that his trial counsel was ineffective in negotiating an appeal waiver as part of Ferro\u2019s plea agreement. The district court addressed this claim when it rejected on the merits Ferro\u2019s contention that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to preserve for appellate review the constitutional objection to the drug quantity attributed to him at sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
