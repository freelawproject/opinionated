On appeal, he argues that his sentence was unreasonable in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). After careful review, we find no error and affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-18\">On March 16, 2005, Ruben was charged in a two-count indictment with embezzlement and embezzlement of VA funds while acting as a fiduciary for his mother, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601. He pled guilty and proceeded to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-19\">According to the presentence investigation report (PSI), Ruben\u2019s mother, Betty Werner, began receiving VA Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) in 1976 after the death of her first husband in World War II. In 1995, Werner was placed in an institution due to severe mental problems, at which time Ruben obtained a durable power of attorney, placing him in a fiduciary relationship with his mother. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>Over the next eight years, Ruben sent approximately ten letters to the VA, all of which were purportedly signed by his mother and directed the deposit of DIC benefits into Ruben\u2019s various bank accounts. Ruben never used any of this money to make payments to the facility caring for his mother, who died in July 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Sometime in late 2003, the VA began an investigation into the possible misappropriation of Werner\u2019s DIC payments. After providing a series of conflicting explanations as to the whereabouts of the DIC payments, Ruben eventually admitted that he had used the money to pay off his own financial obligations and to care for his ill son. He also admitted that he received approximately $800 per month for nearly ten years. According to VA financial records, the total amount of misappropriated funds was $86,402.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">The PSI recommended a base offense level of 6, under U.S.S.G \u00a7 2Bl.l(a)(2), and the following adjustments: (1) an 8-level enhancement based on the amount of money embezzled, U.S.S.G. 2Bl.l(b); (2) a 2-level enhancement because his mother qualified as a vulnerable victim within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l); (3) a 2-level enhancement for violation of a position of private trust, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3; and (4) a 3-level decrease for his acceptance of responsibility, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b). With an adjusted offense level of 15 and a criminal history category VI (based on 17 criminal history points resulting from numerous prior financial crimes and the offense of falsely accusing his former stepdaughter of child neglect and abuse), Ruben faced a Guidelines range of 41-51 months\u2019 imprisonment. There were no objections to the PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court confirmed that there were no objections to the factual basis or the calculations of the PSI and then provided defense counsel the opportunity to argue in support of a mitigating sentence. Counsel asserted that Ruben suffered from severe physical and psychological problems and highlighted that he was caring for a very sick child. Counsel urged the court to impose a sentence consisting of mandatory mental health treatment, restitution payments, \u201csome type of employment compensation,\u201d and no prison time. The district court inquired for more details about these factors and solicited the following additional facts from Ruben and his lawyer: (1) that his son had cancer in the eye, but did not live with Ruben who had not paid child support since June 2003; and (2) that Ruben suffered from diabetes, high blood pressure, and cataracts. The government argued for a high-end sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">The district court stated that it had reviewed the PSI, to which there were no objections, and considered the parties\u2019 arguments, as well as \u201cthe advisory guidelines\u201d and \u201c3553, the need for punishment, the protection of the community, the offense itself.\u201d The court then concluded that in light of all of its considerations, \u201ca sentence within the advisory guidelines is an appropriate sentence\u201d and imposed a 48-month term of imprisonment, followed by 3 years of supervised release. The court also ordered Ruben to pay $86,402 in restitution. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">Ruben asserts that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court did not adequately consult some of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He makes various arguments, some that he raised in the district court and others that he raises for the first time here, in support of mitigation. We are unpersuaded by any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">Our reasonableness review is guided by the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed\u00fcd 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). And our \u201c[r]eview for reasonableness is deferential.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>These factors include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-5\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-6\">(2) the need for the sentence imposed\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-7\">(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-8\">(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-9\">(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-10\">(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-11\">(3) the kinds of sentences available;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-12\">(7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-13\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Although sentencing courts must be <em>guided </em>by these factors, \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Robles, </em>408 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that, <em>post-Booker, </em>district courts need not conduct an accounting of every \u00a7 3553(a) factor and expound on how each factor played a role in the sentencing decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-14\">Based on our careful review, with particular attention to the sentencing transcript and the PSI, we readily conclude that Ruben\u2019s sentence is reasonable. The district court explicitly stated that it had consulted \u00a7 3553(a) prior to imposing a sentence that fell <em>within </em>the advisory Guidelines range. <em>Cf. Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788 (observing that \u201cwhen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one\u201d). Before announcing its sentence, the court heard Ruben\u2019s arguments, which pertained to \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3553(a)(1), since they concerned Ruben\u2019s ill son, his own medical concerns, and his remorse and desire for rehabilitation. Moreover, in imposing sentence, the district court highlighted Ruben\u2019s long history of economic crime and the nature of the offense and its victim. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2) (discussing factors pertaining to need for sentence imposed \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense\u201d and \u201cto afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct\u201d <em>and </em>\u201cto protect the public from further crimes of the defendant\u201d). Finally, the parties\u2019 arguments and the PSI\u2019s calculations outlined \u201cthe kinds of sentences available,\u201d as discussed in \u00a7 3553(a)(3). On this record, Ruben\u2019s sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b903-12\">. Because we find no error based on the district court\u2019s \u00a7 3553(a) analysis, we need not, and do not, reach the issue of whether there was <em>plain </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-13\">As for the government\u2019s jurisdictional argument, we have jurisdiction to review the reasonableness of Ruben's sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>434 F.3d 1318 (11th Cir.2006) (rejecting government's threshold argument that this Court lacks jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) to review a sentence within a correctly-calculated guideline range for reasonableness; concluding that \"a <em>post-Booker </em>appeal based on the \u2018unreasonableness\u2019 of a sentence, whether within or outside the advisory guidelines range, is an appeal asserting that the sentence was imposed in violation of law pursuant to \u00a7 3742(a)(1)\u201d). Pursuant to our well-established prior-precedent rule, this panel is <em>bound </em>to apply, and <em>may not </em>reconsider <em>Martinez. See United States v. Marte, </em>356 F.3d 1336, 1344 (11th Cir.2004) (discussing prior-precedent rule).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
