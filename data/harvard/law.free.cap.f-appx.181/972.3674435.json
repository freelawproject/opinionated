On appeal, Lucas argues that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence, pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), based on the court\u2019s finding that he had three qualifying prior convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Lucas asserts that, pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), his predicate prior convictions must be admitted by him or proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Lucas acknowledges that the Supreme Court has not overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 228, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), in which the Court held that the government need <em>not </em>allege in the indictment or prove beyond a reasonable doubt a defendant\u2019s prior convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence based on those convictions. Lucas also concedes that we lack the authority to overrule the <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>decision, but states that he raises the issue to preserve it for review in the Supreme Court. Pursuant to <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and our controlling caselaw, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-16\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the Supreme Court held that the government is not required to allege in its indictment, nor must it prove beyond a reasonable doubt, that a defendant had prior convictions in order for a district court to properly use those convictions to enhance a sentence. <em>Id. </em>The Court went on to hold that \u201cneither the statute nor the Constitution requires the Government to charge the factor that it mentions, an earlier conviction, in the indictment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226-272, 118 S.Ct. 1219. We have held that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cwas left undisturbed by <em>Apprendi [v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2362-63, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) ], <em>Blakely [v. Washington], </em>542 U.S. 296, 303, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 2537, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) ], and <em>[United States v.] Booker[, </em>543 U.S. 220, 243-44, 125 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>738, 755-756, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)].\u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cPut another way, because the prior-conviction exception remains undisturbed after <em>Booker, </em>a district court does not err by relying on prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 962 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 223, 163 L.Ed.2d 191 (2005); <em>see also United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1246 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cIn sum, under the Supreme Court\u2019s recent precedents neither the Fifth Amendment nor the Sixth Amendment prevented the district court from finding the fact of [the defendant\u2019s] prior convictions, or using them to designate him a ... career offender.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">Given this state of the law, the district court did not err by enhancing Lucas\u2019s sentence based on prior convictions not alleged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
