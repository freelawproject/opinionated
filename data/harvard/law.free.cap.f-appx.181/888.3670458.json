A $1,000,000 supplemental liability insurance policy, underwritten by Defendant Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance Company (\u201cPIIC\u201d), was purchased along with the vehicle\u2019s rental. The district court concluded that PIIC was not hable under the pohcy because Amuchienwa breached the policy\u2019s coverage conditions. And despite a jury determination that PIIC was hable for fraud and negligent misrepresentation, the court awarded Plaintiff $0 in damages because of Amuchienwa\u2019s breach. We now affirm the district court in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-20\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b913-21\">Twenty-three year old Seg\u00fan Amuchienwa and his friend, Oshioma Okomilo, rented cars from Budget-Rent-A-Car while visiting Orlando. The renter of Amuchienwa\u2019s car \u2014 presumably Amuchienwa \u2014 also purchased an optional $1,000,000 supplemental liability insurance pohcy underwritten by PIIC. The pohcy purported to cover only authorized drivers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The rental agreement for Amuchienwa\u2019s car did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>list Amuchienwa as an authorized driver; instead, the agreement bears the name and signature of Angela Panks, Okomilo\u2019s mother. But the agreement does list Amuchienwa\u2019s date of birth, address, and driver\u2019s license number. Some evidence indicates that Panks could not have signed the agreement because she was not in Orlando at the time of the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">On 31 December 1999, Amuchienwa was driving the rented vehicle when he struck and severely injured Plaintiff while she was loading the trunk of her van. About one month later, PIIC received a notice of loss describing the accident and Plaintiffs injuries and requesting coverage. PIIC determined that Amuchienwa was not an authorized driver and denied coverage under the supplemental policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Later, Plaintiffs counsel continued to assert that Amuchienwa was covered under the policy because his personal information appeared on the rental contract; but PIIC again denied coverage for \u201cany claims\u201d resulting from the accident.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">After these coverage denials, Plaintiff sued Amuchienwa in Florida state court. Plaintiff and Amuchienwa entered into a settlement agreement through which Amuchienwa agreed to $4,000,000 in liability and assigned his rights under the supplemental policy to Plaintiff. Plaintiff agreed not to execute the judgment against Amuchienwa if he assisted her in pursuing an action against PIIC. The state court entered a consent judgment reflecting these terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">Amuchienwa never informed PIIC of Plaintiffs suit nor of the settlement agreement. The supplemental policy contains a cooperation condition which requires the insured to (1) \u201cimmediately\u201d notify PIIC \u201c[wjhenever it appears that an \u2018accident\u2019 is likely to involve [the] policy,\u201d (2) cooperate \u201cin the investigation, settlement or defense of the claim or suit,\u201d and (3) assume no obligation without PIIC\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">Plaintiff presented the consent judgment to PIIC and demanded payment. PIIC denied her claim and sought a declaratory judgment in federal district court that Amuchienwa was not covered under the policy and that PIIC was not bound by the settlement agreement. Plaintiff filed a three-count counterclaim in which she alleged breach of contract, fraud, and negligent misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">The district court granted summary judgment for PIIC on its complaint and on Plaintiffs breach of contract claim. Without reaching the question of whether Amuchienwa was an \u201cauthorized driver\u201d under the policy, the court concluded PIIC\u2019s performance was excused by Amuchienwa\u2019s breach of the policy\u2019s cooperation condition. The district court farther declared that PIIC was not bound by the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-12\">Plaintiffs other claims were tried before a jury. The jury found that PIIC\u2014 through its agent, Budget \u2014 fraudulently induced Amuchienwa to purchase the supplemental insurance by misrepresenting that he would be covered under the policy. But because the district court found that Amuchienwa breached his duty to cooperate, the court concluded he would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>received no benefit from his bargain. The court therefore awarded Plaintiff \u2014 standing in Amuchienwa\u2019s shoes \u2014 $0 in damages. The court further denied Plaintiffs claim for punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">II. Standard op Review</p>\n<p id=\"A6Z\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Gibson v. Resolution Trust Carp., </em>51 F.3d 1016, 1020 (11th Cir.1995). We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s ruling that Plaintiff was entitled to no damages. <em>National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Rountree Transp. &amp; Rigging, Inc., </em>286 F.3d 1233, 1244 (11th Cir.2002). We also review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s order granting judgment as a matter of law to PIIC on Plaintiffs claim for punitive damages. <em>Snapp v. Unlimited Concepts, Inc., </em>208 F.3d 928, 932 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">Despite a jury determination that PIIC was hable to Plaintiff for committing fraud and negligent misrepresentation, the district court awarded $0 in damages on account of Amuchienwa\u2019s purported breach of the cooperation condition. We conclude that Amuchienwa, as a matter of Florida law, did not violate the cooperation condition. Because Amuchienwa did not breach the cooperation condition, Plaintiff is accordingly entitled to damages as a result of the jury\u2019s verdict.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We also conclude the district court correctly dismissed Plaintiffs claim for punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">\n<em>A. Cooperation Condition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">Critical to the district court\u2019s disposition was its conclusion that Amuchienwa breached the policy\u2019s cooperation condition by not alerting PIIC of Plaintiffs suit or the settlement agreement. Amuchienwa, according to the district court, breached the condition by not giving PIIC an opportunity to defend Plaintiffs suit. The district court concluded that \u201c[bjecause [PIIC] only denied coverage, but did not refuse to defend, Amuchienwa\u2019s breach of the duty of cooperation remains unexcused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">Under Florida law, for Amuchienwa\u2019s failure to cooperate to excuse PIIC from its obligations under the policy, PIIC must prove that: (1) Amuchienwa failed to cooperate; (2) the lack of cooperation was material; (3) PIIC suffered substantial prejudice as a result of Amuchienwa\u2019s failure to cooperate; and (4) PIIC exercised diligence and good faith in trying to bring about Amuchienwa\u2019s cooperation. <em>Ramos v. Northwestern Mut. Ins. Co., </em>336 So.2d 71, 75 (Fla.1976). Despite PIIC\u2019s repeated denial of coverage, the district court concluded that PIIC satisfied the <em>Ramos </em>requirements as a matter of law. We disagree. Even accepting as true that Amuchienwa materially failed to cooperate, PIIC has not shown substantial prejudice or diligence sufficient for PIIC to prevail as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-13\">When an insurer unequivocally denies coverage, Florida law provides that the insurer cannot later also fall back on breach of the cooperation condition to deny coverage. <em>See Paz v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>478 So.2d 849, 849 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1985) (\u201cHaving breached the contract [by denying coverage, the insurer] cannot attempt to avoid liability by relying on a provision prohibiting the insured from settling with the tortfeasor without its consent.\u201d); <em>In</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number><em>fante v. Preferred Risk Mut. Ins. Co., </em>364 So.2d 874, 875 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1978) (\u201c[W]here an insurer has denied coverage which actually exists, the insurer has breached the contract and therefore cannot be allowed to rely upon a contractual provision prohibiting the insured from settlement of the claim with a responsible party in order to relieve itself from liability.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">PIIC twice flatly denied coverage under the policy' \u2014 once in response to Amuchienwa\u2019s initial claim and the second time in response to Plaintiffs inquiry before she filed suit against Amuchienwa. In each denial, PIIC clearly renounced coverage for injuries stemming from the accident. PIIC\u2019s first denial went so far as to suggest that Amuchienwa \u201ccontact personal counsel, at [his] own expense\u201d to protect his interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">In granting summary judgment for PIIC, the district court relied on <em>First American Title Ins. Co. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa., </em>695 So.2d 475, 477 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1997), in which the Florida appeals court concluded that an insured\u2019s failure to notify its insurer of suit constituted a breach of the policy\u2019s cooperation conditions and excused the insurer\u2019s performance. The <em>First American </em>court did not discuss the <em>Ramos </em>requirements in reaching its conclusion. But unlike the present case it was clear that the insurer in <em>First American </em>exercised diligence in trying to bring about its insured\u2019s cooperation. Seemingly critical to the <em>First American </em>court\u2019s decision was that in its initial letter denying coverage the insurer specifically instructed the insured to notify it of any lawsuit filed in the matter so that the insurer could determine if it owed a duty to defend the suit. <em>Id. </em>at 476. PIIC made no similar statement in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">We do not interpret Florida law to say that an insurer must include some magic words when denying coverage to preserve its rights under a cooperation condition. But unequivocal denials of coverage such as those PIIC made here forfeit an insurer\u2019s right to invoke cooperation conditions against its insured. Had PIIC made some effort to ensure that Amuchienwa knew he was still bound by the policy\u2019s conditions, then a question of fact might remain about whether PIIC\u2019s efforts were sufficiently diligent. But because PIIC made no effort whatsoever, we conclude that Amuchienwa did not breach the cooperation condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">Given the posture of this case, we do not need to decide whether Amuchienwa was covered under the PIIC policy as an authorized driver. A jury has determined that Plaintiff stands in the shoes of a rightful policyholder by virtue of the fraud and misrepresentation attributed to PIIC. The district court, however, awarded Plaintiff $0 in damages because it concluded Amuchienwa breached the cooperation condition. Because we conclude that Amuchienwa did not breach the cooperation condition, the remaining issue for us to determine is the measure of damages to which Plaintiff is entitled.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>\n<em>B. Jury Verdict and Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Plaintiff \u2014 standing in Amuchienwa\u2019s shoes \u2014 prevailed in her suit against PIIC for fraudulently inducing Amuchienwa to purchase the policy, and the jury determined that Plaintiff was entitled to damages as a result of Amuchienwa\u2019s reliance on the misrepresentations. On the proper measure of damages, Florida follows the \u201cflexibility theory,\u201d under which a defrauded party is entitled to the measure of damages that will fully compensate her. <em>Nordyne, Inc. v. Florida Mobile Home Supply, Inc., </em>625 So.2d 1283, 1286 (Fla. Dist.Ct.App.1993) (\u201cThe \u2018flexibility theory\u2019 permits the court to use either the \u2018out-of-pocket\u2019 or the \u2018benefit-of-the-bargain\u2019 rule, depending opon which is more likely fully to compensate the injured party.\u201d). The district court correctly concluded that Plaintiff was entitled to the benefit of her bargain. Damages under the \u201cbenefit-of-the-bargain\u201d rule are calculated by taking the difference between the actual value of the policy and its value had the contested facts \u2014 here, that Amuchienwa was an authorized driver and covered under the policy \u2014 been true. <em>Martin v. Brown, </em>566 So.2d 890, 891 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Amuchienwa bargained for $1,000,000 in supplemental insurance coverage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The purpose of compensatory damages in tort cases such as this one is to restore the injured party to the position she would have occupied had the wrong not been committed. <em>Glades Oil Co., Inc. v. R.A.I. Mgmt., Inc., </em>510 So.2d 1193, 1195 (Fla. Dist.Ct.App.1987). The district court concluded that Amuchienwa\u2019s position as an authorized driver would have yielded him $0 under the policy because he breached the cooperation condition. Because we conclude Amuchienwa did not breach the cooperation condition, it follows that PIIC was not relieved of its duties to Amuchienwa. Plaintiff is accordingly entitled to the full value of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">We remand to the district court for the limited purpose of entering judgment for Plaintiff with a measure of compensatory damages calculated in an amount based on the policy limits.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">\n<em>C. Punitive Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">The district court granted PIIC\u2019s motion for directed verdict on Plaintiffs request for punitive damages. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s order. <em>Snapp, </em>208 F.3d at 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-13\">The Florida Supreme Court has written that \u201cthe justification for a punitive award is to punish the offender and to deter others from committing similar wrongs.\u201d <em>Fisher v. City of Miami </em>172 So.2d 455, 457 (Fla.1965). In limited situations, Florida law provides that a principal may be assessed punitive damages for the acts of its agent. But such exemplary damages may only be assessed against the principal when the principal bears some fault. <em>Mercury Motors Express, Inc. v. Smith, </em>393 So.2d 545, 549 (Fla.1981) (concluding that plaintiff must \u201cprove some fault on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>part of the [principal] which foreseeably contributed to the plaintiffs injury to make him vicariously hable for punitive damages\u201d). <em>See also Life Ins. Co. of North America v. Del Aguila, </em>417 So.2d 651, 652-53 (Fla.1982) (reiterating conclusion in <em>Mercury Motors </em>and finding insufficient proof of principal\u2019s fault).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">The present case presents such a principal/agent arrangement: That the Budget rental-counter employee was acting as PIIC\u2019s agent when she sold Amuchienwa the supplemental policy is uncontroverted. PIIC accordingly cannot be assessed punitive damages unless PIIC exhibited fault. We conclude that Plaintiff has not presented sufficient evidence to show that PIIC bore fault for the Budget employee\u2019s acts. The district court therefore correctly dismissed Plaintiffs claim for punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">For the foregoing reasons we REVERSE the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to PIIC. We conclude that Amuchienwa did not breach the policy\u2019s cooperation condition. We REMAND to the district court for the limited purpose of determining the proper measure of damages to be afforded Plaintiff under the policy. And we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of directed verdict to PIIC on Plaintiffs request for punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED with instructions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b913-14\">. The policy defines an \"authorized driver\u201d as either: \"a. A driver whose name is listed on the original 'rental agreement\u2019; b. A driver designated by description, if any, in the 'rental agreement'; or c. A driver designated by description, if any, in item 6 of the Declarations.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b914-7\">. In a letter dated 8 May 2000, PIIC wrote to Amuchienwa: \"The rental vehicle was operated by you, an unauthorized driver, who violated the rental agreement. As an unauthorized driver, you are not covered under the [supplemental] policy. As such, ... coverage will not be afforded.... [Y]ou may wish to contact personal counsel, at your own expense, to insure your interests are protected.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b914-14\">. In a letter to Plaintiff\u2019s counsel dated 3 May 2001, PIIC wrote: \"Based on our [previous] denial of coverage, we must continue to deny <em>any claims </em>presented on behalf of your client, Ms. Kohne.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b915-10\">. PIIC asserts on appeal that Plaintiff lacked standing to sue because the settlement agreement through which she gained Amuchienwa\u2019s position could not be authenticated. We disagree. As the district court noted in admitting the agreement, both parties relied on its authenticity in their pleadings and at trial. In the \"admitted facts\u201d of the parties\u2019 Joint Pretrial Statement, both parties stipulated that \"[Plaintiff] is the assignee of any rights that Amuchienwa may have had against [PIIC].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b916-7\">. We agree with the district court that PIIC was not entitled to a directed verdict on Plaintiffs fraud claim. We may reverse the denial of a directed verdict only if the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, is such that reasonable jurors could not have arrived at a contrary verdict. <em>Stuckey v. Northern Propane Gas Co., </em>874 F.2d 1563, 1567 (11th Cir.1989). Even without Amuchienwa's testimony, Plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to support the juiy\u2019s verdict; specifically, testimony from Okomilo and the Budget rental agent. Perhaps the most important fact supporting the jury\u2019s verdict is that Amuchienwa purchased the optional supplemental insurance policy. From this a jury could reasonably conclude Amuchienwa justifiably relied on representations he would be covered under the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b917-7\">. In an alternative argument, Plaintiff contends that an \"out-of-pocket\u201d damages calculation entitles her to the amount of her settlement agreement with Amuchienwa, or $4,000,000. We agree with the district court that the true value of out-of-pocket damages would likely compensate the defrauded party for only the amount paid in premiums for the policy, in this case $9.95. Regardless, we do not think PIIC can be liable for an amount in excess of the policy\u2019s upper limits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b917-14\">. We further conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing without prejudice PIIC\u2019s claims against Amuchienwa for failure to prosecute within the time limits specified by local rule. See <em>Dynes v. Army Air Force Exch. Serv., </em>720 F.2d 1495, 1499 (11th Cir.1983) (finding no abuse of discretion when court dismissed claim without prejudice for party\u2019s failure to timely file brief).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
