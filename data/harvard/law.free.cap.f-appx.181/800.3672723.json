Pena maintains that the CB targeted her because of her political affiliation with the Acci\u00f3n Democr\u00e1tica Party (\u201cDAP\u201d), which opposes Chavez. Pena asserts that she established a well-founded fear of future persecution because (1) she protested against Chavez; (2) the CB are aware of her affiliation with the DAP; and (3) her opponents have shown that they are capable of harming her because the woman slapped her. Pena avers that the threat against her from Chavez\u2019s party is country wide, which precludes internal relocation. She also maintains there is a clear probability that she will be persecuted if she returns to Venezuela because her cousin received a threatening call and her home was vandalized by Chavez\u2019s supporters after Pena left for the United States. Finally, Pena claims that the IJ erred in making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>an adverse credibility finding because it was based on immaterial and slight differences in dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To the extent that the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, our review is de novo. <em>Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). The BIA and IJ\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we must affirm the \u201cdecision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84 (quotation omitted). \u201cTo reverse the IJ\u2019s fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General may grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD6\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause such future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. \u201cDemonstrating such a connection requires the alien to present specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of [some statutorily listed factor].\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287 (quotations omitted). We have held that \u201cpersecution,\u201d as used to illustrate that an alien has suffered \u201cpast persecution,\u201d is an \u201cextreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotations and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">If the alien establishes past persecution, it is presumed that her life or freedom would be threatened upon return to the country of removal unless the government shows by a preponderance that the country\u2019s conditions have changed such that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would no longer be threatened or that the alien could relocate within the country and it would be reasonable to expect her to do so. <em>Id.; </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(b), 208.16(b). An alien who has not shown past persecution may still be entitled to asylum if he can demonstrate a future threat to her life or freedom on a protected ground in her country. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(b)(2), 208.16(b)(2). To establish a \u201cwell-founded fear,\u201d an applicant must show that she has a fear of persecution in her home country and that \u201c[t]here is a reasonable possibility of suffering such persecution if he or she were to return to that country.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(i). Further, \u201can applicant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>must demonstrate that h[er] fear of persecution is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">To qualify for withholding of removal under the INA, an alien must show that it is more likely than not that if returned to her country, the alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). \u201cAn alien bears the burden of demonstrating that [s]he more-likely-than-not would be persecuted or tortured upon h[er] return to the country in question.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. Generally, where an alien fails to meet the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard for establishing asylum eligibility, the alien cannot establish the higher burden for withholding of removal. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Even if the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was erroneous, Pena has failed to establish that she and her daughter were eligible for asylum. As we have stated many times, persecution is an \u201cextreme concept.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. In <em>Sepulveda, </em>we held that the death threats that the petitioner and her family repeatedly received over the phone were not enough to rise to the level of persecution. <em>Id. </em>at 1229, 1231. Similarly, phone calls like those received by Pena involving name-calling and general threats to \u201cwatch out\u201d or \u201ctake care,\u201d even coupled with a slap to the face and being threatened during a protest, do not rise to the level of persecution. Pena thus has failed to establish that the evidence she presented before the IJ <em>compelled </em>a finding of past persecution or fear of future persecution, and she is not eligible for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">Likewise, Pena has failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal, which generally requires a greater showing than eligibility for asylum. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b825-15\">. As an initial matter, Pena did not raise any argument regarding the IJ\u2019s denial of her application for relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). Therefore, Pena has abandoned that issue. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (holding that where an appellant fails to raise arguments regarding an issue on appeal, the issue is deemed abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
