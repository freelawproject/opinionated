No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">The presentence investigation report (PSI) indicated that Hughes, a native and citizen of Jamaica, previously had been deported in 1990 and in 1994. He later reentered the United States but was arrested in 2003 on state charges, convicted, and turned over to the federal government in 2004 to face the charge in this case. The PSI reflected Hughes\u2019s extensive criminal history, which showed that he had many felony convictions, including convictions for drug and weapon possession and for aggravated assault and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">At sentencing, the district court indicated that Hughes, because he had an aggravated felony conviction, was subject to a 20-year statutory maximum sentence. Based on Hughes\u2019s total offense level of 13 and a criminal history category of VI, the district court set Hughes\u2019s guideline range at 33 to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But, the district court determined that a higher sentence was appropriate. The court recognized that it was to consider the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in fashioning a sentence. The court then noted that Hughes had received lenient sentences in the past and that a 60-month sentence was necessary to protect the public from further crimes by Hughes, to reflect the seriousness of the repeated offenses, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-14\">Hughes first argues that his sentence is illegal because the district court applied a 20-year statutory maximum sentence, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), based on his earlier convictions, which were not alleged in the indictment and were not submitted to a jury. Instead, Hughes contends that he should have been exposed to the two-year statutory maximum sentence, under \u00a7 1326(a), that would have applied without consideration of his earlier convictions. He recognizes that this Circuit\u2019s interpretation of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), forecloses this argument; but he wishes to preserve the issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hughes correctly concedes that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding precedent. <em>See United States v. Cama</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number><em>cho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1316 n. 3 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 457, 163 L.Ed.2d 347 (2005). The district court, thus, committed no error by considering Hughes\u2019s felony convictions in determining the applicable maximum statutory sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Hughes also challenges the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence above the guideline range. He contends that his sentence is unreasonable because it is premised on a criminal history departure not recognized by the sentencing guidelines: the district court\u2019s characterization of his earlier sentences as \u201clight,\u201d even though Hughes was classified at the highest criminal history category, VI. Hughes also faults the district court for failing to conduct the guideline departure analysis required by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">Post <em>-Booker, </em>we review sentences for reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005) <em>(per curiam). </em>After the district court has calculated the guideline sentencing range accurately, the court then may impose a more severe or more lenient sentence as long as the sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1179 (11th Cir.2005). In determining whether a sentence is unreasonable, we are guided by the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1246. These factors include (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense, (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant, (3) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment, (4) the need to protect the public, and (5) the guideline range. <em>See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 </em>3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">We first reject Hughes\u2019s suggestion that the district court\u2019s sentencing decision was, in effect, a disguised upward departure under \u00a7 4A1.3. The sentencing transcript shows that the district court understood that, <em>pre-Booker, </em>it would have to depart upwardly to impose a sentence outside the guideline range. The district court, however, recognized its discretion, <em>post-Booker, </em>in determining Hughes\u2019s sentence after calculating the guideline range. The district court\u2019s decision to sentence Hughes above the guideline range was an exercise of the court\u2019s discretion: this decision was not a departure, and the court was not required to conduct an upward departure analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-13\">Hughes\u2019s sentence is not unreasonable. After determining that the applicable guideline range was 33 to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment, the district court appropriately considered the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) in imposing a sentence above the guideline range. The court specifically referred to Hughes\u2019s history, including repeated convictions for similar conduct. The court considered the need for the sentence to promote respect for the law, to afford adequate deterrence, and to protect the public from further crimes by Hughes. And we note that the Hughes\u2019s 60-month sentence is only one-quarter of the statutory maximum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-14\">The district court properly detailed why, based on its consideration of the \u00a7 3553 factors, a sentence above the guideline range was warranted. Thus, after reviewing the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we are satisfied that Hughes\u2019s 60-month sentence is not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b798-11\">. The district court expressly rejected the PSI\u2019s recommendation of a 16-level enhancement, \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A), based on Hughes remaining unlawfully in the United States after a conviction for a crime of violence and a firearm offense. The court, instead, applied an 8-level enhancement, \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), because Hughes had an aggravated felony conviction. The court also rejected the PSI\u2019s recommended sentencing range of 100 to 125 months' imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b798-16\">. In <em>Almendarez-Torres v.
