No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-25\">We are aware that Barragaris written plea agreement contains a sentence appeal waiver. The government suggests that Barragan waived the right to appeal his sentence based on the plea agreement and on his \u201cobvious close familiarity with\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>the agreement. But, at the guilty plea hearing, the magistrate judge did not indicate expressly that Barragan was waiving the right to appeal his sentence under most circumstances: the appeal waiver, indeed, was not mentioned at all. <em>See United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1351\u201453 (11th Cir.1993) (declining to determine that defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived right to appeal sentence where it was \u201cnot manifestly clear that [defendant] understood he was waiving his appeal rights\u201d). We cannot say, on this record, that the government could carry its burden of showing that Barragan knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his sentence. We, thus, consider the merits of Barragan\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Barragan argues that, under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights by applying the Sentencing Guideline range in a mandatory fashion and by failing to consider its authority to \u201cdepart downward\u201d from the prescribed sentencing range. We review constitutional challenges to a sentence <em>de novo. United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1321 (11th Cir.2005). Barragan was sentenced after <em>Booker </em>was decided: nothing in the record indicates that the district court misunderstood its authority to apply the Sentencing Guidelines in an advisory, rather than a mandatory, fashion. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 767 (instructing that, although district courts are not bound to apply the guidelines, district courts must consult the guidelines and take them into account). And Barragan presented several possible mitigating factors during sentencing: his age, health, family situation, and economic situation. The district court simply rejected these factors in favor of the guideline sentence. No constitutional error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
