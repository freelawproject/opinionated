Specifically, Faulk contends that the district court erred when it imposed a special condition of supervised release that required Faulk to participate in mental health counseling and treatment as directed by the probation office. He claims that the order gave the probation officer unconstitutional discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-21\">When an issue was not raised before the district court, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Heath, </em>419 F.3d 1312, 1314 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Plain error exists if there was \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citation omitted). An error is only plain if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>is clear under current law. <em>Id. </em>at 1315. To show that an error affected substantial rights, a defendant will almost always have to show that the error \u201caffected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). A violation of Article III of the U.S. Constitution seriously affects the \u201cfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1316 (quotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) allows a district court to require that a defendant \u201cparticipate in a mental health program approved by the United States Probation Office.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5B 1.3(d)(5) (2002). In <em>Heath, </em>we held that leaving the decision of whether a defendant will participate in a mental health program to a probation officer is plain error. 419 F.3d at 1315. The condition at issue in <em>Heath </em>stated: \u201cThe defendant shall participate if and as directed by the probation office in such mental health programs as recommended by a psychiatrist or psychologist to include residential treatment, outpatient treatment, and psychotropic medications as prescribed by a medical doctor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1314. We determined in <em>Heath </em>that the error was plain because it was clear under then-current law. <em>See id. </em>at 1315. Our precedent, we noted, holds that delegating a judicial function violates Article III of the U.S. Constitution. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Prouty, </em>303 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir.2002)); <em>see also United States v. Nash, </em>438 F.3d 1302, 1304, 1306 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (holding that the district court committed plain error by imposing the following condition: \u201cAs deemed necessary by the Probation Officer, the defendant shall participate in mental health counseling, which may include inpatient treatment.\u201d). <em>But cf. United States v. Zinn, </em>321 F.3d 1084, 1086, 1092 (11th Cir.2003) (holding it was <em>not </em>plain error to impose the following condition: \u2018You shall participate as directed in a program of mental health treatment including a sexual offender treatment program approved by the probation officer.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">Here the district court stated to Faulk at sentencing: \u201c|Y]ou will be required to participate in a program of mental health counseling and treatment as directed by the supervising U.S. Probation Officer.\u201d The district court further recommended that Faulk be \u201cdesignated to an institution that has an affiliated mental health unit in order that he can receive mental health treatment.\u201d The language employed by the district court is similar to that upheld in <em>Zinn, </em>because it merely delegates to the probation officer the administrative supervision of Faulk\u2019s participation in the mental health program, not the ultimate decision of whether Faulk must participate in the program. <em>See Zinn, </em>321 F.3d at 1092; <em>Heath, </em>419 F.3d at 1315. On the other hand, the written judgment issued by the district court states: <em>\u201cAs deemed necessary by the Probation Officer, </em>the defendant shall participate in a program of mental health treatment.\u201d (emphasis added). This language is similar to the language in <em>Nash </em>that was found to be delegation of ultimate authority \u2014 and to constitute plain error. <em>See Nash, </em>438 F.3d at 1306. We are thus presented with a situation where the district court\u2019s written judgment deviates from its oral sentence. \u201cWhen the orally imposed sentence differs from the written order of judgment, the oral sentence controls.\u201d <em>United States v. Ridgeway, </em>319 F.3d 1313, 1315 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam). Because the district court\u2019s oral sentence controls \u2014 and the special condition of supervised release described in that sentence is more similar to the condition upheld in <em>Zinn </em>than the conditions rejected in <em>Heath </em>and <em>Nash </em>\u2014 we hold that the district court did not commit plain error. The phrasing the district court chose at the sentencing hearing, coupled with the judge\u2019s recommendation that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>Faulk serve his sentence where he could receive mental health treatment, sufficiently establishes that the district court intended to impose mental health treatment and simply left the discretion or administration of that treatment to the probation officer. Accordingly, we affirm Faulk\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
