On appeal, Young argues that the district court erred by (1) denying his motion for judgment of acquittal; (2) denying his motion to suppress evidence; (3) denying his motion for mistrial based on prosecutorial misconduct; and (4) enhancing his sentence based on extra-verdict facts. We address each issue in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-16\">I. MOTION FOR JUDGMENT OF ACQUITTAL</p>\n<p id=\"b866-17\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal. <em>United States v. PerezTosta, </em>36 F.3d 1552, 1556 (11th Cir.1994). To uphold such a denial, \u201cthis Court need only determine that a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that the evidence established the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Pistone, </em>177 F.3d 957, 958 (11th Cir.1999). We must view all reasonable inferences in favor of the government. <em>Perez-Tosta, </em>36 F.3d at 1556.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-18\">A. <em>COUNTERFEITING CHARGES</em></p>\n<p id=\"b866-19\">We conclude, based upon the evidence in this record, taken in the light most favorable to the government, that a reasonable fact-finder could certainly have found Young guilty of making, passing, and selling counterfeit currency, or at least, of aiding and abetting such conduct. The evidence established more than one witness\u2019s account of Young\u2019s involvement in the offense. First, United States Secret Service Special Agent Kenneth Manderson testified at trial that he had made a number of purchases of counterfeit money from Young and Lebert with Keino Lewis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>(\u201cKeino\u201d), a confidential informant, and that Lebert had told Manderson that he used Young\u2019s machine to print the counterfeit bills. Second, Keino testified at trial that he had observed Young making the counterfeit money, and both Young and Lebert cutting the money, during a controlled purchase on July 7, 2003. Specifically, Keino testified that he observed Young printing money from a printer connected to a laptop and cutting the money with scissors. Keino also testified that, during another purchase, Young got angry because Keino and Manderson were counting the counterfeit money in public, and Young told Keino not to do that again. Third, Lebert testified that he and Young had been making counterfeit money and identification documents together, and that Young\u2019s role was to help cut the currency. Lebert also testified that the batch of currency they sold to Keino on July 7 had been printed at his apartment on a printer he and Young had asked Young\u2019s girlfriend to buy for them. Lebert also testified that he and Young had made the counterfeit money involved in another transaction with Keino in Young\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s apartment, where Young also lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Because the evidence sufficiently supports Young\u2019s convictions, the district court did not err in denying Young\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on this charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">B. <em>DOCUMENT-MAKING IMPLEMENTS CHARGE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">Young also argues that the evidence was not sufficient to support his conviction for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(5) because he only possessed the Eltron P310 Card Maker for the legitimate purpose of using it in his father\u2019s trucking business. Young also asserts that Lebert testified that Young did not know that Lebert had made fraudulent identifications and social security cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">The evidence does not support Young\u2019s argument because Lebert testified that, while Lebert and Young initially purchased the Card Maker for Young\u2019s father\u2019s trucking business, they both used the device for illegal purposes. Young did not present any evidence in contradiction of Lebert\u2019s testimony. Even assuming that Young possessed the Eltron P130 Card Maker purely for legitimate purposes, Young fails to address the mountain of other document-making implements that were found at his apartment, including: (1) software capable of making counterfeit money; (2) images of personal signatures; (3) graphical files representing a Florida driver\u2019s license strip; (4) photographs; (5) software capable of making identification cards; (6) images of social security cards; and (7) a box of blank white cards used to make driver\u2019s licenses and ID\u2019s. Based upon this evidence, a reasonable fact-finder could have found Young guilty of possessing \u201cdocument-making implement[s] ... with the intent such document-making implements] ... will be used in the production of a false identification document....\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(5). Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Young\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">C. <em>FIREARM AND AMMUNITION CHARGES</em></p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">Young next argues that, given the inconsistent statements that his girlfriend, Jamiliah Brown, made to police concerning ownership of the firearm and ammunition, no reasonable juror could have relied on her testimony as the basis for Young\u2019s convictions as to counts five and six. Young asserts that, because Brown\u2019s contradictory testimony is the only evidence tending to show that he was the possessor of the firearm, the evidence is insufficient to establish his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">Here, while Brown admittedly provided false statements to the police, Young\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>counsel cross-examined her on the topic of her false statements. After Brown had testified on direct and Young\u2019s counsel cross-examined her, the ultimate determination with regard to her credibility was left to the jury. <em>See U.S. v. Parrado, </em>911 F.2d 1567, 1571 (11th Cir.1990) (\u201cCredibility determinations are the exclusive province of the jury\u201d), <em>citing United States v. Hewitt, </em>663 F.2d 1381, 1385 (11th Cir.1981) (stating that the jury is entitled to believe the government\u2019s witnesses even if they consist of \u201can array of scoundrels, liars and brigands\u201d). Finding that Brown made the false statements because of her feelings for Young and the pressure she felt from Young to lie is not an unreasonable conclusion for a juror to make. Moreover, the evidence that Young lived at the apartment, kept his clothes in the closet, and had a key to the apartment demonstrates that Young had \u201cthe power and intention to exercise dominion or control\u201d over the firearm and ammunition contained in the master bedroom closet. <em>See United States v. Gunn, </em>369 F.3d 1229, 1235 (11th Cir.2004). Therefore, because a reasonable fact-finder could determine that the evidence established Young\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the district court did not err in denying Young\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">II. MOTION TO SUPPRESS</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Young also argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress because the warrant issued to search his apartment was not supported by probable cause. Young contends that, at the time of the issuance of the warrant, there was unsubstantiated evidence that Lebert had entered apartment # 1805 (Young\u2019s apartment) while the police were surveilling Lebert. Young further asserts that the police could not be sure that Lebert exited apartment # 1805 on his way to complete the fraudulent identification card transaction. Young thus maintains that, based on the totality of the circumstances, the district court should have granted his motion to suppress.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">In this case, the affidavit for the search warrant, which Special Agent Freund prepared, indicated that the officers were aware of the following information at the time of the affidavit: (1) Keino, the confidential informant in this case, had met with Lebert and Young to exchange counterfeit currency; (2) Young was at Lebert\u2019s apartment when Lebert gave Keino the counterfeit currency; (3) Young accepted the genuine currency in exchange for the counterfeit currency; (4) Keino met with Young and Lebert on another occasion to again transfer counterfeit currency; (5) officers witnessed Lebert entering Inverrary Gardens apartment complex and Lebert later informed officers that he had been making false identifications at an apartment within the complex; (6) after Lebert\u2019s arrest, Lebert told officers that Young\u2019s apartment was located at 4200 Inverrary Gardens, Apartment # 1805, and that Lebert had made fraudulent identifications there; and (7) Lebert told officers that the identification-making equipment belonged to Young and was located at Young\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">Considering all the information that Special Agent Freund submitted to the court in the affidavit for the search warrant, and in light of the fact that Young only challenges the surveillance issue on appeal, it is clear that \u201cthe totality of the circumstances allow a conclusion that there [was] a fair probability of finding contraband or evidence\u201d at Young\u2019s apartment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number><em>United States v. Brundidge, </em>170 F.3d 1350, 1352 (11th Cir.1999). Thus, the district court did not err in determining that probable cause supported the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">III. MOTION FOR MISTRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Young argues on appeal that the district court abused its discretion in denying Young\u2019s motion for a mistrial. Young contends that the prosecutor\u2019s act of questioning Brown concerning Young\u2019s custodial status warranted a mistrial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Young maintains that the prosecutor\u2019s statement, that Young was in custody, \u201chad no relevance and was extremely prejudicial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for mistrial for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Knowles, </em>66 F.3d 1146, 1163 (11th Cir.1995). We will reverse a defendant\u2019s conviction on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct only where the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were \u201c(1) improper and (2) prejudiced the defendant\u2019s substantive rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>145 F.3d 1433, 1438 (11th Cir.1998); <em>see also United States v. Abraham, </em>386 F.3d 1033, 1036 (11th Cir.2004) (explaining that prosecutorial misconduct requires a reversal of a defendant\u2019s conviction only where the defendant\u2019s substantial rights were prejudiced \u201cin the context of the entire trial in light of any curative instruction\u201d). \u201cIn order to assess the prejudicial impact of a prosecutor\u2019s statements, we must evaluate them in the context of the trial as a whole and assess their probable impact on the jury.\u201d <em>Hernandez, </em>145 F.3d at 1438.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">In this case, while Young maintains that the prosecutor\u2019s comment was prejudicial, he fails to indicate precisely how the eomment prejudiced his substantial rights as to warrant a mistrial. Given the overwhelming evidence of Young\u2019s guilt, mentioned above, it is unclear in what manner the prosecutor\u2019s comment that Young had been incarcerated could have impacted the jury so that it would have been inclined to find Young guilty regardless of the other evidence. In other words, Young has not established that, but for the prosecutor\u2019s remark, the jury would have found him not guilty. No mention of Young\u2019s custodial status was again made by the prosecutor or any witness. Further, Young declined the court\u2019s offer to provide a curative instruction to the jury. Based on the foregoing, the district court did not err in denying Young\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-10\">Q: Now, the fourth statement that you gave on January 13th, when you said that you had no idea about the gun at the residence and you didn\u2019t know who the gun belonged to, those were lies, weren\u2019t they?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">IV. SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b869-13\">Young argues that the district court violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights by enhancing his sentence based on facts that were neither charged in his indictment nor found by a jury. Young specifically argues that his sentence enhancements based on (1) his obstruction of justice, (2) the face value of the counterfeit currency involved in the crime totaling between $30,000 and $70,000, and (3) the offense involving between 25 and 99 counterfeit documents, violated the rules set forth in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) , and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) .</p>\n<p id=\"b869-16\">Young properly preserved his claim in the district court by objecting under <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>to the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>use of facts found by a preponderance of the evidence to enhance his sentence. <em>See United States v. Dowling, </em>403 F.3d 1242, 1245-46 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining the ways an appellant can preserve a <em>Booker </em>claim). Since Young timely raised a <em>Booker </em>objection in the district court, we review the claim on appeal <em>de novo, </em>but reverse only for harmful error. <em>See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-17\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>A: Yes, correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-18\">Q: And again you were still trying to protect your boyfriend?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-19\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-20\">Q: Because you still were seeing him at the jail, weren\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the Federal Sentencing Guidelines violate the Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury to the extent that they permit a judge to increase a defendant\u2019s sentence based on facts that are neither found by the jury nor admitted by the defendant. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738. To remedy this violation, the Court excised two specific provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, thereby rendering the guidelines \u201ceffectively advisory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245-46, 125 S.Ct. 738. As a result, a sentencing court must still \u201cconsider Guidelines ranges,\u201d but it may \u201ctailor the sentence in light of other statutory concerns as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245-46, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">In <em>Rodriguez, </em>we clarified that <em>Booker </em>error \u201cis not that there were extra-verdict enhancements \u2014 enhancements based on facts found by the judge that were not admitted by the defendant or established by the jury verdict \u2014 that led to an increase in the defendant\u2019s sentence. The error is that there were extra-verdict enhancements used in a <em>mandatory </em>guidelines system.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1300 (2005) (emphasis added). We further explained that \u201cthe use of extra-verdict enhancements in an advisory guidelines system is not unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1301; <em>see also United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1323-24 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that \u201c[njothing in <em>Booker </em>is to the contrary\u201d of a district court decision to base sentence enhancements, under an advisory guidelines scheme, on facts found by a preponderance of the evidence that were not charged in the indictment).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">Young\u2019s challenge to his sentence on appeal is that the district court violated <em>Booker </em>and Young\u2019s constitutional rights by enhancing his sentence based on facts not charged in his indictment or found beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury. At sentencing, the district court adopted the PSI\u2019s applicable guidelines range calculation. Nothing in <em>Booker </em>precluded the court from finding that the PSI\u2019s enhancements were supported by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See Chau, </em>426 F.3d at 1324. The court then explicitly recognized that the guidelines were advisory and considered other sentencing factors, as mandated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Thus, the district court did not err in enhancing Young\u2019s sentence based on extra-verdict facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">Upon review of the record, and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm Young\u2019s convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b868-6\">.
