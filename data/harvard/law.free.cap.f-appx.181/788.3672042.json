On appeal, she argues that the district court violated her Sixth Amendment rights and abused its discretion in sentencing her outside the advisory sentencing range of 8 to 14 months\u2019 imprisonment, as set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4. Specifically, she argues that if the court refuses to adhere to the Chapter 7 advisory sentencing range, it must resentenee her within, or at least consider, the original Guideline range for her underlying offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">In determining a defendant\u2019s sentence following the revocation of probation, a district court must consider the statutory requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565(a)(2), as well as the policy statements contained in Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Cook, </em>291 F.3d 1297, 1299-1301 (11th Cir.2002). The district court has statutory authority under \u00a7 3565(a)(2) to revoke a sentence of probation and resentence the defendant according to subchapter A, which includes the sentencing factors enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3551-59. The district court must also calculate an advisory sentencing range under Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4. Although the Chapter 7 policy statements focus on a defendant\u2019s violation of supervised release, \u201c[the] chapter, to the extent permitted by law, treats violations of the conditions of probation and supervised release as functionally equivalent.\u201d U.S.S.G. Ch. 7 pt. B, introductory comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Supreme Court had no occasion to address the Sixth Amendment implications of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565(a)(2) or of Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines. Before <em>Booker, </em>we held that following revocation of probation, \u201ca court is authorized to re-sentence a defendant without being restricted to the guideline range applicable at the time of the initial sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>Cook, </em>291 F.3d at 1300. In <em>Cook, </em>we also noted that the policy statements of Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines are merely advisory in imposing a sentence upon the revocation of probation. <em>Id. </em>at 1301. <em>Pre-Booker, </em>the Supreme Court explained that the Sixth Amendment is not applicable in revocation proceedings, and concluded that violations \u201cneed not be criminal and need only be found by a judge under a preponderance of the evidence standard.\u201d <em>See United States v. White, </em>416 F.3d 1313, 1318 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 694, 700, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 1800, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000) (addressing revocation of supervised release)). Sentencing following the revocation of probation has always been advisory. <em>Id. </em>Like \u00a7 3565, <em>Booker </em>also allows for advisory sentencing based on factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). 543 U.S. at 261, 125 S.Ct. at 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">Upon review of the record and the sentencing transcript, and upon consideration of the briefs of the parties, we discern no reversible error. Despite the lower advisory Guideline range, the record demonstrates that the district court imposed Lamelas-Linares\u2019s sentence of 36 months\u2019 imprisonment after considering a range of evidence, the Chapter 7 Guidelines imprisonment range of 8 to 14 months, the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, and the maximum statutory sentence for each count of her original conviction. Pursuant to our decision in <em>Cook, </em>the district court may exercise its discretion to resentence Lame<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>las-Linares outside the original Guideline range. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
