Castro was sentenced to 63 months of imprisonment and a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Castro argues that the district court plainly erred in increasing his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L 1.2(b)(1)(A) for a drug trafficking offense based on his prior conviction for a California drug offense. The Government concedes in a motion to vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing that the statute under which Castro was convicted could be violated by conduct that did not include a drug trafficking offense within the meaning of the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Because Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11352(a) encompasses acts that are not included in the definition of a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d in the context of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l), the district court committed plain error in enhancing Castro\u2019s offense level based on the California offense. <em>See United States v. Gutierrez-Ramirez, </em>405 F.3d 352, 359 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 217, 163 L.Ed.2d 198 (2005). Castro\u2019s sentence is vacated and the case is remanded for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">The Government in its motion seeks permission to supplement the record at resentencing with documents to support the enhancement. The Government admits that Castro\u2019s indictment merely tracked the language of the statute and does not establish that the offense was a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under the Guidelines. The district court should allow the Government to supplement the record with only those documents authorized under the categorical approach sanctioned by <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1257, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) to determine whether Castro\u2019s prior conviction was a drug trafficking offense within the meaning of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). <em>See United States v. Bonilla-Mungia, </em>422 F.3d 316, 320 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Gutierrez-Ramirez, </em>405 F.3d at 358-59. Thus, the Government\u2019s motion for permission to supplement the record at resentencing is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">Castro argues that his sentence of imprisonment and supervised release exceeds the statutory maximum for the charged offense and that his sentence should be reduced to a maximum of two years of imprisonment and one year of supervised release pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). He argues that the holding in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) cast doubt on the validity of the decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) that a prior conviction is a sentencing factor and not an element of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-12\">Castro\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>Although Castro contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Castro properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-13\">AFFIRM CONVICTION; VACATE SENTENCE; REMAND FOR RESEN-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>TENCING; GRANT MOTION TO SUPPLEMENT THE RECORD.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b497-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
