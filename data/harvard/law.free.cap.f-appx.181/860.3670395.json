On appeal, Velasco argues that, following its decision in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), a majority of the Supreme Court now would decline to reaffirm <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), in which the Supreme Court held that a prior conviction is not a fact which must be admitted by defendant or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">Because Velasco preserved the issue below, we review <em>de novo </em>the constitutional challenge to his sentence. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">The maximum statutory sentence for unlawful re-entry is 2 years. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). However, where a defendant was deported subsequent to a conviction for an aggravated felony, the statutory maximum is 20 years. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). A drug trafficking crime is considered an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1326(b)(2). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-13\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the Supreme Court held that a prior conviction is not a fact which must be admitted by a defendant or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. 523 U.S. at 230, 118 S.Ct. at 1219. In its subsequent decisions in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), as well as <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Supreme Court reaffirmed the holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres. See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Court held that <em>\u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, </em>any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63 (emphasis added). The Court revisited <em>Apprendi </em>in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>clarifying \u201cthat the \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant </em>[;]\u201d it did not disturb <em>Apprendi\u2019s </em>exception for prior convictions. <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. at 303, 124 S.Ct. at 2537 (emphasis in original). Subsequently, in <em>Booker, </em>the Court held that Blakely applied to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and reaffirmed its holding in <em>Apprendi. </em>543 U.S. at 243-44, 125 S.Ct. at 755-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>Shortly after handing down its decision in <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court decided <em>Shepard, </em>upon which Velasco mounts his argument. In <em>Shepard, </em>the Supreme Court limited the types of evidence a district court can constitutionally consider to determine whether a prior burglary conviction qualifies as a violent felony for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) where the statutory definition of burglary includes both violent and non-violent conduct. <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 15-17, 125 S.Ct. at 1257. A plurality of the Court explained that, while a dispute over whether a burglary was a violent felony for purpose of the ACCA could be \u201cdescribed as a fact about a prior conviction, it [was] too far removed from the conclusive significance of a prior judicial record, and too much like the findings subject to <em>Jones [v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999) ] and <em>Apprendi </em>to say that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>clearly authorizes a judge to resolve the dispute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25, 125 S.Ct. at 1262.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Since <em>Shepard, </em>we have consistently held that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains good law \u201cuntil the Supreme Court determines that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is not controlling precedent.\u201d <em>United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 963 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 223, 163 L.Ed.2d 191 (2005). <em>See also United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1316 n. 3 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 457, 163 L.Ed.2d 347 (2005)(\u201cAlthough recent decisions, including <em>Shepard </em>..., may arguably cast doubt on the future prospects of <em>Ahmendarez-Torres\u2019s </em>holding regarding prior convictions, the Supreme Court has not explicitly overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>As a result, we must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres.\u201d) </em>(citations omitted); <em>United States v. Cantellano, </em>430 F.3d at 1142, 1147 (11th Cir.2005)(\u201cThe fact of a prior conviction clearly may be found by the district court.\u201d); <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1329 (\u201c[A] district court does not err by relying on prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">Furthermore, the district court here, unlike in <em>Shepard, </em>did not resolve any undisputed facts. Velasco conceded at both the plea colloquy and the sentencing hearing that he had a prior conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. Moreover, at the plea colloquy, he stated that he understood he faced a maximum penalty of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. Thus, the district court made no findings of the sort about which the plurality warned in <em>Shepard. See Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 24-25, 125 S.Ct. at 1262.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">Upon review of the presentence investigation report, the sentencing transcript, and the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
