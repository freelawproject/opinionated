We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Jackson v. Houck, </em>No. CA-05-1412-8MBS (D.S.C. Oct. 28, 2005). We are confident that Judge Houck himself determined that Jackson\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion was moot and simply directed his law clerk to have the judge\u2019s decision noted on the docket maintained in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">We also find both Judge Houck and his law clerk are immune from suit. With respect to Judge Houck, judicial immunity attaches even if the act in question was in excess of his authority. <em>See Mireles v. Waco, </em>502 U.S. 9, 12-13, 112 S.Ct. 286, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991). Likewise, law clerks like Dargan are also entitled to absolute judicial immunity \u201cwhen assisting the judge in carrying out the former\u2019s judicial functions.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. McBryde, </em>944 F.2d 229, 230 (5th Cir.1991); <em>see also Oliva v. Heller, </em>839 F.2d 37, 40 (2d Cir.1988). Absolute immunity \u201capplies to all acts of auxiliary court personnel that are basic and integral part[s] of the judicial function.\u201d <em>Sindram v. Suda, </em>986 F.2d 1459, 1461 (D.C.Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). This formulation \u201cenables the immunity to operate where the need for liability in damages is low and the need for a backstop to judicial immunity high.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An action for damages against a clerk is \u201cnot necessary to control unconstitutional conduct in light of the numerous safeguards that are built into the judicial process, especially the eorrectability of error on appeal.\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b397-7\"> Insofar as Jackson may be claiming Judge Houck and Dargan were negligent, he is not entitled to relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000). <em>Pink v. Lester, </em>52 F.3d 73, 74-75 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
