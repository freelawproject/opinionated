No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>In his amended \u00a7 1983 complaint and related pleadings, Rice stated that, in 1997, he pled guilty to armed robbery and aggravated assault. He received concurrent 15-year sentences. He claimed that, under the parole guidelines applicable when he was sentenced, he was required to serve only 1/3 of his sentence before becoming eligible for parole. Rice argued, among other things, that Defendants (the Attorney General of Georgia, the members of the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles, and others) retroactively applied a Georgia law allegedly requiring Rice to serve all of his sentence, thus resulting in a violation of the <em>ex post facto </em>clause and of Rice\u2019s due process rights. Rice requested that the district court (1) force the state trial court to consider a motion for resentencing, (2) compel Defendants to \u201cprepare [his] case for parole,\u201d and (3) award him attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, the district court is to review a prisoner\u2019s civil complaint against a government entity to identify cognizable claims or to dismiss the complaint, or any portion of the complaint, if the complaint is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a), (b). Sections 1915A(b)(l) and 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae both require the district court to review and to dismiss a prisoner\u2019s civil complaint if the court determines that the claims are frivolous. Thus, it stands to reason that the standard of review is the same under both provisions. We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a complaint as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae; so we also will review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s dismissal of Rice\u2019s complaint as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. <em>See Napier v. Preslicka, </em>314 F.3d 528, 531 (11th Cir.2002), cert. <em>denied, </em>540 U.S. 1112, 124 S.Ct. 1038, 157 L.Ed.2d 901 (2004). An action is considered \u201cfrivolous\u201d if it is \u201cwithout arguable merit either in law or fact.\u201d <em>Bilal v. Driver, </em>251 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">Claims challenging the fact of conviction or duration of the sentence \u201cfall within the \u2018core\u2019 of habeas corpus,\u201d while claims challenging the conditions of confinement may be brought in a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>Nelson v. Campbell, </em>541 U.S. 637, 124 S.Ct. 2117, 2122, 158 L.Ed.2d 924 (2004). Rice indicated to the district court that he was challenging only the \u201clength\u201d of his confinement. And Rice sought to have the district court force the state trial court to consider a motion for resentencing and to set his case for parole. Reading Rice\u2019s complaint liberally, Rice is challenging the propriety and duration of his sentence, as well as the execution of his sentence. Rice\u2019s exclusive remedy for these claims was to file a federal habeas corpus petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">To the extent Rice\u2019s complaint challenges the validity of the procedures for establishing parole eligibility, which may be cognizable in a \u00a7 1983 proceeding, <em>see Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 1248, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005), we reject that challenge. Rice\u2019s claim of a due process violation is foreclosed by <em>Sultenfuss v. Snow, </em>35 F.3d 1494, 1502 (11th Cir.1994), where this Court determined that Georgia\u2019s parole procedure does not create a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">And we discern no <em>ex post facto </em>violation. Rice contends that Defendants retroactively applied O.C.G.A. \u00a7 17-10-6.1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>which provides that a defendant convicted of aggravated armed robbery, where his sentence is less than life imprisonment, is required to serve his sentence in its entirety without entitlement to parole. <em>See </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 17-10-6.1(a), (c)(3). But this law became effective on 1 January 1995, before Rice pled guilty in 1997. Rice, thus, has not shown how this law was applied retroactively to increase his sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">Given the lack of arguable merit in Rice\u2019s claims, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b927-6\">. The district court did not rely on this ground in dismissing Rice\u2019s complaint. But we may affirm the district court's disposition of a case <em>on any </em>adequate ground. <em>See Parks v. City of Warner Robins, </em>43 F.3d 609, 613 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b928-18\">. Rice cites to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 42-9-45 to support that he would become eligible for parole after serving 1/3 of his sentence. But the version of \u00a7 42-9-45 applicable when Rice pled guilty in 1997 reads <em>\"[e]xcept as otherwise provided in Code Sections 17-10-6.1 </em>and 17-10-7, an inmate serving a felony sentence or felony sentences shall only be eligible for consideration for parole after the expiration of nine months of his or her sentence or one-third of the time of the sentences, whichever is greater.\u201d O.C.G.A. \u00a7 42-9-45 (1997) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
