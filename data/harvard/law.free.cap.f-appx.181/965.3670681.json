On appeal, Themeli argues that the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s findings with regard to his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief were not supported by substantial evidence. We will review each form of relief sought in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-14\">I. Asylum</p>\n<p id=\"b990-15\">Concerning his asylum application, Themeli argues that he had demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution. Themeli further challenges the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, asserting that his statements in the asylum officer\u2019s summary of his credible fear interview are not inconsistent with his testimony from his hearing. Themeli contends that the credible fear interview lasted a short time and only a summary of his problems was discussed. Themeli maintains that, based on the record and Professor Bernd Fischer\u2019s testimony, he established that he holds political views contrary to those of the Socialist Party, the Socialist Party has engaged in violence toward political figures, and that he was detained and beaten several times \u201cby the secret police and at the order of a government prosecutor.\u201d Themeli also argues that the IJ erred in finding that Themeli\u2019s true identity was questionable based only on the existence of two passports with different dates of birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-16\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s findings, adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning, and briefly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>articulated its reasons for doing so. Thus, we review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">To the extent that the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s decisions were based on legal determinations, bur review is <em>de novo. D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). The IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84 (quotation omitted). Therefore, a finding of fact will be reversed \u201conly when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal....\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc), <em>ceH. denied, </em>544 U.S. 1035, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (\u201c[T]he administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary....\u201d). Likewise, a credibility determination is reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and \u201cthis court may not substitute [its] judgment for that of the BIA with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">To establish eligibility for asylum, an applicant has the burden of proving that he is a \u201crefugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adl\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">To establish asylum eligibility through a well-founded fear, an applicant must prove that his statutorily protected status will cause harm or suffering that rises to the level of persecution. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (citations omitted). \u201cIn order to demonstrate a sufficient connection between future persecution and the protected activity, an alien is required \u2018to present specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account\u2019 of such a protected activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201cEstablishing a history of past persecution creates a presumption that an alien has a well-founded fear of future persecution, although that presumption can be rebutted by the government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-12\">\u201cThe testimony of an applicant, if found to be credible, is alone sufficient to establish\u201d eligibility for asylum.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. at </em>1287. Indications of rehable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>tency with the written application, and the absence of embellishment as the applicant repeatedly recounts his story. <em>See In re B-, </em>21 I &amp; N Dec. 66, 70, 1995 WL 326740 (BIA 1995); <em>see also Dailide v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>387 F.3d 1335, 1343 (11th Cir.2004) (affirming the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination, which was based upon its finding that the applicant's testimony conflicted with his answers to interrogatories, affidavit, deposition, and other documentary evidence). Although uncorroborated but credible testimony may be sufficient to sustain an applicant\u2019s burden of proving eligibility for asylum, \u201c[t]he weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony, however, the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">However, the IJ must provide \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d for her credibility finding. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. The Third and Ninth Circuits have persuasively held that \u201cminor inconsistencies and minor admissions that reveal nothing about an asylum applicant\u2019s fear for his safety are not an adequate basis for an adverse credibility finding.\u201d <em>Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d Cir.2002) (internal quotation omitted); <em>see also Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001). Further, \u201can adverse credibility determination does not alleviate the IJ\u2019s duty to consider other evidence produced by an asylum applicant.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. Nevertheless, when the IJ notes an applicant\u2019s inconsistencies and provides specific cogent reasons which are supported by the record, \u201cwe will not substitute our judgment for that of the IJ with respect to its credibility findings.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">Based on the numerous testimonial and documentary inconsistencies in the record, and given the fact that Themeli failed to address most of them in his appellate brief, the IJ\u2019s finding that Themeli was not credible is supported by substantial evidence. Because the IJ\u2019s credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence, the record does not retain enough, if any, credible claims that could support Themeli\u2019s application for asylum. Moreover, even if some of the record evidence weighs in Themeli\u2019s favor, a review of the entire record, including Themeli\u2019s weak and inconsistent testimony, certainly does not compel reversal. <em>See Adefemi, </em>386 F.3d at 1027 (\u201cthe mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal ... \u201d). As such, the IJ\u2019s determination that Themeli did not establish his eligibility for asylum is also supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">II. Withholding of Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">Themeli argues that, for the reasons he stated with regard to his eligibility for asylum, he is likewise eligible for withholding of removal. Themeli further contends that he clearly established that his life was in danger in Albania and that it is more likely than not that he would be targeted by the socialists upon return to Albania. Themeli also maintains that, as a political activist, he would \u201cstand out in the crowd\u201d if he returned to Albania.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-9\">To establish eligibility for withholding of removal, the applicant must meet a standard more stringent than the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d asylum standard, and \u201cshow that h[is] life or freedom would \u2018more likely than not\u2019 be threatened upon return to his country because of, among other things, his political opinion.\u201d <em>Huang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>429 F.3d 1002, 1010-11 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A)). Thus, an appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>cant who is unable to meet the standard for asylum is also unable to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>Huang, </em>429 F.3d at 1011.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">Because we conclude from the record that Themeli failed to meet the asylum standard, his claim for withholding of removal must fail as well. Thus, we hold that BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">III. CAT Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">Themeli argues on appeal that he is entitled to CAT relief because he suffered torture and beatings from the prosecutor\u2019s guards, who Themeli concludes are government officials or, at least, persons acting on behalf of government officials. Themeli asserts that, if returned to Albania, he would more likely than not be tortured.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">An alien is entitled to withholding of removal under the CAT if he establishes that it is \u201cmore likely than not that he or she will be tortured if removed8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2); <em>see also Cadet v. Bulger, </em>377 F.3d 1173, 1180 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cTorture\u201d is \u201cany act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person ... by or at the instigation of ... a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1); <em>see also D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 819-20. \u201cTorture is an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment and does not include lesser forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that do not amount to torture.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">As explained above, the IJ\u2019s determination, that Themeli and his various accounts concerning the threats and beatings that he sustained in Albania are not credible, is supported by substantial evidence. Moreover, Themeli does not point to any other treatment that he received that was found credible and could amount to \u201ctorture\u201d as defined in the regulations. Therefore, the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s findings with regard to CAT relief are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-11\">For the above-stated reasons, we deny Themeli\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-12\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b991-8\">. The REAL ID Act of 2005 amended the law regarding credibility determinations by adding INA \u00a7\u00a7 208(b)(3)(B)(iii), 1229a(c)(4)(C). Section 101(a)(3) and (d), Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, 303, 304-305. The Act states, however, that these provisions \"shall apply to applications for asylum, withholding, or other relief from removal made on or after\u201d the date of enactment of the act, May 11, 2005. Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. at 305. Therefore, because Themeli's application for asylum was filed before May 11, 2005, these provisions do not apply in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
