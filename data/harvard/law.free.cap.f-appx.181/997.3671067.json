Johnson appeals from an order of the Merit Systems Protection Board, Docket No. PH-0831-04-0568-1-1, in which the Board rejected her claim that she was entitled to benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System (\u201cCSRS\u201d) based <em>on </em>the former employment <em>of </em>her deceased husband. We <em>vacate and remand.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-11\">Ms. Johnson\u2019s late husband, Maurice P. Johnson, was a federal civil service employee for more than 20 years, until he left the federal service in 1980. After leaving the federal service, he applied for disability retirement, but his application was denied. Thereafter, he filed an application for a refund of the retirement contributions he had made during his service. On two of his refund applications, dated October 20, 1988, and <em>December </em>16, 1988, Mr. Johnson certified that he was not married, even though Ms. Johnson represents that he was in fact married to her at that time. On December 20, 1988, a refund in the amount of $11,616.16 was authorized to be paid to Mr. Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-13\">Mr. Johnson died in 2003. After his death, Ms. Johnson filed an application for survivor benefits based on Mr. Johnson\u2019s period of federal service. The Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d), however, advised her that no benefits were payable because all of Mr. Johnson\u2019s retirement contributions had previously been refunded to him. On Ms. Johnson\u2019s request for reconsideration, OPM affirmed its initial decision denying her request for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-14\">Ms. Johnson appealed OPM\u2019s reconsideration decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board. The administrative judge assigned to her case upheld OPM\u2019s decision. The judge noted that because Mr. Johnson had withdrawn his retirement contributions after leaving the federal service, neither he nor any survivor was entitled to a CSRS annuity. Ms. Johnson argued that she was not informed of Mr. Johnson\u2019s 1988 application for a refund of his retirement contributions, and that OPM was under a duty to ensure that she was notified of his refund application. In response to that argument, the administrative judge held that although the law required that an employee\u2019s spouse be informed of the employee\u2019s withdrawal of retirement contributions \u2014 and the consequent forfeiture of his retirement annuity rights and her rights to a survivor annuity \u2014 the obligation to provide such notice fell upon the employee, not OPM. The administrative judge noted that OPM had advised Mr. Johnson that he had an obligation to notify a current or former spouse of his refund application. The administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>tive judge held that OPM had reasonably relied on Mr. Johnson\u2019s statement that he was not married, even though that statement was false. Therefore, the administrative judge held that there was no legal basis to grant Ms. Johnson\u2019s request for any relief based on her lack of notice of Mr. Johnson\u2019s refund application. After the full Board denied her petition for review, Ms. Johnson sought review by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">The government concedes that the administrative judge erred when he ruled that OPM was not required to cross-check Mr. Johnson\u2019s refund application with his personnel file. However, the government argues that the error was harmless and that the Board\u2019s decision should be upheld on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">In 1984, the Civil Service Retirement Act was amended to provide that OPM would pay a lump-sum refund of retirement contributions to an employee \u201conly if any spouse and any former spouse of the employee ... are notified of the employee\u2019s ... application.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8342(j). The statute further provides that the payment of the lump-sum refund of retirement contributions \u201cshall be subject to the terms of a court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation or any court order or court approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree\u201d if the decree, order, or agreement expressly relates to any portion of the lump-sum credit, and if payment of the lump-sum refund would extinguish the employee\u2019s or the spouse\u2019s right to a CSRS annuity. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">In <em>Muwwakkil v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>18 F.3d 921 (Fed.Cir.1994), this court held that as a part of the process of refunding retirement contributions, OPM has a duty to go beyond an employee\u2019s representation that he or she had no spouse or former spouse. Instead, the court held, OPM must examine the employee\u2019s personnel file to determine if there was such a spouse or former spouse who might have rights with respect to the refund or a later survivor annuity that would be forfeited upon payment of the refund. Accordingly, the court held in the <em>Muwwakkil </em>case that OPM had failed to comply with its obligations to ensure that Ms. <em>Muwwakkil </em>had been informed of her former husband\u2019s refund application. The court further held, however, that in order for Ms. <em>Muwwakkil </em>to obtain any relief as a result of OPM\u2019s failure to comply with those notification responsibilities, the Board would have to conclude that she had been harmed by the absence of notification. 18 F.3d at 926. The court noted that it was not clear whether, if Ms. <em>Muwwakkil </em>had been given timely notice of the proposed refund, she would have sought, and could have obtained, a modification of the decree that would have given her rights with respect to her husband\u2019s retirement contributions. Accordingly, the court remanded the case to the Board to determine if Ms. <em>Muwwakkil </em>was prejudiced by not being notified about the refund application filed by her ex-husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">This case is not sufficiently different from <em>Muwwakkil </em>to justify a different result. We therefore adopt the same disposition \u2014 to remand to the Board for a harmless error determination. The only potentially material difference between this case and <em>Muwwakkil </em>is that Ms. <em>Muwwakkil </em>was divorced from her federal employee husband, and there was an existing divorce decree, while Ms. Johnson was apparently separated from Mr. Johnson but not divorced. The government seizes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>on that difference and argues that the divoi'ce decree in <em>Muwwakkil </em>\u201cmay have been subject to modification.\u201d Based on its conclusion that Ms. Johnson had not taken \u201cany apparent action ... to preserve any interest in Mr. Johnson\u2019s property,\u201d the government argues that a remand for a harmless error determination, which was required in <em>Muwwakkil, </em>is not appropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">We disagree. So far as the record reflects, neither Ms. <em>Muwwakkil </em>nor Ms. Johnson had any court order or agreement that gave either of them a legal right to the proceeds of the refund application at the time they were supposed to be notified. Nonetheless, this court held that Ms. <em>Muwwakkil </em>was entitled to an opportunity to demonstrate that if she had been notified of the pending refund application, she would have taken steps to preserve her interest in the refund. The fact that Ms. <em>Muwwakkil </em>had a divorce decree that might have been subject to modification is a factor that might have made it easier for her to find a vehicle through which to protect her interests, but the presence of a divorce decree in that case and not in this one is not a difference that, in our view, justifies a different treatment of the two cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">Because the Board held that there was no error in this case, it had no occasion to explore the question whether OPM\u2019s error was prejudicial. Thus, the government has raised that issue for the first time in this court. The highly factual inquiry into whether the error in this case was prejudicial is not one that we are in a position to conduct in the first instance, at least where the record is as incomplete with respect to the issue of prejudice as it is in this case. Because we are not in a position, based on the limited record before us, to make the kind of factual inquiry necessary to determine whether Ms. Johnson has been prejudiced by the absence of notification of the refund application, we hold that the proper course, as in <em>Muwwakkil, </em>is to remand this case so that the Board can address that issue in the first instance and can make whatever factual findings may be necessary to address the issue of prejudice. Accordingly, we remand this case to the Board to determine whether OPM\u2019s failure to notify Ms. Johnson of the pending refund application prejudiced her, or whether the error can be disregarded as harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">We have examined Ms. Johnson\u2019s other claims and find them to be without merit.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1024-8\">MAYER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AN3\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-9\">Because vacatur and remand here will require the board to speculate as to whether there was harmful error, and because I do not believe <em>Muwwakkil v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>18 F.3d 921 (Fed.Cir.1994), requires remand in this case, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-10\">In <em>Muwwakkil, </em>there was an existing divorce decree legally separating the former spouses\u2019 assets, which was capable of modification by the court and which evidenced the former spouses\u2019 intent to separate their assets. Here, Johnson does not claim that she was legally separated from Mr. Johnson, or that there was any court-approved property settlement agreement awarding her a portion of Mr. Johnson\u2019s property. Thus, vacatur and remand, given the absence of any court intervention separating the Johnsons\u2019 assets, will require significant speculation by the board as to whether there was harmful error, <em>ie., </em>remand will require the board to decide if Johnson would have actually sought (and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>received) either a legal separation or a court-approved property settlement agreement had she known about the lump-sum payment to Mr. Johnson.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
