Jones appeals the district court\u2019s affirmance of the Social Security Administration\u2019s (\u201cSSA\u201d) denial of supplemental security income (\u201cSSI\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(c)(3), and disability insurance benefits (\u201cDIB\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). On appeal, Jones argues that the administrative law judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) determination that she was not disabled during the relevant time period was not supported by substantial evidence because (1) the ALJ did not consider the relevant medical evidence and Social Security Ruling (\u201cSSR\u201d) 02-2p, (2) the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question posed to the vocational expert did not comprehensively describe Jones\u2019s impairments, (3) the ALJ\u2019s finding with regard to Jones\u2019s mental impairment was not supported by substantial evidence, and (4) the ALJ\u2019s finding that Jones\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome was corrected by surgery was also not supported by substantial evidence. Jones further argues that the ALJ erred in failing to consider her eligibility for a closed period of disability. We will address each of Jones\u2019s arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-12\">I. ALJ\u2019s Determination of Not Disabled</p>\n<p id=\"b793-13\">We review a social security case to determine whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and whether the correct legal standards were applied. <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1439 (11th Cir.1997). The Commissioner\u2019s decision will not be disturbed \u201cif, in light of the record as a whole, it appears to be supported by substantial evidence,\u201d which is \u201cmore than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1439-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-14\">A claimant applying for disability benefits must prove that she is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512; <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). The Social Security Regulations outline a five-step sequential evaluation process for determining whether a claimant is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520; <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999). First, the claimant must show that she has not engaged in substantial gainful activity. <em>Jones, </em>190 F.3d at 1228. Second, she must prove she has a severe impairment or combination of impairments. <em>Id. </em>In step three, if her impairment meets or equals a listed impairment, she is automatically found disabled. <em>Id. </em>If it does not, she must move on to step four, where she must prove that she is unable to perform her past relevant work. <em>Id. </em>Finally, if the claimant cannot perform past relevant work, then the burden shifts to the Commissioner in the fifth step to show that there is other work available in significant numbers in the national economy that the claimant is able to perform. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b794-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>A. Medical Evidence and SSR 02-2p</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">On appeal, Jones argues that the ALJ\u2019s decision did not properly incorporate the clarification issued by the Commissioner\u2019s SSR 02-2p to the extent that the ruling indicates that (1) chronic fatigue may be associated with IC, and (2) IC symptoms and the effectiveness of a given treatment can vary. Jones maintains that the ALJ\u2019s finding, that the record did not corroborate a systemic source for her fatigue, is contradicted by SSR 02-2p. Jones also contends that Dr. Reisfield\u2019s report directly contradicted the ALJ\u2019s findings that (1) Jones\u2019s claim that she needed to lie down two or three times per day was self-serving, and (2) Jones can sustain sedentary work activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Social Security Ruling 02-2p clarifies the Commissioner\u2019s policies for evaluating claims for disability on the basis of IC. 67 Fed.Reg. 67436-01. Social Security rulings \u201care binding on all components of the Social Security Administration.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.35(b)(1). According to SSR 02-2p, IC <em>\u201cmay </em>be associated with other disorders,\u201d including chronic fatigue syndrome. 67 Fed.Reg. 67436-01 (emphasis added). Once the ALJ determines that a claimant has an IC impairment, the ALJ must determine, in accordance with the five-step sequential evaluation process, whether the impairment prevents the claimant from doing past relevant work or other work existing in substantial numbers in the national economy. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Here, Jones maintains that the ALJ\u2019s finding, that \u201cthe record does not corroborate any systemic source for\u201d Jones\u2019s chronic fatigue, is not consistent with SSR 02-2p because the ruling explicitly states that chronic fatigue may be associated with IC. However, SSR 02-2p simply notes that some IC claimants <em>may </em>also have chronic fatigue. The ruling, therefore, does not <em>require </em>a finding of chronic fatigue for each claimant that has IC. Further, as the Commissioner notes, the ALJ\u2019s written decision is consistent with SSR 02-2p in that the ALJ followed the five-step sequential evaluation process once the ALJ made a finding that Jones had an IC impairment. <em>See </em>67 Fed.Reg. 67436-01. Thus, although the ALJ\u2019s decision does not specifically cite to SSR 02-2p, the record nevertheless does not support Jones\u2019s contention that the ALJ failed to consider SSR 02-2p or to properly incorporate the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">Additionally, Jones argues that the ALJ failed to \u201caccurately and completely report the opinion of Dr. Reisfield\u201d with regard to Dr. Reisfield\u2019s conclusions on Jones\u2019s inability to work. The Commissioner maintains that Jones waived this issue by failing to raise it before the district court. <em>See also Jones, </em>190 F.3d at 1228 (declining to consider an argument raised for the first time on appeal). As Jones notes in her reply, however, she did assert in the district court that the district court overlooked Dr. Reisfield\u2019s assessment that Jones\u2019s symptoms were \u201cexacerbated by standing, walking, or sitting\u201d (although Jones did not mention Dr. Reisfield by name, she did cite to his report following her assertion). Thus, to the extent that Jones argues on appeal that the ALJ did not completely and accurately report that specific portion of Dr. Reisfield\u2019s opinion, her argument is not waived. In all other respects concerning Dr. Reisfield\u2019s report, however, Jones has waived those arguments. <em>See Jones, </em>190 F.3d at 1228.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">Nonetheless, Jones\u2019s argument is without merit because the ALJ clearly determined that Jones was limited to sedentary work activities in which she was not required to climb, crawl, stoop, or bend, and in which she would have the option to alternate between sitting and standing. Moreover, the ALJ noted that Dr. Reisfield found that Jones\u2019s symptoms were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>\u201cexacerbated by standing, walking, or sitting,\u201d and that \u201c[l]ying down, an IC diet, opioids, and inferential therapy ameliorated her symptoms.\u201d Thus, the ALJ\u2019s assessment is consistent with the findings set forth in Dr. Reisfield\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">B. Hypothetical Question to the Vocational Expert</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">On appeal, Jones argues that the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical did not include Jones\u2019s impairments with regard to her decreased ability to concentrate and focus. Jones asserts that the ALJ did not incorporate Dr. Yates\u2019s finding, that her ability to concentrate was impacted by her physical impairments, into the hypothetical.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Despite the ALJ\u2019s finding at step four of the sequential evaluation, that Jones could perform her past relevant work as a telemarketer, the ALJ went on to step five of the sequential evaluation and posed a hypothetical to the vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d) to determine whether Jones could perform other work that existed in significant numbers in the national economy. In order for a VE\u2019s testimony to constitute substantial evidence that a claimant can perform other work, \u201cthe ALJ must pose a hypothetical question which comprises all of the claimant\u2019s impairments.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>190 F.3d at 1229.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">First, the ALJ found that Jones\u2019s activities of leading an IC support group, attending church, visiting her sister, reading, watching television, and using the computer did not support a finding that Jones\u2019s concentration was deficient. The ALJ noted that Jones did not indicate that she had any difficulty comprehending or following along when she read, watched television, or used the computer. Based on Jones\u2019s own testimony, then, the ALJ did not have reason to suspect that Jones had concentration difficulties. Second, Dr. Yates\u2019s report indicated that Jones\u2019s thought process was coherent, her concentration and memory abilities were fair, and her orientation was good. Dr. Yates also found that Jones had good judgment and a strong work ethic, but that her many physical problems seemed to impede her employ ability. Therefore, Dr. Yates\u2019s report, coupled with Jones\u2019s own testimony concerning her daily activities, do not necessitate a finding that Jones has severe impairments in her concentration. Accordingly, the ALJ\u2019s decision not to include Jones\u2019s concentration abilities in the hypothetical to the VE is supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>See Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1161 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that an ALJ is \u201cnot required to include findings in the hypothetical that the ALJ [has] properly rejected as unsupported\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">C. Jones\u2019s Mental Impairments</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">Jones argues on appeal that the ALJ\u2019s finding with regard to her mental status, specifically, that her mental problems were \u201csituational\u201d to stress over financial and family problems, was inaccurate and was not substantially supported by the record. Jones maintains that Dr. Larsen\u2019s assessment of Jones\u2019s mental status described her as more severely mentally impaired than the ALJ\u2019s decision suggested. Jones contends that Dr. Larsen found that Jones\u2019s mental status was \u201cvery complicated,\u201d while the ALJ found that her mental health was \u201csituational.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-12\">As the Commissioner notes, the ALJ\u2019s finding, that Jones did not suffer from mental impairments, was supported by substantial evidence. First, the ALJ\u2019s finding that Jones\u2019s mental difficulties were situational was consistent with Dr. Larsen\u2019s 2000 findings that, while Jones was not then depressed, she had suffered from depression and was living in a very stressful environment. Second, some of Jones\u2019s other treating physicians noted that Jones did not exhibit any evidence of a psychological impairment. Dr. Tran in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>dicated in 2001 that he did not find that Jones had any symptoms of a mental disorder. Further, Dr. Rowe noted in 2003 that Jones did not have any psychological symptoms, that her affect was normal, and that her mood was pleasant. Accordingly, the record substantially supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Jones\u2019s mental impairments, if any, were situational.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">D. Jones\u2019s Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">On appeal, Jones argues that her carpal tunnel syndrome was not corrected by surgery and that the ALJ\u2019s finding to the contrary was incorrect. Jones contends that Dr. Yoffee\u2019s report supports her assertion. Jones also maintains that Dr. Scales\u2019s report, that Jones suffered from \u201c \u2018simple chronic changes compatible with her prior carpal tunnel surgery but there were no acute changes,\u2019 \u201d actually means that she had continuing (chronic) problems rather than short but severe (acute).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Based on the record, the ALJ\u2019s finding \u25a0with regard to Jones\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome is supported by substantial evidence. Here, the ALJ found that \u201c[p]ostoperative examinations of [Jones\u2019s] upper extremities were negative for objective signs of nerve compression, and there is no evidence that her carpal tunnel syndrome was not corrected by surgery.\u201d In 2000, Dr. Yoffee found that, among Jones\u2019s multiple medical issues, \u201cher main problems appeared] to be recurrence of her carpal tunnel syndrome as well as severe depression and chronic anxiety.\u201d Dr. Yoffee\u2019s neurological and skeletal examinations were negative, and he recommended that Jones receive \u201cfurther neurological and psychiatric evaluation.\u201d Later in 2000, Dr. Scales performed an EMG/Nerve Conduction study, which revealed \u201csimple chronic changes compatible with [Jones\u2019s] prior carpal tunnel surgery but there were no acute changes.\u201d However, Dr. Scales did not recommend any further testing, treatment, or operations for Jones\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome. In May 2001, Dr. Tran examined Jones and found that Jones had a history of carpal tunnel that improved after surgery on both of her wrists. Dr. Tran also found that, while Jones had pain in her wrists, she did not have any (1) limitations of movement, (2) numbness, (3) difficulty with her grip, or (4) limitations of her gross and fine movements. Dr. Tran diagnosed that Jones had a carpal tunnel operation in both hands, but he did not recommend any further tests or treatment with respect to Jones\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">Given the medical evidence on the record, it cannot be said that the ALJ\u2019s determination, that Jones\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome had been corrected, was not supported by substantial evidence. In fact, Dr. Yoffee\u2019s examination, which indicated that Jones\u2019s main problems appeared to include the recurrence of her carpal tunnel syndrome, took place prior to Dr. Scales\u2019s and Dr. Tran\u2019s examinations that each found Jones\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome had not worsened. Further, even Dr. Yoffee did not make an explicit diagnosis that Jones had recurring carpal tunnel syndrome, nor did he suggest a treatment plan more than recommending additional neurological evaluation. It appears that Dr. Scales\u2019s and Dr. Tran\u2019s evaluations were just the additional testing that Dr. Yoffee called for, and those evaluations did not reveal that Jones\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome had not been corrected. Thus, the ALJ\u2019s finding with regard to Jones\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome was supported by substantial medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">II. Closed Period of Disability</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">On appeal, Jones also argues that, if the ALJ\u2019s determination that Jones did not suffer from disabling IC was correct, the ALJ should have considered Jones\u2019s eligibility for a closed period of disability because Jones\u2019s debilitating symptoms exceeded a 12-month duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>Jones\u2019s argument on appeal does not sufficiently provide us with the specific 12-month time period for which she believes she is entitled to a closed period of disability. Jones merely argues that her disability lasted more than 12 months. To the extent that Jones\u2019s argument is that her closed period of disability was the entire period from her alleged onset date until her administrative hearing, Jones\u2019s argument must fail because, based on the above analysis, the ALJ\u2019s finding, that Jones was not disabled for any time during that entire period, was supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, the ALJ did not err in failing to consider Jones\u2019s eligibility for a closed period of disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Upon review of the record, and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s affirmance of the SSA\u2019s denial of SSI and DIB.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
