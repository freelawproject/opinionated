Lab. Code Ann. \u00a7 21.051 (Vernon 2006)(\u201cTCHRA\u201d). Bayland moved for summary judgment, which the district court granted on May 31, 2005. Martin now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">I. <em>Background &amp; Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">Martin was born in 1930 and, from 1982 through 2003, worked at Bayland, a manufacturer of plastic products. For approximately eight years, he worked as an equipment operator; after that, and until he was terminated, Martin worked as a quality controller. Over the course of his employment with Bayland, Martin fell at least seven times. Following a December, 2002 fall at the office, which ultimately landed Martin in the hospital for hip surgery, Jim Moses, Bayland\u2019s owner, approached Martin to terminate his employment. In January 2003, he told Martin: \u201cI think it\u2019s time to hang it up and you \u2014 for you to retire.\u201d Martin submitted a claim to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which issued a right to sue letter. On May 19, 2004, Martin sued in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, which granted Bayland summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-16\">II. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-17\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Pegram v. Honeywell, Inc., </em>361 F.3d 272, 278 (5th Cir.2004). Summary judgment is appropriate if \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). An issue as to a material fact is \u201cgenuine\u201d if the evidence would permit a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the non-moving party. <em>Roberson v. Alltel Info. Servs., </em>373 F.3d 647, 651 (5th Cir.2004)(eiting <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)). The evidence must be construed in a light most favorable to the non-moving party and doubts resolved in its favor. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-19\">III. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-20\">Martin argues that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claim was in error because he presented sufficient direct or, alternatively, circumstantial evidence of discriminatory animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-21\">A. <em>Direct Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-22\">Martin argues that Moses\u2019 remark \u2014 \u201cI think it\u2019s time to hang it up and you \u2014 for you to retire\u201d \u2014 constitutes direct evidence of discrimination. Direct evidence is \u201cevidence that, if believed, proves the fact of discriminatory animus without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>inference or presumption.\u201d <em>Sandstad v. CB Richard Ellis, Inc., </em>309 F.3d 893, 897 (5th Cir.2002). Martin\u2019s evidence cannot be considered direct because it requires one to infer that he was fired because of his age based on Moses\u2019 comment that it was time for him to retire.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There is a link between retirement and age, but it is not a necessary one. Martin presents no direct evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">B. <em>Circumstantial Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"AXJa\">Martin does not present sufficient circumstantial evidence of discriminatory animus to survive summary judgment. ADEA \u201c[pllaintiffs producing only circumstantial evidence of discriminatory animus ... must negotiate the burden-shifting analysis set forth in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green.\u201d Machinchick v. PB Power, Inc., </em>398 F.3d 345, 350 (5th Cir.2005) (citing <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973)). In the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>analysis, once a plaintiff makes out a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination under Title VII, he or she is entitled to a presumption of discrimination, which the defendant may rebut by presenting a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. <em>Shackelford v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, LLP, </em>190 F.3d 398, 404 (5th Cir.1999). If the defendant succeeds in rebutting the presumption, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant\u2019s proffered reason for its action is pretextual. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">In granting summary judgment, the district court concluded that Martin failed to demonstrate that Bayland\u2019s proffered legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for filing him, economic considerations and safety, were pretextual. Martin argues that safety is not validly considered, and that both reasons are unworthy of credence and demonstrably false.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">There are two ways to avoid summary judgment in an ADEA case such as this, following the defendant\u2019s proffer of its legitimate, non-discriminatory reason: \u201c(1) the plaintiff may offer evidence showing that the defendant\u2019s proffered nondiscriminatory reasons are false; or (2) the plaintiff may offer evidence showing that his age was a motivating factor for the defendant\u2019s adverse employment decision.\u201d <em>Machinchick, </em>398 F.3d at 351 (citing <em>Rachid v. Jack in the Box, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 305, 312 (5th Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">Martin first dismisses Bayland\u2019s safety rationale. Based on Moses\u2019 affirmative reply in deposition that economic reasons were the only ones for which Martin was terminated, Martin argues the safety rationale is \u201cattorney dicta,\u201d mere speculation unsupported by admissible evidence. However, later in the same deposition, Moses discusses Martin\u2019s being a hazard to himself and other co-workers. Additionally, in its response to Martin\u2019s interrogatories, Bayland wrote that \u201cPlaintiffs position was eliminated for economic reasons. Additionally, the Plaintiff was unable to perform his duties in a safe manner.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rule 56 specifically identifies answers to interrogatories as a species of evidence on which a court may rely in granting summary judgment. The district court did not err in considering safety as one of Bay-land\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Martin attacks both the economic and safety rationales as false and unworthy of credence. He points to the fact that Moses did not mention either when he informed Martin of his termination, telling him instead that it was time to retire, as evidence of the rationales\u2019 falsity. This omission does not suggest that either rationale is false. Then, turning from imbuing Moses\u2019 words with extra meaning to stripping them of any, Martin argues, citing <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., </em>that the vacuity of the words is proof of an attempt to cover up the real reason for the termination, discrimination. 530 U.S. 133, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). <em>Reeves </em>is not helpful to Martin\u2019s cause. There, the Supreme Court held that a defendant\u2019s proof that an employer\u2019s proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for an adverse employment action was unworthy of credence could allow for a finding of discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 147-48, 120 S.Ct. 2097. Here, Martin provides only the reasons themselves as evidence of their lack of credence; no independent facts support his theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Martin also argues that pretext must be inferred because Bayland\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons conflict. Selectively quoting statements by Moses and Bayland, he identifies four reasons: (1) retirement, (2) safety, (3) elimination of the position and (4) economic reasons. The record supports Bayland\u2019s repeated claim that Martin was terminated because of safety and economic concerns,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and he fails to establish how these reasons conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Martin contends the safety rationale is speculative, legally insufficient and demonstrative of disparate treatment. Given the number of accidents Martin admitted to in his deposition, we find no error in the district court\u2019s characterization of a \u201cpattern\u201d of accidents. Martin argues that <em>Dothard v. Rawlinson </em>precludes Bayland from justifying the termination using Martin\u2019s safety. 433 U.S. 321, 97 S.Ct. 2720, 53 L.Ed.2d 786 (1977). We have never adopted this view of <em>Dothard. See e.g., Chiari v. City of League City, </em>920 F.2d 311, 316 (5th Cir.1991) (\u201c[T]he holding of <em>Dothard </em>supports a conclusion that the City <em>can </em>exclude Chiari from a job because of fears about his safety.\u201d) (emphasis in the original). Martin\u2019s attempt to establish disparate treatment by demonstrating that another worker also fell on the job does not succeed because he does not establish how that worker\u2019s single fall demanded the same treatment as the pattern of falls exhibited by Martin. He does not succeed in rebutting Bayland\u2019s safety rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Martin also attacks Bayland\u2019s economic rationale, denying the company had an economic need to terminate him. The only evidence he proffers to this effect is Bay-land\u2019s timing in terminating him and several notations on a company record of staff reduction, which indicate certain employees retired and were fired, rather than being laid off. With respect to the notations, while there is a lack of clarity from the record as to why each listed individual left Bayland\u2019s employment, it is not disputed that staff rolls were reduced by 50%. Martin\u2019s timing argument is that the company\u2019s failure to fire him months before, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>when economic problems became manifest and before things began to improve, demonstrates that the economic justification is pretextual. Because they are not inconsistent with terminating an employee for economic reasons, neither Bayland\u2019s failure to fire Martin earlier nor the fact its finances had begun to improve suffice to establish that the economic rationale was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Martin fails to rebut Bayland\u2019s proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for his termination. Pointing only to Moses\u2019 \u201cit\u2019s time to retire\u201d remark and two other innocuous retirement references,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Martin also fails to establish that age was a motivating factor in his termination. The word \u201cretire,\u201d does not, by its very use, bear this kind weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">IV. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">For the reasons above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b447-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-6\">. In <em>Sandstad, </em>we rejected as direct evidence comments requiring less of an inferential leap to animus than that required here. Stock analysts were quoted as complaining about \"too much grey hair\" in company management and a supervisor told the plaintiff that the Chief Executive Officer had decided to \"skip a generation\u201d in selecting plaintiff's replacement. 309 F.3d at 895. The <em>Sandstad </em>comments more directly implicate age than the word \"retire,\u201d at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b448-12\">. We find no merit to Martin\u2019s argument that \"perform[ing] his duties in a safe manner\u201d is a reason distinct from being a hazard to himself and to other employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b449-7\">. Two of these \"reasons\u201d are not actually proffered by Bayland. Forced retirement means nothing apart from the reasons driving it. Martin attempts to assign independent meaning to Moses' comment that it was time to retire, imputing to it ageism. This reading presupposes the discriminatory animus it is intended to prove. Likewise, Martin appears to manufacture position elimination as an independent reason proffered by Bayland for his dismissal. The letter to the EEOC on which he relies does not support his theory as it clearly identifies safety as a major concern, mentioning that the position had been eliminated only in passing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b450-17\">. In a company record, Martin was listed as having retired. Additionally, a workers' compensation insurance adjustor testified that, in March 2003, after Martin\u2019s December fall when he was not working and was receiving compensation for his injury, Moses told the adjuster Martin had retired. If anything, these references imply Moses believed Martin had retired.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
