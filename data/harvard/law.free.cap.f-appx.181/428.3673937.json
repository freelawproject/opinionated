The parties dispute whether we should treat this case as an appeal of the denial of a habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 or a petition for review under the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231 (May 11, 2005). Athough Congress was silent as to the effect of the Real ID Act on \u00a7 2241 cases pending on appeal, we have held that habeas petitions on appeal on May 11, 2005, the REAL ID Act\u2019s effective date, \u201care properly converted into petitions for review.\u201d <em>Rosales v. Bureau of Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement, </em>426 F.3d 733, 736 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1055, 163 L.Ed.2d 882 (2006). Accordingly, we will treat Galvan\u2019s appeal as a petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-22\">The parties also dispute whether we can consider only the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) decision or the decisions of the immigration judge (IJ) and BIA. This court generally has the authority to review only decisions of the BIA, not decisions of an IJ. <em>See Alarcon-Chavez v. Gonzales, </em>403 F.3d 343, 345 (5th Cir.2005). However, this court may review an IJ\u2019s decision if that decision had some impact on the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>In dismissing Galvan\u2019s appeal and affirming the IJ\u2019s decision, the BIA expressly, though succinctly, noted that the IJ had taken into account the positive and negative equities and made no clear error in his various factual conclusions. Because the BIA relied, at least in part, on the IJ\u2019s decision, we will consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s decisions. <em>Mikhael, </em>115 F.3d at 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Galvan raises four claims: (1) the BIA failed to issue a sufficiently reasoned decision that addressed the legal and factual issues which he raised; (2) the BIA\u2019s decision violated its regulations and did not satisfy Galvan\u2019s due process rights; (3) Galvan was substantially prejudiced by the BIA\u2019s failures; and (4) his appeal should have been referred to a three-member panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\n<em>Alleged Inadequacy of the BIA\u2019s Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Galvan alleges that the BIA failed to issue a sufficiently reasoned decision that addressed the legal and factual issues which he raised. In part, he bases this claim on assertions that this court can consider only the BIA\u2019s decision and that the BIA\u2019s decision standing alone fails to provide an adequate basis for this court to review the BIA\u2019s legal and factual conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">As noted above, this court can consider the decisions of the IJ and BIA in this petition for review. <em>See Mikhael, </em>115 F.3d at 302. The BIA\u2019s decision, while succinct, agreed with the IJ\u2019s extensive factual analysis and legal conclusions. The IJ considered Galvan\u2019s factual and legal arguments and, in compliance with BIA precedent, weighed the positive and negative equities. Because there is substantial evidence in the record to support the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s conclusions, Galvan\u2019s contention that the BIA\u2019s decision was inadequate is unavailing. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">\n<em>Alleged Violations of BIA Regulations and Galvan\u2019s Due Process Rights</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">Galvan contends that the BIA abused its discretion when it considered non-record factors, its workload and litigation priorities. This court has rejected similar arguments. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832-33 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">Galvan also asserts that the BIA failed to give meaningful consideration to the substantial evidence in favor of his claim and violated Galvan\u2019s due process rights by failing to engage in <em>de novo </em>review of the IJ\u2019s legal conclusions and application of pertinent standards. The BIA did not violate Galvan\u2019s due process rights by relying on the reasons set forth by the IJ. <em>Soadjede, </em>324 F.3d at 832-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">As noted above, the IJ considered the positive and negative equities as required by BIA precedent, including Galvan\u2019s claim of rehabilitation and the evidence opposed to this claim. After doing so, the IJ found that Galvan failed to carry his burden of showing he was entitled to \u00a7 212(c) relief. Because there is no evidence in the record which compels a contrary conclusion, the BIA did not abuse its discretion when it affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">Galvan also contends that the BIA abused its discretion by denying his unopposed motion to remand. The BIA routinely treats motions to remand as motions to reopen. <em>See Ogbemudia v. INS, </em>988 F.2d 595, 599-600 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Matter of Coelho, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 464, 471, 1992 WL 195806 (BIA 1992). The BIA applies the same standards to a motion to remand as it does to a motion to reopen, and this court reviews both motions for an abuse of discretion. <em>Ogbemudia, </em>988 F.2d at 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">The BIA must deny a motion to reopen if it finds that the movant has not introduced previously unavailable, material evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>dence or if the movant has not established a prima facie case for the underlying substantive relief sought. <em>Ogbemudia, </em>988 F.2d at 599-600. Further, even if a movant establishes those threshold requirements, the BIA may deny a motion to reopen if it determines that \u201cthe movant would not be entitled to the discretionary grant of relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 600 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Galvan\u2019s motion to remand. The IJ stated that his decision would not be affected even if Galvan\u2019s 1990 conviction had been lowered to a misdemeanor. Further, the IJ based his decision that Galvan failed to establish his rehabilitation, in part, on Galvan\u2019s use of cocaine in relation to the 2001 conviction. Thus, Galvan was not entitled to a remand based on his \u201cnew\u201d evidence related to his 1990 and 2001 convictions, and the BIA did not err when it failed to order a remand or to address the motion to remand. <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 139-40 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Ogbemudia, </em>988 F.2d at 599-600. <em>Alleged Need for Referral to a Three-Member Panel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Galvan contends that, under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(6)(iii), (v), (vi), a three-member panel was required to hear his appeal to the BIA. The immigration regulations state that, \u201c[ujnless a case meets the standards for assignment to a three-member panel under paragraph (e)(6) of this section, all cases shall be assigned to a single Board member for disposition.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e). A three-member panel is appropriate only if there is a need \u201cto review a decision by an immigration judge ... that is not in conformity with the law or with applicable precedents,\u201d \u201cto review a clearly erroneous factual determination by an immigration judge,\u201d or \u201cto reverse the decision of an immigration judge or the Service, other than a reversal under \u00a7 1003.1(e)(5).\u201d \u00a7 1003.1(e)(6)(iii), (v), (vi).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Galvan has not established that the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decisions did not comply with the law or BIA precedent. Similarly, he has not proven that the BIA\u2019s or IJ\u2019s decisions were based on clearly erroneous factual findings. Finally, Galvan has not established any other reasons that would require the BIA to reverse the IJ\u2019s decision. Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion when it failed to refer Gal-van\u2019s appeal to a three-member panel. <em>Alleged Prejudice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Galvan argues that he was substantially prejudiced by the BIA\u2019s failure to comply with its regulations and issue a sufficiently reasoned decision that addressed his factual and legal issues. The decisions issued by the IJ and BIA sufficiently evaluated Galvan\u2019s factual and legal claims, and Gal-van failed to establish that the BIA did not comply with its regulations. Because the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decisions complied with BIA regulations, due process requirements, and this court\u2019s precedent, Galvan\u2019s claim of prejudice is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">Accordingly, Galvan\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b453-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
