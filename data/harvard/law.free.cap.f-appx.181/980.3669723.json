Further, he argues that he belonged to a particular social group of veterinarians who helped small farmers improve their lives by increasing the fertility of their herds, and guerrillas persecuted him on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">A. Asylum</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). The IJ\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we should \u201caffirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. United States Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotations and citations omitted). The substantial evidence test is \u201cdeferential\u201d and does not allow \u201creweigh[ing] the evidence from scratch.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cTo reverse the IJ\u2019s fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003) (considering withholding-of-removal claim). The fact that evidence in the record may also support a conclusion contrary to the administrative findings is not enough to justify a reversal. <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006), <em>citing Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 1035, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Borrero and his wife did not suffer past persecution because although Borrero worked in an area controlled by guerrilla groups for almost two years, he was never physically harmed. Borrero testified that the guerrillas closely monitored him, stopped him and his wife at road blocks, and threatened him in person and over the telephone, but these incidents did not rise to the level of persecution. Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Borrero failed to establish a nexus between the feared harm and a protected ground. The evidence is consistent with a finding that the guerrilla groups harassed Borrero due to his refusal to cooperate with them rather than his actual or imputed political opinion. Moreover, Borrero has not met his burden of showing that he was targeted on account of his membership in a particular social group. He claims that his social group consisted of veterinarians who wanted to improve the lives of small farmers by providing education and technical assistance. However, he has not established that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>association comprises a cognizable group or that it shares an immutable characteristic.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">As Borrero has not established past persecution, he is not entitled to a presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Borrero does not have a well-founded fear of future persecution because (1) he was never physically harmed in Colombia; (2) he returned to Colombia after he entered the United States; (3) he was not harmed when he returned to Colombia; and (4) his parents and brother live in Bogota and have not been harmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">B. Withholding of Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">To qualify for withholding of removal under the INA, an alien must show that his or her life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). The evidentiary burden for withholding of removal is greater than that imposed for asylum, accordingly, if an alien has not met the well-founded fear standard for asylum, he generally cannot meet the standard for withholding of removal. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">The petitioners failed to carry their burden of establishing past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, which precludes them from being granted asylum. The IJ properly found that the petitioners likewise could not satisfy the greater \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d burden applicable to requests for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">C. Transcript Erros</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">The petitioners also argue that their case should be remanded because the asylum hearing transcript contains many indiscernible words, and, therefore, it is prejudicial. The petitioners did not allege in their notice of appeal or brief to the BIA that the asylum hearing transcript was of such poor quality that it prejudiced them. They argue for the first time on appeal that the asylum hearing transcript is prejudicial. Therefore, they have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies with respect to this claim, and we lack jurisdiction to review it. \u201cThe exhaustion requirement applicable to immigration cases is found in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), which provides that \u2018[a] court may review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sundar v. INS, </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2003). We have \u201cinterpreted that requirement to be jurisdictional, so we lack jurisdiction to consider claims that have not been raised before the BIA.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">Upon review of the record on appeal and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, se discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny petitioners\u2019 petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
