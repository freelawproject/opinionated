On appeal, McClendon argues that the district court erred in finding that exigent circumstances justified the warrantless entry into his motel room when there was no suspicious activity observed by the police or any indication that he was aware of police activity. McClendon also argues that according to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the district court violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights by relying on the fact of two prior convictions to enhance his sentence when neither conviction was alleged in the indictment or proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-15\">At the suppression hearing, the Government adduced the following. Elitsa Fernandez, a housekeeper at the motel in which McClendon was staying, entered McClendon\u2019s room and detected a \u201cgreat deal of heat,\u201d and saw that the smoke detector was covered with a towel. She noticed that stove burners were turned on, and she turned them off. On top of the counter she saw a big glass jar with some liquid inside, and on the table she saw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>what she described as little white pieces or stones that looked something like cereal. As she left, McClendon accosted and repeatedly asked her about what she had seen in the room. He grabbed her arm and threatened her. In response, she quickly left. McClendon followed her to the motel office.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">McClendon told the front desk worker that he was going to stay another day and that he did not want his room cleaned. He then looked threateningly at Fernandez. With the help of another, Fernandez, who did not speak English, told her manager what had occurred. The manager then called the police and told them that she suspected drug activity. When the police arrived, they spoke with both the manager and Fernandez and surmised that McClendon was cooking crack cocaine. One of the officers recognized McClendon\u2019s name as someone with a long history of drug dealing. The officers then knocked on McClendon\u2019s door and eventually kicked it in after McClendon had partially opened and attempted to reclose the door. They noticed a pungent odor, possibly cocaine, and found marijuana, cocaine, and crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">\u2018We apply a mixed standard of review to the denial of a defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, reviewing the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its application of law to those facts <em>de novo. </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Lyons, </em>403 F.3d 1248, 1250 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 732, 163 L.Ed.2d 576 (2005). Moreover, \u201call facts are construed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below.\u201d <em>United States v. Bervaldi </em>226 F.3d 1256, 1262 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">The Fourth Amendment provides that: \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated____\u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV. Warrantless searches and seizures inside a person\u2019s home are presumptively unreasonable. <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>720 F.2d 1520, 1525 (11th Cir.1983). However, a warrantless search or seizure may be justified where both probable cause and exigent circumstances exist. <em>Id. </em>Exigent circumstances exist where the delay in obtaining a warrant must yield to the urgent need for immediate action. <em>Id. </em>at 1526.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-12\">Narcotics cases present a compelling need for the exigent circumstances doctrine because \u201ccontraband and records can be easily and quickly destroyed while a search is progressing.\u201d <em>United States v. Young, </em>909 F.2d 442, 446 (11th Cir.1990). \u201cIn determining whether agents reasonably feared imminent destruction of the evidence, the appropriate inquiry is whether the facts, as they appeared at the moment of entry, would lead a reasonable, experienced agent to believe that evidence might be destroyed before a warrant could be secured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>825 F.2d 152, 156 (7th Cir.1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-13\">Circumstances are not normally considered exigent, however, where the suspects are unaware of police surveillance or where the police officers create the exigent circumstances. <em>United States v. Tobin, </em>923 F.2d 1506, 1511 (11th Cir.1991) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-14\">Here, the record shows that McClendon feared that Fernandez would report his drug activity to an authority. Although McClendon was not aware of the police activity, he knew that Fernandez was frightened, had gone straight to the motel front office after their encounter, and would probably notify an authority of what she had seen. McClendon argues that his renewal of the room for another day shows that he would not destroy or remove evidence of a crime. However, his renewal of the room does not overcome the weight of the other evidence. The officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>had knowledge of McClendon\u2019s past drug activity, and, reflecting on the foregoing facts, reasonably believed that McClendon would destroy the drug evidence in an attempt to avoid detection. <em>See Tobin, </em>923 F.2d at 1511.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Furthermore, the exigent circumstances were not created by the officers\u2019 knock on McClendon\u2019s motel room door; the exigent circumstances were created by McClendon\u2019s actions toward Fernandez. McClendon knew that Fernandez had entered his motel room where drug activity was in plain view. His threat to Fernandez led to her belief that something illegal was afoot in the room. McClendon was well aware that Fernandez saw the evidence of illegal activity in his room, was frightened of his response, and would probably report his activity after she fled his presence. Thus, the record shows that exigent circumstances justified the warrantless entry and that those circumstances were not created by the officers. Accordingly, we affirm the district court in denying McClendon\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">McClendon timely objected that his sentence was unconstitutionally enhanced based on prior convictions that were not alleged in the indictment and not proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, which violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights under <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Apprendi. </em>The fact and nature of McClendon\u2019s two prior convictions were made known in the PSI. In addition, at sentencing, the Government introduced expert testimony and evidence that the two convictions were, in fact, attributed to McClendon.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">We have reiterated on numerous occasions that <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), continues to control cases concerning enhancements based on prior convictions. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1246 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201c[T]he government need not allege in its indictment and need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had prior convictions for a district court to use those convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence.\u201d); <em>United States v. Cantellano, </em>430 F.3d 1142, 1147 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (\u201cThe fact of a prior conviction clearly may be found by the district court.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1604, 164 L.Ed.2d 325 (2006); <em>United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 962 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 223, 163 L.Ed.2d 191 (2005) (explaining that the Sixth Amendment is not implicated when a defendant\u2019s sentence is enhanced based on a prior conviction). McClendon\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-11\">Accordingly, we affirm both McClendon\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
