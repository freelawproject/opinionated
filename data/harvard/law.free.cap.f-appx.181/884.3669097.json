On appeal, Bryant argues that his motion to suppress the evidence, which was seized from his house pursuant to a search warrant, should have been granted because: (1) there was no reference in the warrant affidavit to the confidential informant\u2019s (Cl) veracity, reliability, or prior use; (2) the affiant made a recklessly false statement when he said that he had reason to believe that \u201cillegal narcotics are being kept and sold\u201d at Bryant\u2019s residence; and (3) there was no competent evidence to show ongoing drug activity or that Bryant was connected to it from police surveillance of another individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-20\">We review the district court\u2019s determination that an affidavit contains probable cause <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.2000). We give due deference to the inferences that the district court and law enforcement officers drew from the facts. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-21\">Based upon this record we cannot say that the district court erred. Because there was sufficient corroborating information that was not stale in the search warrant affidavit to support a finding of probable cause, even assuming arguendo that there was falsity in the officer\u2019s statement, the district court did not err by denying Bryant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
