Guanipa contends: (1) we should reconsider our decision in <em>Brown v. McFadden, </em>416 F.3d 1271 (11th Cir.2005), which upheld the BOP\u2019s time served interpretation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624; (2) <em>Brown </em>is distinguishable because, due to her lack of notice of 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 523.20,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the rule of lenity should apply in her case; and (3) <em>Brown </em>is distinguishable because it does not address the issue of whether the retroactive application of the BOP\u2019s interpretation violated the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause. The district court did not err, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-17\">I. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b957-18\">We review the denial of relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 de novo. <em>Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-19\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A24\">A. <em>Reconsideration of </em>Brown</p>\n<p id=\"b957-20\">We cannot reach a result contrary to a prior panel\u2019s decision unless that decision is inconsistent with an earlier decision. <em>Hurth v. Mitchem, </em>400 F.3d 857, 862 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-21\">While an intervening decision of the Supreme Court can overrule the decision of a prior panel of our court, the Supreme Court decision must be clearly on point. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number><em>See Florida League of Professional Lobbyists, Inc. v. Meggs, </em>87 F.3d 457, 462 (11th Cir.1996) (\u201c[W]e are not at liberty to disregard binding case law that is so closely on point and has been only weakened, rather than directly overruled, by the Supreme Court.\u201d) \u201cWithout a <em>clearly contrary </em>opinion of the Supreme Court or of this court sitting en banc, we cannot overrule a decision of a prior panel of this court....\u201d <em>National Labor Relations Board v. Datapoint Corp., </em>642 F.2d 123, 129 (5th Cir.1981) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-4\"><em>Garrett v. Univ. of Ala. at Birmingham Bd. of Trs., </em>344 F.3d 1288, 1292 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">We lack the authority to overrule <em>Brown. </em>Contrary to Guanipa\u2019s assertion, <em>Gonzales v. Oregon, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 904, 163 L.Ed.2d 748 (2006), is not clearly on point because, in <em>Gonzales, </em>the Attorney General lacked the authority to issue the rule prohibiting doctors from prescribing regulated drugs for use in physician-assisted suicide. <em>Id. </em>at 925. In contrast, the BOP has the implied statutory authority to construe 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b)(1). <em>Yi v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>412 F.3d 526, 534 n. 5 (4th Cir.2005); <em>Perez-Olivo v. Chavez, </em>394 F.3d 45, 52 (1st Cir.2005); <em>White v. Scibana, </em>390 F.3d 997, 1001 (7th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied sub nom. White v. Hobart, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2921, 162 L.Ed.2d 297 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">B. <em>Rule of Lenity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b958-11\">In <em>Brown, </em>we found the rule of lenity inapplicable because the BOP\u2019s interpretation was reasonable. <em>Brown, </em>416 F.3d at 1273. As explained in the cases we cited in <em>Brown, </em>deference to the BOP\u2019s interpretation foreclosed an inquiry into whether the rule of lenity required an interpretation in the prisoners\u2019 favor. <em>Yi, </em>412 F.3d at 535; <em>O'Donald v. Johns, </em>402 F.3d 172, 174 (3d Cir.2005), <em>pet. for cert. filed </em>(Jan. 3, 2006) (05-8504); <em>Perez-Olivo, </em>394 F.3d at 53-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-12\">In <em>Brown, </em>the issue of notice for the purposes of applying the rule of lenity is never reached. Therefore, that Guanipa was sentenced before the enactment of 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 523.20 does not provide a basis on which to distinguish this case from <em>Brown.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b958-13\">C. Ex Post Facto <em>Clause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b958-14\">To prevail on an <em>ex post facto </em>claim, a party must demonstrate (1) the law was retrospective, in that it applied to events occurring before its enactment, and (2) she was disadvantaged by it. <em>United States v. Abraham, </em>386 F.3d 1033, 1037 (11th Cir.2004), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 417, 163 L.Ed.2d 318 (2005). In <em>Knuck v. Wainwright, </em>759 F.2d 856, 858 (11th Cir.1985), we held a change in an agency\u2019s interpretation of an ambiguous statute violated the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause. Knuck pled guilty in April 1976 to crimes he committed in October 1975. <em>Id. </em>at 857. For ten years prior to 1979, the Florida Department of Corrections (DOC) interpreted the gain time statute to provide for the award of gain time on the basis of the sentence imposed. <em>Id. </em>at 857-58. In 1976, the statute was amended, and in 1979, the DOC determined its calculation method was in error because it did not impose gain time on the basis of time served. <em>Id. </em>at 858. The DOC then recalculated Knuck\u2019s gain time. <em>Id. </em>We rejected the DOC\u2019s argument there was no <em>ex post facto </em>violation because the law (i.e. the statute) had not changed, and held this recalculation was an <em>ex post facto </em>violation because the gain time statute was ambiguous, the DOC\u2019s original interpretation was reasonable, and Knuck \u201chad over 10 years notice through the established practice and regulations of the D.O.C. that he would be awarded lump sum gain time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 858-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-17\">Although the parties dispute whether 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 523.20 was applied to Guanipa, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>assuming that it was, she cannot prevail on her <em>ex post facto </em>claim. Like the statute in <em>Knuck, </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8642(b)(1) is ambiguous. <em>Brown, </em>416 F.3d at 1273. However, unlike the changed interpretation in <em>Knuck, </em>Guanipa concedes the \u201cBOP had consistently construed 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b)(1) against [her] interpretation both before and after [she] committed her offense in 1996.\u201d Based on this concession, Guanipa was not disadvantaged by 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 523.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">There are no grounds for this Court to overrule the <em>Brown </em>decision. Additionally, the rule of lenity does not apply and there is no <em>ex post facto </em>violation. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Guanipa\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b957-14\">.
