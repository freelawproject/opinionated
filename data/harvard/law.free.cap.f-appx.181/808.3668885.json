Mathis does not challenge his status as a \u201cthree-striker\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) and has not paid the filing fee in full. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-11\">Mathis has a prolific filing history, having filed over forty suits in the district courts between 1990 and 2005. At least eleven of his civil rights cases were dismissed for frivolity, failure to prosecute, or pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). In February 2005, Mathis filed the instant suit against multiple prison officials, alleging that his life was in danger because a guard tried to kill him in December 2004 and continued to make threats against his life. His complaint then detailed assorted grievances he had with prison conditions and his treatment at the prison. In his pleadings, Mathis falsely represented that he had never had a lawsuit dismissed for frivolity, maliciousness, or failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-14\">The magistrate judge noted that Mathis\u2019s complaint in this case was \u201ctypical of\u2019 and \u201cmuch like his previous frivolous filings.\u201d In hght of Mathis\u2019s fifing history, his dishonesty regarding previous suits, and the multiple claims unrelated to imminent physical danger contained in the complaint, the magistrate judge found that Mathis\u2019s allegation of imminent danger was so lacking in credibility that he should not be allowed to proceed <em>in forma pauperis. </em>For the same reasons, the magistrate judge also recommended dismissing the complaint and barring Mathis from any future filings until he paid his full fifing fee debt except (1) filings in any criminal proceeding brought against him; (2) a timely filed reconsideration motion showing why the sanction should not be applied to him; and (3) any fifing that argues that Mathis has been denied access to the state courts. The district court adopted the recommendation without comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-15\">On appeal, Mathis argues that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing his complaint. Pursuant to the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act, the district \u201ccourt shall dismiss the case at any time if the court determines that ... (B) the action or appeal \u2014 (i) is frivolous or malicious....\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cA claim is frivolous if it is without arguable merit either in law or fact\u201d or when it appears that the plaintiff has little or no chance of success. <em>Bilal v. Driver, </em>251 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir.2001). When considering the issue of frivolity, \u201ca litigant\u2019s history of bringing unmeritorious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>litigation can be considered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1850. Moreover, \u00a7 1915 \u201caccords judges not only the authority to dismiss a claim based on an indisputably meritless legal theory, but also the unusual power to pierce the veil of the complaint\u2019s factual allegations and dismiss those claims whose factual contentions are clearly baseless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1349 (citations omitted). Considering Mathis\u2019s litigation history, dishonesty regarding the dismissal of previous suits, and the multitude of unrelated prison grievances alleged in the complaint, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing the complaint as frivolous. <em>See id. </em>at 1349-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Mathis\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b833-12\">.
