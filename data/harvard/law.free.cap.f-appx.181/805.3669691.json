Williams\u2019s conviction was based on four sales of crack cocaine to a confidential informant (\u201cCl\u201d), and on crack cocaine seized at his house during the execution of a search warrant. On appeal, Williams argues that the district court abused its discretion in sustaining objections to several cross-examination ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>tions put by Williams\u2019s counsel to an investigating officer regarding the Cl\u2019s drug use. Williams also contends that the district court erred in overruling his objection to the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cGuidelines\u201d) calculation, because the government engaged in sentence manipulation when it did not arrest him after his second drug transaction. We affirm Williams\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">\u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him....\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. The primary purpose of the Confrontation Clause \u201cis to secure for the [defendant] the opportunity of cross-examination.\u201d <em>United States v. Baptista-Rodriguez, </em>17 F.3d 1354, 1366 (11th Cir.1994) (alteration in original). \u201cThe Confrontation Clause is satisfied when the defense is given a full and fair opportunity to probe and expose ... infirmities through cross-examination, thereby calling to the attention of the fact-finder the reasons for giving scant weight to the witness\u2019 testimony.\u201d <em>Dorsey v. Chapman, </em>262 F.3d 1181, 1188 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotes omitted) (omission in original). Indeed, we have emphasized that the Confrontation Clause \u201conly guarantees an <em>opportunity </em>for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotes omitted). Trial judges have discretion to impose reasonable limits on cross-examination due to \u201c \u2018concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness\u2019 safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baptista-Rodriguez, </em>17 F.3d at 1366 (quoting <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 1435, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986)). Ultimately, a defendant establishes a Confrontation Clause violation \u201cby showing that he was prohibited from engaging in otherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to show a prototypical form of bias on the part of the witness, and thereby to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors ... could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.\u201d <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. at 680, 106 S.Ct. at 1436 (internal quotes omitted). We review restrictions on cross-examination for abuse of discretion. <em>Baptista-Rodriguez, </em>17 F.3d at 1370-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">Williams contends that his confrontation rights were violated when, during his trial, the district court sustained government objections to five of his counsel\u2019s cross-examination questions as \u201cargumentative.\u201d According to Williams, the district court\u2019s actions essentially prevented his counsel from impeaching the credibility of the Cl, and thereby \u201cirreparably damaged\u201d Williams\u2019s entrapment defense. We disagree. First of all, a review of the record indicates that the questions at issue were argumentative, i.e., \u201cinterposing] a viewpoint under the guise of asking a question.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 114 (8th ed.2004).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Several of our sister circuits have found no abuse of discretion where a court limited cross-examination in similar situations. <em>See United States v. Tansley, </em>986 F.2d 880, 886 (5th Cir.1993) (no confrontation violation where limitations on cross-examination \u201cwere made af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>ter the questioning became redundant and argumentative and most times only peripherally relevant\u201d); <em>United States v. Carter, </em>973 F.2d 1509, 1516-17 (10th Cir.1992) (no abuse of discretion where cross-examination question \u201cbordered upon being both argumentative and a comment on the evidence\u201d); <em>United States v. Osorio, </em>929 F.2d 753, 760 (1st Cir.1991) (no confrontation violation where the \u201cquestions put by defense counsel as to which objections were sustained were largely argumentative, and essentially called upon [the witness] to give his own opinion concerning the truthfulness of another witness\u2019s testimony\u201d); <em>cf. United States v. Rubin, </em>733 F.2d 837, 841 (11th Cir.1984) (\u201cThe district court also acted correctly in sustaining defense counsel\u2019s argumentative, redundant and sometimes speculative questions.\u201d). Second, the district court\u2019s actions in sustaining five objections did not deprive Williams of a full and fair opportunity, through cross-examination, \u201cto expose to the jury the facts from which jurors ... could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.\u201d <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. at 680, 106 S.Ct. at 1436. The record shows that Williams\u2019s counsel had the opportunity \u2014 and was in fact able \u2014 to elicit plenty of factual testimony from which the jury could draw inferences (and counsel could argue) against the Cl\u2019s credibility and the propriety of the government\u2019s investigation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Williams also asserts that he was a victim of \u201csentencing entrapment,\u201d because the government could have arrested him after the second drug transaction underlying his convictions, but instead continued to conduct several additional controlled buys, thereby increasing the Guidelines range applicable to Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">In the wake of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review sentences for reasonableness, with the Guidelines considered to be advisory. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). <em>Booker </em>did not, however, alter our review as to the application of the Guidelines. <em>See id. </em>at 786 (explaining that district court must still calculate the Guidelines range correctly and consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). Thus, we review a district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1253 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1809, 164 L.Ed.2d 544 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-13\">Although Williams claims the government engaged in \u201csentencing entrapment,\u201d that term denotes \u201c[a] claim that a defendant, although predisposed to commit a minor or lesser offense, is entrapped into committing a greater offense subject to greater punishment.\u201d <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>138 F.3d 1410, 1414 (11th Cir.1998) (internal quotes omitted). Given that Williams\u2019s argument focuses not on his predisposition, but rather on the government\u2019s conduct in continuing to pursue controlled buys, Williams\u2019s claim is better described as one of \u201csentencing factor manipulation\u201d (or \u201csentencing manipulation\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number><em>See id. </em>(\u201cWhile sentencing entrapment focuses on the defendant\u2019s predisposition, sentencing factor manipulation focuses on the government\u2019s conduct.\u201d). A claim of sentencing manipulation \u201crequires us to consider whether the manipulation inherent in a sting operation, even if insufficiently oppressive to support an entrapment defense, ... or due process claim, ... must sometimes be filtered out of the sentencing calculus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotes omitted). Even before <em>Booker, </em>however, we had not decided whether sentencing manipulation was a valid defense or basis for downward departure. <em>See id.; United States v. Govan, </em>293 F.3d 1248, 1251 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Assuming that Williams can invoke a sentencing manipulation defense, he has nevertheless failed to show that it is applicable here. Williams argues that, because the government vouched for the credibility of the Cl, the only reason additional controlled buys were conducted was to enhance Williams\u2019s liability under the Guidelines. At sentencing, however, the district court noted that multiple controlled buys strengthened the prosecution\u2019s case, and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-6\">The reason that there were several transactions here is not that the government was trying to increase the sentence. The reason there were several transactions here is that Mr. Williams was willing to engage in those transactions. The amount of drugs he\u2019s held accountable for in this presentence report doesn\u2019t overstate the seriousness of the offense. If anything, it\u2019s the other way around. This is only a portion of the drugs that Mr. Williams was engaged in dealing on an ongoing basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axs_\">Furthermore, we rejected a similar claim of sentencing manipulation in <em>Govan. See </em>293 F.3d at 1251 (\u201cMaking four purchases instead of just one in this case is no more manipulative than the government in <em>Sanchez </em>setting in motion a fictitious sting operation involving a large quantity of drugs instead of a small one.\u201d). As we stated in <em>Govan, </em>\u201cthere is nothing wrong with the government attempting to strengthen its case for conviction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">Upon our review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in sustaining objections to certain cross-examination questions posed by Williams\u2019s counsel, and that the district court did not err in rejecting Williams\u2019s claim of sentencing manipulation. Accordingly, we affirm Williams\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b830-6\">. For example, Williams\u2019s counsel asked the government's lead investigator, Tonja Bryant-Smith, for the number of times that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (\"FDLE\u201d) drug-tested the Cl during its investigation of Williams. Bryant-Smith responded: \"We don\u2019t drug-test any of our informants. It\u2019s just not something we do. I've been there three years, and we've never drug-tested any informants.\u201d Williams\u2019s counsel replied: \"You don't want to test them?\u201d At this point the government objected to counsel\u2019s question as argumentative, and the district court sustained the objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b831-7\">. In closing arguments, for example, Williams\u2019s counsel suggested that FDLE's decision not to test the Cl for drug use was a \"don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d approach intended to avoid eliciting any information that might tend to undermine the Cl\u2019s credibility at trial. Counsel also pointed to the Cl\u2019s status as a paid informant to suggest a financial motive on the Cl\u2019s part for participating in entrapment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b831-15\">. We likewise reject Williams\u2019s assertion, based on the same arguments, that the district's court's decision to sustain the government\u2019s five objections essentially deprived Williams of effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
