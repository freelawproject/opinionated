Perez-Toj first challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The Government argues that the sentence appeal waiver in Perez-Toj\u2019s plea agreement bars his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-25\">The waiver-of-appeal provision is construed against the Government as the drafter of the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Somner, </em>127 F.3d 405, 408 (5th Cir.1997). Because Perez-Toj\u2019s plea agreement does not specifically waive the right to attack the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b), we conclude that the waiver provision does not preclude this appeal. <em>See id. </em>Because Perez-Toj may be entitled to a lesser sentence if his constitutional challenge were successful, he has standing. <em>See Henderson v. Stalder, </em>287 F.3d 374, 380 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-26\">Perez-Toj cannot succeed on this claim, however, because his constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Perez-Toj contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>(2005). Perez-Toj properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Perez-Toj also argues that the district court committed plain error by failing to afford him the right of allocution. Because the Government has not invoked the waiver provisions in the plea agreement as to Perez-Toj\u2019s allocution claim, the waiver in the plea agreement does not bind Perez-Toj on that issue. <em>See United States v. Story, </em>439 F.3d 226, 230-31 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">As the record does not show that the district court unequivocally communicated to Perez-Toj his right to speak on any subject of his choosing, the district court committed error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(4)(A)(ii); <em>United States v. Echegollen-Barrueta, </em>195 F.3d 786, 789 (5th Cir.1999). Further, given the clear language of Rule 32 and precedent interpreting it, the error was obvious or plain. <em>See United States v. Reyna, </em>358 F.3d 344, 350 (5th Cir.2004). Perez-Toj has shown that he raised an argument in connection with sentencing that, if resolved in his favor, would have reduced the applicable Guidelines range or his ultimate sentence and thus, under <em>Reyna, </em>prejudice is presumed. <em>See id. </em>at 352. He fails, however, to allege any facts or arguments that he would have made at sentencing that would have warranted a lesser sentence and, consequently, he fails to prove a miscarriage of justice. We thus decline to exercise our discretion to correct the district court\u2019s error. <em>See United States v. Magwood, </em>445 F.3d 826, 830 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b488-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
