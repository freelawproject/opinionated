As Brown acknowledges, his challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)(1) is without merit. <em>See United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001). His conviction is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>The Government concedes that Brown preserved his claim of <em>Fanfan </em>error, i.e., that the district court erred in sentencing him under the then-mandatory Guidelines, in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>548 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The Government also concedes that remand for resentencing may be appropriate because aside from relating \u201cthoughts about the appropriateness of the guideline sentence, there was no other action by the district court that might arguably suggest that the court would have applied the same sentence under an advisory guideline sentencing scheme.\u201d In light of the Government\u2019s concession and the district court\u2019s statement at sentencing that it would impose an alternative sentence if <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) applied, Brown\u2019s sentence is hereby VACATED and this case is REMANDED to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
