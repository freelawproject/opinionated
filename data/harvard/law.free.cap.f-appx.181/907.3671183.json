Because the district court correctly concluded that the savings clause provision of section 2255 does not apply to Quinn\u2019s petition, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">The availability of habeas corpus relief under section 2241 is a question of law we review <em>de novo. Darby v. Hawk-Sawyer, </em>405 F.3d 942, 944 (11th Cir.2005). Under the \u201c \u2018savings clause\u2019 of [section] 2255 ... a prisoner [may] file a [section] 2241 petition only if an otherwise available remedy under [section] 2255 is \u2018inadequate or ineffective\u2019 to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945. We have held that the savings clause only applies if the petitioner can satisfy three elements.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-10\">1) that claim is based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; 2) the holding of that Supreme Court decision establishes the petitioner was convicted for a nonexistent offense; and, 3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first [section] 2255 motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-11\"><em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-12\">The savings clause does not apply to either claim raised in Quinn\u2019s petition. Quinn argues that his sentence was calculated in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and that his conviction for using or carrying a firearm is invalid under <em>Arthur Andersen, L.L.P. v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 696, 125 S.Ct. 2129, 161 L.Ed.2d 1008 (2005). Both claims fail. First, because <em>Booker </em>is not a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision, <em>Varela v. United States, </em>400 F.3d 864, 867-68 (11th Cir.2005), Quinn cannot satisfy the first element required for the savings clause to apply to his <em>Booker </em>claim. Second, Quinn\u2019s <em>Arthur Andersen </em>claim fails because, although <em>Arthur Andersen </em>might apply retroactively, <em>Arthur Andersen </em>interpreted section 1512(b) and is not relevant to section 924(c), the provision under which Quinn was convicted. In addition, even if <em>Arthur Andersen </em>was applicable in Quinn\u2019s case, Quinn\u2019s claim would still fail because <em>Arthur Andersen </em>did not establish that Quinn was convicted of a nonexistent offense. Quinn\u2019s assertion that he is not guilty of the offense does not establish that the offense does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-14\">The dismissal of Quinn\u2019s section 2241 petition is</p>\n<p id=\"b932-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
