Jackson contends that the district court improperly departed because it bypassed criminal history categories V and VI without stating reasons for its rejection of those categories. Jackson asserts that the district court did not consider 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\u2019s sentencing factors and imposed an unreasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">We review an upward departure for reasonableness; we review the decision to depart upwardly and the extent of the departure for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006). An upward departure is not an abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion when it (1) \u201cadvanee[s] the objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)\u201d; and (2) is \u201cjustified by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The district court departed upwardly after citing to six prior convictions that did not contribute points to Jackson\u2019s criminal history category and determining that the Sentencing Guidelines did \u201cnot adequately reflect the seriousness of [Jackson\u2019s] prior conduct\u201d or the likelihood that he would commit future crimes. The district court\u2019s reasons are sanctioned under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 as grounds for an upward departure, and the reasons advance the directives of \u00a7 3553(a)(2). <em>See United States v. McKenzie, </em>991 F.2d 203, 204 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">We do not require the district court to engage in \u201ca ritualistic exercise\u201d in which it \u201cmechanically discusses each criminal history category it rejects en route to the category it selects.\u201d <em>McKenzie, </em>991 F.2d at 204. The district court\u2019s reasons for rejecting intermediate criminal history categories are implicit and are supported by the record. <em>See United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347-48 (5th Cir.2006); <em>McKenzie, </em>991 F.2d at 204-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">The district court\u2019s reasons for the upward departure correspond to the objectives of \u00a7 3553(a)(1) and coincide with the concerns of \u00a7 3553(b). The district court\u2019s statements at sentencing indicate that it considered the guidelines range and policies as \u00a7 3553(a)(3)-(7) requires. Accordingly, the district court considered statutory factors in deciding to depart upwardly and did not abuse its discretion. <em>See United States v. Saldana, </em>427 F.3d 298, 312-13, 315-16 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 810, 163 L.Ed.2d 637 (2005) and \u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1097, 163 L.Ed.2d 911 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">We accord great deference to the district court\u2019s decision as to the extent of the departure. <em>See Saldana, </em>427 F.3d at 312. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b464-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
