Reed argues that his sentence was improper under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because it was based on facts that were neither found by a jury nor admitted by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-19\">Reed\u2019s assertion of <em>Booker </em>error is correct. He preserved this error by raising an objection to his sentence grounded in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). <em>See United States v. Garza, </em>429 F.3d 165, (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1444, 164 L.Ed.2d 143 (2006). When, as is the case here, a <em>Booker </em>error has been preserved in the district court, we \u201cwill ordinarily vacate the sentence and remand, unless [this court] can say the error is harmless under Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 284 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Government has not met its \u201carduous\u201d burden of demonstrating \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that the Sixth Amendment <em>Booker </em>error did not affect the sentence that [Reed] received.\u201d <em>Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d at 285, 287. Consequently, Reed\u2019s sentence is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b469-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
