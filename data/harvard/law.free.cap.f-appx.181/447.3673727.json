Because we find that the Commissioner\u2019s decision is based upon substantial evidence and in accordance with law, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-22\">On January 29, 1987, Lula Alfred applied for disability insurance benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act, alleging an inability to work due to blindness in her left eye and limited vision in her right eye. An administrative law judge (ALJ) awarded Alfred benefits effective March 30, 1988 because her condition met the severity criteria stated in \u00a7 2.03(A) of the Commissioner\u2019s listing of impairments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In February 1995, the So<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>cial Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) performed a continuing disability review<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and concluded that Alfred\u2019s disability ceased in November 1994 because she had returned to substantial gainful activity. Specifically, since being found disabled in 1988, Alfred worked for approximately eighteen months in a salon answering telephones thirty-two hours per week, and worked for approximately one year at a church performing janitorial work twenty-three hours per week. Alfred requested reconsideration of the SSA\u2019s decision; however, for reasons not completely clear from the record, the SSA never processed the request nor did it cease Alfred\u2019s benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">In May 1997, the SSA again reviewed Alfred\u2019s case and found that her disability ceased on September 1, 1997 due to medical improvement. Specifically, the SSA concluded that Alfred\u2019s condition no longer met the severity requirements in \u00a7 2.03(A). Consequently, the SSA terminated Alfred\u2019s benefits on November 30, 1997, and notified her that as a result of her medical improvement, she had been overpaid $11,064.00.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Alfred thereafter requested a hearing before an ALJ, which was held on April 1, 2002. During the pendency of the administrative review of her disability cessation, Alfred filed an application for Title XVI supplemental security income (\u201cSSI\u201d) benefits, which was later consolidated with Alfred\u2019s pending disability cessation appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-12\">After considering Alfred\u2019s background, work experience and medical history, the ALJ determined that Alfred retained the residual functional capacity to perform her past janitorial work, which he labeled \u201chousekeeping,\u201d and was therefore not disabled. Accordingly, the ALJ concluded that Alfred was no longer entitled to disability insurance benefits and not eligible for SSI benefits. The Appeals Council denied Alfred\u2019s request for review, making the ALJ\u2019s decision the final decision of the Commissioner. Alfred then filed a complaint in federal district court, seeking review of the Commissioner\u2019s final decision pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). The magistrate judge recommended the ALJ\u2019s decision be affirmed, and the district court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision. Alfred then filed this appeal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-13\">Our review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny benefits is limited to two inquiries: whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence and whether the Commissioner applied the proper legal standards.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Substantial evidence \u201cmeans such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and is \u201cmore than a mere scintilla and less than a preponderance.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If supported by substantial evidence, the Commissioner\u2019s factual findings are conclusive.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Alfred bears the burden of proving she suffers from a disability under the SSA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cDisability\u201d is defined under the SSA as \u201cany medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In examining a disability claim, the Commissioner uses the familiar five-step sequential process to determine whether: (1) the claimant is performing substantial gainful activity; (2) the claimant has a \u201csevere impairment\u201d; (3) the claimant\u2019s impairment meets or equals one listed in Appendix 1 of the regulations; (4) the claimant has the residual functional capacity to perform her past relevant work; and (5) the claimant can make an adjustment to other work in light of her age, education, work experience, and residual functional capacity.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If the claimant shows that she is disabled under the first four steps, the burden shifts to the Commissioner for the fifth step to demonstrate that the claimant can perform other substantial work in the national economy.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A finding that the claimant is not disabled at any step is conclusive and ends the inquiry.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">We have previously noted that an \u201cALJ\u2019s decision must stand or fall with the reasons set forth in [his] decision.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Here, the ALJ determined that Alfred was not disabled at step four, finding that she had the residual functional capacity to perform her past relevant work as a housekeeper. Alfred challenges the ALJ\u2019s decision on two grounds. First, she claims that the ALJ\u2019s finding is not supported by substantial evidence. Second, Alfred contends that part-time work can not constitute \u201cpast relevant work\u201d and therefore, the ALJ\u2019s finding that she can return to past relevant part-time work is erroneous as a matter of law. We find both arguments unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">At Alfred\u2019s administrative hearing, the ALJ asked vocational expert Harris Rowzie to comment on the extent to which Alfred\u2019s vision impairments would prevent her from performing her prior work. The vocational expert stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOy\">Housekeeping cleaner as an example, I would venture to say that with that little vision that the problem that [Alfred]\u2019s going to face with doing that job is she\u2019s going to miss things---- If she\u2019s running a vacuum cleaner and she\u2019s going to be required to run that vacuum cleaner she\u2019d almost have to do something in a compulsive manner. And that is since she\u2019s got more peripheral vision on the right she\u2019d always have to start on the left and move to the right. But by the same token she\u2019s not going to have the accuracy that someone with binocular vision would have with the same restriction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-14\">Mr. Rowzie did not provide any other testimony regarding Alfred\u2019s ability to perform the work of a housekeeper. In his decision finding Alfred not disabled, the ALJ stated that \u201cRowzie opined [that Alfred] could do her past work as a housekeeper.\u201d Alfred contends that Rowzie\u2019s testimony regarding her ability to perform the work of a housekeeper is, at best, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>ambiguous, and therefore, does not support the ALJ\u2019s finding that she can perform that occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">To demonstrate that she is disabled at step four, Alfred must show that she lacks the residual functional capacity to perform: (1) the actual functional demands and job duties of her past job and (2) the functional demands and job duties of the occupation as generally required by employers in the national economy.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Alfred has failed to make the requisite showings. At her administrative hearing, Alfred testified that there were no tasks that she was unable to accomplish at her past job as a housekeeper because of her vision. Additionally, the record demonstrates that Alfred earned over $12,000 per year working as a housekeeper from 1996-1998. Notably, this is an amount well in excess of the $500 per month amount presumed to show performance of substantial gainful activity.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Alfred\u2019s earnings records also reveal that she was capable of performing her job duties of a housekeeper before her condition had medically improved. Accordingly, because there is substantial evidence, apart from Rowzie\u2019s testimony, that supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Alfred has the residual functional capacity to perform the actual functional demands of her past housekeeping job, we conclude that Alfred\u2019s first argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Alfred also contends that, as a matter of law, past work performed on a part-time basis cannot constitute \u201cpast relevant work.\u201d Social Security Ruling (\u201cSSR\u201d) 96-8P provides that an individual\u2019s residual functional capacity measures their \u201cmaximum remaining ability to do sustained work activities in an ordinary work setting on a regular and continuing basis.\u201d A \u201cregular and continuing basis\u201d is defined by SSR 96-8P as \u201c8 hours a day, for 5 days a week, or an equivalent work schedule.\u201d However, SSR 96-8P also expressly states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-12\">[t]he ability to work 8 hours a day for 5 days a week is not always required when evaluating an individual\u2019s ability to do past relevant work at step 4 of the sequential evaluation process. Part-time work that was substantial gainful activity, performed within the past 15 years, and lasted long enough for the person to learn to do it constitutes past relevant work, and an individual who retains the RFC to perform such work must be found not disabled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-13\">Alfred\u2019s work as a housekeeper meets the definition of \u201cpast relevant work.\u201d First, the housekeeping work was performed from 1996 through 1998, and was thus performed within the 15 years preceding the ALJ\u2019s November 2002 decision. Second, as mentioned above, Alfred\u2019s work as a housekeeper constitutes substantial gainful activity because it yielded over $12,000 per year from 1996-1998. Finally, there is no evidence indicating, nor does Alfred claim, that her housekeeping job did not last long enough for her to learn how to do it. Accordingly, Alfred\u2019s prior housekeeping job is \u201cpast relevant work\u201d and because she retains the residual functional capacity to perform that work, she is not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-14\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b472-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
