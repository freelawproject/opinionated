Woodbury pleaded guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, to distribution of 50 grams or more of cocaine base (crack), in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a), and the district court sentenced him as a career offender to a term of 151 months imprisonment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court also imposed an alternative discretionary sentence of 151 months imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), taking the Sentencing Guidelines as advisory. Under the terms of his plea agreement, Woodbury waived his right to \u201cappeal whatever sentence was imposed, including any issues that relate to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>the establishment of the guideline range, reserving only the right to appeal from an upward or downward departure from the guideline range that is established at sentencing.\u201d He also reserved the right to appeal a sentence that exceeded the maximum term provided by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Despite the waiver, Woodbury now seeks to appeal his career offender status, arguing that the waiver is not enforceable in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (holding that Apprendi<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> exception for fact of a prior conviction limits sentencing court to charging document, plea agreement and colloquy, statutory definition, or defendant\u2019s admissions to determine a disputed fact about a prior conviction). We dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">We review the validity of a waiver de novo, <em>United States v. Brown, </em>232 F.3d 399, 403 (4th Cir.2000), and will uphold a waiver of appellate rights if the waiver is valid and the issue being appealed is within the scope of the waiver. <em>United States v. Attar, </em>38 F.3d 727, 731-33 (4th Cir.1994). A waiver is valid if the defendant\u2019s agreement to the waiver was knowing and voluntary. <em>United States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165, 167 (4th Cir.1991). Generally, if the district court fully questions a defendant regarding the waiver of his right to appeal during the colloquy under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11, the waiver is both valid and enforceable. <em>Wessells, </em>936 F.2d at 167-68. In <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162 (4th Cir.2005), a case involving a waiver virtually indistinguishable from the waiver in this case, we held that a waiver of the right to appeal contained in a plea agreement that was accepted before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), was not invalidated by the change in the law effected by <em>Booker </em>because the waiver was valid and the issue raised was within the scope of the waiver. <em>Blick, </em>408 F.3d at 172-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">Here, the record reveals that the district court conducted a thorough Rule 11 inquiry and specifically questioned Woodbury about whether he understood that he was waiving his appellate rights. Despite Woodbury\u2019s limited education and intellectual ability, the record reveals that he was able to understand the consequences of the waiver. We conclude that the waiver is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">Woodbury contends that his waiver of appeal rights is not enforceable, first, because he did not agree to a sentence that he views, <em>post-Shepard, </em>as an incorrect, unconstitutional, and illegal application of the Sentencing Guidelines and the \u201cCareer Offender Statute.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He also contends that certain provisions of his plea agreement preclude a valid waiver of the district court\u2019s determination that he is a career offender. Finally, he contends that the waiver does not preclude a challenge to his sentence on constitutional grounds, citing <em>Attar, </em>38 F.3d at 732.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-14\">Woodbury\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by <em>Blick, </em>which rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that he could not have knowingly waived his rights under <em>Booker </em>before it was decided. <em>Blick, </em>408 F.3d at 170-71. Like the defendant in <em>Blick, </em>Woodbury was sentenced under the <em>pre-Booker </em>and <em>pre-Shepard </em>guidelines, exactly as contemplated in his plea agreement. <em>Blick, </em>408 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>F.3d at 172-73. In <em>Blick, </em>we distinguished the defendant\u2019s situation from the one presented in <em>Attar </em>and <em>United States v. Broughtort-Jones, </em>71 F.3d 1143 (4th Cir.1995), where \u201cthe errors allegedly committed by the district courts were errors that the defendants could not have reasonably contemplated when the plea agreements were executed.\u201d <em>Blick, </em>408 F.3d at 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Woodbury agreed to forego his right to appeal the district court\u2019s determination of his career offender status, agreed to give up his right to appeal \u201cwhatever sentence is imposed, including any issues that relate to the establishment of the guideline range,\u201d and reserved only the right to appeal a departure or a sentence that exceeded the statutory maximum. Wood-bury\u2019s claim that the district court erred in sentencing him as a career offender falls squarely within the scope of his waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b394-20\">. The district court departed downward from the Sentencing Guidelines range of 262-327 months under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, p.s. (2003) (departure for overstated criminal history), and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, p.s. (departure for substantial assistance).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b395-7\">. <em>Apprendi v.

Woodbury is referring to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(h), which directs the Sentencing Corn-mission to assure that the guidelines specify a sentence at or near the maximum authorized prison term for adults who commit a third felony drug offense or violent crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
