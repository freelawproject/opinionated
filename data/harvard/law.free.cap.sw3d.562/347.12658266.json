Allison appeals. He argues: (1) that the circuit court erred in admitting into evidence diary entries and letters authored by his minor victim, because the statements were hearsay; (2) that the circuit court erred when it prohibited his counsel from asking venire members during\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   whether they thought child molesters should be castrated or receive the death penalty; and (3) that he is entitled to a new trial because a paralegal who previously worked for the public defender's office assisted the prosecution during his trial. We affirm. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, we have provided the parties an unpublished memorandum setting forth the reasons for this order. Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
