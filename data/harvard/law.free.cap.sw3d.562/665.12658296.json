Aside from portions added to address the State's arguments for reconsideration, our opinion otherwise remains unchanged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   While Appellant Maurice Bluitt was incarcerated in a Colorado prison, the State of Texas initiated proceedings to have him civilly committed as a sexually violent predator.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20841.081\">\n    Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \u00a7 841.081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (West 2017). Because we hold that Appellant had a statutory right to appear in person at the civil commitment trial, we reverse the trial court's judgment and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Appellant has a criminal history including sexually violent offenses.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the late 1980s, Appellant was indicted in Texas for aggravated sexual assault of a child under the age of 14. In a plea bargain, Appellant pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of sexual assault and was placed on deferred adjudication probation for two years, which he successfully completed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 1996, Appellant was charged with kidnapping and sexually assaulting a woman in Colorado. In 1998, he pleaded guilty to the kidnapping charge in exchange for a four-year term of probation, which he was permitted to serve in Texas. But it was not long before he was arrested again. In 1999, Appellant was charged in Tarrant County with indecency with an eight-year-old child by contact. Appellant was convicted of the crime as charged and sentenced to 20 years' in the custody of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In January 2016, when TDCJ released Appellant on parole, he was placed in the custody of Colorado authorities for a probation revocation proceeding in connection with his 1998 kidnapping conviction. Eight months later, while the instant case was pending, the Colorado court revoked Appellant's probation, and he was sent to a Colorado prison to serve his ten-year sentence. And so throughout the pendency of\n   these civil commitment proceedings, Appellant has been incarcerated in Colorado.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. After TDCJ released Appellant to Colorado's custody, the State of Texas petitioned to civilly commit Appellant.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Approximately two months after Appellant was placed in custody in Colorado, on March 31, 2016, the State filed a petition to civilly commit Appellant as a sexually violent predator.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20841.081\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But because Appellant was incarcerated in Colorado at the time, the State sought to abate the proceedings indefinitely. Appellant, through counsel, filed a response opposing the abatement. In his response, Appellant cited the statutory requirement that a trial must be conducted in a sexually-violent-predator proceeding within 270 days after the petition is served.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20841.081\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 841.061(a)(1) (West 2017). The trial court denied the motion to abate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Prior to trial, Appellant's trial counsel struggled to effectively and regularly communicate with Appellant. The Colorado prison in which Appellant was located required a court order before it would allow any verbal communications between Appellant and his attorney. Even after such an order was obtained, the prison still hindered their ability to communicate by, for instance, requiring that calls be supervised by a guard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Soon Appellant's ability to appear in person for the trial became a concern for both counsel and the trial court. In email correspondence with the attorneys, the trial court inquired of the State how it planned to \"get [Appellant] from Colorado to Texas.\" An attorney for the State responded that he had been unable to find any authority to bring Appellant to Texas for the proceeding and suggested that Appellant might participate in the trial through videoconferencing instead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Following this email correspondence, in November 2016, Appellant filed a motion to dismiss the commitment proceeding on two grounds: (1) that if the State could not bring Appellant to Texas for the trial, his \"absolute right\" to appear in person would be violated, and (2) the inability to effectively communicate with his attorney violated his right to effective assistance of counsel. The State responded by arguing that Appellant was not entitled to appear in person at trial, and the State then formally requested that the trial court allow him to appear through videoconferencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The trial court denied Appellant's motion to dismiss and granted the State's request to allow his participation in trial through videoconferencing. In its order, the court required that a fax machine be available in the event \"there [was] a need to send facsimile copies of any documents to [Appellant] to review during the trial\" and also provided that Appellant should be afforded the opportunity to communicate with his counsel whenever necessary by telephone \"or other appropriate means.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On the day of the first trial setting, January 9, 2017, Appellant appeared through videoconferencing and requested a continuance. In his request, Appellant agreed to waive his right to proceed to trial within 270 days of being served with the petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20841.081\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 841.061(a)(1). The trial court granted the continuance and reset the trial to begin April 17, 2017. The trial court also noted on the record that the State intended to seek permission from the Colorado trial court to allow a Tarrant County official to transport Appellant to Texas for the April trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The trial court conducted the trial without Appellant present.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The State's efforts to secure Appellant's transportation to Texas for trial ultimately\n   proved unsuccessful, and on the morning of the first day of trial, Appellant refused to appear by videoconferencing. Appellant's trial counsel articulated that Appellant objected to appearing by video and to the trial being conducted in his absence. The trial court denied Appellant's objection after noting on the record that a live video connection with the Colorado prison had been arranged. The trial court continued to deny repeated objections raised by Appellant's trial counsel throughout the proceeding regarding his client's physical absence from trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At the end of the trial, the jury found that Appellant was a sexually violent predator, and the trial court entered a final judgment civilly committing him. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Appellant's two issues on appeal relate to the effects of his imprisonment in Colorado on his ability to participate in the civil commitment proceedings and to effectively communicate with his attorney. In his first issue, Appellant argues that the trial court violated his statutory and constitutional rights by conducting the trial without him being physically present. In his second issue, Appellant argues that he was effectively denied his right to the assistance of counsel throughout the proceedings. Because we find that the statute governing sexually-violent-predator civil commitments guarantees the right to appear in person at trial, we sustain that part of Appellant's first issue and do not reach his second issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. R. App. P. 47.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    I. How to civilly commit a sexually violent predator\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In 1999, the Texas Legislature first recognized the existence of \"a small but extremely dangerous group of sexually violent predators\" with behavioral abnormalities that are not amenable to traditional mental illness treatment modalities and that make them likely to engage in repeated predatory acts of sexual violence.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20841.001\">\n    Tex.

Accordingly, the legislature enacted chapter 841 of the health and safety code to provide a mechanism for the civil commitment of sexually violent predators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Notice to TDCJ and an assessment of the person\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Pursuant to chapter 841, within two years of an inmate's anticipated release date, TDCJ is required to notify a multidisciplinary team of the anticipated release of any person serving a sentence for a sexually violent offense.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20841.021\">\n    Tex.

But before entering the order, the trial court may impose certain requirements, including requirements that the person reside where instructed by the Texas Civil Commitment Office (TCCO), that the person participate in and comply with a sex-offender treatment program, and that the person submit to tracking and any other appropriate supervision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20841.003\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 841.082 (West Supp. 2017).

The State's interpretation ignores section 841.146, which directly incorporates code of criminal procedure chapter 33's provisions regarding a criminal defendant's right to be present at voir dire.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20841.146\">\n    Tex.

App. 1985) (construing article 33.03's allowance for the trial court to proceed with trial \"after the jury has been selected\" in the event the defendant voluntarily absents himself from the trial). And we agree with our sister court that the incorporation of chapter 33 into chapter 841 means that a person facing civil commitment under chapter 841 is entitled to be physically present during voir dire.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Commitment of Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7089056\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/410/542/#p553\">\n    410 S.W.3d 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 553 (Tex.

Again, it seems absurd that the legislature would, on the one hand, provide a person with the right to be physically present during voir dire, but on the other hand, deny the person the right to be physically present during the trial itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The State points to an additional provision in chapter 841 to contend that videoconferencing meets the requirements of this statute. Section 841.152(a) provides that a person's right \"to be present\" at the probable cause hearing during the biennial review can be met through closed-circuit video teleconferencing.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20841.152\">\n    Tex.

The legislature, fully aware of videoconferencing technology, chose to allow it specifically in the context of the biennial review, but did not make a similar provision in the context of the initial commitment hearing. We decline the State's invitation to read an entire\n   provision into the initial civil commitment trial process that is not present.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Ford Motor Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6908009\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/442/265/#p287\">\n    442 S.W.3d 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 287 (Tex. 2014) (orig. proceeding) (applying the well-established presumption that the legislature \"omitted words it intended to omit\");\n   <em>\n    Osterberg v.

Alternatively, the State suggests that Appellant \"appeared\" for purposes of the statute by filing an answer or any other pleadings. Not only does this argument ignore the statutory language that Appellant had the right to appear\n   <em>\n    at the trial\n   </em>\n   , the state's argument makes little sense in the context of this type of civil proceeding. Although civil in nature, a civil commitment proceeding is a far cry from the traditional civil lawsuit. The State's argument ignores the significant difference between a civil commitment proceeding where personal liberty is at stake and a general civil case which seeks only monetary or other compensation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ringer v.

Under this statutory scheme, there is no method by which Appellant could have forfeited his right to a trial by failing to appear or file an answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In its motion for en banc reconsideration, the State conflates sexually-violent-predator civil commitments with mental-health civil commitments. Despite the complete absence of any evidence that Appellant lacked the capacity to attend his own trial, the State argues that sex offenders should not have the right to be personally present at their initial civil commitment trial because they have not been treated yet, stating, \"These are not necessarily people that can sit through a jury trial without being physically or mentally harmed,\" and that they can be present at a biennial review hearing because, by then, they have \"received years of treatment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We recognize that mental-health commitments and sexually-violent-predator commitments are in some ways analogous, but we disagree with the State's implication that they are the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Mental-health commitments are appropriate where an individual suffers from a mental illness and, as a result, (1) is likely to cause serious harm to himself or others, or (2) is suffering from \"severe and abnormal mental, emotional, or physical distress\"; is experiencing \"substantial mental or physical deterioration\" of the individual's \"ability to function independently, which is exhibited by the proposed patient's inability ... to provide for the proposed patient's basic needs, including food, clothing, health, or safety\"; and is unable to make a rational and informed decision as to whether or not to submit to treatment.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20574.034\">\n    Tex.

The provision for the mental-health commitment of an individual suffering from a mental illness that renders him a risk of serious harm toward himself or others is similar to the commitment of a sexually violent predator-an individual whose behavioral abnormality renders them prone to engaging in repeated predatory acts of sexual violence. But the State's argument for reconsideration asks us to assume that all accused sexually violent predators are mentally ill to the extent that they are suffering from \"severe and abnormal mental, emotional, or physical distress,\" or are unable to function independently or make rational and informed decisions regarding their treatment options. In fact, such an assumption would ignore a key difference between sexually-violent-predator commitments and mental-health commitments: a person can only be deemed a sexually violent predator if he has been criminally convicted of at least one sexually violent offense.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20574.034\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 841.003. To be convicted of a sexually violent offense, the person was presumed mentally competent and has already participated in a trial without the benefit of treatment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 46B.003 (West 2018) (providing that a person is incompetent to stand trial if he lacks the ability to consult with his lawyer or lacks a rational and factual understanding of the proceedings against him);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20574.034\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   art. 46C.155 (West 2018) (providing that a defendant found not guilty by reason of insanity is considered to be acquitted). The State's argument ignores this important difference between mental-health commitments and sexually-violent-predator commitments and asks us to presume that the person, while competent to stand trial in the underlying criminal proceeding, subsequently became incompetent during his stay in prison.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We decline to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In addition, at oral argument in this case, the State asserted that Appellant waived any right to be physically present at his commitment trial by committing a crime in the state of Colorado which resulted in his removal to Colorado by TDCJ. The State did not provide briefing or otherwise provide support for this proposition and we can find nothing in the law in general or chapter 841 in particular that supports this theory of waiver. We reject this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   For these reasons, we hold that the legislature guaranteed the right to be physically present at trial to persons facing civil commitments as sexually violent predators. Because the trial court proceeded to trial without affording Appellant his right to be physically present, we hold that the trial court erred and we sustain Appellant's first issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Appellant's absence from the trial caused him harm.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Having found error, we must determine whether the error probably caused rendition of an improper judgment or\n   probably prevented Appellant from properly presenting the case to this court. Tex. R. App. P. 44.1(a) ;\n   <em>\n    Romero v. KPH Consolidation, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8936401\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/166/212/#p225\">\n    166 S.W.3d 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 225 (Tex. 2005). Based on the record before us, it seems clear that Appellant's absence caused him harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   At the outset, the trial court highlighted Appellant's absence, leaving the false impression that Appellant's failure to appear by video at trial was simply a matter of Appellant's indifference to participation. At the beginning of voir dire, the trial court instructed the jury as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Mr. Bluitt is not present in court today. Mr. Bluitt is in Colorado. We had made arrangements for Mr. Bluitt to appear by video conferencing where he would be able to see you and you would be able to see him and he would be able to hear what anyone was saying.\n   <em>\n    However, Mr. Bluitt has chosen not to participate by video conferencing. And that is his choice.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   [Emphasis added.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   We first note our concern with the trial court's statement. After commenting to the jury that Appellant had \"chosen not to participate,\" the trial court refused to allow Appellant's counsel to explain to the jury the reason that Appellant had made such a \"choice,\" i.e., that Appellant insisted upon his right to appear in person. Because the trial court's comment did nothing to explain the circumstances surrounding Appellant's \"choice,\" it left open the negative inference that Appellant did not appear simply because he did not care. Had the jury made such an inference without the trial court's assistance is one thing, but it is quite another for the trial court to comment on Appellant's exercise of a right in such a way that encourages a negative impression for the jury. This is why the law does not permit commentary on the defendant's decision not to testify or his exercise of a privilege claim in a criminal proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. R. Evid. 513 (prohibiting the court or counsel from commenting upon a privilege claim);\n   <em>\n    Griffin v.

What it may infer when the court solemnizes the silence of the accused into evidence against him is quite another.\"). Here, the trial court could have avoided the potential of creating a false impression with the jury by saying nothing at all, especially since the jury later heard evidence of Appellant's incarceration in Colorado which was the primary stumbling block in securing his presence at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The residual effect of the trial court's comment is quite apparent in the record when reviewing the statements made by the venire panel throughout the remainder of voir dire regarding Appellant's absence from trial. Several members of the venire panel voiced concern-even irritation-that Appellant was not present. Twelve indicated outright that they would feel so strongly about Appellant's absence that they could not be fair to him. For example:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   \u2022 \"I feel that first of all, he is not even here today. You know, I had changed my plans to be here today. It just has a bad feeling already that I'm pretty sure that I would not be fair and impartial.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   \u2022 \"[T]he idea that he is not here even sort of makes me think already that the guy is guilty.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   \u2022 \"Yeah, there's no way [I could be a fair juror] already in my mind.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   \u2022 \"Is he incarcerated? Is he hospitalized now?\" When the prosecutor asked how his being incarcerated could affect her view, she admitted, \"I would be biased, let's just say that, biased towards his guilty [sic].\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   \u2022 When asked if he could consider Appellant's testimony offered through a taped deposition the same as he would live testimony, another venireperson admitted that he \"would view a deposition as a lower form of evidence than were he here in person\" and felt it \"would make him less credible.\" Two other veniremembers agreed with him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   \u2022 \"I'm struggling with such a serious matter, trying not to read into the fact that the Defendant is not taking the time or able to take the time to represent - - to be part of it. I - - I just struggle with that a little bit. I'll be honest.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   \u2022 \"If he's being accused of something, I want to be up front, I want to be here I want people to see me, you know. And I understand that assuming you just said he is probably still in prison, but he can be handcuffed and flown out here, I guess, and that would make a difference for me.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   While some, if not all, of these veniremembers were stricken, these statements-made within the hearing of the entire venire panel-provide insight into how the trial court's instruction and Appellant's absence were viewed by potential jurors in the case. When the trial court refused to allow Appellant's trial counsel to explain that Appellant wanted to attend but attempts to have him transported back to Texas for trial had failed, the likelihood for a distinctly false impression to be formed in the jurors' minds was further compounded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Additionally, the State's sole live witness relied upon and highlighted Appellant's demeanor, the very factor that the jury was deprived of evaluating for themselves. While Appellant's videotaped deposition was played for the jury, Dr. Darrel Turner, a clinical psychologist, appeared live, and in his testimony regarding his evaluation of Appellant, Dr. Turner emphasized Appellant's demeanor as it appeared to Dr. Turner during his three-hour interview of Appellant and during the videotaped deposition. Dr. Turner testified that Appellant's demeanor was \"markedly different\" during the interview from his demeanor as reflected in the recorded deposition. He expanded, saying that when he met with Appellant, Appellant looked \"physically different,\" and \"much more ... cocky, much less subdued.\" He described his surprise upon receiving and reviewing the video of the deposition because \"it really did look like a different person ... that I had spoken with who was very, very, very sure of himself and very cocky.\" He opined that Appellant appeared in the deposition video to be \"making an effort to present himself as a bit more meek than he was ... when [Dr. Turner] met with him.\" Dr. Turner noted that this difference was diagnostically significant in determining that Appellant had antisocial personality disorder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The State further emphasized Appellant's demeanor in its closing argument. Although it initially cautioned the jury, \"It doesn't matter that he's in Colorado. It's completely irrelevant to whether or not he has a behavior abnormality,\" the State went on to argue that the jury was able to observe Appellant's demeanor in his video deposition, even noting that that may have been the only thing that was \"helpful\" about watching the deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   With such stress placed on his demeanor, Appellant was placed at a severe disadvantage by being precluded from attending the trial in person and allowing the jurors to judge his demeanor for themselves. It is axiomatic that a key role of the jury is to judge the demeanor of the witnesses and the parties before it.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Golden Eagle Archery, Inc. v.

At the first trial setting, Appellant agreed to waive the 270-day requirement. We remand these proceedings to the trial court to determine the extent of that waiver,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tex. R.

Now the person is entitled to be present.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    This is not to say that a potential sexually violent predator could not also be deemed mentally ill such that a mental-health commitment is warranted simply because the sexually violent predator was deemed competent to stand trial and be convicted of a sexual offense. But there is no support for the State's proposition that all sexually violent predators should be so presumed and therefore not entitled to attend their civil commitment trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Because we hold that the right to be physically present at trial is statutorily guaranteed, we do not reach Appellant's constitutional arguments.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tex. R. App. P. 47.1. We do however note our concern that proceeding to trial without the person's physical presence could present constitutional concerns.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hendricks\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"916116\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/346/#p364\">\n     521 U.S. at 356-60\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"916116\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/346/#p364\">\n     117 S.Ct. at 2079-81\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (evaluating Kansas's civil commitment statutory scheme in light of substantive due process concerns).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Furthermore, even if Appellant had availed himself of the videoconferencing option offered, we are not convinced that Appellant would have had adequate ability to communicate with his counsel during the proceedings. We acknowledge that the trial court stated that it would allow Appellant to communicate with his counsel by phone, videoconference, or facsimile, whenever requested. But it is unclear how Appellant could have both privately and contemporaneously communicated with his attorney under such circumstances, leaving some doubt as to the efficacy of videoconferencing in affording Appellant the ability to assist in his own defense.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
