Defendant's sole point on appeal argues the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a \u00a7 552.020\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   mental examination and proceeding through trial and sentencing without ordering such an examination. For the reasons that follow, the trial court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Twenty-eight minutes prior to the scheduled start of trial, defense counsel (\"Counsel\") filed a motion for a mental examination pursuant to \u00a7 552.020 (\"the motion\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The motion claimed that Defendant was a \"critical witness in his case and [C]ounsel believes he is unable to testify on his own behalf.\" Accordingly, the motion requested that the court \"order a mental exam to determine Defendant's ability to aid in his own defense[.]\" In\n   support, the motion made the following factual allegations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   1. That Defendant has uncontrollable arm movements, twitches, and random facial movements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   2. That his conversation is unstructured and incoherent in that he starts one thought and randomly jumps to a new subject.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   3. That he stated he has been on suicide watch all of last week.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   4. That he has attempted suicide twice in the recent past.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   5. That Defendant states he has been in multiple mental health facilities bases [sic] on multiple severe diagnoses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court heard arguments on the motion prior to opening statements. Counsel asserted that Defendant was taking an unspecified \"lithium-based medication\" and when Defendant was not on his medication, he had \"real disconnected thought processes.\" Counsel posited to the trial court, \"It appears to me to be schizophrenia, because he'll go down one conversation, one topic, and he starts laughing, and then all of a sudden he'll jump to something completely different. And he laughs at inappropriate times and just really bizarre behavior.\" Counsel claimed he needed Defendant to testify, but Counsel did not believe Defendant was competent to testify \"at least at this point.\" Counsel did not inform the trial court whether Defendant was taking his medication the morning of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial court denied the motion, finding there was not sufficient evidence at that time to grant the motion. The trial court clarified, however, that if Counsel renewed the motion at the conclusion of the State's case, the trial court would consider the motion again. Counsel did not renew the motion for mental examination at any subsequent time. Defendant did not testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Prior to announcing the verdicts, the trial court sua sponte made the following record:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   I do want to make one comment before I make a finding here, and I do intend to rule today. That is concerning the motion for mental exam. I tried to be clear on that this morning in giving [Counsel] opportunity to present whatever he wanted to in regard to that. And I think he presented me what he had in terms of conclusions about his own observations, which I take those very seriously when [C]ounsel say those things.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   But at the end of that, I'm still faced with just ruling based upon the information that is in front of me, and I did not find that there was sufficient grounds for a mental examination and evaluation to be ordered. I kept my mind open in that regard and told [Counsel] he could renew that if he wished to in the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   I also, because the Court has an independent duty in that regard, if it should come to the Court's attention that there's any reasonable grounds to believe [Defendant] is suffering from an incapacity, I observed [Defendant] during the course of this trial today. I observed his demeanor and his behavior, and perhaps lack of behavior, in that he interacted with [C]ounsel in the way that defendants normally do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   That is, I observed at least seven independent times that I made note of that he conferred with [C]ounsel, that he made notes and passed to [C]ounsel, that they discussed things that were happening when witnesses were testifying. That is the type of behavior that happens every day in this courtroom. I observed nothing that was unusual in that regard. So I'm not saying that that's determinative of anything, to be\n   clear. I'm just saying that adds to what the Court is taking into consideration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   So in terms of independent duty, I find no reason to believe that [Defendant] is suffering from any sort of mental incapacity at this juncture, based upon what is before me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The trial court found Defendant guilty as charged and imposed three seven-year sentences (Counts 1, 2, and 5), one 15-year sentence (Count 4), and a life sentence (Count 3), concurrent with each other and any other sentences. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion and Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant's sole point claims the trial court abused its discretion by denying the motion for a \u00a7 552.020 mental examination and proceeding through trial and sentencing without ordering such an examination. Defendant argues that the factual allegations in the motion and Counsel's arguments prior to trial constituted reasonable cause to believe Defendant was unable to assist in his own defense and that a reasonable judge in the same position would have doubted Defendant's competency to stand trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"It is well established that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the criminal prosecution of a defendant who is not competent to stand trial.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State v.

Missouri has codified this constitutional requirement in \u00a7 552.020.1, which provides that \"[n]o person who as a result of mental disease or defect lacks capacity to understand the proceedings against him or to assist in his own defense shall be tried, convicted or sentenced for the commission of an offense so long as the incapacity endures.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The test for competency is whether the defendant has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding and has a rational as well as a factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\n   <em>\n    Edwards v.

When sufficient information comes before the court such that the judge has reasonable cause to believe the defendant lacks fitness to proceed, the judge must order a mental examination, even if counsel has not raised the issue.
