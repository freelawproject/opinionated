BNSF argues that the trial court erred in denying BNSF's motion because the Tubbses failed to make a submissible case as to (1) the applicable standard of care and (2) punitive damages. BNSF also argues that the trial court erred in refusing BNSF's withdrawal instructions pertaining to evidence of (1) the height and design of the track and (2) an intentional breach of the track. Because we find that the Tubbses made a submissible case on the standard of care and punitive damages and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying BNSF's withdrawal instructions, we affirm the trial court's denial of BNSF's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Tubbses own and operate a farm in a floodplain near the Missouri River in Holt County, Missouri. The farm is located just southeast of Big Lake and about three-and-a-half miles east of the Missouri River. BNSF, an interstate freight railroad, owns and operates a track that runs east to west across the floodplain and bisects the Tubbses' farm. The track sits atop an earthen embankment, which was originally built in 1887.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The embankment blocked the free flow of occasional floodwaters from the Missouri River. In response to recurrent flooding over the years, BNSF incrementally raised the height of the track and added more ballast (crushed rock) between the embankment and the track to prevent water from spilling over the track and interrupting rail service. But, as the height of the track increased, BNSF did not provide additional drainage capacity (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , bridges or culverts) to address the increased volume of dammed water. Record-setting floodwaters from the Missouri River breached the embankment in July 2011 and damaged the Tubbses' farm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2012, the Tubbses filed a lawsuit in Holt County Circuit Court against BNSF and its contractor, Massman Construction Company, seeking actual and punitive damages for state-law torts, including trespass, nuisance, negligence, inverse condemnation, and statutory trespass in connection with the embankment breach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After discovery, BNSF moved for summary judgment on the ground that federal law preempted the Tubbses' state-law claims. The Tubbses requested and obtained a stay from the trial court so they could seek a Declaratory Order from the Surface Transportation Board (STB) addressing whether their state-law claims were preempted by federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2014, the STB concluded that the Tubbses' state-law claims were related to the design, construction, and maintenance of BNSF's rail line and, therefore, were preempted by the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010101\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (ICCTA).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Thomas Tubbs\n   </em>\n   , No. FD 35792,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%205508153\">\n    2014 WL 5508153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *4 (STB Service Date: Oct. 31, 2014).

The verdict-directing instruction given to the jury paraphrased the language of \u00a7 213.33, which states, in full, \"[e]ach drainage or other water carrying facility under or immediately adjacent to the roadbed shall be maintained and kept free of obstruction, to accommodate expected water flow for the area concerned.\" Specifically, the verdict-directing instruction stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Your verdict must be for plaintiffs, if you believe:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   First, defendants failed to maintain and keep free of obstruction each drainage or other water carrying facility under or immediately adjacent to the roadbed to accommodate expected water flow for the area concerned, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Second, defendant was thereby negligent, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Third, as a direct result of such negligence plaintiffs sustained damage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Over BNSF's objection, the court also instructed the jury to decide whether punitive damages should be awarded against BNSF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The following evidence favorable to the jury's verdict was adduced at trial. Historically, the valley where the Tubbses' farm is located had experienced several large floods, including floods in 1952, 1967, 1973, 1984, 1993, 2007, 2008, and 2010. In response to, or anticipation of, these events, BNSF occasionally raised the height of its track to prevent water from spilling over it and interrupting rail service, but BNSF never added any new openings in the embankment to allow for cross-drainage. Each time BNSF raised the track to protect it from expected water flow, the increase in height, together with the lack of additional drainage, increased the damming capability of the embankment because, as the track grew in height, the more water it would block, thereby raising the pressure on the embankment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   During\n   flooding, the absence of cross-drainage produced a water pressure differential-more water and greater water pressure on the upstream (northern) side of the embankment and substantially less water and thus lower water pressure on the downstream (southern) side. During the 2011 flood, the water on the north side of the embankment was approximately two feet deeper than the water on the south side. The uneven water pressure forced water to flow through the soil in the embankment, eroding the fine sediment therein, and eventually causing the breach that is the subject of this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Upstream from the Tubbses' farm, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) operates a series of five large reservoirs. In 2007, the Corps publicly announced that it would be releasing a larger volume of water from its reservoirs in the future, which would increase the flow of the Missouri River, creating a greater likelihood of downstream flooding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In the spring of 2011, BNSF knew there \"was a possibility that there would be flooding\" in the Missouri River Basin that year. The previous winter had been the snowiest in recent years in the northern region, and the eventual snowmelt significantly raised water levels in the Corps' reservoirs. Then, both April and May of 2011 had record-setting rainfall in the upper Missouri River Basin. The rain in May nearly filled the Corps' reservoirs to capacity. By the end of May, the Corps announced that it planned to release 150,000 cubic feet of water per second from its Gavins Point reservoir in South Dakota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In May and June of 2011, BNSF hired engineering consultants to advise it regarding the anticipated flooding that summer. At the time, BNSF's embankment had one drainage opening in its five-mile span, which was a bridge 134 feet in length. One consultant advised BNSF that four additional drainage openings in the embankment and a substantial increase in the existing opening were needed to address the anticipated water flow. Specifically, the consultant indicated that the height and length of the track necessitated ten times the amount of existing drainage through the embankment to accommodate expected water flow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Around the same time, BNSF raised its mainline track and fortified the entire track structure by placing rock, riprap, and other material trackside. BNSF focused its efforts on raising its track east of Big Lake-a stretch of about a mile-where the track sat at a slightly lower elevation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, BNSF \"ran out of time.\" Also, in the initial stages of the flood, before the embankment breach at the Tubbses' farm, BNSF contractors were \"out there mobilizing to start building bridges.\" BNSF \"knew [they] were going to do something. [They] just didn't know exactly what.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On June 19 or 20, 2011, a levee about eight miles north of Big Lake collapsed. The breach was several hundred feet wide and allowed a tremendous volume of water to move south, requiring the evacuation of local community members, including the Tubbses. Floodwaters quickly reached the north side of BNSF's embankment, and BNSF stopped operating freight trains on that segment of the line on June 20 because the track was submerged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In an effort to restart service, BNSF had internal discussions about the possibility of intentionally cutting holes in the embankment where the track ran along another farm to allow water to pass to the south side of the embankment equalizing the water pressure so the company could start rebuilding the embankment under the roadbed. At trial, the Tubbses introduced an internal BNSF email indicating that the railroad had intentionally breached the embankment to relieve pressure created by the floodwaters. But witnesses testified that BNSF never actually intentionally breached the embankment, and the Tubbses did not submit the claim of intentional breach to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The difference in surface water elevations on the north and south sides of the embankment produced a water pressure differential that was too great for the embankment to withstand, and, on July 21, 2011, the embankment failed at the site of the Tubbses' farm. The breach in the embankment adjacent to the Tubbses' farm eventually grew to a width of 900 feet. As the embankment gave way, the water rushed from north to south with such velocity that it scoured holes on the Tubbses' farm down to bedrock. The scour holes covered almost forty acres and were sixty feet deep in places. When the floodwaters finally receded, they left large sand deposits on approximately 385 acres of the farm; in some places, the sand was eight feet deep. A farm appraiser estimated that the difference in the value of the Tubbses' farm before and after the embankment breach was $2,598,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   During the instruction conference, BNSF's counsel proposed the following withdrawal instructions relevant to this appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Instruction No. C-The evidence of the height of Defendant's track or increases in height of Defendant's track is withdrawn from the case and you are not to consider such evidence in arriving at your verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Instruction No. E-The design of Defendant's track structure is withdrawn from the case and you are not to consider such evidence in arriving at your verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Instruction No. A-Any evidence concerning intentional breach of the roadbed is withdrawn from the case and you are not to consider such evidence in arriving at your verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The trial court rejected these withdrawal instructions, but instructed the Tubbses' counsel \"to not argue intentional breach\" in his closing statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   When the Tubbses' counsel raised arguments about the height of the track during his closing argument, BNSF renewed its objection on preemption grounds. This time, the trial court sustained BNSF's objection and told the Tubbses' counsel in a sidebar discussion: \"And to correct this ..., I'm going to instruct you to explain [to the jury] that the pertinent issue is the drainage of the water.\" Counsel then turned to the jury and said: \"So I want to make sure that the complaint is not that they raised the track by [two] foot; that's not the issue. It's raising the track with no drainage; [they] didn't add one more foot of opening.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The jury returned a verdict in favor of the Tubbses, awarding them $2,598,000 in compensatory damages and $1,231,000 in punitive damages, and the trial court entered its judgment accordingly. BNSF filed a timely Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict and Alternatively for a New Trial or to Amend the Judgment, in which BNSF raised the four issues, among others, on appeal here. The trial court denied BNSF's motion in its entirety. This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   BNSF raises four points on appeal. In Points I and II, BNSF argues that the trial court erred in denying BNSF's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict because the Tubbses failed to make a submissible case as to (1) the applicable standard of care (Point I) and (2) punitive damages (Point II). In Points III and IV, BNSF argues that the trial court erred in refusing BNSF's withdrawal instructions pertaining to evidence of (1) the height and design of the track (Point III) and (2) an intentional breach of BNSF's embankment (Point IV). We discuss each point in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

App. W.D. 2001). In its first point on appeal, BNSF asserts that, at trial, the Tubbses failed to make a submissible case on the duty of care owed by BNSF. Central to this issue is what\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20213.33\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 213.33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   requires of railroads. Specifically, does it require railroads to add or expand drainage facilities to accommodate expected water flow (as the Tubbses suggest), or does it merely require that they maintain the structural integrity of existing drainage facilities and ensure that they are free of obstruction (as BNSF suggests)?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Before examining BNSF's assertion on this point, however, we must first address the Tubbses' claim that the STB and the Eighth Circuit decisions are the law of the case on the nature of BNSF's duty of care. The Tubbses sought a stay of their state court action so that the STB could determine whether the Tubbses' state-law claims were preempted under the ICCTA. Although the Tubbses' petition for damages pending at that time in state court did not raise claims based on an alleged violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20213.33\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 213.33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Tubbses' Petition for a Declaratory Order, filed with the STB, did ask the STB to determine whether a claim based on a violation of \u00a7 213.33 would be preempted by the ICCTA. In its decision on the preemption of the Tubbses' state-law claims, the STB stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Here, the FRSA regulations that Petitioners cite [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20213.33\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 213.33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   213.103(c) ] are applicable to the entire national rail system and do not directly conflict with the uniform federal regulation of railroads under the Interstate Commerce Act.

The issue before the STB and Eighth Circuit-whether the Tubbses' claim under \u00a7 213.33 was preempted-is substantially different from the question of how the regulation should be interpreted. Additionally, where the prior tribunals did not construe or apply the regulation, the typical concerns underlying the law-of-the-case doctrine about uniformity of decisions, judicial economy, and the parties' expectations do not arise. At trial, the parties spent considerable time and energy arguing the meaning of \u00a7 213.33 (in addition to how it applied to BNSF under the facts of this case), which suggests that the parties had no expectation that the issue had been resolved by either the STB or Eighth Circuit decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Tubbses argue that, even if the proper interpretation of \u00a7 213.33 was not resolved by the STB, the railroad could have raised the issue and thus the law-of-the-case doctrine still applies. We disagree. The FRA, not the STB, is the federal agency charged with promulgating, interpreting, and enforcing the FRSA regulations, which include the drainage regulation. Moreover, even if the STB could have interpreted \u00a7 213.33, it was the Tubbses who sought a stay of the state case in order to seek guidance from the STB, yet they never raised the issue of the proper interpretation of \u00a7 213.33 with the STB.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Therefore, we reject the Tubbses' claim that the STB and Eighth Circuit decisions are the law of the case on the nature and scope of the duty \u00a7 213.33 imposed on BNSF.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Having determined that the STB and Eighth Circuit decisions did not address the nature of the duty owed under \u00a7 213.33, we now turn to that issue.

In contrast, BNSF interprets the phrase \"[e]ach drainage ... facility ... shall be maintained and kept free of obstruction\" to require the railroad to only maintain the structural integrity of existing drainage facilities and keep them free of obstruction. The railroad does not read the phrase \"to accommodate expected water flow\" to broaden that obligation. In other words, BNSF does not believe that \u00a7 213.33 requires\n   the railroad to add drainage under any circumstance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   But, even if the regulation could be interpreted to require a railroad to expand or add drainage facilities, it is required to do so only to accommodate typical water flow in the area and not water flows at historic levels. We discuss each of these phrases in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Under the plain language of \u00a7 213.33, the phrase \"maintained and kept free of obstruction\" pertains to only \"drainage or other water carrying facilit[ies].\" In other words, it is \"[e]ach drainage or other water carrying facility,\" and not other parts of the track like the roadbed or the embankment, that must be \"maintained and kept free of obstruction.\" But, as the Tubbses assert, use of the conjunctive \"and\" indicates that \"maintained\" and \"kept free of obstruction\" are two different concepts and, thus, should not be conflated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Olivette v.

Thus, the \"plain and ordinary meaning\" of \"maintained\" is to keep something in its existing state through repair or to keep it from failing. Under this definition, the term \"maintained\" does not appear to include the addition of something new. This view is supported by the structure of \u00a7 213.33 as well, which specifies that what is to be maintained is \"\n   <em>\n    [e]ach\n   </em>\n   drainage or other water carrying facility,\" \u00a7 213.33 (emphasis added), which suggests that BNSF's obligation to maintain applies solely to drainage facilities\n   <em>\n    already in existence.

The phrase \"to accommodate expected water flow for the area concerned\" describes the reason that each drainage facility must be maintained. In other words, the clause \"to accommodate expected water flow for the area concerned\" provides a standard of performance for the required task of maintaining each drainage facility. It is difficult to give any meaning to the phrase \"to accommodate expected water flow for the area concerned\" if the regulation is read to obligate railroads to maintain the structural integrity of only existing drainage facilities and to keep them free of obstruction regardless of the woefully inadequate nature of the existing drainage facilities. In a situation where the number and/or size of drainage facilities is inadequate, no matter how well their structural integrity is maintained or how well they are kept free of obstruction, expected water flow simply cannot be accommodated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   BNSF offers two arguments to support its narrow reading of \u00a7 213.33.

Second, BNSF argues that \u00a7 213.33 is purely a maintenance regulation and that, in light of ICCTA preemption, it cannot be interpreted to impose any design obligation on the railroad. But a casual reading of Part 213 reveals that, contrary to BNSF's argument, the FRA's safety regulations often impose structural obligations as well as maintenance-related ones.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, we see no basis for BNSF's argument that \u00a7 213.33 cannot be read to require additional drainage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \"It is a basic rule of [regulatory] construction that words should be given their plain and ordinary meaning whenever possible and [courts] will look elsewhere for interpretation only when the meaning is ambiguous or would lead to an illogical result defeating the purpose of the [regulation].\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Section 213.33 is intended to ensure railroad safety by preventing water from pooling on or around the tracks. Under BNSF's reading of \u00a7 213.33, as long as the structural integrity of existing drainage facilities is maintained and they are kept free of obstruction, the regulation is satisfied, regardless of whether the amount of drainage provided is adequate to accommodate expected water flow. In other words, BNSF reads \u00a7 213.33 to protect against only one source of water in the track area-that caused by damage to or blockage of existing drainage facilities, even though the lack of adequate drainage can lead to the same or greater dangers to railroad safety. For example, if read as BNSF suggests, \u00a7 213.33 would protect rail safety by preventing the pooling of water or the overtopping of tracks that might occur due to a collapsed or otherwise blocked drainage structure during a heavy rain event, but would do nothing to guard against the exact same risk resulting from inadequate drainage in an area where there is significant runoff during heavy rain. This reading is not consistent with \u00a7 213.33 's purpose of accommodating expected water flow so as to ensure railroad safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Although\n   <em>\n    MD Mall\n   </em>\n   involved storm water runoff and not widespread flooding conditions, \u00a7 213.33 must also be interpreted to prevent the threat to track integrity posed by water pouring over the track or washing away the roadbed's support structure during flooding. In flood conditions, the interpretation of \u00a7 213.33 suggested by BNSF-that BNSF is required to maintain existing drainage facilities and keep them free of obstruction, but is not required to provide an adequate amount of drainage-conflicts with the purpose of the drainage regulation. Floodwaters accumulating on one side of a track embankment with inadequate cross-drainage will rise more rapidly and, thus, be more likely to overtop the track, creating a hazard the regulation is intended to prevent. Moreover, uneven water levels between the upstream and downstream sides of such an embankment expose the upstream side to significantly more pressure, thus compromising the embankment's integrity, which is what happened here. Therefore, in the context of a flood, the narrow reading of \u00a7 213.33 advanced by BNSF is inconsistent with the regulation's purpose.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Therefore, to give both phrases-\"each drainage ... facility ... shall be maintained or kept free of obstruction\" and \"to accommodate the expected water flow for the area concerned\"-meaning consistent with the purpose of \u00a7 213.33, we must read the regulation to require not only that existing drainage facilities be kept structurally sound and free of obstruction but also that an adequate amount of drainage be provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   BNSF also argues that even if \u00a7 213.33 imposes upon it a duty to expand or add drainage facilities, that duty applies to accommodate only\n   <em>\n    expected\n   </em>\n   water flow, which does not include flooding of historic proportions such as that experienced near Big Lake in 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   As noted above, \"[i]t is a basic rule of [regulatory] construction that words should be given their plain and ordinary meaning whenever possible and [courts] will look elsewhere for interpretation only when the meaning is ambiguous or would lead to an illogical result defeating the purpose of the [regulation].\"\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9093938\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/116/630/#p638\">\n    116 S.W.3d at 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although there was evidence that a flood in 1952 had a higher peak discharge and higher peak flow than the 2011 flood, there was also evidence that the 2011 flood involved more water and was longer in duration than previous\n   floods. But whether the 2011 flood was so unique vis-\u00e0-vis other floods as to make its water flow unexpected was a question for the jury. And, even if the jury concluded that the 2011 flood was greater in magnitude than previous floods, there was still a question of fact as to whether such a flood was probable in light of other evidence, including that, in 2007, the Corps publicly announced that, in the future, it would be releasing a larger volume of water from its reservoirs upstream from Big Lake, which would increase the flow of the Missouri River, creating a greater likelihood of downstream flooding. Thus, there was sufficient evidence to submit to the jury the question of whether BNSF violated its duty to accommodate expected water flow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The first element of a submissible case of negligence is the existence of a duty on the part of the defendant.\n   <em>\n    Poloski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9441304\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/68/445/#p449\">\n    68 S.W.3d at 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As we discussed in connection with Point I above, the purpose of \u00a7 213.33 is to prevent water from pooling on or under the tracks, overtopping the tracks, or otherwise compromising track integrity, because that may endanger safe railroad operations or cause railroad-related accidents or incidents. But, the Clarification Amendment imposes liability when a railroad's violation of \u00a7 213.33 results in property damage even though the regulation itself is not intended to protect neighboring property owners. Typically, punitive damage claims based on an alleged violation of a duty of care established by statute or regulation involve a duty designed to protect the injured party. In such cases, whether punitive damages can be awarded in a negligence action depends on whether the \"defendant knew or had reason to know a high degree of probability existed that the action would result in injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Oyler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655638\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/539/742/#p746\">\n    539 S.W.3d at 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Poage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385676\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/523/496/#p516\">\n    523 S.W.3d at 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original omitted)). In light of the two-part regulatory scheme at issue in this case, the standard is different. Here the question is whether, through its conduct, BNSF manifested such reckless indifference to the obligations imposed by \u00a7 213.33, that the railroad intentionally violated the drainage regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Viewed in the light most favorable to the Tubbses, the evidence in this case was sufficient to permit the jury to conclude that BNSF acted with \"conscious negligence tantamount to intentional wrongdoing\" where BNSF knew that its track was located in an area that frequently flooded, that the embankment under its track acted as a dam, that the existing drainage facility in the embankment was inadequate to allow water to pass from one side of the embankment to the other, and that the differential in water levels caused by the damming effect of the embankment caused pressure on the embankment. Moreover, although the embankment had survived prior floods, by raising the embankment, BNSF increased the pressure that flooding would cause on the embankment, and BNSF had been put on notice as early as 2007 that, in the future, the Corps would be releasing a larger volume of water from its reservoirs upstream from Big Lake, which would increase the flow of the Missouri River. Thus, there was evidence that BNSF knew that the lack of drainage facilities risked overtopping or compromised structural integrity. Yet BNSF failed to add drainage facilities to accommodate the expected water flow and, as a result, the embankment collapsed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   According to the trial testimony, the area where BNSF's track was located was prone to flooding and BNSF had been put on notice that water flow in the area was likely to increase in the future. BNSF knew its embankment acted like a dam, obstructing the free flow of floodwaters across the valley. Several times over the years, BNSF raised the height of its track to prevent water from spilling over the track and interrupting rail service. But, as the height of the track increased, BNSF did not add drainage to address the increased volume of dammed water. The embankment's damming effect created a situation where the pressure differentials between the upstream (northern) side and\n   the downstream (southern) side could threaten the stability of the embankment. There was testimony that, when the water pressure builds up against the embankment, it causes sediment to be washed away to the point that the embankment collapses, which is exactly what happened at the Tubbses' farm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In May, BNSF began hiring engineering consultants to advise the railroad about the anticipated flooding that summer. One consultant advised BNSF that drainage through the embankment was so inadequate that four additional drainage openings and a substantial increase in the existing opening were needed to address the anticipated floodwaters. Yet, BNSF added no drainage. Despite having knowledge of the effect of increasing the track height without adding drainage and the likelihood of significant flooding, BNSF focused its actions on raising the track again and fortifying the embankment by adding riprap. In the initial stages of the flood, before the embankment breach at the Tubbses' farm, BNSF contractors were \"out there mobilizing to start building bridges.\" BNSF \"knew [they] were going to do something. [They] just didn't know exactly what.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The evidence was sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that BNSF was indifferent to the risks associated with the lack of adequate drainage through the embankment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   BNSF argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's award of punitive damages because the Tubbses had to show that the railroad's conduct was \"tantamount to intentional wrongdoing,\" and they failed to do so.\n   <em>\n    Lopez v.

In\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court of Missouri articulated three factors weighing against the submission of punitive damages in negligence cases:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   prior similar occurrences known to the defendant have been infrequent; the injurious event was unlikely to have occurred absent negligence on the part of someone other than the defendant; and the defendant did not knowingly violate a statute, regulation, or clear industry standard designed to prevent the type of injury that occurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11186693\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/26/151/#p160\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The first factor-knowledge of prior similar occurrences-does not relieve BNSF of liability here. Although BNSF's embankment had not failed during previous floods, there was evidence that BNSF was aware of the increased damming effect its raised track would have and the likelihood of increased water flow in the area caused by releases from upstream reservoirs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Koon v. Walden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655640\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/539/752/#p773\">\n    539 S.W.3d 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 773-74 (Mo. App. E.D. 2017) (holding that lack of prior incidents was not important because that factor went to defendant doctor's knowledge, and he admitted knowing the risks of prescribing opioids for plaintiff). With respect to the second factor-the injurious event was unlikely to have occurred absent someone else's negligence-we find that the failure of BNSF's embankment was the result of pressure on\n   the embankment caused by the increased damming effect of the raised embankment and inadequate drainage under or through the embankment, rather than the flood in and of itself. Finally, the third factor-the defendant did not knowingly violate a regulation designed to prevent the type of injury that occurred-also weighs against BNSF. BNSF knowingly took steps that violated the purpose of \u00a7 213.33-preventing water from weakening the track support structure. The railroad increased the height of the track knowing that would increase the volume of dammed water and the differential pressure on the embankment, without providing anywhere for the additional dammed water to go, except eventually through a breach in the embankment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Eastern District of this court recently elaborated on the meaning of \"tantamount to intentional wrongdoing,\" and we find the analysis in that case persuasive.\n   <em>\n    Koon\n   </em>\n   , 539 S.W.3d at 773-74. In\n   <em>\n    Koon\n   </em>\n   , the court held that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to award punitive damages against a doctor who failed to monitor a patient to whom he had prescribed increasingly high amounts of opioids.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court explained that, \"though [the doctor] may have had 'no specific intent to injure,' his awareness-from his knowledge of surrounding circumstances-that his conduct would probably result in injury demonstrates that his actions were 'tantamount to intentional wrongdoing.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 773. Likewise, in the present case, the evidence, viewed most favorably to the Tubbses, supports a finding that BNSF was aware-from its knowledge of surrounding circumstances-that its conduct, coupled with the expectation of increased water flow, would probably result in collapse of the track embankment. Under\n   <em>\n    Koon\n   </em>\n   , that is enough to make BNSF's conduct \"tantamount to intentional wrongdoing.\" And, under the Clarification Amendment, the fact that a collapse occurred and the Tubbses' farm was destroyed as a result exposes BNSF to punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to conclude that BNSF acted with reckless indifference to, or conscious disregard for, its obligations under \u00a7 213.33 in circumstances that presented a high probability of harm. Thus, the trial court did not err in submitting the issue of punitive damages to the jury. Point II is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Withdrawal Instructions on Height and Design of Track\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   At trial, BNSF raised an objection to the Tubbses' arguments about the height of the track, arguing that the issue was preempted. The trial court overruled the objection but gave BNSF a standing objection to any inquiry about the track's height. Then, during the instruction conference, BNSF proposed the following withdrawal instructions about the height and design of the track structure:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   Instruction No. C-The evidence of the height of Defendant's track or increases in height of Defendant's track is withdrawn from the case and you are not to consider such evidence in arriving at your verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   Instruction No. E-The design of Defendant's track structure is withdrawn from the case and you are not to consider such evidence in arriving at your verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The court rejected these instructions. When the Tubbses' counsel raised arguments about the height of the track during his closing argument, BNSF renewed its objection on preemption grounds. This time, the trial court sustained BNSF's objection and told the Tubbses' counsel in a sidebar discussion: \"And to correct this ..., I'm going to instruct you to explain [to the jury] that the pertinent issue is the drainage of the water.\" Counsel then turned to the jury and stated: \"So I want to make sure that the complaint is not that they raised the track by 2 foot; that's not the issue. It's raising the track with no drainage; [they] didn't add one more foot of opening.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The verdict-directing instruction provided to the jury stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   Your verdict must be for plaintiffs, if you believe:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   First, defendants failed to maintain and keep free of obstruction each drainage or other water carrying facility under or immediately adjacent to the roadbed to accommodate expected water flow for the area concerned, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Second, defendant was thereby negligent, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   Third, as a direct result of such negligence plaintiffs sustained damage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   None of the instructions given to the jury mentioned the height or design of the track.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   We find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying BNSF's Instruction No. C (height of BNSF's track) or Instruction No. E (design of BNSF's track structure). The Tubbses' claim of inadequate drainage is inextricably linked to increases in the height of the track. Proposed instructions C and E would have withdrawn evidence of the height and design of the track, but the height and design of the track were relevant to the Tubbses' claim that more drainage was needed to comply with \u00a7 213.33. The taller the track, the greater the damming effect of the embankment and, therefore, the greater the need for drainage. It would have been unreasonable to ask the jury to consider the Tubbses' claim without regard to any evidence of the increasing height of the track. And our review of the trial testimony revealed that, for the most part, when evidence about track height was presented, it was in conjunction with the lack of additional drainage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Even if we were to determine from our review of the testimony that the jury could have been misled into thinking that the proper height and design of the track were issues for deliberation, counsel's statement about the pertinent issue being drainage, when coupled with the verdict-directing instruction, were sufficient to ensure that the jury would not be misled. Both counsel's statement and the verdict-directing instruction, which tracked the language of \u00a7 213.33, made clear to the jury that the issue for deliberation was drainage and not track height or design. Thus, the trial court properly exercised its discretion in rejecting BNSF's withdrawal instructions on track height and design. Point III is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Withdrawal Instruction on Intentional Breach Theory\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   At trial, the Tubbses introduced an internal BNSF email indicating that the railroad had intentionally breached the embankment where the track ran along another farm to relieve pressure created by the floodwaters. However, all of the witnesses who testified on this issue, including the author of the email, stated that the intentional breach never occurred, and the Tubbses offered no other evidence to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   During the instruction conference, BNSF proposed the following withdrawal instruction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   Instruction No. A-Any evidence concerning intentional breach of the roadbed is withdrawn from the case and you are not to consider such evidence in arriving at your verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The trial court rejected this instruction, but directed plaintiffs' counsel \"to not argue intentional breach\" in his closing statement. None of the instructions provided to the jury addressed the issue of intentional breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Although it would have been prudent for the trial court to give BNSF's withdrawal instruction on intentional breach, the court's decision to reject the instruction is not an abuse of discretion. \"There is no abuse of discretion if reasonable persons could differ about the propriety\n   of the trial court's decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11889514\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/956/351/#p355\">\n    956 S.W.2d at 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, reasonable people could disagree about the propriety of the court's decision to deny the instruction on intentional breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Although the BNSF email about an intentional breach was admitted into evidence, every witness, including the Tubbses' expert, testified that no intentional breach occurred. The instructions given to the jury were consistent with the evidence. None of the instructions, including the verdict director, mentioned an intentional breach. And the Tubbses' counsel did not mention the intentional breach email in his closing argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burton v.
