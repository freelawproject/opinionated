We conclude that this suit to remove a county official from elected office under chapter 87 of the Texas Local Government Code (the removal statute) is a legal action under the TCPA. However, the TCPA does not apply when a government attorney brings an enforcement action in the state's name. We further conclude that only one of the several allegations against the county official constitutes an enforcement action. Finally, as to the allegations that are not enforcement actions, we conclude that the state's sovereign immunity does not protect it from the county official's claim for appellate costs. We affirm the court of appeals' judgment, with a modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When Paul Harper ran for a position on the Somervell County Hospital District Board, he campaigned on pledges to eliminate the tax that supports the district and to replace the district's administrative employees. He won the election, joined the board, and allegedly tried to make good on his promises. In response, a county resident named George Best sought to remove Harper from the board by filing this suit under the removal statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. LOC. GOV'T CODE \u00a7\u00a7 87.001 -.043. Specifically, Best alleged that Harper violated the district's bylaws at a board meeting by moving to set the district's tax rate at zero-even though Harper knew that eliminating the tax revenue would bankrupt or otherwise harm the district. Best also alleged that Harper posted a blog that falsely accused the district's administrative employees of violating the law. Best argued these actions were enough to remove Harper for incompetency under the removal statute.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 87.013(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The removal statute authorizes any Texas resident who has lived in a county for at least six months to file a petition to remove certain county officers from office (a removal petition).\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 87.012, .015(b);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tex.

Consistent with that requirement, the Somervell county attorney opted to appear in this case as plaintiff on the state's behalf. The state adopted Best's allegations, and it added an allegation that Harper engaged in misconduct by violating the Texas Open Meetings Act when he exchanged certain text messages with other board members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.

Harper contended that the state could not establish a prima facie case for removal because he did not formally move to set the district's tax rate at zero, did not author or publish the blog, and did not violate the Open Meetings Act by exchanging text messages with other board members.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10170170,2250942\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/285/191/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 27.005(c) (providing that a court may not dismiss a legal action \"if the party bringing the legal action establishes by clear and specific evidence a prima facie case for each essential element of the claim\"). Harper argued that the trial court should dismiss the removal petition and award him attorney's fees, costs, and sanctions.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10170170,2250942\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/285/191/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 27.009(a) (instructing that a court dismissing an action shall award attorney's fees, court costs, and sanctions to a party who obtains dismissal).

The state moved for rehearing in the court of appeals, arguing for the first time that sovereign immunity protects it from any claim for attorney's fees, court costs, or sanctions under the TCPA. The court of appeals denied the motion. But while the motion was pending, Harper lost his bid for reelection, and as a result he no longer serves on the hospital district's board.

Harper argues we cannot address mootness at all because the trial court's record contains no evidence\n   that he lost his reelection bid and no longer serves on the board.

TEX. GOV'T CODE \u00a7 22.001(d). Here, the state filed a \"status report\" with the court of appeals that included an election canvass confirming that Harper lost his reelection bid. Harper does not dispute that he lost the election or that he no longer holds the position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The state concedes that Harper's failed reelection bid renders its removal petition moot. But the state contends that the issue whether the court of appeals properly ordered the trial court to award Harper his costs, attorney's fees, and sanctions under the TCPA is not moot. We agree that Harper's request for an award of attorney's fees and sanctions under the TCPA presents an issue that is separate from the request for removal, and we also agree that this separate issue survives the mootness that would otherwise prevent us from addressing the underlying claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We have recognized that in some cases-but not all-a claim for attorney's fees \"breathes life\" into a suit that has become moot in all other respects.\n   <em>\n    Camarena v.

We disagree. A court order requiring the defendant's removal or ouster from office is undoubtedly a \"remedy.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Dishman v.

And \"remedy\" is another word for \"relief.\"\n   <em>\n    See Relief\n   </em>\n   , BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014) [ BLACK'S ] (defining \"relief\" as the \"redress or benefit[ ] ... that a party asks of a court\" and noting that \"relief\" is \"[a]lso termed\n   <em>\n    remedy\n   </em>\n   \"). Here, the remedy the state seeks is only available because Texas law-specifically, article 5, section 24 of the Texas constitution and chapter 87 of the Texas Local Government Code-provides it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Const. art. V, \u00a7 24 ; TEX. LOC. GOV'T CODE \u00a7 87.013.

For example, the statute permits a trial court to refuse to issue an order for citation against the county officer. TEX. LOC. GOV'T CODE \u00a7 87.016(c).

According to the state, these \"specific\" provisions govern the dismissal of a removal action, but the TCPA's \"general\" dismissal provisions do not.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , TEX. GOV'T CODE \u00a7 311.026(b) (providing that when a general provision irreconcilably conflicts with a special or local provision, \"the special or local provision prevails ... unless the general provision is the later enactment and the manifest intent is that the general provision prevail\"). So in the state's view, we cannot apply the TCPA to a removal petition without intruding \"into a field governed by a specific law adopted pursuant to a constitutional mandate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Harper responds that the removal statute's remedies are not exclusive and that the chapter itself contemplates that a defendant can rely on external defenses such as the TCPA. For example, the chapter states that \"the proceedings connected with the trial\" of a removal petition \"shall be conducted as much as possible in accordance with the rules and practice of the court in other civil cases.\" TEX. LOC. GOV'T CODE \u00a7 87.018(b).

Here, the state neither identifies nor have we found any provision in either statute that cannot be applied alongside those in the other statute. The removal statute provides for dismissal when the trial court determines that citation should not issue. TEX. LOC. GOV'T CODE \u00a7 87.016(c). The TCPA's dismissal provisions provide the defendant the opportunity to argue for dismissal on other grounds-namely, his rights to free speech, to petition, and to associate. TEX. CIV.

Otherwise, the legislature would have said \"legal action\" all four times.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    These observations demonstrate that whatever an \"enforcement action\" is, it must be different from a \"legal action.\" A \"legal action\" is \"a lawsuit, cause of action, petition, complaint, cross-claim, or counterclaim or any other judicial pleading or filing that requests legal or equitable relief.\" TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7 27.001(6). It would be difficult to write a more capacious definition, and even more so to conceive one for an undefined term. So the definition of an \"enforcement action\" cannot exceed the broad definition the TCPA gives for \"legal action.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7322096\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/325/628/#p639\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Nor can the two terms share the same meaning.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     DeQueen\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7322096\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/325/628/#p639\">\n     325 S.W.3d at 635\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Hence, a TCPA \"enforcement action\" must be a subtype of legal actions in general. That is, the term \"enforcement action\" must mean something less than \"any legal action brought by the state.\" Otherwise, \"enforcement action\" and \"legal action\" would mean the same thing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    We conclude that, within the TCPA, the term \"enforcement action\" refers to a governmental attempt to enforce a substantive legal prohibition against unlawful conduct. This interpretation is consistent with the TCPA's text, under which enforcements are but one type of legal action.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7322096\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/325/628/#p639\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 27.001(6). It also accords with the TCPA's self-expressed purpose, which \"is to encourage and safeguard constitutional rights\"-not to impede the criminal or civil proceedings that law enforcement or other government agencies initiate.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7322096\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/325/628/#p639\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 27.002. Under this definition, a removal petition is not an \"enforcement action\" in the abstract. Instead it is a procedural device, and as such a party cannot initiate a removal action to enforce the removal statute itself. There is a range of conduct-some unlawful and some not-for which a public official may properly face removal under the removal statute. And as discussed above, the TCPA is available\n    by default since removal actions are legal actions. However, when a removal action has its basis in unlawful conduct, the \"enforcement action\" exemption renders the TCPA inapplicable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Accordingly, we must next ask whether the petition against Harper seeks to enforce a substantive legal prohibition against unlawful conduct. Under the removal statute, \"[a]n officer may be removed for: (1) incompetency; (2) official misconduct; or (3) intoxication on or off duty caused by drinking an alcoholic beverage.\" TEX. LOC. GOV'T CODE \u00a7 87.013(a).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    In his original petition, Best sought Harper's removal based on Best's allegation that Harper \"exhibited incompetency by way of gross ignorance of his official duties and gross carelessness in the discharge of those duties.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7322096\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/325/628/#p639\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 87.011(2)(A)-(B) (\" 'Incompetency' means: (A) gross ignorance of official duties; (B) gross carelessness in the discharge of those duties[ ]....\"). Incompetency is a basis for removal under the removal statute, but it is not against the law.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7322096\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/325/628/#p639\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 87.013(a)(1). Similarly, while intoxication is also a basis for removal, and while the town drunk might make a lousy official, being the town drunk is not against the law.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7322096\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/325/628/#p639\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 87.013(a)(3).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Best's incompetency claims are a transparent retaliation against Harper's quixotic political beliefs. Harper opposed the hospital district's creation. He put his beliefs into action by running for office, and the voters of Somervell County elected him on a clearly stated anti-tax platform. Best's petition alleges Harper did exactly what he told the voters he would do upon taking office. Harper's detractors may disagree with his politics, but no law requires elected officials to support the status quo upon arriving in office. Best's removal petition was a pretext for forcing Harper to cease acting on the beliefs that won him his office in the first place.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    We are not fooled. We doubt anyone else is. Harper's refusal to capitulate to Best's demands does not render him incompetent. Best thought that the hospital district was important, and he sought Harper's removal because he thought that Harper was setting the hospital up for failure, lacked candor, and sometimes communicated less than cordially. Even if a jury agreed that Harper was unfit for office, he would face no criminal or civil penalty other than removal itself. Efforts like Best's are attacks on core political speech. But the TCPA \"protects citizens who petition or speak on matters of public concern from retaliatory lawsuits that seek to intimidate or silence them.\"\n    <em>\n     In re Lipsky\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6872091\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/579/#p584\">\n     460 S.W.3d 579\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 584 (Tex. 2015) (orig. proceeding) (footnote omitted) (citing TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7\u00a7 27.001 -.011). Since the incompetency allegations in Best's petition seek to achieve Best's political goals rather than to enforce a law, they cannot form the basis of an enforcement action for purposes of the TCPA.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7 27.010(a).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Nor are we swayed by the argument that Best's incompetency claim included allegations that Harper violated the hospital district's bylaws. The bylaws require board members to discharge their duties \"in good faith, with ordinary care, and in a manner the director reasonably believes to be in the best interest of the District.\" Similarly, the bylaws prohibit members from performing \"any act with the intention of harming the District or any of its operations\" or \"that would make it impossible or unnecessarily difficult to carry on the intended or ordinary business of the District.\" Best's petition argues Harper violated the bylaws by attempting to set the district's tax rate at zero and by accusing\n    the district's administration of violating the law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    The Somervell County Hospital District Board of Directors may promulgate bylaws pursuant to its authority to \"adopt rules governing the operation of the hospital and hospital system and the duties, functions, and responsibilities of district staff and employees.\" TEX. HEALTH &amp; SAFETY CODE \u00a7 286.075. Although violation of an organization's internal rules concerning \"duties, functions, and responsibilities\" may expose the violator to liability, the rules are just that-rules. Though they may sometimes overlap with Texas statutes, regulations, or common-law obligations, the bylaws appear nowhere within these bodies of law. Instead, they arise by agreement of the board of directors. Indeed, the bylaws include numerous references to actions required by law\n    <em>\n     or\n    </em>\n    the bylaws. In sum, the bylaws are not\n    <em>\n     legal\n    </em>\n    prohibitions against unlawful conduct, and they do not elevate the allegations in Best's petition to an \"enforcement action.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    TEX.

This allegation is sufficient to form the basis of an enforcement action. It involves reference to a specific statutory provision that contains a substantive prohibition against certain conduct, and the state alleges Harper violated that prohibition. Whatever the merits of the state's allegation, it amounts to an \"enforcement\" of a law-the Open Meetings Act-\"brought in the name of this state.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    TEX. CIV.

The court of appeals' judgment awarded \"judgment against the state of Texas for [Harper's] appellate costs that were paid, if any, by [Harper]; and all unpaid appellate court cost[s], if any ... against the state of Texas.\" Similarly, the court of appeals' opinion remands the case to the trial court for a \"determination of Harper's request for court costs, reasonable attorney's fees, and sanctions.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6782405\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/493/105/#p111\">\n     493 S.W.3d at 118\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The state argues the award and remand were improper.

The removal statute requires \"the person filing the petition to post security for costs\" and further directs that dismissal shall be \"at the cost of the person filing the petition.\" TEX. LOC. GOV'T CODE \u00a7 87.016(c). The state joined Best's suit, but Best filed the initial petition, so the state argues that the removal statute does not provide a waiver of immunity. Similarly, the TCPA allows a court to award \"sanctions against the party who\n    <em>\n     brought\n    </em>\n    the legal action.\" TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7 27.009(a)(2) (emphasis added).

LOC. GOV'T CODE \u00a7 87.016(c). Harper argues this officer is an \"agent of the state\" and therefore the removal statute contemplates payment by a \"governmental entity.\" So in Harper's view, the state stepped beyond the sphere of its immunity when it appeared in the suit. Harper also points to the four-factor analysis we set out in\n    <em>\n     Wichita Falls State Hospital v. Taylor\n    </em>\n    for determining whether language less explicit than \" 'sovereign immunity to suit is waived' ... may nevertheless waive the State's immunity from suit,\" to argue that the removal statute, the TCPA, or both expressly waives immunity.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9114989\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/106/692/#p697\">\n     106 S.W.3d 692\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 697-98 (Tex. 2003) (footnote omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    We agree with the state that neither statute waives the state's immunity from suit. The portions of the removal statute discussing costs treat the temporary replacement officer as an individual, not as an agent of the state.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    TEX. LOC. GOV'T CODE \u00a7 87.017. The officer is an agent of the state for purposes of carrying\n    out his job duties, but not for purposes of paying the costs associated with an unsuccessful removal action. Consequently, the removal statute does not contain a \"clear and unambiguous\" waiver of the state's immunity from suit.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Tooke\n    </em>\n    , 197 S.W.3d at 328-29.

[it] would have clearly stated so.\" That argument states precisely the opposite of the presumption that we apply when determining whether the legislature has waived sovereign immunity.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Taylor\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9114989\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/106/692/#p697\">\n     106 S.W.3d at 701\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"[W]e require the Legislature to express its intent beyond doubt and will construe ambiguities in a manner that retains the State's immunity.\").

Because the state should not be suing to prevent its own citizens from participating in government-especially when it lacks even a prima facie case against them-and because when it does sue, it risks paying only attorney's fees (rather than damages or some other uncapped sum), abrogating the state's sovereign immunity in the TCPA context does not present any grave danger to the public fisc.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Tex.

We have considered abrogation for attorney's fees in other contexts-sometimes applying it, sometimes not-but we have never addressed a counterclaim for attorney's fees under the TCPA. So while cases like\n    <em>\n     Kinnear\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Manbeck\n    </em>\n    are instructive, neither is dispositive.

To reach its good result in this case, the Court ignores the governing statute's language and undermines our well-established sovereign-immunity precedent. Applying the statute's language and our carefully constructed immunity doctrine, I would hold that the Texas Citizens Participation Act does not apply to this enforcement action; and even if it did apply, sovereign immunity bars Harper's counterclaim for fees, costs, and sanctions.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    <strong>\n     I.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    <strong>\n     Enforcement Action\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    The Texas Citizens Participation Act (TCPA) \"does not apply\" to \"an enforcement action that is brought in the name of this state or a political subdivision of this state by the attorney general, a district attorney, a criminal district attorney, or a county attorney.\" TEX.

Here, a county attorney, acting for the state, sought to remove Harper from his elected position on a hospital district's board under Chapter 87 of the Local Government Code.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    TEX. LOC. GOV'T CODE \u00a7 87.013(a)(1), (2). The first issue is whether this Chapter 87 removal action is an \"enforcement action.\" If it is, Harper cannot recover his costs, fees, or sanctions under the TCPA because the TCPA \"does not apply.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    The TCPA does not define \"enforcement action.\" Considering its common, ordinary meaning and its statutory context, the Court construes the term to mean a legal action that attempts \"to enforce a substantive legal prohibition against unlawful conduct.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at ----. Although I cannot fully join the Court's reasoning,\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    I agree\n    that its definition adequately captures the term's common, ordinary meaning.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    But I do not agree with the Court's application of that definition.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    The Court agrees that this Chapter 87 removal action is an enforcement action\n    <em>\n     to the extent\n    </em>\n    it seeks removal based on Harper's alleged \"official misconduct,\" because his alleged misconduct arises from \"unlawful\" actions in violation of the Texas Open Meetings Act.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at ----. But the Court\n    holds that this is not an enforcement action to the extent it seeks removal based on Harper's alleged \"incompetency\" because incompetency \"is not against the law.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at ----. According to the Court, Harper could seek dismissal and recover attorney's fees, costs, and sanctions under the TCPA to the extent the state sought removal based on incompetency allegations, but not to the extent the state relied on misconduct allegations.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at ----. By inventing this dichotomy, the Court finds a way to allow Harper to recover at least some costs and fees under the TCPA.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    But it does so only by ignoring Chapter 87's governing provisions, which-for both incompetency and misconduct-permit removal only to enforce an officer's statutorily imposed \"official duties.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Chapter 87 describes three grounds for removal: \"incompetency,\" \"official misconduct,\" and \"intoxication on or off duty caused by drinking an alcoholic beverage.\" TEX. LOC. GOV'T CODE \u00a7 87.013(a). As the Court notes, the statute defines official misconduct to mean \"intentional,\n    <em>\n     unlawful\n    </em>\n    behavior,\" but the remainder of that definition explains that the behavior must relate \"to\n    <em>\n     official duties\n    </em>\n    by an officer entrusted with the administration of justice or the execution of the law. The term includes an intentional or corrupt failure, refusal, or neglect of an officer to\n    <em>\n     perform a duty\n    </em>\n    imposed on the officer by law.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6782405\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/493/105/#p111\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 87.011(3) (emphases added).

While the Court certainly has the power to \"abrogate\" sovereign immunity however it wants, its decision in this case undermines the distinction we have recognized between the\n    <em>\n     scope\n    </em>\n    of immunity and a\n    <em>\n     waiver\n    </em>\n    of immunity.

Unlike the Court's misplaced reliance on the TCPA's purpose to construe the statutory term \"enforcement action,\"\n    <em>\n     see supra\n    </em>\n    n.2, the Court relies on that purpose here to shift the responsibility for its own policy decision. The Court cannot claim to be promoting the legislature's purpose when-as the Court itself agrees-the legislature did not waive the state's immunity from suit in the TCPA.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    at ----. Nor does anything about the TCPA suggest that the legislature wanted the Court to treat the TCPA differently than any other statute that allows for an award of attorney's fees. To the contrary, the legislature has made clear its view (and we have consistently and repeatedly agreed) that we cannot find that a statute waives immunity unless it does so by \"clear and unambiguous\" language. TEX. GOV'T CODE \u00a7 311.034. Because the legislature has not clearly and unambiguously waived immunity in the TCPA, the Court cannot genuinely claim to be promoting the legislature's purpose by judicially abrogating immunity the legislature has not waived.\n    <em>\n     See supra\n    </em>\n    n.3.

The question we must decide is whether Harper can recover those losses under the TCPA. Because this Chapter 87 removal action is an \"enforcement action\" regardless of the grounds asserted, the TCPA \"does not apply.\" And even if it did apply, the state's immunity from suit bars Harper's counterclaim for court costs, attorney's fees, and sanctions because the state neither sought nor obtained any monetary recovery that an award to Harper could offset. Because Harper's counterclaim presents the only issue that is not now moot in this case, I would reverse the court of appeals' judgment remanding the case for an award of costs, fees, and sanctions and render judgment dismissing this case. Because the Court holds otherwise, I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-130\">\n     For the reasons the Court explains, I agree that this case is not moot and that it constitutes a \"legal action\" under the TCPA.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-131\">\n     In particular, I do not join the Court's reliance on \"that last redoubt of losing causes, the proposition that the statute at hand should be liberally construed to achieve its purposes.\"\n     <em>\n      Dir.,Office of Workers' Comp.

But the question of whether the claim has merit is relevant to the trial court's decision whether to\n     <em>\n      dismiss\n     </em>\n     the claim, not to whether the TCPA\n     <em>\n      applies\n     </em>\n     in the first place.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code \u00a7 27.005 (providing that court shall dismiss a suit if the evidence shows that it is based on, relates to, or is in response to the defendant's exercise of the rights to free speech, to petition, or of association; unless the evidence establishes a prima facie case for each element of the claim; unless the evidence establishes each element of a valid defense). If the claim constitutes an enforcement action, Harper cannot seek dismissal\n     <em>\n      under the TCPA\n     </em>\n     because the TCPA does not apply\n     <em>\n      even if\n     </em>\n     the claim lacks merit. And the fact that the claim is based on the defendant's free speech is a prerequisite for dismissal under the TCPA, not a prerequisite for the TCPA's enforcement-action exemption.\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131066\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/522/#p525\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     \u00a7\u00a7 27.003(a), .005(b). Under the Court's purpose-based reasoning, the enforcement-action exemption will never apply if the defendant is entitled to dismissal, and thus the exemption means nothing at all. If the suit is an enforcement action but is based on the defendant's free speech, the exemption would not apply but the defendant would always meet the prerequisite for dismissal. If it is an enforcement action and is not based on free speech, the exemption would apply and the defendant would not be entitled to dismissal. In other words, under the Court's construction, the exemption would merely prevent the TCPA from applying to claims that would not be subject to dismissal under the TCPA anyway.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"3\">\n    <p id=\"p-133\">\n     I do not agree, however, with the Court's suggestion that a\n     <em>\n      substantive\n     </em>\n     legal prohibition must appear in some \"specific\n     <em>\n      statutory\n     </em>\n     provision\" and must be enforceable by \"criminal or civil penalties.\"\n     <em>\n      Ante\n     </em>\n     at 14, ---- (emphasis added). \"Substantive\" does not mean \"statutory,\" and \"substantive\" requirements are not enforceable only by \"criminal convictions and civil penalt[ies].\" Substantive law is the \"part of the law that creates, defines, and regulates the rights, duties, and powers of parties.\"\n     <em>\n      Substantive Law\n     </em>\n     , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). It is the counterpart of \"procedural law,\" which \"prescribe[s] the steps for having a right or duty judicially enforced, as opposed to the [substantive] law that defines the specific rights or duties themselves.\"\n     <em>\n      Procedural Law\n     </em>\n     , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014).\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-134\">\n     If the Court intends to suggest that an enforcement action must seek to enforce a\n     <em>\n      statutory\n     </em>\n     obligation or prohibition, that suggestion ignores the term's common, ordinary meaning. The Legislature commonly uses the term to refer to actions to enforce not just statutory obligations, but rules, orders, and a variety of other substantive legal duties.\n     <em>\n      See, e.g.\n     </em>\n     , Tex. Gov't Code \u00a7 417.010(b) (authorizing state fire marshal to bring an \"enforcement action\" to revoke the licenses of those who violate any \"rule or order adopted under\" the applicable statute); Tex. Water Code \u00a7 7.002 (granting state commission \"enforcement authority\" to \"initiate an action\" to \"compel compliance\" not only with relevant statutes, but also with the \"rules, orders, permits, or other decisions of the commission\"). More specifically, the Legislature commonly uses the term to refer to actions to compel compliance with a position's general legal duties. The Finance Code, for example, authorizes the state banking commissioner to pursue an \"enforcement action\" to \"remove\" a bank's officer, director, or employee \"from office or employment\" if the person \"engaged in a breach of trust or other fiduciary duty\" or even \"conducted business in an unsafe or unsound manner.\" Tex. Fin. Code \u00a7\u00a7 35.002(a), .003(a);\n     <em>\n      see also\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131066\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/522/#p525\">\n       id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     \u00a7\u00a7 185.002(a), .003(a) (same for enforcement actions against state trust company subsidiary officers and employees). And the Insurance Code authorizes the state insurance commissioner to \"take an enforcement action\" to \"suspend or revoke\" a health maintenance organization's certificate of authority if the organization \"is operating in a manner\" that is \"significantly contrary to its basic organizational documents or health care plan;\" provides \"a health care plan that does not provide or arrange for basic health care services;\" cannot \"fulfill its obligation\" to provide \"health care services as required under its health care plan;\" is \"no longer financially responsible and may reasonably be expected to be unable to meet its obligations to enrollees or prospective enrollees;\" or \"would be hazardous to its enrollees if it continued in operation.\" Tex.

In short, in common usage, the phrase \"enforcement action\" includes government actions to compel compliance with more than just\n     <em>\n      statutory\n     </em>\n     prohibitions. But as I explain, a Chapter 87 removal suit is an enforcement action under either approach because it seeks to enforce statutorily imposed official duties.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-135\">\n     The court of appeals held that this suit is not an enforcement action because it sought to\n     <em>\n      remove\n     </em>\n     Harper from his elected position rather than to\n     <em>\n      compel\n     </em>\n     him to comply with the position's duties.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Harper v.

The Court disagrees and holds that a Chapter 87 action\n     <em>\n      can\n     </em>\n     be an enforcement action even though it seeks only to remove the defendant from a county office.\n     <em>\n      Ante\n     </em>\n     at ----.
