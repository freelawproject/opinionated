CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7\u00a7 51.014(a)(9), 74.351(a), (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   According to the expert reports, Nancy Curnel presented to the emergency room of Houston Methodist Hospital-Willowbrook with elevated liver enzymes caused by a recently prescribed antibiotic. Curnel was examined by a hospitalist, Dr. Michael Esantsi, who misdiagnosed her with viral hepatitis ; ordered that she continue taking her current medications, including the antibiotic that was causing her elevated liver enzymes; and admitted her to the hospital. Once admitted, Curnel continued to receive the hepatotoxic antibiotic, and she began to receive another well-known hepatotoxic medication, acetaminophen, again by an order of Esantsi. On the third day of her hospitalization, Curnel was examined by a gastroenterologist, who noted that she might be suffering from drug-induced liver injury. He ordered a biopsy of Curnel's liver to test for other potential causes. Later that same day, another hospitalist discontinued the antibiotic. Curnel's liver enzymes began to improve. Curnel's physicians did not cancel or postpone the biopsy. On the morning of the fifth day of Curnel's hospitalization, a blood clotting test ordered by Esantsi to clear Curnel for the biopsy returned as normal, and a radiologist performed the biopsy as scheduled. During the biopsy, the radiologist nicked Curnel's artery, causing her severe injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Curnel and her husband, Ronald, asserted health care liability claims against Esantsi and Methodist, among others. They served a series of expert reports from a\n   gastroenterologist, Dr. Todd Sheer, and a registered nurse, Julie Fomenko. Esantsi and Methodist both filed motions to dismiss. The trial court found that the expert reports were deficient as to both Esantsi and Methodist, denied the Curnels' request for an extension to cure the deficiencies, and dismissed the Curnels' claims with prejudice. The Curnels filed a motion for reconsideration, supported by amended expert reports, which the trial court denied as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In three issues, the Curnels contend that the trial court abused its discretion by (1) granting Esantsi's and Methodist's motions to dismiss, (2) denying their request for an extension to cure, and (3) denying their motion for reconsideration. We hold that the expert reports were deficient but may be curable. Therefore, we reverse the trial court's order dismissing the Curnels' claims against Esantsi and Methodist and remand the case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The expert reports of Sheer and Fomenko provide the background facts in this case. There are five reports from Sheer (one original and four supplemental) and three reports from Fomenko (one original and two supplemental). We accept the expert reports' factual statements for the limited purpose of this appeal and do not address the merits of the Curnels' claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bowie Mem'l Hosp. v.

According to Dr. Sheer's expert reports, Curnel had been sent to the ER \"by her primary medical provider to find out why recent blood work identified abnormal liver tests (hepatitis ).\" Curnel's \"medical history was negative for drug or alcohol abuse and chronic liver disease.\" \"She was taking several medications for longstanding medical conditions, with no history that these medications had caused hepatotoxicity in the past.\" The only \"new drug\" she was taking was the nitrofurantoin. After she began taking nitrofurantoin, \"liver function studies performed by her primary care provider demonstrated elevated values.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Curnel told the nursing staff that she had been sent to the ER by her primary care physician because recent blood work indicated that she had elevated liver enzymes. An ER nurse took Curnel's medical history, noting that \"Curnel had recently started nitrofurantoin and was then referred to the hospital for evaluation of elevated liver enzymes.\" However, there is no documentation that the nurse evaluated Curnel's \"current medications, including nitrofurantoin,\" for \"potential hepatotoxicity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After the nurse took Curnel's medical history, Curnel was examined by an emergency medicine physician, Dr. Scott Wiesenborn. Wiesenborn noted that Curnel had recently begun taking nitrofurantoin and had been referred to the ER for elevated liver enzymes. Wiesenborn ordered that Curnel's liver enzymes be tested, and the results confirmed that several of her liver enzymes were abnormally high, including her alanine transaminase (ALT ), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Wiesenborn diagnosed Curnel with a fever and \"elevated liver function tests/probable acute hepatitis,\" although he did not specify whether it was \"drug, viral, autoimmune, etc.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Curnel is hospitalized\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Wiesenborn called the on-duty hospitalist, Dr. Michael Esantsi, to determine whether to admit Curnel for hospitalization. According to Sheer's expert reports, Esantsi's \"history and physical\" was \"not significantly different from the one performed in the ER\" by Wiesenborn. Esantsi documented that Curnel had started nitrofurantoin, but he did \"not list this in his Medications section.\" He diagnosed Curnel with \"abnormal liver function tests,\" specifying that the probable cause was \"viral-induced hepatitis.\" According to Sheer, \"[d]rug-induced liver injury [was] not considered in the history and physical,\" and Esantsi's \"plan include[d] continuing current regular home medications.\" Esantsi ordered that Curnel take \"nitrofurantoin 100 mg capsule oral two times daily\" and that she undergo a gastrointestinal consultation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   One of the nurses documented Esantsi's order concerning Curnel's medications, \"which included nitrofurantoin SR (Macrobid ) 100 mg capsule oral two times daily.\" There is no documentation that the nurses ever developed \"a plan for an evaluation for the hepatotoxic potential of the medications, and there is no documentation elsewhere in the medical record that such evaluation was completed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   That afternoon, Curnel was transferred from the ER to the medical-surgical unit, where she was examined by a gastroenterologist, Dr. Steven Ugbarugba. Ugbarugba's consultation notes made \"no mention\" of Curnel \"starting nitrofurantoin recently\" and \"omit[ted] a list of her medications.\" Ugbarugba performed a number of tests, which ruled out a number of potential causes of Curnel's elevated liver enzymes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ugbarugba did not note nitrofurantoin as a potential cause of Curnel's elevated liver enzymes. Again quoting from Sheer's reports, there is \"no documentation that drug-induced liver injury [was] considered\" by Ugbarugba at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Later that evening, Curnel received a dose of nitrofurantoin, which was \"dispensed from the pharmacy\" and \"administer[ed]\" by one of the nurses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On the morning of Friday, October 9, Curnel's liver enzymes were tested again. The test results showed a \"slight increase\" in both her ALT and AST. Curnel underwent additional testing, which indicated that she did not have viral hepatitis but was suffering from DILI instead. A complete blood count (CBC) revealed that Curnel had eosinophilia, a condition that is \"indicative\" or \"suggestive\" of DILI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   According to Sheer, Esantsi's notes indicate that, when he saw Curnel again that day, he \"repeat[ed] the running diagnosis of probable viral hepatitis, despite negative test results,\" with \"no documentation that drug-induced liver injury [was] considered.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At the nurses' request, Esantsi ordered that Curnel begin to take acetaminophen, \"another well-known hepatotoxic medication.\" A nurse administered the medication to Curnel that afternoon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   That evening, Curnel received another dose of nitrofurantoin, \"dispensed from the pharmacy\" and \"administer[ed]\" by another nurse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On the morning of Saturday, October 10, Curnel received yet another dose of nitrofurantoin. Her liver enzymes were tested again, and the results showed increases in her ALT and ALP, and a slight decrease in her AST, which nevertheless remained abnormally high. The results also showed a \"slight rise\" in her bilirubin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Later that day, she was examined again by Dr. Ugbarugba, who ordered that Curnel undergo a liver biopsy. Ugbarugba wrote a progress note, which \"reaffirm[ed]\" the general diagnosis of \"acute hepatitis\" but added that the etiology remained \"unclear\" and that there was a \"possibility\" that the hepatitis was \"medication-induced.\" Sheer's expert reports state that this is the \"first documentation\" of a medical provider considering DILI as a potential cause of Curnel's elevated liver enzymes. Ugbarugba \"recommend[ed] holding Acyclovir, Vyvance, and Tylenol specifically,\" and he made \"a general suggestion to 'hold hepatotoxic medications.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Later that afternoon, Curnel was examined by another physician, Dr. Yamini Naygandhi, who was \"covering for Esantsi.\" Naygandhi noted that Curnel might be suffering from \"medication related hepatitis\" (i.e., DILI) instead of \"viral\" hepatitis and ordered a review of Curnel's medications \"to find out what [was] causing [her] elevated LFT [liver function tests].\" She also ordered that Curnel discontinue nitrofurantoin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   By Sunday, nitrofurantoin was \"no longer on [Curnel]'s patient medication list and was not administered.\" Her bilirubin and ALP increased, but her ALT and AST decreased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Curnel's artery is nicked during her liver biopsy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On the morning of Monday, October 12, the day of Curnel's scheduled liver biopsy, Curnel's enzymes showed \"further improvement.\" Her bilirubin began to decrease, her AST continued to decrease, and her ALT and ALP underwent \"non-significant changes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   At 9:00 a.m., Curnel was examined for a third time by Ugbarugba. His progress note contained the \"exact\" same \"assessment from the day prior\" except that it noted, \"Liver bx today.\" \"A pre-procedure prothrombin time/INR ordered by Dr. Esantsi return[ed] as normal (this was the first time checked since presentation).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   At 10:30 a.m., a radiologist, Dr. Mark Brodie, performed the biopsy. He obtained two \"cores,\" which showed that \"the liver function abnormalities were due to medication effects.\" During the biopsy, Brodie nicked Curnel's artery, causing severe injuries. Curnel required multiple blood transfusions, medications to maintain circulation, mechanical ventilation, prolonged resuscitation, and extended ICU care. According to Sheer, Curnel \"will have a slow and painful recovery.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Curnels asserted health care liability claims against Esantsi and Methodist,\n   among others. The Curnels served Esantsi and Methodist with a series of expert reports from Sheer and Fomenko. Sheer's reports addressed both Esantsi and Methodist, while Fomenko's addressed only Methodist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Esantsi and Methodist filed objections and motions to dismiss for failure to serve adequate expert reports. The Curnels responded that the reports were adequate. They requested that the trial court deny the motions to dismiss or, alternatively, grant them a 30-day extension to cure any deficiencies in the reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The trial court heard the motions to dismiss and found that the combined expert reports of Sheer and Fomenko were deficient as to both Esantsi and Methodist. The trial court sustained Esantsi's and Methodist's objections, denied the Curnels' request for a 30-day extension to cure, and dismissed the Curnels' claims with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Curnels filed a motion for reconsideration, supported by amended expert reports. The trial court denied the motion, and the Curnels appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    Motions to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In their first issue, the Curnels contend that the trial court abused its discretion in granting Esantsi's and Methodist's motions to dismiss for failure to serve adequate expert reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The trial court found that Sheer's reports were deficient on all three elements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Sheer's opinions on elements of standard of care and breach\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   We begin by considering whether Sheer's reports provide adequate opinions on the first two elements: standard of care and breach. In his reports, Sheer explains that the standard of care required Esantsi to take certain actions and to refrain from taking others throughout the course of Curnel's treatment at Methodist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Sheer writes that, as Curnel's \"primary physician\" at the hospital, Esantsi was \"responsible\" for the \"decision to admit and discharge\" her. At the \"most basic\" level, a hospitalist like Esantsi must \"understand the effect of medications on a patient, especially when evaluating liver function.\" When a patient presents with elevated liver enzymes, \"medications should be at the top of the list of potential causes, which is especially true when the patient has recently initiated a course of a frequently implicated agent such as nitrofurantoin.\" And, Sheer continues, when a patient's\n   elevated liver enzymes are \"drug-induced,\" a liver biopsy is \"rarely helpful.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   According to Sheer, when Curnel presented to the hospital after having recently initiated an antibiotic well-known for its hepatotoxic potential, the standard of care required Esantsi to \"evaluate the hepatotoxic potential\" of Curnel's medications; \"recognize drug-induced liver injury as the probable cause of [her] elevated liver enzymes\"; \"discontinue the offending drug,\" nitrofurantoin ; refrain from ordering other hepatotoxic medications; and \"discharge her to be followed as an outpatient with her primary care physician to confirm normalization of the liver tests on serial lab testing.\" Sheer explains that Esantsi breached this standard by failing to take any of these steps. Esantsi failed to evaluate the hepatotoxic potential of her medications, recognize DILI as the probable cause of her elevated liver enzymes, discontinue the antibiotic, refrain from ordering other hepatotoxic medication, and discharge her for outpatient monitoring. Instead, Esantsi misdiagnosed Curnel with probable viral hepatitis, ordered that she continue to take nitrofurantoin and begin to take hepatotoxic acetaminophen, and admitted her for hospitalization and \"unnecessary testing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   After Curnel was admitted for hospitalization, Sheer explains, Esantsi continued to be responsible for deciding when to discharge her, and the standard of care required him to recognize that a liver biopsy was not \"warranted\" or \"justified\" under the circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sheer further explains that Esantsi breached this standard by \"maintaining [Curnel's] admission to the hospital for the biopsy\" and ordering a pre-procedure prothrombin time test\"in preparation of the liver biopsy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Thus, in his reports, Sheer explains in detail what he believes the standard of care required Esantsi to have done under the circumstances and what Esantsi did instead.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Palacios\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11094124,11094165\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/46/873/\">\n    46 S.W.3d at 880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Sheer's opinion on element of causation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   We next consider whether Sheer's reports provide an adequate opinion on the third element: causation. To show causation, Sheer explains a chain of events that begins with Esantsi's initial breaches-Esantsi's failure to evaluate Curnel's medications for hepatotoxic potential when she first presented, to diagnose her with DILI, and to discharge her for outpatient monitoring. He instead misdiagnosed her with viral hepatitis, ordered that she continue to take the contraindicated antibiotic and another hepatotoxic medication, and improperly admitted her for hospitalization and unnecessary testing. The chain of the events then continues to Esantsi's subsequent breaches-Esantsi's act and omissions in continuing to misdiagnose Curnel with viral hepatitis, maintaining her admission to the hospital, and ordering the prothrombin time test in preparation for the biopsy. And the chain ends with the unwarranted\n   biopsy taking place as scheduled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The chain of events leading up to Curnel's injuries includes many other acts by many other actors. These actors notably include Ugbarugba, who ordered the liver biopsy even though he considered DILI a potential cause of Curnel's elevated liver enzymes and Curnel showed improvement after nitrofurantoin was discontinued, and Brodie, who actually performed the biopsy and nicked Curnel's artery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   An event that starts a chain of events can be too attenuated from an injury to cause it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Providence Health Ctr. v.

She further opines that the policies and procedures should require such an evaluation to occur when the patient is admitted to the hospital and, once admitted, when the patient is prescribed a given medication. According to Fomenko, Methodist breached this standard because such policies and procedures were either not in place or not enforced, as evidenced by the fact that Curnel's medications were not evaluated for hepatotoxicity when she was admitted to the hospital or before the nurses administered nitrofurantoin to her for three consecutive days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   With respect to the Curnels' vicarious liability claim based on negligence by the Methodist nursing staff, Fomenko opines that the standard of care required the nurses to evaluate Curnel's medications; recognize that nitrofurantoin was hepatotoxic and thus contraindicated given Curnel's elevated liver enzymes; refrain from administering nitrofurantoin to Curnel; notify the ordering practitioner, Esantsi, of the reason for their decision; and seek clarification of his order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   According to Fomenko, the nurses breached the standard of care by failing to take any of these steps.

They noted Curnel had been taking nitrofurantoin, but they failed to recognize that nitrofurantoin is hepatotoxic and thus failed to clarify the contraindicated nitrofurantoin order with Esantsi or any other practitioner.

In his reports, Sheer opines that, by failing to promptly evaluate Curnel's mediations and instead administering the contraindicated antibiotic for three consecutive days, Methodist and its nursing staff deprived Curnel's physicians of \"necessary data and information for making the correct diagnosis and considering discharge from the hospital.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   According to Sheer, had the Methodist nurses complied with the standard of care identified by Fomenko, the physicians would have had the benefit of data showing a declining trend in Curnel's liver enzymes, which, in turn, would have led them to diagnose her with DILI and discharge her for further monitoring on an outpatient basis, thereby avoiding the liver biopsy and the injuries that Curnel received from it.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   [A]dministration of the nitrofurantoin to [Curnel] during her hospitalization (due to failure to evaluate the hepatotoxic potential of the medication) perpetuated the elevated liver enzymes. In reasonable medical probability, if the nurses had not administered nitrofurantoin, [Curnel]'s liver enzymes would have immediately improved. Thus, the nurses' administration of the drug deprived the physicians of data relevant to a diagnosis of probable drug induced liver injury and discharge for outpatient monitoring.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Sheer's reports about the nurses, like his reports on Esantsi, attempt to show proximate cause by explaining a chain of events that begins with the Methodist nurses' failure to evaluate Curnel's medications and to refrain from administering the contraindicated nitrofurantoin and ends with Curnel's artery being nicked and the resulting injuries. And like the alleged negligence of Esantsi, the alleged negligence of Methodist and its nursing staff is too attenuated from Curnel's injuries to be considered a substantial factor in bringing those injuries about.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Curnel's physicians identified DILI as a potential cause of her elevated liver enzymes two days before the biopsy. Ugbarugba and Naygandhi both considered DILI a potential cause of Curnel's elevated liver enzymes, both ordered that Curnel stop taking all hepatotoxic medications, and Naygandhi specifically ordered that Curnel stop taking nitrofurantoin. Once Curnel stopped taking nitrofurantoin, her enzymes began to improve. And, as Sheer states in his reports, by October 12, the liver tests showed even \"further improvement.\" None of Curnel's physicians ordered that the biopsy not take place. The physicians had the information to diagnose Curnel with DILI and discharge her from the hospital before the biopsy. Instead, armed with the very information that Curnel claims they needed, they elected to go forward with the biopsy on its scheduled date. Sheer's reports do not explain how and why additional information from the nurses would have led the physicians to cancel the biopsy if the information the physicians already had did not or how the nurses \"had either the right or the means to persuade\" the physicians to cancel the biopsy.\n   <em>\n    Zamarripa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407879\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/526/453/#p459\">\n    526 S.W.3d at 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nor do Sheer's reports state that Methodist's nurses were part of the decision to perform the biopsy or its timing. We hold that Sheer's reports do not adequately address cause-in-fact for the claims against Methodist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   We further hold that Sheer's reports do not adequately address foreseeability, either. They do not explain how and why Methodist's nurses should have anticipated Curnel's artery being nicked because of either Methodist's failure to implement and enforce policies and procedures requiring the evaluation of hepatotoxic medication or the nurses' failure to evaluate Curnel's medications for hepatotoxicity and to refuse to administer the drug. Thus, we hold that Sheer's reports on Methodist fail to adequately address both components of proximate cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Conclusion on adequacy of expert reports\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In sum, we hold that Sheer's reports on Esantsi provide adequate opinions on the standard of care and breach but do not provide an adequate opinion on either component of proximate cause. We further hold that Fomenko's reports on Methodist provide adequate opinions on the standard of care and breach but that Sheer's reports on Methodist do not provide an adequate opinion on either component of proximate cause. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding the reports inadequate as to both Esantsi and Methodist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Accordingly, we overrule the Curnels' first issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    Motions for Extension to Cure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In their second and third issues, the Curnels contend that the trial court abused its discretion by denying their motion for a 30-day extension to cure the deficient expert reports and by denying their motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Under the Act, if the plaintiff timely serves an expert report, and the trial court concludes that the report is an objective good faith effort to comply with the statute but nevertheless deficient in some way, the trial court has the discretion to grant the plaintiff one 30-day extension to cure the deficiencies.

Part of the purpose of the extension is to afford a plaintiff who made a good faith effort the chance to cure a defective report after the deficiencies have been identified by the trial court.
