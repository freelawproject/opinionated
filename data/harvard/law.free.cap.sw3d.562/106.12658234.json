PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7\u00a7 15.01(a) (West, Westlaw through 2017 1st C.S.), 22.011(a)(2)(A) (West, Westlaw through 2017 1st C.S.).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In accordance with the jury's recommendation as to punishment, the trial court sentenced Crawford to confinement for six years,\n   suspended his sentence, and placed him on community supervision for five years. In two issues, Crawford seeks reversal and rendition of a judgment of acquittal on the grounds that the evidence is legally insufficient to sustain his conviction because: (1) the evidence failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that he did an act that amounted to more than mere preparation; and (2) the State offered no evidence that a child was the object of the sexual assault that he purportedly attempted. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A grand jury indictment alleges, in relevant part, that on or about May 17, 2016, in Montgomery County, Texas, Crawford \"did then and there, with specific intent to commit the offense of Sexual Assault of a Child, do an act, to-wit: travel to a prearranged meeting location, amounting to more than mere preparation that tended to but failed to effect the commission of the offense[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At trial, Jerry Serratt, a detective with the Montgomery County Precinct 1 Constable's Office, recounted how his investigative efforts prompted Crawford to travel to the prearranged meeting location. Serratt is assigned to the Internet Crimes Against Children Taskforce (ICACT), a nationwide law enforcement effort that employs proactive investigations. Some of the proactive investigations involve Serratt posting advertisements on social media websites posing as, among other things, a mother offering a minor daughter for sexual activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On the afternoon of May 17, 2016, Serratt posted an online advertisement on the \"personals &gt; casual encounters\" webpage on Craigslist with the title \"Mother and Daughter Trucker Team-ww4m (the woodlands)\". The advertisement, which was admitted into evidence, stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   It use [sic] again....\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   we are driving into porter for the night. Mother and daughter trucker team.... she [sic] young and she is my real daughter. If you [sic] interested[,] hit me back.... We [sic] spending the night here at some apartments w[h]ere the company is providing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Soon thereafter, a response from an email address belonging to Crawford was forwarded to the email address associated with the advertisement. Serratt, posing as \"Misty Patterson,\" began emailing with Crawford. Their conversation, read to the jury by Serratt and a printout of which was admitted into evidence, provides the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   CRAWFORD : Hey very interested ... 25 white 6'2\" slim and DDF.... I have experience with multiple ... would love to experience a mother/daughter team though\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   PATTERSON : Hey I am 32 year old female and daughter is 14 is that cool\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   CRAWFORD : What do ya'll look like?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   PATTERSON : I am 5'5 125 hispanic female and daughter is 5'1 110 hispanic female\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   CRAWFORD : That's hot ... can I get a pic of you 2? I'll send one back.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Serratt then emailed Crawford two photographs, each depicting the torso of a clothed female mannequin taken at a department store. The photograph depicting Patterson was of a mannequin in the women's section, while the photograph depicting Patterson's daughter was of a mannequin in the junior's section. In exchange,\n   Crawford emailed Serratt two shirtless photographs of himself, one of which shows his face. The email conversation continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   CRAWFORD : Where are ya'll at right now?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   PATTERSON : in the woodlands\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   CRAWFORD : Have a place to play?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   PATTERSON : yes[.] what do you want to do[?]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   CRAWFORD : Play with you both ... lick and suck\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   PATTERSON : so u just want to suck\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   CRAWFORD : And fuck\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   PATTERSON : from both of us\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   CRAWFORD : If that's ok\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   PATTERSON : yea that cool.... she is 14 yo so basically protection is a must\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   CRAWFORD : Sure no problem\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   PATTERSON : ok cool beans\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   CRAWFORD : What's the address?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   PATTERSON : I give u that once I know ur coming\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   CRAWFORD : I'm already in the woodlands ... over near sawdust\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   PATTERSON : txt me at [ ]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The phone number Serratt texted to Crawford was to a cell phone used by Corey Arnold, an investigator assigned to the ICACT, as part of a continuation of the proactive investigation started by Serratt. Arnold, pretending to be Patterson, and Crawford then texted each other regarding the logistics of their meeting. Arnold read portions of the text messages and a printout of them was admitted into evidence. In one of his messages, Crawford noted that he needed to \"stop to get rubbers.\" Patterson texted Crawford an address where she and her daughter would be waiting. The two then texted the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   CRAWFORD : What are you wearing? I'm about 10 mins away\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   PATTERSON : We are both wearing black shorts and pink tank tops\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   CRAWFORD : Ok[.] And she's okay with this?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   PATTERSON : Yep she knows.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Crawford, within approximately two and half hours of having initially responded to the Craigslist advertisement, arrived at the predetermined location. He was apprehended by police officers with the ICACT. The officers searched Crawford, but they did not find condoms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A jury found Crawford guilty of attempted sexual assault of a child, a third-degree felony,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 15.01(a), 22.011(a)(2)(A), assessed punishment at confinement for six years, but recommended suspending his sentence and placing him on community supervision for five years. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In\n   <em>\n    Brack\n   </em>\n   , the defendant responded to a Craigslist personal advertisement involving a mother and minor daughter, exchanged sexually explicit messages with a person he believed to be the minor daughter's mother, arranged to meet the mother and minor daughter for sexual relations, and arrived at a predetermined location.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20651264\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, Crawford's attempt to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Brack\n   </em>\n   is unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The indictment in this case alleges that Crawford travelled \"to a prearranged meeting location, amounting to more than mere preparation that tended to but failed to effect the commission of the offense,\" and it does not specify that the prearranged meeting location was the precise location where the sexual assault of a child was to occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Crawford responded to an online advertisement on the \"personals &gt; casual encounters\" webpage on Craigslist titled \"Mother and Daughter Trucker Team-ww4m (the woodlands)\" by describing his height, build, and as being \"DDF,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   having\n   experience with \"multiple,\" and \"would love to experience a mother/daughter team though.\" Both Serratt and Arnold recounted online and text conversations, respectively, that they had with Crawford while they pretended to be Patterson, the mother of a fourteen-year-old. Printouts of those conversations were admitted into evidence. Crawford inquired as to whether Patterson had a \"place to play\" and that he wanted to play with, \"lick,\" \"suck,\" and \"fuck\" both Patterson and her fourteen-year-old daughter. He sent two shirtless photographs of himself. Within approximately two and half hours of having initially responded to the Craigslist advertisement, Crawford arrived at the predetermined location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   From this evidence, the jury could have reasonably inferred that Crawford intended to engage in the sexual activity he described with Patterson and her fourteen-year-old daughter and that Crawford's actions amounted to more than mere preparatory conduct to engage in the offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182418\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/307/#p319\">\n    443 U.S. at 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182418\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/307/#p319\">\n    99 S.Ct. 2781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; TEX.

Crawford's contention that his lack of condoms and lubrication to effectuate a sexual encounter with Patterson's fourteen-year-old daughter renders the evidence legally insufficient is unavailing. The jury's province was to reconcile Crawford's statements to Patterson regarding condoms and his arriving at the rendezvous point without them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7257311\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/419/665/#p671\">\n    419 S.W.3d at 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Crawford's first issue is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Involvement of Child\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In Crawford's second issue, he contends that the evidence is legally insufficient to sustain his conviction because the State offered no evidence that a child was the object of the sexual assault that he purportedly attempted. Crawford argues that the penal statutes at issue require the existence of an actual child and because Patterson's fourteen-year-old daughter was fictitious, the evidence is legally insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Brack\n   </em>\n   , the court held that the offense of attempted sexual assault of a child, as opposed to the offense of online solicitation of a minor, does not require evidence that the minor actually existed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20651264\">\n    2018 WL 651264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (citing\n   <em>\n    Ex Parte Victorick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6886118\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/453/5/#p12\">\n    453 S.W.3d 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 12 (Tex. App.-Beaumont 2014, pet. ref'd) ). Serratt and Arnold testified that they were part of to the ICACT, Seratt posted an online advertisement, and together both provided the jury with the details of the advertisement and communications with Crawford. The State was not required to prove direct communication with Patterson's fourteen-year-old daughter or that either Serratt or Arnold were Patterson's fourteen-year-old daughter. The offense charged was not online solicitation of a minor. See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN . \u00a7 33.021 (West, Westlaw through 2017 1st C.S.). As in\n   <em>\n    Brack\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that the actual existence of Patterson's fourteen-year-old daughter is not an element of the offense of attempted sexual assault.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20651264\">\n    2018 WL 651264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (citing\n   <em>\n    Victorick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6886118\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/453/5/#p12\">\n    453 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   12 ). Therefore, the fact that Patterson's daughter was fictitious does not render the evidence insufficient. Crawford's second issue is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
