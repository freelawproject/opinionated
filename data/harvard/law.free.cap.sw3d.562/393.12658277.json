We reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Appellant and Respondent were in a romantic relationship in high school. They broke off their relationship sometime around January, 2011. Shortly thereafter, Respondent became pregnant as a result of a non-consensual sexual encounter with another man. Afterwards, while Respondent was pregnant, she and Appellant resumed their relationship. Respondent told Appellant of the pregnancy; the child, E.K., was born April 11, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellant and Respondent continued their relationship for the next several years. Appellant and Respondent lived together, and Appellant helped care for E.K. Appellant viewed his relationship with Respondent and E.K. as that of a family, and he views E.K. as his daughter, if not in biological fact. Appellant and Respondent were never married.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The couple separated sometime around 2016 or 2017. Since their separation, Respondent has not allowed Appellant any contact with E.K.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 25, 2017, Appellant filed a petition with the St. Charles County Circuit Court for third-party custody, pursuant to Section 452.375.5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   With the court's leave, Appellant filed an Amended Petition for Third Party Custody (Amended Petition) on November 11, 2017, which set out the facts of his relationship with Respondent and E.K. in further detail. Among the facts alleged were:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   - Appellant assumed the role of a father to E.K., and E.K. referred to Appellant as \"Dad\" and to Appellant's parents as \"Grandma\" and \"Grandpa.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   - Friends and acquaintances of Appellant and Respondent believed Appellant to be E.K.'s father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   - Respondent referred to E.K. as \"your baby\" during her pregnancy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   - Appellant was present during E.K.'s birth, cut the umbilical cord, and held her after the delivery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   - Appellant and Respondent chose E.K.'s name together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   - Appellant and Respondent purchased a house. The house was in Respondent's name, but Appellant provided the down payment and made mortgage payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   - Appellant provided for E.K. financially and cared for her when Respondent was at work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   - Appellant, Respondent, and E.K. lived the life of a typical family, spending time during the week and on weekends doing family activities such as game nights, trips, and birthday parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   - Appellant, Respondent, and E.K. slept in the same bed together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   - Appellant, Respondent, and E.K. spent holidays with each other's respective families.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   - Appellant and Respondent were at one point engaged and planning a wedding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   - During this period, Respondent invited and encouraged Appellant to take an active parental role with E.K.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   - Since their separation, E.K. had become emotionally distraught due to her lack of contact with Appellant, whom she viewed as her father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   - E.K.'s biological father had played no role whatsoever in her life, and is an unsuitable, unwilling custodian of E.K.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   - Respondent had herself proven to be an unfit custodian by refusing to allow contact between Appellant and E.K.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   - Appellant is a suitable custodian, and able and willing to provide an adequate and stable environment for E.K.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   - Finally, Appellant alleges these circumstances constitute special or extraordinary circumstances rendering it in E.K.'s best interests to continue to have contact with Appellant, and to grant custody rights to Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Appellant attached one exhibit, a copy of a text message allegedly received from Respondent, to his Amended Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On the same day he filed his Amended Petition, Appellant also filed a motion to appoint a guardian ad litem to investigate whether the welfare of E.K. required he be granted third-party custody rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On December 4, 2017, Respondent filed a motion to dismiss Appellant's Amended Petition. Respondent argued even if all the facts alleged in Appellant's Amended Petition were true, the Amended Petition failed to state a claim upon which the relief sought could be granted. On that same day, Respondent also filed a motion asking for a hearing on her motion to dismiss and requested the court defer ruling on Appellant's\n   motion to appoint a guardian ad litem until after such hearing was held, as a ruling in favor of Respondent would obviate the need for a guardian ad litem's appointment. The motion court granted both requests, and the motion to dismiss Appellant's Amended Petition was set for hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The hearing was held on January 19, 2018. At the hearing, no argument was presented from Appellant or Respondent regarding the merits of Respondent's motion to dismiss the Amended Petition. Rather, the parties themselves testified before the motion court about the many factual disputes in the underlying claim. Respondent testified, in so many words, that the facts averred in the Amended Petition were inaccurate and mischaracterized the relationship between Appellant, E.K., and herself. Both parties submitted several exhibits to the motion court, including a number of affidavits submitted by Respondent from E.K.'s teachers and physician, and several photographs, a Father's Day card, and a text message submitted by Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   After hearing evidence from the parties, the motion court took the matter under submission. On January 24, 2018, the motion court entered a one-sentence judgment granting Respondent's motion to dismiss Appellant's Amended Petition. This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Points Relied On\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Appellant asserts two points on appeal. In his first point, Appellant claims the trial court erred in granting the motion to dismiss the Amended Petition because the facts alleged in the petition were sufficient to state a claim for third-party custody under Section 452.375.5. Appellant's second point claims the motion court misapplied Section 452.375.5 when it failed to enter judgment in favor of Appellant. Because resolution of Appellant's first point is dispositive of this appeal, we do not reach Appellant's second point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Appellate review of a trial court's order to grant a motion to dismiss is\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fenlon v.

Taking all facts pled in the Amended Petition as true, like the couple in\n   <em>\n    K.M.M.\n   </em>\n   , Appellant, Respondent, and E.K. shared a home together. Appellant provided for E.K.'s needs financially, as well as making payments towards the shared home purchased in Respondent's name. Appellant alleges he and Respondent were engaged for some time and planning a wedding. Appellant states he was present and provided care during Respondent's pregnancy and after E.K.'s birth. He claims he was present during the delivery and helped pick out E.K.'s name. As stated in the Amended Petition, the bond formed between Appellant\n   and E.K. is that of parent and child, and E.K. has suffered emotionally since their separation. The facts which Appellant pleads are sufficient to satisfy the \"welfare\" prong of Section 452.375.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Having satisfied the \"welfare\" prong, the next step of the analysis is whether an award of custody or visitation would be in the child's best interests, and whether Appellant is a suitable custodian able to prove an adequate and stable environment for E.K.

As stated above, Appellant's Amended Petition pled sufficient facts to meet the \"welfare\" prong of Section 452.375.5; it also pled sufficient facts to show it would be in E.K.'s best interests to allow some custody or visitation for Appellant. We point chiefly to the facts alleged in the Amended Petition that indicate an important emotional bond has formed between Appellant and E.K., the difficultly E.K. has had adjusting to the absence of the man she knew as her father, Respondent's unwillingness to allow a relationship between Appellant and E.K., and E.K.'s relationship with Appellant's relatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Finally, we reach the question of whether the facts in the Amended Petition establish Appellant would be a suitable custodian. The Amended Petition avers facts showing Appellant has been a suitable and dedicated custodian from the beginning of E.K.'s life. It further avers Appellant would continue to play this role, should he be afforded the chance. These allegations are sufficient to meet this element of the third-party custody claim.

Accordingly, we find the trial court erred when it granted Respondent's motion to dismiss on the basis the Amended Petition failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In so holding, we do not purport to resolve the underlying factual disputes of the case, which are substantial. As we note above, it is not the function of this Court, nor is it the function\n   of the motion court, to determine on the merits whether Appellant is entitled to relief when considering a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Fenlon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8205860\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/266/852/#p854\">\n    266 S.W.3d at 854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim assumes that all averments in plaintiff's petition are true and tests only the adequacy of plaintiff's petition.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8205860\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/266/852/#p854\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In her brief, Respondent does not challenge the sufficiency of Appellant's Amended Petition to state a claim for third-party custody. Rather, Respondent argues that, despite the order stating otherwise, ruling on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim was not what the motion court was actually doing. Instead, Respondent argues the motion court appears to have considered evidence outside of the pleadings, and in so doing converted the proceedings into a motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In support of her argument, Respondent points to Rule 55.27\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   , which states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   If, on a motion asserting the defense numbered (6) to dismiss for failure of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 74.04. All parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 74.04.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Respondent claims matters outside of the facts alleged in the Amended Petition were presented to the motion court, and were not excluded from its consideration. Specifically, Respondent points to the single exhibit attached to the Amended Petition when it was filed with the motion court, and the testimony and other evidence presented to the motion court at the hearing on the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Although the motion court does not mention considering facts outside of the pleadings, the record strongly suggests it did so. As stated above, Respondent called her motion to dismiss for a hearing. However, at that hearing there was no argument made regarding the legal sufficiency of Appellant's Amended Petition to state a claim for third-party custody. Instead, the hearing was comprised entirely of Appellant and Respondent themselves testifying about the substantive facts underlying Appellant's claim, and presenting evidence in an effort to bolster their many conflicting claims of material fact. From the record, it appears as though the hearing was actually a trial on the substantive merits of the claim. Given these inconsistencies, it is unsurprising there remains some confusion as to what the motion court was and was not considering when granting Respondent's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Rule 55.27 does allow a court to treat a motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment when the moving party includes matters outside the pleadings for the court to consider. However, in doing so the court is obligated to require the parties to adhere to the mandatory directives of Rule 74.04, which governs motions for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Schnurbusch v. W.

App. S.D. 2017). As the Western District of this Court recently explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Rule 74.04(c)(1) sets forth the requirements for filing a motion for summary judgment which includes: (1) the filing of a statement of uncontroverted facts stated with particularity and in numbered paragraphs, (2) the attachment of a copy of all discovery, exhibits or affidavits\n   on which the motion relies, and (3) the filing of a separate legal memorandum explaining why summary judgment should be granted. The rule further requires a response, to be filed within thirty days, that sets forth each statement of fact in its original paragraph number and immediately thereunder admit or deny each of movant's factual statements. The rule prohibits a denial from resting upon the mere allegations or denials of the party's pleading but rather requires the response to support each denial with specific references to the discovery, exhibits or affidavits that demonstrate specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. The respondent is also allowed to set forth additional material facts that remain in dispute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   These procedural requirements are not to be taken as idle suggestions. The underlying purpose of Rule 74.04 is directed toward helping the court expedite the disposition of the case. Because of this fact,\n   <em>\n    compliance with the rule is mandatory.\n   </em>\n   Summary judgment is based on the underlying predicate that, where the facts are not in dispute, a prevailing party can be determined as a matter of law. The procedures of Rule 74.04 were developed to establish a step-by-step method by which such cases can be identified and resolved. The failure of the parties to adhere to the text of the rule robs it of its usefulness.\n   <em>\n    It is not the function of the circuit court or appellate court to sift through a voluminous record in an attempt to determine the basis for the motion.\n   </em>\n   Rather, a motion for summary judgment is required to follow a specific format in order to clarify the areas of dispute and eliminate the need for the trial or appellate court to sift through the record to identify factual disputes. Such rationale is equally applicable to a motion to dismiss that has been converted to a motion for summary judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    Energy Creates Energy, LLC v.

If the trial court gives no such notice and the judgment expressly grants the motion to dismiss, this is an affirmative statement that the trial court did not convert the motion and, more importantly, that it did not consider matters outside the pleadings.

As a practical matter, the trial court may allow parties to \"waive\" all sorts of procedural requirements and deliver a ruling on whatever basis it desires.
