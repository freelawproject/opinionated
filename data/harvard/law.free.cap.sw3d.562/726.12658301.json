On the\n   court's own motion, we withdraw the panel opinion and judgment dated August 15, 2018 and substitute this en banc opinion and judgment. Appellee's motion for rehearing is denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. APP. P.49.7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This is an accelerated appeal from the trial court's order terminating Appellant Anthony's parental rights to his child, J.A.B. In a single issue on appeal, Anthony argues he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial. Because we agree Anthony received ineffective assistance of counsel, we reverse the trial court's order of termination as it pertains to Anthony only and remand the cause for a new trial. However, because Anthony did not challenge the appointment of the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (the \"Department\") as managing conservator under section 153.131 of the Texas Family Code, we affirm the trial court's appointment of the Department as managing conservator of J.A.B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Tracy is the mother of J.A.B. and J.A.B.'s half-brother. Anthony is J.A.B.'s alleged father. On the date this case was filed, J.A.B. was thirteen years old and his brother was an infant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Based on reports of physical neglect of J.A.B. and unsanitary living conditions in the home in which Tracy was living with J.A.B. and his infant brother, the Department removed both children and filed a petition to terminate Tracy's parental rights, as well as the parental rights of Anthony and the other child's father. Anthony was appointed trial counsel. While the case was pending, Anthony was arrested and incarcerated, and he is not due to be released from incarceration until October 27, 2020.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 1, 2018, the trial court held a bench trial. On the date of trial, Anthony was not present because he was incarcerated, and his trial counsel appeared and announced \"not ready.\" The trial court overruled trial counsel's \"not ready,\" and proceeded to trial to terminate Anthony's, Tracy's, and the other father's parental rights. The Department called a caseworker as its only witness. Shortly after the Department began examining the caseworker, trial counsel requested to be excused from the proceeding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [Trial counsel]: Judge, pardon me. I have a[n] actual client in a termination hearing in 3.06. May I be excused and come back here very shortly?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [Trial court]: Can we proceed without you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [Trial counsel]: Yes, you can, Judge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [Trial court]: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Anthony's trial counsel then left the courtroom and did not return until after the Department rested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   During trial counsel's absence from the courtroom, the Department caseworker testified to the reasons why Anthony's parental rights should be terminated, specifically due to abandonment of J.A.B., and to the reasons why termination of Anthony's parental rights is in J.A.B.'s best interest. Also during trial counsel's absence, Tracy's attorney, the other father's attorney, and J.A.B.'s ad litem attorney each conducted a brief cross-examination of the Department caseworker, and the Department rested. While the attorneys were making closing statements, Anthony's trial counsel returned to the courtroom. After asking the trial court for permission to \"ask one or two questions,\" trial counsel then conducted his own brief cross-examination of the Department caseworker. Trial counsel then rested. No other witnesses testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Tracy voluntarily relinquished her parental rights to both children, and the other father voluntarily relinquished his\n   parental rights as well. The trial court accepted the voluntary relinquishments. The trial court terminated Anthony's parental rights to J.A.B. on the ground of abandonment and found termination of Anthony's parental rights is in J.A.B.'s best interest. Anthony appeals, complaining of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

We concluded the first\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   prong was satisfied because there was \"no plausible strategic reason\" for trial counsel to fail to show up for trial, particularly because trial counsel subsequently admitted he intended to appear and was at fault for his failure to do so.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6874032\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/459/90/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We also relied on\n   <em>\n    Lockwood v.

We agreed with\n   <em>\n    Lockwood\n   </em>\n   that a presumption of prejudice applied in\n   <em>\n    J.M.O.\n   </em>\n   because trial counsel \"wholly\" failed to appear at trial to \"subject the Department's case to appropriate adversarial testing.\"\n   <em>\n    In re J.M.O.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6874032\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/459/90/\">\n    459 S.W.3d at 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rather, trial counsel was in the courtroom when the case was called, announced \"not ready,\" and later briefly cross-examined the Department caseworker. However, trial counsel was not present for virtually all of the Department's case, including\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     all of its evidence in support of terminating Anthony's parental rights\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , as well as the cross-examination of the Department's sole\n   witness by the attorneys representing Tracy, the other father, and the ad litem. We therefore agree with Anthony that his trial counsel was not present for a \"critical stage\" of litigation-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the entirety of the Department's case in support of terminating Anthony's parental rights. Although trial counsel did briefly cross-examine the Department caseworker, trial counsel could not have \"subject[ed] the Department's case to appropriate adversarial testing\" after being absent for all of the caseworker's testimony regarding whether Anthony's parental rights should be terminated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re J.M.O.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6874032\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/459/90/\">\n    459 S.W.3d at 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We conclude Anthony has satisfied the first\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   prong because there was no plausible strategic reason for trial counsel to be absent for all of the Department's case against Anthony.

In\n   <em>\n    J.A.B\n   </em>\n   ., father's counsel left the courtroom shortly after the Department began examining the caseworker and did not return to the courtroom until\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the State rested and closed. The court held that trial counsel's intentional abandonment of the indigent parent during trial reflected presumptively deficient conduct and that his absence during a critical stage of litigation warranted a presumption of prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    D.R.R.\n   </em>\n   , in contrast, counsel was late and arrived after the State had commenced its case-in-chief and had completed direct examination of the first witness, the Department's caseworker.

Appellant did not complain that he was denied counsel who wholly failed to appear and fully participate at a critical stage of litigation at trial.

(concluding counsel's performance was deficient where record showed appointed counsel stated in his motion to reconsider, and at the hearing on the motion, that he was at fault for failing to appear).

In\n   <em>\n    J.A.B\n   </em>\n   ., appellant argued counsel \"wholly failed to appear at the trial\" and appellant was therefore denied the effective assistance of counsel at trial. Appellant argued the adversarial process was so unreliable that a presumption of prejudice was warranted. The court was able to determine from the trial transcript when and why counsel abandoned appellant during trial, and concluded that when an attorney knowingly and completely abandons a parent during the State's case-in-chief and does not return until after closing argument, counsel's conduct falls below \"reasonable, professional assistance\" and cannot be considered sound trial strategy. Further, the court concluded that the State's case was not subjected to being tested during trial. That counsel returned to the courtroom after the State rested and closed but was permitted to cross-examine a witness was inapposite to our determination that the record had established deficient representation by appellant's attorney who had effectively abandoned his client at the critical stage of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The appellant in\n   <em>\n    D.R.R\n   </em>\n   ., in contrast, raised two specific challenges on appeal: (1) trial counsel was ineffective because he (a) failed to communicate with appellant about the trial date and (b) arrived late; and (2) the trial court erred in denying counsel's \"not ready\" announcement. As to ineffective assistance, the record did not\n   explain the challenged conduct raised by appellant. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    J.A.B.\n   </em>\n   , we were unable to determine from the record in\n   <em>\n    D.R.R.\n   </em>\n   \"that it was trial counsel who failed to communicate with or advise Appellant\" (noting instead that\n   <em>\n    the record itself\n   </em>\n   demonstrated appellant himself did not visit his child and did not appear at any trial settings, nor communicate with the Department or his child).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re D.R.R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203044575\">\n    2017 WL 3044575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2.

Under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   's second prong, the\n   <em>\n    J.M.O.\n   </em>\n   court held, \"[T]he\n   <em>\n    Chronic\n   </em>\n   presumption [of prejudice] should apply when appointed counsel\n   <em>\n    wholly fails to appear at trial in a parental-rights termination proceeding\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6874032\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/459/90/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The\n   <em>\n    J.M.O.\n   </em>\n   court further held, \"a presumption of prejudice may be warranted if an indigent parent is denied counsel at a 'critical stage' of litigation\" because \"the adversary process itself is presumptively unreliable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Again, the record in\n   <em>\n    D.R.R\n   </em>\n   ., however, did not explain the challenged conduct raised by appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Given the factual distinctions between the two, I fail to see that a conflict exists between\n   <em>\n    J.A.B\n   </em>\n   . and\n   <em>\n    D.R.R.\n   </em>\n   warranting en banc review. I therefore dissent from the en banc court's sua sponte decision to overrule\n   <em>\n    D.R.R\n   </em>\n   . and would deny the State's panel motion for rehearing.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    <em>\n     Lockwood v.
