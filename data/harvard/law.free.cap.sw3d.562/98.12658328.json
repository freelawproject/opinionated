On appeal, appellant Henry McCall contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Hillis, arguing Hillis failed to prove as a matter of law that he owed no duty to McCall based on the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    ferae naturae.\n   </em>\n   We reverse the trial court's summary judgment and remand to the trial court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Hillis owns property in Fredericksburg, Texas. Hillis operated a bed and breakfast (\"B&amp;B\") on the property. In addition to the structure out of which Hillis operated the B&amp;B, there was a cabin located on the property about 75 to 100 feet from the B&amp;B. McCall leased the cabin from Hillis. According to McCall, he was permitted to use the B&amp;B, and ultimately, \"both voluntarily and at the request of\" Hillis, undertook \"simple jobs\" at the B&amp;B, e.g., opening doors and ensuring the residence was in \"good working order.\" McCall asserted that several times, while helping out at the B&amp;B, he noticed brown recluse spiders inside the B&amp;B. McCall claimed he periodically alerted Hillis about the spiders. McCall asserted the only action taken by Hillis was to inform the housekeeper; Hillis took no other steps to address the spider issue. Ultimately, while McCall was performing some maintenance work inside the B&amp;B, he was bitten by a brown recluse spider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After he was bitten, McCall brought a premises liability action against Hillis. Hillis filed a traditional motion for summary judgment. In his motion, Hillis alleged that as a matter of law he owed no duty to McCall \"to prevent or warn of those dangers which allegedly caused [McCall's] injuries.\" Hillis relied upon the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    ferae naturae\n   </em>\n   to support his contention that he owed no duty to McCall. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Hillis. McCall timely perfected this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   McCall contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Hillis because he failed to prove as a matter of law that he did not owe McCall a duty to make the property safe or to warn of the existence of spiders on the property. Hillis contends the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    ferae naturae\n   </em>\n   supports the trial court's summary judgment in his favor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We review a traditional summary judgment under a de novo standard of review.\n   <em>\n    First United Pentecostal Church of Beaumont v.
