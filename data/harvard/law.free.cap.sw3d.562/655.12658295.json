Acceptance Indemnity has filed a motion to stay proceedings pending our resolution of this matter. Because we conclude the trial court erred in denying Acceptance Indemnity's motion to compel and abate and there is no adequate remedy at law, we conditionally grant the petition for writ of mandamus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Acceptance Indemnity issued a commercial property insurance policy to the RPI (or its owner) for an apartment complex. The RPI submitted a claim under its policy to recover damages for property damage incurred after a wind/hail event that occurred in May 2015. The parties could not agree on the cost of repairs. The contractor hired by the RPI estimated damages in an amount far greater than the appraisal obtained by Acceptance Indemnity. All estimates were provided in August 2015. The RPI continued to demand payment based on its contractor's estimate, claiming the loss estimate used by Acceptance Indemnity failed to include overhead, profit, and taxes. In September 2015, Acceptance Indemnity requested the RPI sign a proof of loss, which it ultimately did in December 2015, but the RPI modified it to include notice that it was still seeking full payment based on the contractor's estimated loss. Ultimately, the RPI completed repairs on the property and Acceptance Indemnity paid the RPI the undisputed amount of loss less the deductibles. Thereafter, the RPI requested additional payment for its contractor's overhead, profit, and sales tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In April 2017, the RPI sent Acceptance Indemnity a demand letter that gave notice of alleged underpayment, violations of the DTPA and Texas Insurance Code, and breach of the common law duty of good faith and fair dealing. On August 1, 2017, Acceptance Indemnity made a written demand for appraisal, invoking the appraisal provision set out in the insurance policy. Those provisions provide that if the parties disagree on the amount of loss, either may make a written demand for appraisal of the loss. The provision describes selection of appraisers, an umpire, and other items associated with the process. In that same letter, Acceptance Indemnity designated its chosen appraiser. The RPI responded by letter, stating appraisal was not appropriate. It then filed suit against Acceptance Indemnity on August 14, 2017, alleging breach of contract and numerous extra-contractual claims. In response, Acceptance Indemnity filed a motion to compel appraisal and abate, seeking to compel appraisal under the policy and abate the proceedings pending the outcome of the appraisal. After a hearing, the trial court denied the motion to compel and request for abatement. Acceptance Indemnity filed a petition for writ of mandamus, asking this court to order the trial court to order the parties to engage in the appraisal award process and abate the suit filed by the RPI pending appraisal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Acceptance Indemnity contends that absent a showing of illegality or waiver, which mandates a showing of prejudice, the appraisal clause must be enforced. There was no assertion of illegality, so Acceptance Indemnity contends the trial court erred in denying the motion to compel appraisal and abate because the RPI failed to establish waiver or prejudice. The RPI, however, sets forth numerous arguments in which it contends appraisal is not proper in this case, and further argues Acceptance Indemnity waived its right to\n   invoke appraisal and the RPI was prejudiced thereby.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mandamus relief is available only to correct a clear abuse of discretion when there is no other adequate remedy at law.\n   <em>\n    In re M-I, L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12182474\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/505/569/#p574\">\n    505 S.W.3d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 574 (Tex. 2016) (orig. proceeding);\n   <em>\n    In re Prudential Ins.

The RPI first contends appraisal is inappropriate because the parties' dispute is not over the amount or valuation of overhead, profit, and taxes due, but whether they are due at all - which is a legal question not subject to an appraisal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Acadia Ins.

The RPI asserts Acceptance Indemnity has wholly denied payment of overhead, profit, and taxes as opposed to contesting the amounts due, so appraisal is not warranted. According to the mandamus record, this is incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In its motion to compel appraisal, Acceptance Indemnity specifically stated \"[t]he parties disagree over the\n   <em>\n    cost\n   </em>\n   of repairs,\" so it invoked the appraisal provision. And, during argument before the trial court, counsel for Acceptance Indemnity specifically advised the trial court that the RPI is \"misconstruing the dispute.\" She further stated Acceptance Indemnity is not disputing that the RPI is entitled to market value for overhead and profit; rather, the dispute is \"how much is that overhead and profit appropriate under the circumstances of the size of these losses.\" As for taxes, taxes are dependent upon the amount to be paid for the overhead/profits, so they are tied up within the appraisal for overhead and profits.

App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2017, no pet.) instructive. In that case, the court held an insurer's denial of a claim did not constitute waiver - one of the two grounds the supreme court has found sufficient for a court to refuse to compel an appraisal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 525-26. The court upheld, on appeal, the trial court's decision granting the insurer's motion to compel appraisal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The First Court of Appeals ruled similarly in the case of\n   <em>\n    In re Liberty Ins.

App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2016, orig. proceeding). In that case the court held that whether an insurer denied a claim for damages is relevant to the question of waiver, but not determinative.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6773525\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/496/229/#p235\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It appears, therefore,\n   even if the issue is, in fact, denial of the claim as opposed to the amount of loss, appraisal is not precluded in the absence of proof of waiver or illegality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The RPI next contends that even if appraisal is appropriate, Acceptance Indemnity breached the insurance policy by not paying the overhead, profit, and taxes, thereby discharging the RPI from complying with any further contractual provisions, including the appraisal provision. In support of this argument, the RPI relies upon basic contract law. However, to sustain this position, we would have to determine in the first instance whether Acceptance Indemnity breached the insurance policy by failing to pay the overhead, profits. and taxes. This puts the cart before the horse. Acceptance Indemnity has not paid because there is a dispute over the amount owed. Although the RPI does not make this argument, perhaps the contention is Acceptance Indemnity should have paid the amount it believes is due for overhead, profits, and taxes - then maybe appraisal would be appropriate. Importantly, however, in\n   <em>\n    Universal Underwriters\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court held appraisal clauses are generally enforceable absent illegality or waiver; the court did not include a precipitous breach as a ground for refusing to enforce an appraisal clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7318488\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/345/404/#p406\">\n    345 S.W.3d at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, it appears that in the absence of illegality or waiver, the clauses are enforceable.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7318488\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/345/404/#p406\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A breach of contract might subject a party to civil penalties, but breaching a contract is not \"illegal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Next, the RPI contends appraisal is not required because Acceptance Indemnity improperly used the appraisal clause as a litigation tactic to extinguish the RPI's constitutional right to a jury trial on the amount and damages and its statutory and common law claims. Moreover, the RPI contends the appraisal clause lacks \"mutuality\" and is illusory, and is therefore, unenforceable. The RPI argues the appraisal clause cannot be enforced because if Acceptance Indemnity dislikes the outcome of the appraisal, it can still deny coverage, based on the clause in the appraisal award provision that provides Acceptance Indemnity retains its right to deny the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   First, the language in the insurance policy itself belies the validity of this argument. In the appraisal clause, it states the insured \"will still retain [its] right to bring a legal action against us, subject to the Legal Action Against Us Commercial Property Condition.\" That provision merely states no one may bring a legal action against Acceptance Indemnity under the policy unless there has been full compliance with the terms of coverage and the action is brought within two years and one day after the loss. Moreover, the argument regarding lack of mutuality and enforceability has been rejected by both the First and Third Courts of Appeals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re State Farm Lloyds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12376449\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/514/789/#p795\">\n    514 S.W.3d 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 795 (Tex.

We hold the RPI failed to carry its burden to establish Acceptance Indemnity waived the appraisal clause and has presented no other viable argument that would have permitted the trial court to refuse to compel an appraisal. Accordingly, we conditionally grant Acceptance Indemnity's petition for writ of mandamus and direct the trial court to: (1) vacate its order denying Acceptance Indemnity's motion to compel appraisal and abate; (2) order the parties to engage in the appraisal process pursuant to the terms of the appraisal clause; and (3) abate the litigation pending the completion of the appraisal process. The writ will issue only in the event the trial court fails to comply with our directives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Marialyn Barnard, Justice\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   I dissent from the majority's conditional grant of mandamus relief because I do not believe the matter in dispute falls within the scope of the appraisal clause contained in the insurance policy. The key term in the appraisal clause is the \"amount of loss.\" The trigger for the mutual right to invoke the appraisal clause is if Acceptance and the insured \"disagree[s] on the amount of loss.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In its motion to compel appraisal, Acceptance broadly states that the \"gatekeeper issue for all of Plaintiffs' claims is the 'amount of loss,' \" which phrasing is tied to its invocation of the appraisal clause. However, the record shows that the current issue in dispute with respect to the appraisal clause is not \"the amount of loss,\" i.e., the valuation of the property damage, but rather the failure of Acceptance to\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   pay the general contractor JMI's overhead and profit and taxes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, in its motion to compel, Acceptance states that it \"has paid $752,567 on the claim, representing\n   <em>\n    the undisputed amount of loss\n   </em>\n   \" minus the insured's deductible. Acceptance characterizes the current dispute as based on the insured's continued demand for \"payment based on JMI's estimate.\" At the hearing on its motion to compel, counsel for Acceptance specified that the dispute between the parties was over its denial of payment for the \"overhead and profit.\" Thus, the record shows the relevant dispute in the underlying cause over Acceptance's refusal\n   to also pay JMI's overhead and profit and taxes is separate from the actual \"amount of the loss,\" and falls outside the scope of the appraisal clause. Under this interpretation, the court would not reach the analysis on waiver on which the majority opinion is based.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   I would hold the trial court did not clearly abuse its discretion by denying relator's motion to compel appraisal under the terms of the property insurance policy.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    The case law on this issue is quite prevalent.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Universal Underwriters of Tex.
