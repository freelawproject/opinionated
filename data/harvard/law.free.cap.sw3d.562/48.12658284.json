Burgess, Justice\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   A Panola County jury determined that Lydia Metcalf was a party to the offense of sexual assault, convicted her of the offense, and assessed a sentence of three years' imprisonment. On appeal, Metcalf argues that (1) the evidence is legally insufficient to support her conviction, (2) the trial court erred in admitting evidence of a subsequent extraneous offense, (3) the trial court erred in denying her motion for mistrial, and (4) the court's jury charge contained error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We find Metcalf's first issue dispositive of this appeal. Because we conclude that the evidence was legally insufficient to support her conviction, we reverse the trial court's judgment and render a judgment of acquittal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The evidence at trial established that Metcalf's child, Amber,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   was sexually abused by her stepfather, Allen Metcalf. Allen was convicted of nine counts of sexual assault and three counts of indecency with a child. In this case, the State argued that, on or about December 10, 2010, Metcalf was a party to Allen's penetration of Amber's anus by his sexual organ. Amber, who was twenty-three at the time of trial, testified about the family's history and the sexual abuse she suffered while living with Metcalf and Allen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Amber stated that Metcalf divorced her biological father when she was nine years old. Thereafter, Metcalf, Amber, and Amber's brother moved in with Allen. When Amber was twelve, the family moved to Houston, and Metcalf and Allen had two other children together. Amber testified that she was taken out of public school and given the duty of caring for house and home while Metcalf worked. According to Amber, Allen began his abuse of her by entering her room and touching her breasts and vagina when she was thirteen years old. Amber also said that Allen soon began vaginally penetrating her with his hands and penis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   She testified that she did\n   not tell anyone of Allen's sexual abuse because Allen had threatened to kill her siblings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Amber testified that the family moved to Carthage, Texas, when she was fourteen and that she continued to do household chores and cook for the family while her mother was working at a daycare facility. She said that Allen soon began coming into her room almost every night for the purpose of sexually assaulting her. Amber testified that, on one occasion during the daytime, Allen took Amber to her mother's room and penetrated her anus with his sexual organ. Amber said that, although she did not know where Metcalf was, she called out to her, but did not receive any response. The incident caused Amber to threaten Allen with revealing the abuse to her mother, but, as a result of Allen's threat to harm her siblings, Amber kept quiet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Amber testified that, when she was fifteen, she told Metcalf that \"Allen was doing bad things and he was a monster.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Amber added that, because she was scared, she did not go into any detail and made no allegation of sexual abuse at that time. Metcalf did not believe that Allen did \"bad things\" or that he was \"a monster,\" and \"didn't do anything at that time.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   When asked, \"Did you ever cry out for your mom when Allen came into your room,\" Amber responded that she had, that Metcalf would stand near the door to the master bedroom, that Metcalf would ask, \"What's going on,\" and that Metcalf would walk away after Allen exited her room and reported that she was simply having a nightmare.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Amber said she did not cry out again \"[b]ecause [she] knew [her] mother was letting it happen.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When Amber was sixteen, she told Metcalf that Allen had \"slapped [her] and tried to pull down [her] pants.\" In a voluntary statement, Metcalf wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   I called Allen to come home and he said that it wasn't anything sexual, that [Amber] was whining about having to use the bathroom so he took her behind a tree and pulled at her shorts. I did not believe him but I had no proof. I made Allen leave our home but let him come back later ... I gave [Amber] a whistle and a cell phone and told her to call 911 if Allen tried to touch her again.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Amber testified that she received the whistle and cell phone, but was told to call Metcalf if something happened, not the police. Amber did not use the cell phone or whistle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Amber stated that she did not inform Metcalf of the sexual abuse even though Allen had raped her for a number of years. During cross-examination, Amber testified that she did not know whether Metcalf was present when she was raped because she\n   \"was in a locked room,\" and \"[Metcalf] was sleeping in her room when Allen came into [Amber's] room.\" She said that Metcalf never directed Allen to perform any sexual acts on her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Over objection, the State introduced an extraneous offense which occurred after Allen stopped anally raping Amber. In 2011, Metcalf walked into Amber's room and found Allen on top of her daughter. Amber testified that Allen was touching her vagina with his hands when Metcalf saw them, instructed Allen to get into the master bedroom, and argued with him behind closed doors. Metcalf kicked Allen out of the home. After only four hours of his absence, however, she then pleaded with her daughter to allow Allen to move back home by asking Amber to \"think about the kids.\" Amber testified that she gave in to her mother's plea, allowed Allen to move back in, and was instructed by Metcalf not to tell anyone. When asked, \"When did the acts by Allen against you, the anal raping, when did that stop,\" Amber responded that it was when Metcalf found out in 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   With respect to the 2011 incident, Metcalf wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   I saw Allen on the bed touching Amber's stomach. I told Allen to leave or I would call the police.... When Allen came back he got on his hand and knees apologizing and promising to never touch [Amber] again.... When [Amber] was 20 Allen started taking me to our priest and admitting that he had touched [Amber].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Prior to the 2011 incident, however, Amber clarified that she never told Metcalf that Allen had attempted to have sex with her and that she first told Metcalf that Allen had raped her when she was twenty-two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After hearing this evidence, the jury convicted Metcalf of being a party to anal penetration of Amber by Allen's sexual organ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Because no other evidence was offered to support this inference, a conclusion that Metcalf knew Amber was crying out because she was being sexually abused, instead of having nightmares, was based on speculation. Amber's statements to Metcalf that Allen was doing bad things, was a monster, and had once tried to pull down her pants were, likewise, insufficient to support a rational inference that Metcalf was aware that Allen was committing the act of anal penetration alleged. Amber further stated that she was not sure whether her mother was present in the home when Allen penetrated her anus with his penis and that Allen did not commit any act of sexual assault after the 2011 incident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The extraneous 2011 incident, which occurred after the act alleged in the indictment, established that Metcalf then became aware that Allen contacted Amber's vagina with his hand, failed to inform law enforcement at that point, and allowed Allen to move back into the home. However, the agreement to act together to execute a common purpose \"must be made before or contemporaneous with the criminal event\" alleged.\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11428496\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/83/308/#p314\">\n    83 S.W.3d at 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While the 2011 incident, when coupled with Amber's statements that she cried out for her mother and believed her \"mother was letting it happen,\" could have contributed to the belief that Metcalf may have known or suspected some untoward behavior on Allen's part prior to that incident, Amber testified that she did not inform Metcalf that Allen was sexually abusing her before the anal penetration alleged in the State's indictment occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The basic facts in this case, even when viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, do not establish that Metcalf had the prior or contemporaneous intent to promote or assist Allen in the commission of the sexual assault alleged in the indictment-anal penetration-beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather, we conclude that they reveal nothing more than a basis for speculation that Metcalf was guilty, as a party, of the offense alleged. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the evidence is legally sufficient for a rational jury to conclude that Metcalf was a party to the offense under either Section 7.02, subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3), beyond a reasonable doubt, which is this State's highest burden of proof. Therefore, we reverse Metcalf's conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Metcalf's Conviction Cannot Be Reformed\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Next, having determined that the evidence was legally insufficient to support Metcalf's conviction as a party to the offense of sexual assault as alleged, we must now consider whether the conviction should be reformed to reflect a conviction of a lesser-included offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Canida v.

TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 37.09 (West 2006). A person commits the offense of indecency with a child if the person contacts the anus of a child younger than seventeen years of age with intent to arouse or gratify his sexual desire, including through clothing. TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 21.11(a)(1), (c) (West Supp. 2018). Here, the act of sexual contact of Amber's anus by Allen's penis would be established by proof of the same or less than all the facts required to establish the act of penetrating Amber's anus. Thus, in circumstances such as the one in this case, indecency with a child is a lesser-included offense of sexual assault.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ochoa v.

App. 1998). Accordingly, we examine whether the evidence was legally sufficient to support a conviction of Metcalf as a party to indecency with a child. Specifically, we ask whether the evidence established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that, (1) having a legal duty to prevent the commission of indecency with a child (2) and acting with intent to promote or assist its commission, (3) Metcalf (4) failed to make a reasonable effort to prevent the commission of the offense of indecency with a child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The State cites several cases bearing on this matter, which we find easily distinguishable. The first category of cases involve facts that established the appellant's active encouragement of the offense. For example, the State cites to\n   <em>\n    Simon v.

The State also cites\n   <em>\n    Carson v. State\n   </em>\n   , in which we concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support a mother's conviction for the capital murder of her child where she requested or encouraged her boyfriend to perform an exorcism on her child, was present during a thirty-hour period of horrendous torment of the child, saw a photo of the child showing abuse to her face, and heard terrible cries of the child, but did nothing to aid her.\n   <em>\n    Carson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7328383\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/422/733/#p742\">\n    422 S.W.3d at 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In the second category of cases, the evidence suggested that the appellant was an active participant in the commission of the offense. In\n   <em>\n    Beardsley v.

The record does not support an inference that Amber told Metcalf that she was sexually assaulted. Moreover, the hypothetically correct jury charge, as determined by the State's indictment, required the State to prove that Metcalf acted with the intent to promote or assist the act of sexual assault-specifically by anal penetration.\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2021.11\">\n     Tex.

An inference that Metcalf was aware of any act of anal penetration from these record references would require conjecture.

The risk must be of such a matter and degree that the failure to perceive it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that an ordinary person would exercise under all the circumstances as viewed from the actor's standpoint.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206.03\">\n     Tex.
