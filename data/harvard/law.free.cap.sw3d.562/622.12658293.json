The Wilsons then filed counter-claims against the Ammermans, asserting that the Ammermans also violated applicable deed restrictions. The trial court rendered summary judgment in favor of the Association and the Wilsons on all claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, the Ammermans argue:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   (1) the trial court erred in granting summary judgment dismissing the Ammermans' claims on statute of limitations grounds because the Ammermans presented some evidence raising a fact issue regarding when their cause of action for breach of the Covenants and a declaratory judgment against the Wilsons and the Association accrued and when they could have discovered their cause of action; and (2) the trial court erred in granting summary judgment dismissing their claims on the ground that the Association and the Wilsons had conclusively proved that they did not violate the relevant restrictive covenants because they presented some evidence that the Association acted arbitrarily and capriciously in approving the Wilsons' building plans; and (3) the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the Wilsons on their claim that the Ammermans breached the restrictive covenants in making changes to the buildings on their own property because the alleged violations were barred by the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We affirm the trial court's summary judgment dismissing the Ammermans' claims against both the Wilsons and the Association. We reverse the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the Wilsons on their counterclaims against the Ammermans and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Ranches of Clear Creek (the Community) is a gated community in Waller County, Texas. The Declaration of Covenants and Restrictions for the Ranches of Clear Creek (the Covenants) that were filed with Waller County require, among other things, in Article VI, section 3, that all improvements or alterations to improvements must be approved in writing by the Architectural Review Committee (ARC) after the submission of certain required documentation. The Covenants further provide that all improvements to property must be made within the designated predetermined \"Building Envelope,\" which is defined as \"that certain contiguous and regularly shaped three (3) acre portion of each Lot to be designated by each Owner and approved by the Residential Review Committee prior to the commencement of any construction upon any Lot.\" Article VI, Section 9 of the Covenants states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The Building Envelope of each lot shall be located so that same is as far as reasonably possible from the Building Envelope on all other contiguous Lots. In the event that a Building Envelop has not been established on all contiguous tracts then the Building Envelope shall be located as follows: (i) in a manner that will maintain the integrity of a rural ranch setting; (ii) be set back from any abutting Street a minimum of 100 feet; (iii) have a side yard set back a minimum of 100 feet; and (iv) have a rear yard set back a minimum of 100 fee. Once established, the Building Envelope shall not be modified nor changed without Residential ARC approval.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Covenants give the Association's Architectural Review Committee (the ARC) \"exclusive jurisdiction over all original construction on the Lots.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Covenants also govern the types of structures that may be built. Article VII, section 3 provides, in part, that \"[n]o detached garage or accessory building shall exceed one story in height without the written consent of the Residential ARC.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Article VII, section 4 governs garages, driveways, and sidewalks. It provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Each Single Family Residence must have an attached or detached garage for a minimum of two (2) full size automobiles. Each Owner shall construct and maintain at his own expense a driveway from the garage of his or her residence to the abutting Street, including the portion of the driveway in the street easement, and the Owner shall repair at his expense any damage to the Street or drainage ditches occasioned by connecting the driveway thereto.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Article VII, section 19 addressed requirements of outbuildings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   No outbuilding or structure shall be permitted outside of the Building Envelope without prior written approval of the Residential ARC and must be located in such a manner as to be no nearer any street, or common area, than the rear of the primary residence. No more than three (3) outbuildings or other structures, temporary or permanent, will be allowed without approval of the Residential ARC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Covenants further state that the purpose of the Association is to, among other things, \"providing for the maintenance and preservation of the Area of Common Responsibility and the facilities of the Association and architectural control of the Lots.\" The Covenants vested the Association's Board with rule-making authority to \"exercise business judgment and reasonableness on behalf of the Association\" in adopting, amending, repealing, and enforcing the rules and regulations necessary to implement the Covenants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Ammermans purchased Lot 28, a 30.6-acre parcel, in May 2006. The Wilsons purchased lot 29, a 16.8-acre parcel of land, several months later. Lots 28 and 29 are contiguous. Each lot had a predetermined Building Envelope within which the owner was permitted to construct a residence and other buildings. The Ammermans began to develop their property, Lot 28, immediately after they purchased it. In 2007, their barndominium was approved by the ARC with a changed Building Envelope, and the residence was completed in November of 2008. In June and July 2012, the Ammermans constructed a shed outside of Lot 28's building envelope and, in January 2014, they added onto their shed outside Lot 28 in front of their barndominium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Subsequently, in 2015, the Wilsons began the process of building their retirement home on Lot 29, with ARC approval. The Ammermans investigated the proposed building location and came to believe that the Wilsons residence violated the restrictive covenants governing the Community. Specifically, they alleged, but have not shown, that the Wilson's building plan is not within the 2006 predetermined Building Envelope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Ammermans' Suit Against the Association and the Wilsons and Request for a Declaratory Judgment and Temporary Injunction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On January 11, 2016, the Ammermans filed suit against the Association and the Wilsons. They alleged causes of action for breach of contract and declaratory judgment, asserting that the Association and the Wilsons had violated Article VI, Section 9 of the Covenants regarding the location of the building envelope for the Wilson's lot. The Ammermans sought a declaratory judgment \"regarding the construction and validity of the Covenants in order to determine the rights, status, and legal relations of the Ammermans and Defendants.\" The Ammermans also sought a temporary injunction to prevent the Wilsons from building their proposed residence while litigation proceeded. The Ammermans' subsequently amended their petition to add a cause of action against the Association for failing \"to comply with\n   their duties\" and \"by exercising their discretionary authority in an arbitrary and capricious manner.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Association and the Wilsons answered, denying all of the Ammermans' claims and asserting various affirmative defenses, including that the Ammermans' claims were barred by the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The trial court held a hearing on the Ammermans' request for a temporary injunction. Clay Ammerman testified that he and his wife were among the first residents to purchase lots in the community, that they had purchased Lot 28 because of its unique location and secluded nature, and that they immediately began construction of their primary residence. Ammerman acknowledged that he was aware at the time he purchased his lot of potential locations where his neighbors, the Wilsons, could build a residence on Lot 29. However, he testified that their proposed building location, or building envelope, violated the Covenants because their approved building site was not as far as reasonably possible from his residence and would affect the resale value of his home. Clay Ammerman also acknowledged that he had sought and obtained approval to move his own building envelope when building his home in 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On February 9, 2016, the trial court denied the request for injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Wilsons' April 28, 2016 Counterclaim and the Ammermans' April 29, 2016 Amended Petition and Application for Permanent Injunction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On April 28, 2016, the Wilsons filed a counterclaim against the Ammermans for breach of contract and for a declaratory judgment, asserting that the Ammermans had breached the Covenants \"by constructing their shed [and by] constructing a car-port and failing to construct a garage.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Wilsons asked that the trial court declare their rights with respect the Covenants and find that the Ammermans had breached them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Ammermans did not file an answer to the Wilsons' counter-petition. However, the next day, April 29, 2016, they filed an amended petition and an application for permanent injunction containing additional information regarding the parties. The Ammermans continued to assert that the Wilsons and the Association had violated Article VI, Section 9 of the Covenants, specifically the part stating that \"[t]he Building Envelope of each lot shall be located so that same is as far as reasonably possible from the Building Envelope on all other contiguous lots.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Association's and the Wilsons' May 9, 2016 Joint Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On May 9, 2016, the Association and the Wilsons filed a joint traditional motion for summary judgment on the Ammermans' claim that they had both breached Article VI, Section 9 of the Covenants. They argued that when the Ammermans and the Wilsons purchased their lots in 2006, the Wilsons' lot, Lot 29, \"already had a pre-determined Building Envelope that was set by the [Association] and the developer of the subdivision.\" They argued: \"Despite\n   the undisputed fact that the Ammermans were aware of the location of Lot 29's Building Envelope in 2006, they have waited nearly a decade and until the eve of the construction of the Wilsons' home to file a frivolous suit complaining about information they have been in possession of since at least May 2006.\" They asserted that the Ammerman's claims were barred by the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In the alternative, the Association and the Wilsons argued in their traditional motion for summary judgment that the \"governing documents give the [Association] and [ARC] discretion to determine the placement of all Building Envelopes as well as the placement of structures within the Building Envelopes,\" and thus the Ammermans could not raise a genuine issue of material fact on their claims that either the Association or the Wilsons had breached Article VI, section 9 of the Covenants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Association and the Wilsons supported this motion for summary judgment with the affidavit of Jack Owen, the president of the Association and the custodian of the Association's records. He averred, in relevant part, that the Ammermans purchased Lot 28 in May 2006, that the Wilsons purchased Lot 29 in September 2006, and that \"[a]s of January 3, 2016, the Wilsons were given approval to begin construction of their home.\" Owen stated, \"When determining approval for the Wilsons, the [Association] and ARC determined that the Wilsons' Building Envelope is as far as reasonably possible from all other contiguous owners in the [Community].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Association and the Wilsons also included the transcript from the temporary injunction hearing as support for the motion for summary judgment. They cited Clay Ammerman's testimony that he was aware of the potential building sites for the Wilsons' home when he purchased his lot in 2006, his acknowledgment that the previously proposed building cite for the Wilsons' home was \"closer to [his] primary residence ... than the envelope where the Wilsons\" had been approved to build their home in 2016, and that Clay Ammerman was aware that people had to build within their designated building envelope when he purchased his lot in 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The motion for summary judgment was also accompanied by the declaration of Johnny Wilson, in which he stated that \"each individual lot was listed for sale with a Building Envelope that was predetermined by the HOA [the Association] and the ARC,\" and, thus, when he and his wife purchased their lot in September 2006, \"the Building Envelopes for all of the lots, including Lot 29, were already set. As such, we were not only aware of Lot 29's Building Envelope, but also our neighbor's, Clay and Erin Ammerman's ... Building Envelope.\" He went on to state that \"one of the reasons we ultimately decided to purchase Lot 29 was because of the Building Envelope.\" He stated that he and his wife had owned Lot 29 for nearly ten years before deciding to build a retirement home, and the plans and specifications for the home that were approved by the Association and ARC \"showed that the home would be located inside of our Building Envelope.\" He stated, \"Notably, we have not ever requested that our Building Envelope be modified or changed and so, it has remained in its original location for ten years.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Association and the Wilsons also presented the trial court with a copy of the Covenants and other documents governing the Community, a copy of the letter from the ARC approving the Wilsons' building plans, and a copy of a letter from the ARC to the Ammermans explaining its decision to approve the location of the Wilsons' home. The letter to the Ammermans stated,\n   in part, \"Regarding the ARC decision to approve the location of the Wilson's home site on Lot 29 the ARC has placed considerable effort to address your concerns as well as the effect on the Wilsons of moving their building envelope as you have suggested.\" The ARC specifically noted that \"the Wilsons' requested home site on Lot 29 is within the 'as reasonably possible' distance required by our [Covenants]\" and that the original building site \"was closer to the cul-de-sac than the Wilsons have requested, [and] therefore the building envelope has already been set back.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In their response to the motion for summary judgment, the Ammermans asserted generally that after they became aware of the Wilsons' building location in January 2016, they investigated and discovered \"that the Wilsons were building their residence in a location different than what was originally platted by the developer,\" referring apparently to the fact that the Wilsons had chosen a site for their home within their building envelope that was different from the building site originally noted by the developer. The Ammermans contended, however, that the Wilsons' \"building envelope was changed and/or modified based on the December 16, 2015 building plans submitted by the Wilsons,\" citing the letters from the ARC approving the Wilsons' building and explaining its decision to the Ammermans as evidence to support their contention. The Ammermans did not dispute that a four-year statute of limitations applied to their claims for breach of contract and declaratory judgment, but they argued that their limitations period did not begin to run until January 2016 when they first received notice from the ARC that it had approved \"a new build location in breach of the Covenants[.]\" The Ammermans also asserted that the discovery rule applied to their claims because their injury was inherently undiscoverable until the Wilsons began to develop their property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Ammermans supported their response with, among other documents, the affidavit of Clay Ammerman, in which he provided details of the building of his own residence. He stated, \"During the development of our Lot, we were required by the then existing ARC to incur substantial expenses planting foliage to screen off our property from the then platted build location on Lot 29.\" He further averred that, based on the details of the Wilsons' construction, the \"recently approved build location renders the foliage we were required to plant useless, as it does not provide any screening where the Wilsons are now approved to build.\" He stated that the Wilsons' home would be visible from the entrance to his home and that the build site \"is a mere 100 yards from our property line, resulting in the Wilsons' newly approved building location being not as far as reasonably possible from our building envelope.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Ammermans' June 1, 2016 Amended Petition and June 14, 2016 Motion for Summary Judgment on the Wilsons' Counterclaim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On June 1, 2016, while the Association's and the Wilson's joint traditional motion for summary judgment was still pending, and before the trial court ruled on their original claims regarding Article VI, Section 9 of the Covenants, the Ammermans filed a second amended petition, asserting new claims for breach of contract and declaratory judgment against the Association. In their amended petition, the Ammermans contended again that the Association and the Wilsons had breached Article VI, Section 9 of the Covenants, and they added claims that the Association breached Article II, Sections 1 and 4, Article VI sections 3, and\n   Article VII, section 3 in connection the approval of the Wilsons' building site. The Ammermans asked the trial court to declare their rights with respect to the additional covenants as well as with respect to Article VI, Section 9 pursuant to the Declaratory Judgments Act, Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 37.004(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Ammermans also asserted that the Association had violated Property Code sections 202.004 and 215.009 by approving the Wilson's building plans. Section 202.004 provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (a) An exercise of discretionary authority by a property owners' association or other representative designated by an owner of real property concerning a restrictive covenant is presumed reasonable unless the court decides by a preponderance of the evidence that the exercise of discretionary authority was arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   TEX. PROP. CODE ANN . \u00a7 202.004 (West 2014). Likewise, section 215.009 provides that \"[a] property owners' association may enforce its restrictive covenants ... by exercising discretionary authority relating to a restrictive covenant unless a court has determined by a preponderance of the evidence that the exercise of discretionary authority was arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 215.009 (West 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On June 14, 2016, the Ammermans filed their own motion for summary judgment asserting that the Wilsons' counterclaims were barred by the statute of limitations and laches. The Wilsons responded, asserting that they had no way to know that the Ammermans had not complied with the Covenants until Ammerman testified at the temporary injunction hearing regarding their lack of written approval by ARC for their improvements and other deviations from the Covenants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Trial Court's July 6, 2016 Order on the Association's and the Wilsons' Traditional Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On July 6, 2016, the trial court granted in its entirety the Association's and the Wilsons' joint traditional motion for summary judgment on the Ammermans' claims that the Wilsons and the Association had breached Article VI, section 9 of the Covenants. It specifically ruled that the Association and the Wilsons had established both that the statute of limitations barred the Ammermans' breach of contract and declaratory judgment claims and that the Association and the Wilsons had established as a matter of law that neither had violated Article VI, Section 9 of the Covenants. The trial court also awarded reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees to the Wilsons and the Association in an amount to be determined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    F. The Trial Court's July 18, 2016 Order on the Ammermans' Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On July 18, 2016, the trial court granted the Ammermans' motion for summary judgment on the Wilsons' counterclaims on limitations grounds in part and denied it in part. The trial court ruled that the Ammermans' \"claim in the Motion that the statute of limitations has passed on [the Wilsons'] [counter-claims] for breach of contract on the construction of the Barndominium is hereby GRANTED.\" The trial court denied summary judgment on the Wilsons' remaining breach of contract counterclaims, specifically denying the portion of the Ammermans' motion arguing that claims involving construction and modification of the equipment building and the declaratory judgment claims were barred by the statute of limitations. These claims, therefore, continued to go forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    G. The Association's August 10, 2016 Second Traditional Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On August 10, 2016, the Association filed a second traditional motion for summary judgment to address the additional claims raised by the Ammermans in their June 1, 2016 amended petition, before the July 6, 2016 summary judgment was entered, regarding discovery of the Association's and the Wilsons' alleged breaches of the Covenants, and also regarding the Association's alleged breach of Property Code sections 202.004 and 202.009. The Association sought dismissal of all of the Ammermans' claims against it, including both the Ammermans' claims related to discovery of the Wilsons' alleged breaches of the Covenants within the statute of limitations, on which the trial court had already ruled, and the Ammermans' new claims under the Property Code. The Association set out detailed arguments asserting that it had not breached any provisions of the Covenants. And it asserted that the Ammermans' related declaratory judgment claims failed for the same reasons as their breach of contract claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Association argued, again, that, as decided by the trial court's July 6, 2016 summary judgment order, the Ammermans were aware of the location of the pre-determined Building Envelope on the Wilsons' property in 2006. Thus, any complaints that the Association violated Article VI, Section 9 or any other provisions of the Covenants in determining or approving the location of the Wilson's Building Envelope were barred by the statute of limitations for breach of contract. The Association further argued that the discovery rule did not apply because the summary judgment evidence established that Clay Ammerman was aware of the Wilsons' potential building locations in 2006 and that he was aware that owners could build their home anywhere within the predetermined building envelope that was designated prior the Ammermans' and Wilsons' purchase of their respective lots in 2006. In the alternative, the Association argued in its second motion for traditional summary judgment that it did not breach any of the provisions asserted by the Ammermans in their June 1 amended petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Finally, the Association moved for summary judgment on the Ammermans' claim that the Association had violated Property Code sections 202.004 and 202.009. It argued that section 215.009 was not applicable in this case. The Association further argued in its motion for summary judgment that it did not violate the Property Code by acting arbitrarily or capriciously, in violation of section 202.004, when it approved the Wilsons' building plans under Article VI, Section 9. The Association cited Property Code section 202.004(a), creating a presumption that a property owners' association's exercise of discretion \"is presumed reasonable unless the court decides by a preponderance of the evidence that the exercise of discretionary authority was arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. PROP. CODE ANN . \u00a7 202.004(a). The Association argued that the Ammermans had failed to rebut this presumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    H. The Trial Court's November 21, 2016 Order on the Association's Second Traditional Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   On November 21, 2016, the trial court granted summary judgment against the Ammermans and dismissed all their claims against the Association in response the Association's second traditional motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Trial Court's December 13, 2016 Order Severing the Cases and the Association's December 29 Notice of Appeal in Cause No. 16-01-23529-A, Resulting in Appellate Cause No. 01-17-00015-CV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   On December 13, 2016, the trial court severed all of the Ammermans' claims against the Association into a separate cause of action, stating \"that all claims and causes of action asserted by [the Ammermans] against [the Association] are hereby severed into a separate cause under a new cause number[,]\" namely cause number 16-01-23529-A. This severance order, combined with the trial court's July 6, 2016 order, granting the Association's and the Wilsons' joint motion for summary judgment, and the November 21, 2016 order, granting the Association's second traditional motion for summary judgment, constituted a final ruling of the trial court with respect to the Association. It left pending only the Wilsons' counterclaim for declaratory judgment and breach of the Covenants against the Ammermans insofar as the counterclaim regarded later improvements made to the Ammermans' property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Accordingly, the trial court's summary judgments in favor of the Association on the Ammermans' claims against it became the trial court's final judgment with respect to the Association.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   On December 29, 2016, the Ammermans filed a notice of appeal in the severed case, trial court cause number 16-01-23529-A, resulting in appellate cause number 01-17-00015-CV. The notice of appeal challenged both the July 6, 2016 order granting the Joint Motion for Summary Judgment and the November 21, 2016 order granting the Association's second Motion for Summary Judgment, and it noted that those judgment were made final as to the Association when the claims against the Association were severed from those of the Wilsons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    J. The Wilsons' December 27, 2016 Amended Counterclaim Against the Ammermans; the Wilsons' March 10, 2017 Traditional Motion for Summary Judgment on Their Counterclaim; and the Ammermans' April 4, 2017 Response\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   On December 27, 2016, the Wilsons filed an amended counterclaim asserting claims for breach of contract and declaratory judgment against the Ammermans, again based on allegations that the Ammermans breached the Covenants by failing to get written approval for their improvements, constructing their shed in a location that violated the restrictions, constructing a car-port, and failing to construct a garage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   On March 10, 2017, the Wilsons filed a traditional motion for summary judgment on their counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment that the Ammermans had violated Article VI, sections 3 and 9, and Article VII, sections 4 and 19 of the Covenants by failing to include a garage as part of their primary residence and by building the equipment shed without written ARC approval outside their building envelope and placing it somewhere besides the rear of the property. The Wilsons sought reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees pursuant to the Declaratory Judgments Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   As summary judgment evidence, the Wilsons included a transcript of Clay Ammerman's testimony at the temporary injunction hearing. The Wilsons contended that Clay Ammerman admitted at the hearing that his residence lacked a two-car garage; that he had built a shed on his property without obtaining written approval from the Association and that the shed\n   was built in front, rather than behind, the primary residence; and that the shed is located outside the Ammermans' building envelope and was located less the one-hundred feet from the property line. Specifically, the Wilsons cited Clay Ammerman's testimony that his home had a \"porte cochere\" and his statement, \"I don't need a garage. It is not visible from any street or common area or adjoining property.\" They also point to Clay Ammerman's testimony that he got verbal approval to build his shed and his testimony that he built the shed in the only location that he could have built it, which he acknowledged was not in his rear yard. The Wilsons also provided a survey showing that the shed is less than 100 feet from the Wilson-Ammerman property line and thus was placed inside the 100-foot setback required by the Covenants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Wilsons asserted that all of these conditions constituted violations of the Covenants, and because Ammerman admitted to the violations, no genuine issues of material fact existed and the Wilsons were entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In their Response to the Wilson's Motion for Summary Judgment on their counterclaim, filed April 4, 2017, the Ammermans asserted that the evidence, including Clay Ammermans' testimony, established that their residence contained \"garage space far larger than the 600 square feet required by the [Covenants]\" and pointed to garage space included on their property as containing \"both an [eight foot] roll-up metal door and a [fourteen foot] set of double cedar plank doors for larger vehicles.\" They also pointed to the fact that their residence included a porte-cochere that satisfied the Covenant's requirement that each residence include a garage. The Ammermans also cited to the fact that they obtained written approval for the residential building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Regarding the Wilsons' claims that the Ammermans built the shed without written approval, the Ammermans pointed to e-mail correspondence from members of the ARC approving the construction of the shed. They argued that, at a minimum, the e-mails raised a fact question regarding whether the Ammermans obtained proper written approval to build the shed. They also argued that, although the Covenants generally require that sheds and other storage buildings should be placed behind the primary residence, the Covenants have a specific condition that lake-front properties-like the Ammermans'-may not have storage buildings placed in the rear yard. They also argued that, to the extent their property varied from the requirements of the Covenants, the e-mails approving the construction of the shed raised at least a fact question that they were granted a variance by the Association and, thus, were not in violation of the Covenants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In addition to floor plans showing the presence of a garage and a porte-cochere in the Ammermans' residence, the Ammermans provided written documentation and emails showing approval of their building plans and affidavits of other Community residents who stated that building approvals were done verbally or by email, as had occurred in the Ammermans' case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    K.

The trial court awarded the Wilsons reasonable and necessary attorney's fees, thereby disposing of all of the Wilsons' remaining claims against the Ammermans. The trial court's May 16, 2017 order in cause number 16-01-23529 thereby became the court's final judgment on all of the Wilsons' claims against the Ammermans and all of the Ammermans' claims against the Wilsons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   On June 14, 2017, the Ammermans filed a Notice of Appeal against the Wilsons, resulting in appellate cause number 01-17-00448-CV. In this notice of appeal, the Ammermans again listed the trial court's November 21, 2016 order granting the Association's second motion for summary judgment, which was also included in the then-pending appeal in appellate cause number 01-17-00015-CV, and they listed the trial court's May 16, 2017 final order granting the Wilsons' motion for summary judgment on their declaratory judgment counter-claim against the Ammermans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    Summary Judgment on the Ammermans' Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In their first and second issues, the Ammermans argue that (1) the trial court erred in granting summary judgment dismissing their claims on statute of limitations grounds because they presented some evidence raising a fact issue regarding when their cause of action for breach of the Covenants and for a declaratory judgment against the Wilsons and the Association accrued and when they could have discovered their cause of action; and (2) the trial court erred in granting summary judgment dismissing their claims on the ground that the Association and the Wilsons had conclusively proved that they did not violate the relevant restrictive covenants because they presented some evidence that the Association acted arbitrarily and capriciously in approving the Wilsons' building plans.

The Ammermans argue that this was some evidence that the proposed location of the home site was changed sometime between 2006 and 2016. However, none of this evidence contradicts the evidence that the parties were aware of possible building locations in 2006, at the time they purchased their lots. And none of this evidence contradicts Johnny Wilsons' declaration that the approved building site was within the original building envelope.

The trial court ultimately found that the Ammermans' breached the Covenants as a matter of law because (1) their primary residence\n   lacked a two-car garage; (2) they constructed an equipment shed on Lot 28 without written approval of the ARC; (3) the equipment shed on Lot 28 was not located behind the primary residence; and (4) the equipment shed on Lot 28 was located outside the Building Envelope and within the 100-foot setback at the property line. However, the Ammermans cited other portions of that same record indicating that the Ammermans believed they had acted within the scope of the Covenants at all times. For example, Clay Ammerman testified that he had a \"porte cochere\" and that he did not need a garage, but he did not affirmatively testify that his property lacked a garage in violation of the Covenants. The Ammermans also presented summary judgment evidence that their home had garage space and that their primary residence was approved by the ARC in writing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Regarding the alleged violations for the building of the shed, Clay Ammerman testified at the temporary injunction hearing that he got verbal approval to build his shed and that he built the shed in the only location that he could have built it, which he acknowledged was not in his rear yard. This testimony does not constitute an admission that the Ammermans failed to get written approval, as the Wilsons claim. Furthermore, the Ammermans submitted summary judgment evidence in the form of emails from ARC members approving the building of the shed-including its location as being outside the original Building Envelope, within the 100-foot setback, and not being located behind the primary residence. The Ammermans presented affidavits from other homeowners averring that the Association's practice was to provide the required approvals either verbally or through emails such as those provided to the Ammermans here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The Ammermans also pointed to the copies of the Covenants themselves, which provided exceptions to the general rule that utility buildings must be located behind the primary residence by stating that lake-front properties-like the Ammermans'-may not have storage buildings placed in the rear yard. The Ammermans also argued that, to the extent their property varied from the requirements of the Covenants, the ARC was authorized to approve construction that otherwise violated the covenants and that the e-mails approving the construction of the shed raised at least a fact question that they were granted a variance by the Association and, thus, were not in violation of the Covenants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Thus, although the trial court concluded that the Ammermans were in violation of the Covenants because their primary residence lacked a two-car garage, the Ammermans provided more than a scintilla of evidence indicating that their primary residence contained an appropriate garage or the equivalent of a garage, in the form of a porte cochere, that was approved by the ARC in writing. The Ammermans also provided emails raising, at the least, a fact question regarding whether they had obtained written approval from the ARC to construct their shed. The e-mails indicated that ARC committee members approved the shed-including its location-prior to the Ammermans' beginning construction. Furthermore, the Covenants themselves indicated that lake-front properties may not have storage buildings in the rear yard and that the ARC had authority to approve building plans even if they varied from the requirements of the Covenants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   We conclude that the Ammermans presented more than a scintilla of evidence raising a fact-issue regarding whether their primary residence and shed violated the Covenants. Accordingly, the trial court\n   erroneously granted summary judgment on the Wilsons' counterclaims against the Ammermans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. CIV .
