A majority of the court grants the State's motion for rehearing. The court's opinion and judgment issued March 27, 2018 is withdrawn and the following opinion is issued in its stead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Appellant Jermaine Earvin Johnson challenges his conviction for aggravated robbery, asserting that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over his case because a grand jury impaneled by a district court other than the trial court presented the indictment to the trial court. Appellant also contends that article 102.004(a) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, which governs jury fees paid by convicted defendants, violates the separation-of-powers clause of the Texas Constitution. Finally, appellant urges that the imposition of a jury fee against those convicted by a jury violates the constitutional right of trial by jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We conclude, unanimously, that the trial court had jurisdiction over the case. All members of the panel join in section III.A of this opinion on rehearing. Regarding appellant's facial constitutional challenge to the jury fee, however, a majority of the court on rehearing holds that article 102.004(a) is not facially unconstitutional on the grounds that it violates the separation-of-powers clause. As to appellant's third issue, a majority holds that the imposition of this jury fee does not violate the constitutional right to a trial by jury. Accordingly, the trial court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The grand jury for the 209th District Court of Harris County presented an indictment charging appellant with aggravated robbery. That indictment was filed in the 263rd District Court of Harris County, the court in which the State's complaint had been filed. The judge of the 263rd District Court conducted a jury trial of the charged offense. The jury found appellant guilty as charged and assessed punishment at 27 years' confinement. The trial court ordered appellant to pay court costs. The bill of costs, which totaled $334, included a $40 \"jury fee\" charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Appellant raises three issues in this court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (1) The 263rd District Court of Harris County did not have jurisdiction over appellant's case because the grand jury for the 209th District Court of Harris County presented the indictment to the 263rd District Court, and that presentment does not vest jurisdiction in the 263rd District Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (2) The jury fee is unconstitutional because having the trial court collect the fee makes the court a tax gatherer, which violates the Texas Constitution's separation-of-powers clause.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (3) The jury fee violates the accused's right to a jury trial enshrined in the Texas Bill of Rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Trial Court's Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In his first issue, appellant argues that the trial court, the 263rd District Court, lacked jurisdiction over this case because a grand jury impaneled by the 209th District Court presented the underlying indictment to the 263rd District Court. Appellant contends that the grand jury for the 209th District Court should present indictments only to the 209th District Court and that this grand jury had no authority to present an indictment to the\n   263rd District Court. Appellant argues that because the grand jury for the 209th District Court did not present the indictment to the 209th District Court, that court lacked jurisdiction over the indictment, and because the grand jury had no authority to present the indictment to the 263rd District Court, that court lacked jurisdiction. According to appellant, if a grand jury impaneled by one district court presents an indictment to a different district court, then no district court has jurisdiction over the indictment. Appellant concedes that if the grand jury had presented the indictment to the 209th District Court, that court would have had jurisdiction over the indictment and that court would have had authority to transfer the case to the 263rd District Court. Appellant notes that the record does not reflect any transfer in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Texas Code of Criminal Procedure sets forth the organization and duties of a grand jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex.

Proc. art. 102.004(a). Appellant's argument amounts to a facial challenge to the constitutionality of article 102.004(a). Appellant contends that article 102.004(a) violates the separation-of-powers provision because the statute does not direct that the funds collected be expended for something that is a legitimate criminal-justice purpose. The parties have not cited and research has not revealed any case addressing this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Before addressing the constitutional issues, we note that appellant did not raise these complaints in the trial court by objecting to the imposition of court costs. However, the record shows the court assessed the bill of costs the same date as the judgment, but the bill of costs was not filed until three days after the judgment. An appellant may raise complaints about court costs, including complaints about the constitutionality of the statutes authorizing those costs, for the first time on appeal when they are not imposed in open court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

As to the portion of the fee allocated to the criminal justice planning account, the court held that the appellant did not meet his burden because the statute allowed for constitutional applications.

The State refers to the first fund as the county \"jury fund\" and cites Government Code section 61.001(b) for the proposition that the reimbursement of juror expenses under section 61.001(a) must be paid out of the county's jury fund.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tex.

According to the State, under\n    <em>\n     Peraza\n    </em>\n    , the fees are \"directly related to the recoupment of costs of judicial resources expended in connection with the prosecution of criminal cases.\"\n    <em>\n     Peraza\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6854194\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/467/508/#p514\">\n     467 S.W.3d at 517\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The State posits that we may draw a distinction between certain types of court costs depending upon their intended uses. Some court costs reimburse expenses already incurred in a criminal prosecution; other court costs are to be expended to offset certain future criminal-justice costs. As the State suggests, we may reasonably read\n    <em>\n     Salinas\n    </em>\n    's requirements as inapplicable to those costs that reimburse past expenses. If that is so, the State argues, then the jury fee is constitutional regardless whether the legislature has directed how the funds collected are to be spent. We need not address this point because we conclude that appellant has failed to meet his burden on a facial challenge even assuming\n    <em>\n     Salinas\n    </em>\n    applies.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    Appellant relies on cases in which courts imposed the actual expenses incurred in providing a jury trial for the defendant, as opposed to the imposition of a statutory jury fee as we have here.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.
