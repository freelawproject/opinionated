The issues presented are whether the truck's owner was a trespasser and whether he can be liable for negligence when the fire was set by an unknown third-party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Dan Howard and Sherolyn Howard are the owners of property in Lowmansville, Kentucky. At the time of the fire, the property was leased by Bob and Diane Castle who operated a grocery store on the property known as Family Food.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the late evening of December 26, 2015, after the store closed, Leslie Matthew Spradlin parked his truck in the store parking lot. He left with a friend leaving a firearm, two ammo clips and a tool box in the truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Sometime during the night, Spradlin's truck caught fire. The actual cause of the fire has not been determined, although to be clear, there is no suggestion that Spradlin set the fire to either the truck or the store building. The Howards' claim is that a third-party broke into Spradlin's truck, stole the firearms, ammo clips and tool box and then burned the truck to cover the crime. The eaves of the grocery store caught fire and the building was entirely destroyed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In his deposition testimony, Spradlin explained that his wife had worked at the grocery store and Bob Castle was a friend. He parked in the store lot after hours many times and believed Bob would not object to him parking in the lot on the evening of the fire. However, he did not have express permission of the Howards or Castles to park in the store's lot on that night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During discovery, the Howards admitted that there were not any \"no trespassing signs\" or \"no parking\" signs on the property at the time Spradlin parked his truck. They further admitted that they never advised Spradlin or anyone not to park on the property after hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 29, 2016, the Castles, in separate affidavits dated June 29, 2016, stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   That affiant further states that there were no \"no parking\" signs on the premises and no other signs which would keep persons from parking on the premises any time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   That affiant never objected to persons parking on the premises as long as they didn't interfere with the daily operations of the business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The affiant states that persons often parked there after closing hours and affiant never objected to same and felt that the openness of the lot was good for business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The affiant states that there were no locked gates, fences or any other signs or other notices which would keep persons from parking on the lot and affiant\n   did not consider any person, including Matthew Spradlin, to be trespassers on the lot after closing hours and that individuals frequently parked on the premises after closing hours and were never considered to be trespassers[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On August 18, 2017, the Castles again signed separate affidavits. They repeated that there were not any \"no parking\" signs in the parking lot when Spradlin parked his truck and that, although Spradlin did not obtain permission to park his truck on the lot the night of the fire, \"people did park there all the time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Based on the above recited undisputed facts, the circuit court granted summary judgment to Spradlin. We review its summary judgment under a well-established standard. Under Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure (CR) 56.03, we must ask whether the circuit court correctly found that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Because summary judgment involves only legal questions and the existence of any disputed material issues of fact, \"an appellate court need not defer to the trial court's decision and will review the issue\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Lewis v.

App. 2001). The party opposing summary judgment must present \"at least some affirmative evidence showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact for trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Steelvest, Inc. v.

Summary judgment is only proper when \"it appears impossible for the nonmoving party to produce evidence at trial warranting a judgment in his favor[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9995816\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/807/476/#p482\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Howards argue Spradlin was a criminal trespasser under Kentucky Revised Statutes (KRS) 511.080(1) and, therefore, he is liable under a theory of negligence per se. We agree with the circuit court that under the undisputed facts, Spradlin was not a trespasser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Statutory law is consistent in its definition of a trespasser. KRS 381.231 defines a \"trespasser\" as \"any person who enters or goes upon the real estate of another without any right, lawful authority or invitation, either expressed or implied[.]\" In the criminal context, KRS 511.080(1) provides \"[a] person is guilty of criminal trespass in the third degree when he knowingly enters or remains unlawfully in or upon premises.\" KRS 511.090 provides that \"[a] person 'enters or remains unlawfully' in or upon premises when he is not privileged or licensed to do so.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As the above definitions indicate, either in the civil or criminal context, a person who enters the property of another \"by express invitation or implied acquiescence of the owner or occupant solely on [his] own business, pleasure or convenience\" is not a trespasser.\n   <em>\n    Scuddy Coal Co. v.

There was not a \"no trespassing\" sign or other signage that would put anyone on notice that parking on the lot was prohibited after hours. Spradlin testified he had previously parked on the store lot after hours without objection from the Castles. The Castles' affidavits stated they never objected to anyone parking on the premise at any time, people often parked on the store\n   lot after hours without their objection, and they believed it was beneficial to their business for people to park there. Most telling, the Castles stated they, the possessors of the property, did not consider any person, including Spradlin, to be a trespasser when parked on the lot after hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In light of the evidence produced by Spradlin, the Howards had the burden to present evidence establishing a triable issue of material fact that the Castles' objected to Spradlin parking on the store lot after hours.\n   <em>\n    Steelvest\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9995816\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/807/476/#p482\">\n    807 S.W.2d at 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . No such evidence having been produced, summary judgment was appropriate as to any claim of trespass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Regardless of how the Howards creatively attempt to frame their claim, it is a common-law negligence claim. Any negligence claim has four elements: \"(1) a legally-cognizable duty, (2) a breach of that duty, (3) causation linking the breach to an injury, and (4) damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Patton v. Bickford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386978\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/529/717/#p729\">\n    529 S.W.3d 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 729 (Ky. 2016). Whether the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff is a question of law for the court, while breach and injury are questions of fact for the jury.\n   <em>\n    Pathways, Inc. v. Hammons,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9096310\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/113/85/#p89\">\n    113 S.W.3d 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 89 (Ky. 2003). Causation is a mixed question of law and fact.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9096310\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/113/85/#p89\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The initial inquiry is whether the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff. The Kentucky Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Grayson Fraternal Order of Eagles, Aerie No. 3738, Inc. v. Claywell,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9971125\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/736/328/#p332\">\n    736 S.W.2d 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 332 (Ky. 1987), is often cited for the proposition that Kentucky has adopted a \"universal duty of care\" under which \"every person owes a duty to every other person to exercise ordinary care in his activities to prevent foreseeable injury.\" Despite the \"universal duty of care\" embraced in\n   <em>\n    Grayson\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court subsequently clarified that the duty was limited by the concept of foreseeability. In\n   <em>\n    Pathways,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9096310\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/113/85/#p89\">\n    113 S.W.3d at 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting David J. Leibson, 13 Kentucky Practice,\n   <em>\n    Tort Law\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 10.3 (1995) ), the Court stated \"[t]he most important factor in determining whether a duty exists is foreseeability.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Foreseeability defies precise definition but is generally defined in terms of occurrences that a reasonable person would anticipate. In\n   <em>\n    Merchants Ice &amp; Cold Storage Co. v.

Men are not called upon to guard against every risk that they may conceive as possible but only against what they can forecast as probable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Although almost any outcome is possible, it does not mean it is probable. As noted in\n   <em>\n    Pathways\n   </em>\n   (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 289(a) ), \"[t]he actor is required to recognize that his conduct involves a risk of causing an invasion of another's interest if a reasonable man would do so while exercising such attention, perception of the circumstances, memory,\n   <em>\n    knowledge of other pertinent matters,\n   </em>\n   intelligence, and judgment as a reasonable man would have.\"\n   <em>\n    Pathways,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9096310\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/113/85/#p89\">\n    113 S.W.3d at 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Despite the declared limitation of foreseeability on the universal duty concept, the Court would later rethink the relationship between duty and foreseeability. In\n   <em>\n    Shelton v.

The Court held\n   that foreseeability was a factor in the breach analysis that presents a jury question unless \"reasonable minds cannot differ or it would be unreasonable for a jury to find breach or causation[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7092016\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/413/901/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7092016\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/413/901/\">\n    at 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

App. 2017). However, this is not a premises liability case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Unfortunately, the Supreme Court was less than clear whether foreseeability is taken out of the duty analysis in all negligence cases or its decision applies only to the open and obvious doctrine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this case, whether we consider foreseeability in a duty, breach or causation analysis makes no difference. Because there is no question of material fact and only one reasonable conclusion can be reached regarding breach of any duty by Spradlin or causation, summary judgment was appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Shelton,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7092016\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/413/901/\">\n    413 S.W.3d at 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Spradlin did not breach any duty of reasonable care by merely parking his truck six feet from the grocery store building. No reasonable person would say that is so. A truck in a place where it is legally permitted to be parked simply does not pose a recognizable risk. Common practice and experience tells us this is true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Howards argue that it was not the parking of the truck that posed the danger but rather the gun, ammo clips and toolbox inside made it probable a thief would take the items and burn the truck to cover the crime. They argue that Spradlin should have anticipated these crimes would occur and, as the argument goes, parked his truck a sufficient distance from the building so as not to catch it on fire when the crimes occurred or removed the items from the parked truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Howards' argument is that Spradlin should have foreseen a crime upon a crime and taken reasonable care to prevent what was a possible but an improbable occurrence. The Howards' breach of duty argument is counterintuitive to the third element of negligence, causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Causation as an element of any negligence action consists of two components, but-for causation and proximate cause. \"But-for causation requires the existence of a direct, distinct, and identifiable nexus between the defendant's breach of duty (negligence) and the plaintiff's damages such that the event would not have occurred 'but for' the defendant's negligent or wrongful conduct in breach of a duty.\"\n   <em>\n    Patton,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386978\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/529/717/#p729\">\n    529 S.W.3d at 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The second component, proximate causation, \"captures the notion that, although conduct in breach of an established duty may be an actual but-for cause of the plaintiff's damages, it is nevertheless too attenuated from the damages in time, place, or foreseeability to reasonably impose liability upon the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386978\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/529/717/#p729\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386978\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/529/717/#p729\">\n    at 731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court continued its reliance\n   on the Restatement pointing out that \"448 and 449, also must be read in conjunction with\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Second) of Torts,\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 302B [.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9976729\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/817/443/#p449\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That section, \"Risk of Intentional or Criminal Conduct,\" states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   An act or an omission may be negligent if the actor realizes or should realize that it involves an unreasonable risk of harm to another through the conduct of the other or a third person which is intended to cause harm, even though such conduct is criminal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9976729\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/817/443/#p449\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Second) of Torts\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 302B ). Applying the quoted Restatement provisions and case law, the Court then analyzed the facts under the superseding cause doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Britton\n   </em>\n   , a fire started when trash was piled next to a grocery store by a tenant's employees and the trash was ignited by a third-party causing the building to catch fire. Permitting the trash to pile up next to the building was a safety code violation and, even if not, piling rubbish and boxes too high in a dumpster and too close to a building could be negligent conduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9976729\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/817/443/#p449\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9976729\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/817/443/#p449\">\n    at 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court held that the third-party's act did not supersede the tenant's negligence because the fire was a reasonably foreseeable result of piling flammable material next to a building.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9976729\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/817/443/#p449\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9976729\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/817/443/#p449\">\n    at 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the end, the Supreme Court held that whether the fire was started accidently, negligently, intentionally, or criminally was insignificant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9976729\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/817/443/#p449\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9976729\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/817/443/#p449\">\n    at 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The issue as framed by the Court was whether it could be proved that the defendant \"caused or permitted trash to accumulate next to its building in a negligent manner which caused or contributed to the spread of the fire and the destruction of the lessor's building.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9976729\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/817/443/#p449\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9976729\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/817/443/#p449\">\n    at 451-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the defendant did so, \"the source of the spark that ignited the fire [was] not a superseding cause under any reasonable application of modern tort law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9976729\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/817/443/#p449\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9976729\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/817/443/#p449\">\n    at 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Any similarity between\n   <em>\n    Britton\n   </em>\n   and this case ends with the fact that a grocery store caught fire. A parked truck with the ignition turned off is not a fire hazard as was the trash in\n   <em>\n    Britton\n   </em>\n   . Spradlin parked his truck in a parking lot where the undisputed evidence is that he had the possessor's permission to park.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   An analogous situation was presented in\n   <em>\n    Bruck v. Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9278541\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/131/764/\">\n    131 S.W.3d 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ky. App. 2004), where the alleged negligent actor left the key in an unlocked truck on his driveway, a thief stole the truck, and negligently operated the truck causing the plaintiff injuries. The Court held the original negligent act of leaving the key in the truck only created a condition.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9278541\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/131/764/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9278541\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/131/764/\">\n    at 768\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Applying the superseding cause factors in\n   <em>\n    NKC Hosps\n   </em>\n   ., the Court concluded that the negligent driving of the thief was an unforeseeable intervening act that constituted a superseding cause.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9278541\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/131/764/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9278541\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/131/764/\">\n    at 769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Howards cannot prevail as a matter of law. Even if we assume Spradlin breached any duty owed to the Howards, the intervening and superseding intentional or criminal acts of the unknown third-party broke whatever weak chain of causation the Howards could establish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   For the reasons stated, the summary judgment of the Lawrence Circuit Court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   ALL CONCUR.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Kendall v.

App. 2017), this Court held that\n    <em>\n     Shelton\n    </em>\n    embraced the universal duty of care concept rather than the foreseeability analysis. \"By removing foreseeability as a part of the duty analysis, duty effectively becomes a given element in negligence actions.\" While it is unnecessary for this panel to agree or disagree with this interpretation, we do urge our Supreme Court to clarify this issue at its first opportunity.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
