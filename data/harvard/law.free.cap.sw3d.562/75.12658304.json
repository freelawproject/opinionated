We reverse and render.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The City of San Antonio by and through City Public Service Board d/b/a CPS Energy (hereinafter, \"CPS Energy\") was sued by Christopher Smith for damages he sustained in a motorcycle accident. In his petition, Smith alleged that he was driving his motorcycle on an exit ramp from Interstate Highway 10 to Interstate Highway 37 when he struck a light pole that had fallen onto the roadway. Smith also alleged that he was unable to avoid the light pole and was thrown from his motorcycle and sustained serious injuries. According to Smith's petition, the downed light pole created a driving hazard and CPS Energy was negligent in failing to timely remove the light pole blocking the roadway and in failing to warn him of the light pole blocking the roadway. Smith asserted negligent activity, premises liability, and gross negligence claims against CPS Energy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   CPS Energy filed a plea to the jurisdiction and a supplemental plea to the jurisdiction (collectively, \"the plea to the jurisdiction\"), asserting that it was entitled to governmental immunity because the Texas Tort Claim Act's (\"TTCA's\") waiver of immunity did not apply. Specifically, CPS Energy argued Smith's claims did not fall within the limited waiver of immunity provided by section 101.021 of the TTCA. Additionally, CPS Energy argued that even if Smith had alleged facts that brought his claims within section 101.021's limited waiver of immunity, his claims were barred by statutory exceptions for emergencies provided under sections 101.055(2) and 101.062(b) of the TTCA. Finally, CPS Energy argued that it was immune from suit under section 101.056 of the TTCA because any act on its part regarding the downed light pole was a discretionary act for which the Legislature had not expressly waived immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In his response to the plea to the jurisdiction, Smith argued that CPS Energy shared with the City of San Antonio responsibility for the maintenance and removal of downed light poles in emergency situations under a joint enterprise theory; that CPS Energy and the City's light pole maintenance was a proprietary function that was not protected by immunity; that CPS Energy was not protected by immunity because immunity does not extend to private companies exercising independent discretion; and that even if immunity did apply, it would be waived because the light pole obstructing the roadway was a special defect under the TTCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After a hearing, the trial court granted CPS Energy's plea to the jurisdiction as to Smith's negligent activity claims, but denied its plea to the jurisdiction as to Smith's premises liability and gross negligence claims. CPS Energy appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The only part of the trial court's ruling challenged on appeal is the denial of CPS Energy's plea to the jurisdiction as to Smith's premises liability and gross negligence claims. Thus, our review is limited to this part of the trial court's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Appellate Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Whether the trial court had subject-matter jurisdiction over Smith's claims is a question of law that we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Texas Dep't of Parks &amp; Wildlife v.

Smith further alleged that CPS Energy was negligent in failing to timely remove the light pole blocking the roadway and in failing to warn him of the light pole blocking the roadway. The activities that form the basis of Smith's claims involve CPS Energy's response to a traffic hazard either by removing the hazard from\n   the roadway or by warning drivers of the hazard.

Smith further alleged that CPS Energy was negligent in failing to timely remove the light pole blocking the roadway and in failing to warn him of the light pole blocking the roadway. In its plea to the jurisdiction, CPS Energy contended that Smith's claims regarding its failures to report, warn, remove, or make safe the roadway after the light pole was struck and knocked down by another driver constituted complaints about the manner in which it responded to an emergency call or reacted to an emergency situation and fell within the scope of section 101.055(2) of the TTCA. CPS Energy presented evidence to support its contention that section 101.055(2) applied. Smith, however, did not file any pleadings asserting that the emergency exception did not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The evidence before the trial court included the undisputed testimony of Jose Guadalupe Trevino, CPS Energy's Director of Construction and Maintenance. In his deposition testimony, Trevino testified that CPS Energy employs first responders called \"troublemen.\" CPS Energy's troublemen are dispatched to emergencies throughout the city. According to Trevino, a downed light pole blocking a lane of highway at an interchange would be considered an emergency once it was reported to CPS Energy. Once a downed light pole is reported to CPS Energy, it dispatches a troubleman to patrol the area to find it. If a troubleman arrives at the scene of a downed light pole and decides that it is too dangerous to get the pole out of the road on his own, he will try to set up cones or at least alert drivers to the downed pole so they will be more cautious. And, if CPS Energy's troubleman cannot remove the downed pole himself, he will call for assistance from the police department or a crew to help him get the downed pole out of the way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In his affidavit, Trevino testified CPS Energy's dispatch records and audio recordings showed that at about 3:49 p.m. on the day of Smith's accident, CPS Energy received a call from the San Antonio Police Department (\"SAPD\") stating that a light pole had been knocked down and was in the middle of the highway. The caller specified that the downed light pole was located at Eastbound IH-10 and Pine. CPS Energy dispatched a troubleman to look for the downed light pole located at Eastbound IH-10 and Pine. At approximately 4:26 p.m., the troubleman contacted the dispatcher and advised that he had \"been from Hackberry all the way to Walters on both sides of 10\" and was \"not seeing anything.\" At approximately 4:27 p.m., CPS Energy's dispatcher called SAPD to request clarification about the downed light pole and was told that the light pole was actually located at Eastbound 10 to Northbound 37 and that the police had already left the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Other undisputed evidence showed the downed light pole near Pine Street and IH-10 was not the one struck by Smith. Smith's accident occurred at approximately 4:46 p.m. when he struck the downed light pole located at Eastbound 10 to Northbound 37. Thus, the evidence showed that on the afternoon of Smith's accident CPS Energy was informed of two downed light poles located in the same vicinity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In sum, the undisputed evidence showed that CPS Energy considered a downed light pole blocking the roadway to be an emergency and it employed first responders, troublemen, who responded to this type of emergency. The undisputed evidence also showed that on the day of Smith's accident CPS Energy was notified of a downed light pole in the middle of the\n   highway near Pine Street and IH-10 and it responded by sending a troubleman to locate the downed light pole. When the troubleman was unable to locate the downed light pole, he contacted the dispatcher who sought clarification of the location of the downed light pole. At this point, the dispatcher was informed of another downed light pole, the downed light pole involved in Smith's accident. We conclude that the evidence established that Smith's claims arose from CPS Energy's response to an emergency call or reaction to an emergency situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Once CPS Energy presented evidence establishing that the emergency exception applied, Smith was required to plead and present evidence of at least one of the following: (1) CPS Energy was not responding to an emergency call or reacting to an emergency situation; (2) CPS Energy was not in compliance with the laws and ordinances applicable to the emergency action; or (3) CPS Energy's actions were taken with conscious indifference or reckless disregard for the safety of others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hartman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8466484\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/201/667/#p671\">\n    201 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   672 ;\n   <em>\n    Quested\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6916150\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/440/275/#p284\">\n    440 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   284 ;\n   <em>\n    Rosenbaum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%206739583\">\n    2011 WL 6739583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 ;\n   <em>\n    Little\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8167344\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/259/236/#p238\">\n    259 S.W.3d at 238-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

According to Smith, the emergency exception did not apply here because there was \"no evidence that CPS Energy ever responded to the scene of the wreck involving [him.]\" We reject this argument for several reasons. First, Smith cites no authority to support this argument. Second, whether or not CPS Energy arrived at the scene of\n   Smith's accident is irrelevant. Smith's claims involve CPS Energy's response or reaction to the downed light pole that he struck, a light pole that had been knocked down by another motorist prior to Smith's accident.

Smith was driving his motorcycle on an exit ramp from Interstate Highway 10 to Interstate Highway 37 near downtown San Antonio in the afternoon when he unexpectedly encountered a fallen light pole obstructing his travel lane. The evidence shows material fact issues exist as to whether CPS Energy waived its immunity by failing to warn of or make safe this special defect on the roadway. Although the majority opinion decides CPS Energy had governmental immunity, it skips over the issue of whether CPS Energy waived its immunity and instead concludes that even if it did, Smith's suit must be dismissed because the emergency exception applies to this case.

The jurisdictional evidence shows the City and the State entered into a contract whereby the City agreed to maintain and operate the lighting system along the interstate highways within the City, \"including the furnishing of all materials, equipment, and labor which may become necessary to maintain the system.\" The evidence also shows, via a contract between CPS Energy and an independent contractor, that CPS Energy had a duty to maintain the lighting systems within the City, which included \"state-owned expressway lighting systems.\" This evidence reasonably gives rise to an inference that the City delegated its duty to maintain the lighting system along the interstate highways to CPS Energy. The evidence also suggests the duty to maintain and operate the lighting system encompasses a responsibility to remove light poles when they fall onto the highway. Joel Nelson, an SAPD senior management analyst, testified when asked who is responsible to get fallen light poles off the highway and out of traffic, \"TxDOT ... has the responsibility for all things on the highway with the exception of the light poles.

Castilleja-Rodriguez related she told CPS Energy personnel the exact location of the fallen light pole, and that she was told CPS Energy \"already [had] a call on that.\" When asked whether an hour and forty-six minutes is too long for a pole to be down and blocking a lane of traffic on an interchange like the one between I-37 and I-10, the City's corporate representative replied, \"I mean, if it's blocking a lane, absolutely ... that would be too long.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Smith and indulging in every reasonable inference and resolving any doubts in Smith's favor, I conclude genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether CPS Energy had control over the highway with regard to the lighting system and thus had a duty to warn of or remove the light pole when it fell onto the roadway and created a dangerous condition, whether CPS Energy knew or should have known about the fallen light pole, and whether CPS Energy breached its duty by failing to remove or warn of the fallen light pole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Suarez v.

The majority focuses on the fact that CPS Energy, after receiving a call from SAPD, dispatched a troubleman to locate the fallen light pole.

If this were so, all special defect claims would trigger the emergency exception where the governmental defendant had actual knowledge of the condition, thus allowing it to claim it was in the process of reacting to it. Such an extension of the emergency exception would effectively rewrite the TTCA to alter what a plaintiff must show to succeed on a special defect claim where it is undisputed the governmental unit had actual knowledge of the condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   When interpreting and applying a statutory provision, we \"must consider the statutory scheme as a whole\" and \"strive to give the provision a meaning that is in harmony with other related [provisions].\"\n   <em>\n    Fort Worth Transportation Auth. v.

This would mean that whenever a governmental unit in a special defect case\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   had actual knowledge of the condition, the plaintiff must not merely show that the governmental unit knew or should have known of the condition and breached its duty of care, as \u00a7 101.022(b) provides, but that, in the absence of laws or ordinances applicable to the governmental unit's response to the condition, the plaintiff would also have to show the governmental unit reacted with \"conscious indifference or reckless disregard for the safety of others,\" i.e., gross negligence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7301929\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/283/329/#p331\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 101.055(2).

The majority repeatedly states Smith did not plead or prove that the emergency exception did not apply; however, Smith was only required to plead and prove the emergency exception did not apply once CPS Energy met its initial burden to present evidence showing the emergency exception applied to the facts of the case, which it failed to do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7132573\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/372/629/#p635\">\n    372 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   635 ;\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205472537\">\n    2017 WL 5472537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3, *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Accordingly, I conclude the emergency exception does not apply to this case and\n   therefore does not provide a basis for reversing the trial court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, I do not believe the emergency exception provides a basis for reversing the trial court's order and dismissing Smith's claims, and because the evidence raises fact issues as to CPS Energy's liability, I would affirm the trial court's order.
