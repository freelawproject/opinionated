VAUGHT, Judge\n  This interlocutory appeal stems from the order of the Washington County Circuit Court granting the motion of appellee Northwest Physicians, LLC's (Northwest) to compel discovery. On appeal, appellant Washington Regional Medical Center (WRMC) argues that the circuit court's order compels the discovery of the medical records of nonparty patients maintained by WRMC, which is in violation of Arkansas Rule of Evidence 503, the physician-patient privilege. On appeal, appellee Dr. Shaun Senter purports to incorporate the arguments of WRMC and claims that he properly asserted, and did not waive, the Rule 503 privilege. We affirm.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-9\">\n  Senter was employed as a cardiologist by Northwest, located in Bentonville, Arkansas, pursuant to the terms of a March 28, 2011 employment agreement that contained nonsolicitation and noncompetition covenants.\n  <footnotemark>\n   1\n  </footnotemark>\n  Northwest terminated Senter's employment on January 19, 2016. Senter subsequently accepted employment with WRMC.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-10\">\n  On May 25, 2016, Northwest filed suit against Senter seeking damages for breach of the nonsolicitation and noncompete covenants set forth in the employment agreement. Northwest alleged that Senter breached the noncompete provision when he became an employee of WRMC, a competing hospital located within a twenty-mile radius of Northwest, within the one-year period following his termination. Northwest also alleged that Senter breached the nonsolicitation covenant when patients who had been treated by Senter at Northwest were solicited by Senter to receive services at WRMC, and these patients actually received medical services at WRMC.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-11\">\n  During discovery, Northwest learned that Senter had kept information on his home computer of over 1,600 patients he had treated while employed at Northwest and that he had provided this information on a thumb drive to WRMC upon his employment there. Northwest also learned in discovery that a third-party pacemaker company, Boston Scientific, had provided WRMC with a list of hundreds of patients Senter had treated while at Northwest; these patients had been called on by WRMC at the behest of Senter after he became employed at WRMC; and approximately two hundred of Senter's patients whom he had treated at Northwest had been seen or treated by Senter since he joined WRMC.\n </opinion>\n <attorneys id=\"p-12\">\n  Northwest propounded interrogatories and requests for production to Senter seeking the names and contact information of patients he had seen since his termination of employment with Northwest and while employed with WRMC and asking whether WRMC had contacted any of these patients. Senter objected on several bases, none of which was that the information sought was protected by the physician-patient privilege.\n </attorneys>\n <footnote label=\"1\">\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The nonsolicitation covenant provides that Senter agreed, for a period of one year following the termination of his employment, not to, either directly or indirectly, call on, solicit, take away, or attempt to call on, solicit, or take away any person who was a patient of Northwest during the term of the employment agreement. The noncompete covenant provides that Senter agreed, for a period of one year following the termination of his employment, to not work for a competing hospital located within a twenty-mile radius of Northwest.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thereafter, Northwest issued a subpoena duces tecum to WRMC requesting:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   1.

Senter's and WRMC's responses asserted that the requested information was protected by the physician-patient privilege. A motion-to-compel hearing was held on September 7, 2017. At the conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court orally granted Northwest's motion, finding that the physician-patient privilege \"could be overcome\" with an order of protection because the medical information sought by Northwest was essential to its cause of action against Senter. After finding that the privilege could be overcome, the circuit court then found that there would be no basis for the privilege if the nonparty patients' names were not identified.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   But I don't see any basis for privilege if that person is never identified, how in the world you could say that their privilege was violated, if that person is never identified. You can't. Because who would come forward and say my privilege was violated and you say, how do you know? Well, I don't, but it could have been. I mean, I don't see any way, if you do it that way, because they'll never know who that person was.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On November 21, 2017, the circuit court entered an order granting Northwest's motion to compel. The order states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   2. For the reasons set forth from the bench at the hearing on the Motion, the Court finds that the Motion should be and hereby is granted as follows.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   3. WRMC is to produce to Northwest the following: for the time period commencing from when Dr. Senter became employed by WRMC until January 19, 2017 ... a list of each type of procedure and medical service he has performed while with WRMC, and for each such procedure and service, the number of times he performed it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   4. In addition, for the time period commencing from when Dr. Senter became employed by WRMC until January 19, 2017, WRMC is to produce Northwest the following: a list of patients (whose names can be replaced by using a generic number in order to protect their identity) seen or treated by Dr. Senter during his employment at WRMC that he also saw or treated while he was employed with Northwest, and for each such patient, the type of procedure and medical service they received\n   from Dr. Senter. In determining which patients have been seen or treated by Dr. Senter at both Northwest and WRMC during this time period, WRMC is to review its internal records and compare those against both the list of patients provided to it by Dr. Senter on the thumb drive as well as the list provided to WRMC by Boston Scientific (a copy of which has been produced by WRMC in response to Northwest's Subpoena).\n   <em>\n    As an alternative to the foregoing, WRMC may elect to provide the following\n   </em>\n   : a list of patients seen or treated by Dr. Senter during the first full year of his employment at WRMC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   5.

WRMC also contends that none of the exceptions stated in Rule 503 apply and that the Rule 503 privilege was not waived. Finally, WRMC argues that Rule 503 and its more stringent patient-privacy protections trump federal HIPAA law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   With respect to WRMC's appeal, we hold that WRMC's first argument-whether it is entitled to claim the Rule 503 privilege-is dispositive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Rule 503 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (b)\n   <em>\n    General Rule of Privilege.\n   </em>\n   A patient has a privilege to refuse to disclose and to prevent any other person from disclosing his medical records or confidential communications made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment of his physical, mental or emotional condition, including alcohol or drug addiction, among himself, physician or psychotherapist, and persons who are participating in the diagnosis or treatment under the direction of the physician or psychotherapist, including members of the patient's family.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (c)\n   <em>\n    Who May Claim the Privilege.\n   </em>\n   The privilege may be claimed by the patient, his guardian or conservator, or the personal representative of a deceased patient.

R. Evid. 503(b), (c) (2017). The policy behind the physician-patient privilege is to encourage patients to communicate openly with their physicians and to prevent the physicians from revealing the infirmities of the patient.\n   <em>\n    Finney v.

Rule 503 expressly states that the privilege may be claimed by the patient or the patient's physician at the time of the communication. Ark. R. Evid. 503(c). The rule defines a \"patient\" as a person who consults or is examined or interviewed by a physician or psychotherapist, and it defines a \"physician\" as a person authorized to practice medicine in any state or nation, or reasonably believed by the patient\n   so to be. Ark. R. Evid. 503(a)(1), (2). These definitions do not include WRMC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Further, WRMC did not argue below and does not argue on appeal that as Senter's employer it is entitled to assert the physician-patient privilege based on agency principles. Rather, WRMC concedes that the privilege belongs to the patient yet claims that it is the proper party to assert it on behalf of the patient. However, under Rule 503, it is not. The privilege belongs to patients and their physicians who are presumed to have the authority to claim the privilege. Ark. R. Evid. 503(b) ;\n   <em>\n    McKenzie v.

Instead, Senter filed his brief in accordance with the appellee's brief due date, which prevented Northwest from being able to respond to Senter's arguments and is inherently unfair.\n    <em>\n     Ark.

WRMC, Senter, and Northwest agreed at the motion-to-compel hearing that federal protections under HIPAA apply to the nonparty patients' medical information.
