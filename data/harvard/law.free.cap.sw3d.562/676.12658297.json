Penal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 21.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 22.021 (West Supp. 2017). The trial court sentenced him to two life sentences for the aggravated sexual assault convictions and three consecutive twenty-year sentences for the indecency convictions. On appeal, Perez complains of the trial court's admission of extraneous-offense testimony by two of his younger sisters to incidents of sexual abuse allegedly committed by him in the 1960s and its admission of testimony by a social worker and sex-offender-treatment provider to the characteristics and dynamics of situations of sexual abuse. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Ana and Brianna's outcries\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Cousins Ana and Brianna spent a lot of time at the home of their grandparents, Perez and his wife, Regina. Perez and Regina often babysat their grandchildren, and the whole family would often gather together at their home for family dinners together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After one such family dinner on Saturday, May 31, 2014, Brianna's mother Jennifer was helping Brianna, who was seven at the time, undress for a bath when she noticed that the side of Brianna's left breast was \"puffed.\" Jennifer testified that upon noticing the mark, Brianna exclaimed, \"[O]h, grandpa,\" and when Jennifer asked her what she meant, Brianna told her that \"grandpa like[d] to bite her boobs\" and that it made her \"a little sore.\" Jennifer testified that Brianna also said that Perez liked to kiss her and put his tongue in her mouth and she did not like that, and that Perez had recently started taking out his private part and rubbing it \"on the front and back of her ... private areas.\" Jennifer testified that Brianna also mentioned something about her cousin Ana that concerned her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The next day, Jennifer went to her parents' home and confronted Perez in front of other family members, including one of her sisters and Regina. According to Jennifer, Perez dismissed the allegations and claimed that he just patted Brianna on the leg and occasionally gave her a kiss on the cheek or a peck on the mouth. The family then called Ana's father, Leo, and told him to bring his wife, Mary, and Ana to the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Once they arrived, Jennifer told Leo and Mary about Brianna's allegations. Leo and Mary took Ana to another room and asked Ana if Perez had touched her inappropriately. Mary testified at trial that Ana \"kind of looked at [them] and got teary eyed and said, yes. And she said that he had been touching her and she pointed to her private area.\" According to Mary, Ana \"scooted to the edge of the bed and she opened her legs and said that he had been rubbing her down there and pointed to her private area.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Later, once they were at home, Ana revealed more details of the abuse, telling Mary that Perez \"had been touching down\n   there and rubbing her down there in her private area and that he had been making her touch him in his private area\" in an up and down motion, that she had seen Perez's penis and seen \"something clear and slimy\" come out of it, and that \"he would also put his private area to her private area and then she said that he would also put it to her ... butt area.\" According to Mary, Ana said that \"she was scared to say anything but now she felt like everything was fine to talk about.\" Ana said all of the events happened in the computer room or his bedroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On the same day that she confronted Perez about the allegations and shared them with Mary and Leo, Jennifer reported the allegations to police. Within days, the two girls were taken for forensic interviews with Shannon May of Patsy's House Children's Advocacy Center. May testified at trial to both girls' descriptions of the abuse. According to May, Ana told her that Perez would make her kiss him in exchange for candy, that Perez \"put his pee pee\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   through her underwear,\" that Perez's \"pee pee had touched her butt,\" and that Perez had put his mouth on her vagina. May also recounted Brianna's descriptions of Perez making her touch his penis at least twice and his direction not to tell anyone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   May also described drawings that each girl made during her interview, and those drawings were admitted into evidence. Ana made two drawings. One drawing included a stick figure and a tongue with an arrow connecting the tongue to the stick figure's genital area, the words \"PeePee,\" \"Balls\", and the sentence \"[Ana] is sad.\" Ana's second drawing included a depiction of two stick figures lying in a bed, a \"PeePee\" with hair on it, a \"little hole\" and the word \"slim[y].\" Brianna wrote on a piece of paper, \"My Grapa put hes metal paret in my metal paret [sic].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Perez was charged with seven counts of aggravated sexual assault and indecency with a child by contact as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 Count 1: Aggravated sexual assault of Ana by penetrating her sexual organ with his;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Count 2: Aggravated sexual assault of Ana by penetrating her sexual organ with his tongue;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 Count 3: Indecency by sexual contact by touching Ana's genitals;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Count 4: Indecency by sexual contact by causing Ana to touch his genitals;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Count 5: Aggravated sexual assault of Brianna by penetrating her sexual organ with his;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Count 6: Indecency by sexual contact causing Brianna to touch his genitals; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 Count 7: Aggravated sexual assault of Ana by penetrating her anus with his sexual organ.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Testimony at trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Ana and Brianna\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Ana was eight when she testified at trial to Perez's sexual abuse. She testified, \"[W]e would watch cartoons and then he would like start touching me [with] ... [h]is hands.\" She described how he touched her legs and her \"middle part,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   how he put his \"middle part\" in hers twice, how he made her touch his \"middle part,\" how he touched her butt with his \"middle part,\" and how he touched her \"middle part\" with his tongue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Brianna was ten at the time of trial. She testified that the abuse took place in Perez's bedroom and in the computer room in his house. Brianna alleged that Perez bit her breast and forced her to put her hand on his penis and move her hand up and down. She also recounted in detail how Perez \"put his middle part in [hers]\" \"a lot of times,\" and she described it as feeling \"weird and sticky\" and \"[s]limy.\" Brianna also recalled an instance when Perez put his penis in her anus. According to Brianna, Perez directed her not to tell anybody about the abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Sexual assault nurse examiners\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Each girl was examined by a sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE) and both SANEs testified at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Michelle Smith examined Ana. At trial, Smith recounted Ana's description of the abuse:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Grandpa tells me to go and watch cartoons in his room. He opens my legs, he makes me sit on the edge of the bed. He ... takes out his thing and puts it in mine. He does it every day when I come over. He tries to kiss me, but I don't want to, but he does.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Smith testified that a physical examination of Ana revealed a \"possible notch\" in her hymen. She explained that she could not make a definitive finding regarding the cause of the notch but that it was consistent with the sexual acts that Ana had described. She estimated that fewer than ten percent, and possibly as low as four percent, of examinations observing physical trauma lead to a definitive finding, and those examinations are conducted immediately after the abusive event.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Heather Lampe examined Brianna. Lampe recounted for the jury Brianna's description of the abuse: \"My grandpa put his middle in my middle. He did it at his house. He did it a lot of times. He unbuttoned his pants and pulled down his underwear, he unbuttoned my pants and pulled down my underwear. Told me don't tell anybody. It felt weird.\" Lampe also testified that Brianna indicated that the abuse was painful. Lampe testified that during the physical examination she observed a notch in Brianna's hymen and described the notch as a nonspecific finding that could have been caused by the abuse Brianna described but also could have been caused by a nontraumatic event.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Perez's sisters\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The State called two of Perez's younger sisters, Stacy and Tina, to testify to their allegations of his sexual abuse of them when the sisters were young children. Perez's counsel objected to their testimony as improper extraneous-offense evidence, and a hearing was held outside the presence of the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Stacy and Tina each described the small home in which their family, of which Perez was the oldest of seven children, lived in Monterrey, Mexico, in the 1960s. Both women described how Perez, the oldest of the seven children, shared an upstairs room with a brother and that the women would regularly clean as part of their chores.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Stacy is fifteen to twenty years younger than Perez and described an incident that took place when she was no older than seven or eight years old, in the mid- to late-1960s. Stacy testified,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   What I remember is that I would lay down and be looking at the floor, but he would be over me. I would remember his breathing and ... he was breathing really hard and I remember the pressure of my panties were on my ankles and his - - I guess he had pulled them down and - - and he had his thing in between my legs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   She clarified that his \"thing\" was his penis and that the area between her legs was her vagina, but could not remember if his penis penetrated her vagina. Stacy testified that she pretended she was not there and that she did not understand what was happening. She did not recall it happening again, but she did recall another instance after the family moved to Wichita Falls in 1970 when Perez picked her up \"so [she] was like straddled to him\" and she said, \"[N]o, no you ain't going to do this here. You're not going to do this here.\" She said that he put her down when she said that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Although the incident between Stacy and Perez was never reported to authorities, Stacy testified that she spoke to one of her sisters about the incident and her sister's response was, \"[N]ot you too.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In fact, Tina testified at trial, \"[Perez] would have intercourse with myself and my other sisters.\" She described how she and her sisters would go upstairs to clean the room that Perez shared with a brother and Perez would force them to lie down on the bed, and he would have sex with them. She also alleged that Perez would sometimes make her touch his penis and would come to her bed and fondle her while she pretended to sleep. She testified, \"It was something that was constantly happening all the time,\" and that, at the time, she did not understand what was going on. She described it as \"[d]isgusting.\" She testified that she did not tell anyone about his sexual abuse because he was the oldest sibling and they were taught to respect him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The trial court overruled Perez's objections to Stacy's and Tina's testimony as improper extraneous-offense evidence, finding that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to believe that the incidents of abuse took place and that its probative value was not outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice. Stacy and Tina each repeated their testimony for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Jennifer Edwards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The State sought to call Jennifer Edwards, a licensed sex-offender treatment provider, as an expert witness, and Perez objected. A hearing was held outside the jury's presence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Edwards testified to her education and background, including her 21 years of experience working for an agency that treated only sex offenders, as a forensic interviewer at a children's advocacy center, and as a forensic interviewer for Rockwall County. She described her review of and reliance on research such as peer-reviewed journals regarding sex-offender treatment. She testified that she treated \"thousands\" of sex offenders over the years. Edwards testified that, at the time of trial, she had a private therapy practice in McKinney where she treated a variety of people, some with \"average issues\" such as depression, anxiety, and marital issues, but the majority being sex offenders. Edwards testified that through her education and experience, she had learned common characteristics of perpetrators and victims, including the type of power and control that exists in such a relationship and the difficulties children have testifying in court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On cross-examination, Edwards admitted that she had not evaluated Perez and did not intend to talk about Perez specifically in her testimony. Edwards also admitted that there is no recognized profile of a sex offender, but that she would instead be discussing \"some common characteristics in behavior and thought.\" Edwards further testified that she would be providing \"general jury education about basically what to look for because what we learn through the media is very inaccurate.\" She detailed the categories of behavior she expected to talk about, such as \"minimizing an offense, making excuses or\n   justifying an offense, using ... power play over the victim, thoughts of self pity[,] ... grooming.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Perez's counsel objected to Edwards's testimony on the basis that it was not relevant because she could not tie her testimony to Perez specifically, relying upon the case of\n   <em>\n    Williams v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10008152\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/895/363/\">\n    895 S.W.2d 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex. Crim. App. 1994). The trial court overruled Perez's objection and explained that it felt the case of\n   <em>\n    Duckett v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9990253\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/797/906/\">\n    797 S.W.2d 906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex. Crim. App. 1990), was more closely aligned with the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In front of the jury, Edwards made it clear that her testimony was not intended to determine Perez's guilt, but to provide \"general education about sex offender and ... child sexual abuse dynamics.\" She explained that sex offenders come from all kinds of backgrounds, socioeconomic classes, ages, and professions, and can be married or not. She testified that 97-98% of child sexual abuse victims know their perpetrators because sex offenders are able to plan their access to the victim, manipulate the victim, and maintain a close relationship with the victim to keep the abuse secret. She testified that incest is common among sexual abusers and that it is \"very common\" for sex offenders to take risks with children, even when other children or adults are around. Edwards testified that abusing the child when other family members are nearby \"sends a message from the perpetrator that I am all powerful, I can do what I want whenever I want and wherever I want.\" Edwards testified that she has encountered alibis by perpetrators that things were \"misconstrued, that the child didn't understand what was happening or ... just said it was one thing because they didn't know the word for the thing that was happening.\" Edwards also testified that a sex offender can be emboldened when they are not caught early on and that she had cases where the abuse was multigenerational.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Edwards also testified to general characteristics of child abuse victims. She said that it was \"incredibly common\" for children to refrain from telling someone about the abuse until it had been going on for some time and that a child might disclose a little bit about the abuse to a parent, gauge the parent's reaction, and then decide if they want to disclose more. She explained that this can be due to a sense of confusion the child may have about the abuse, especially if the abuser is someone they have a close relationship with. Edwards also affirmed that she has encountered children who try to block abusive events from their mind and that some adults do not disclose child sexual abuse until decades after the events. She also testified that it was \"very common\" for children to, a couple of years after the abuse took place, remember some details vividly and other details not as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   When given the hypothetical of children who see their abuser several times a week or at family gatherings and to whom other family members are deferential, Edwards testified,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Somebody who is held in high regard within the family, it's less likely that the child is going to make an outcry. Children are - - you know, again, their level of awareness about many things is far beyond what we realize and often children will be concerned that they will disrupt the family dynamics, that everybody will be upset, everybody will be angry, whether they're believed or not believed, they just know this is ... a bomb, they understand that and what a big deal this is. And so certainly if that person is held in high regard, the concern the child has about not being believed is exponentially greater....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Edwards also explained how sex abuse can escalate, beginning with grooming and then progressing to sexual acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Edwards also testified that she had never personally encountered an instance where more than one child lied about sexual abuse allegedly committed by the same perpetrator.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   On cross-examination, Edwards confirmed that it would be \"wrong\" for the jury to interpret her testimony as evidence of Perez's guilt. And she confirmed that there is no real profile of a typical sex offender and that she never met with or evaluated Perez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The jury's charge and verdict\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In the jury charge, the trial court included the following limiting instruction regarding extraneous-offense testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   During the trial, you heard evidence that the defendant may have committed wrongful acts not charged in the indictment. The State offered the evidence for any bearing the evidence has on relevant matters, including the character of the defendant and acts performed in conformity with the character of the defendant, absence of mistake or accident, motive, and intent. You are not to consider the evidence at all unless you find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant did, in fact, commit the wrongful act. Those of you who believe the defendant did the wrongful act beyond a reasonable doubt may consider it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Even if you do find that the defendant committed a wrongful act, you may consider this evidence only for the limited purpose previously described. You may not consider this evidence to prove that the defendant is a bad person and for this reason was likely to commit the charged offense. In other words, you should consider this evidence only for the specific, limited, purposes described above.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The jury found Perez guilty of counts 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6; it found him not guilty of counts 2 and 7. After a punishment hearing, the jury assessed life sentences for counts 1 and 5 (aggravated sexual assault) and 20-year sentences for counts 3, 4, and 6 (indecency with a child). This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Perez brings three points on appeal. His first two points relate to the trial court's admission of Stacy's and Tina's testimony to Perez's alleged abuse of them as children in the 1960s. His third point argues that the trial court erred by admitting Edwards's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Extraneous-offense testimony by Stacy and Tina\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Article 38.37 statutorily expands the admissibility of extraneous-offense evidence in a trial involving certain offenses against children, including the sex offenses at issue here. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.37, \u00a7 1(a)(1)(A), (B) (West 2018). Section 1(b) of the article applies to evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts committed by the defendant against the child who is the victim of the alleged offense.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9990253\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/797/906/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1(b). Section 2, on the other hand, is not limited to evidence of offenses committed against the child who is the victim in the immediate prosecution:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Notwithstanding Rules 404 and 405, Texas Rules of Evidence, and subject to Section 2-a, evidence that the defendant has committed a separate offense described\n   by Subsection (a)(1) or (2)\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   may be admitted ... for any bearing the evidence has on relevant matters, including the character of the defendant and acts performed in conformity with the character of the defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Sec. 2-a. Before evidence described by Section 2 may be introduced, the trial judge must:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   (1) determine that the evidence likely to be admitted at trial will be adequate to support a finding by the jury that the defendant committed the separate offense beyond a reasonable doubt; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   (2) conduct a hearing out of the presence of the jury for that purpose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9990253\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/797/906/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 2-2-a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Section 2 is at issue in this case. The trial court held two hearings outside the presence of the jury, one to evaluate Stacy's testimony and a second to evaluate Tina's, and found that each woman's testimony was adequate to allow the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Perez sexually abused them as children. The trial court also conducted a rule 403 balancing test and determined that the probative value of their testimony was not outweighed by any unfairly prejudicial nature thereof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Perez's first point argues that article 38.37 is facially unconstitutional; his second point argues that the trial court erred by admitting Stacy's and Tina's testimony under article 38.37. We overrule both points for the reasons discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Constitutionality of article 38.37, section 2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   We review the constitutionality of a statute in light of the presumption of the statute's validity and presume that the legislature did not act unreasonably or arbitrarily in enacting the statute.\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Granviel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9942849\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/561/503/#p511\">\n    561 S.W.2d 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 511 (Tex.

As we observed in\n   <em>\n    Mosier\n   </em>\n   , remoteness is a factor we must consider, as a substantial gap in time between the occurrence of extraneous offenses-especially those in which a final conviction was not obtained-and the charged offense will weaken the probative value of the extraneous-offense evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9 (citing\n   <em>\n    Bachhofer v.

The girls' mothers testified to their outcries of the abuse, and Jennifer testified to her observation of Brianna's \"puffed\" breast after they returned from Perez's home. The SANEs testified to both girls' descriptions of the abuse. And both SANEs testified to their observations of notches in each girl's hymen that, although not conclusively indicative of abuse, were consistent with their descriptions of the abuse. We disagree with the State's assertion that it needed Stacy's and Tina's testimony because it lacked any \"physical evidence or eye-witness testimony\" to corroborate Ana's and Brianna's testimony, especially in light of the 50 years that passed in between the alleged events and the complete lack of corroborating evidence to support Stacy's and Tina's testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mosier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202375768\">\n    2017 WL 2375768\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11.

They also had the benefit of testimony by the girls' mothers, the forensic interviewer, and the SANEs to the girls' descriptions of the abuse. The girls' drawings made during the forensic interview were also admitted into evidence-drawings that said \"[Ana] is sad\" and \"my [grandpa] put [his middle] par[t] in my [middle] par[t],\" depicted Perez's \"[b]alls,\" his \"[p]ee[p]ee,\" and his tongue, and depicted him lying in bed with Ana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Even so, the State inexplicably felt compelled to emphasize the alleged abuse of Stacy and Tina repeatedly during its closing arguments. The prosecutor first mentioned that Stacy, Tina, Ana, and Brianna were all prepubescent female family members when the abuse took place. He then mentioned the sisters' demeanors when they testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   You also heard from [Tina], the Defendant's oldest sister that testified, and you can look at her demeanor. You saw how she was more calm and reserved, very matter of fact about what had happened. And then you compare that to [Stacy], the Defendant's other sister who also testified. If you recall, [Stacy] testified about abuse that happened nearly 50 years ago. And what did she say she remembered to this day? She can still feel his hot breath on her neck. And you saw [Stacy], a woman in her mid-50s break down as she tried to detail what she went through at the hands of this Defendant, her own brother.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   And then in his final closing argument and in response to Perez's counsel's assertion that the sisters never reported the abuse, the prosecutor pointed out that Stacy did outcry when she was young by telling her mother and her sister what happened. The prosecutor then said,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   I was also struck by something defense counsel said, not just in its closing arguments a few minutes ago, but also in his opening arguments to begin the case. He said all this was, once you take away the medical evidence was a he said, she said case. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a he said, she said, she said, she said, she said case. Four victims testified to the abuse that this Defendant did to them.\n   <strong>\n    Two of those victims are the ones who you're going to have to decide whether or not they were telling the truth when they testified.\n   </strong>\n   [Emphasis added.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   We find this last sentence especially troubling. It essentially directs the jury that they do not have to evaluate Stacy's and Tina's credibility-a direct contradiction of the trial court's instruction that the jury\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   find beyond a reasonable doubt that the extraneous offenses actually occurred before it can consider the evidence for any reason.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ware v.

The jury absolutely had to weigh Stacy's and Tina's credibility before it considered their testimony as evidence of propensity or character, or for any other reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The prosecutor also emphasized in his final closing argument that the jury could consider Stacy's testimony for any bearing it had on relevant matters, including character conformity. He then emphasized the similarities between Stacy, Tina, Ana, and Brianna in that they were all \"prepubescent female family members over whom\n   the Defendant had some degree of power and control.\" He continued,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   You heard her testify that it was a family secret, that he would have her lay down, he would be behind her and that 50 years later she can still remember his breath on her neck. That's a sensory detail right there. And what did she say? She said it was a family secret, that when it happened she would pretend she wasn't there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   You then heard from another one of the Defendant's sisters, [Tina]. She said that she was deferent to the Defendant and basically treated him like you would a parent whenever her parents were away. You would hear how he sneaks into her bed at night while she pretends to be asleep and he puts his fingers in her vagina. You then heard how he would get on top of her, face-to-face in that upstairs shack room and penetrate her vagina with his penis. When asked how it felt, she said it was disgusting. What did the Defendant say? You better not tell anyone. Manipulation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   And what did both [Stacy] and [Tina] testify to? That when their brother went into the Army, they said they were relieved. Not concerned that their brother might be sent to an area to face combat, they were relieved because he wouldn't be around anymore.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   Plato said, \"The true measure of a man is what he does with power.\" And we've seen what the Defendant does with power. The power he had over his two younger sisters, the power he had over his two granddaughters here in Wichita Falls. Instead of fond memories of their older brother, instead of fond memories of grandpa, they're going to remember sodomy, oral sex, incest, vaginal intercourse with a blood relative.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Later, the prosecutor asked the jury, \"What would be the motive for [Brianna] and [Ana] and [Stacy] and [Tina] to testify untruthfully?\" He asserted that the defense had not established any motive for the four of them to lie, and argued, \"[I]t wasn't as if the Defendant didn't have a chance to tell you. He got up on the witness stand. He never said why this wouldn't be true.\" And finally, the prosecutor ended his argument as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   Ladies and gentlemen, I would submit to you, sexual predators are ... wolves in ... sheep's clothing. And there's a wolf in this room right now and he's sitting right here. This is a wolf who began to prey on his own family in Monterrey, Mexico, and then preyed on his granddaughters here in Wichita Falls. But today it ends. Today it ends when you say we believe you [Brianna]. Today it ends when you say we believe you [Ana] that these things happened. And when you come back with those seven verdicts of guilty, you're not going to be telling this wolf anything he doesn't already know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   We find the State's emphasis in closing on Stacy's and Tina's testimony troubling, especially in light of the substantial other evidence the State had at its disposal.

Even though the majority of Edwards's testimony was to the former category, Perez's argument does not complain of her testimony in this respect. Because Perez has not challenged the testimony regarding the characteristics of sexually abused children, he has forfeited any argument about it on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. R.

Specifically, Perez argues that Edwards's testimony was inadmissible because she had not personally evaluated Perez, she had not performed any actuarial tests of Perez, she acknowledged that there is no profile of a \"typical\" sex offender, and she admitted that she had \"nothing specific\" to tell the jury about the case. According to Perez, \"[t]he record is completely devoid of any attempt to make a connection between her general 'jury education' testimony and the specifics of this case.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Perez relies primarily upon\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   to support his argument.

The trial court agreed that\n   <em>\n    Duckett\n   </em>\n   applied, and we agree\n   with the trial court. In\n   <em>\n    Duckett\n   </em>\n   , a prosecution for indecency with a child, a certified social worker and advanced clinical practitioner testified as an expert witness to the phases experienced by child victims of sexual abuse, and then he applied those phases to the particulars of the case.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9990253\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/797/906/\">\n    797 S.W.2d at 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court of criminal appeals held that the testimony was admissible: \"[I]f a qualified expert offers to give testimony on whether the reaction of one child is similar to the reaction of most victims of familial child abuse, and if believed this would assist the jury in deciding whether an assault occurred, it may be admitted....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9990253\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/797/906/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9990253\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/797/906/\">\n    at 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In support of its holding, the court of criminal appeals observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   The expert's testimony here encompassed at least one specialized view concerning the process through which a child may encounter and deal with an abusive situation. The record does not reflect the jury was of such composition that the knowledge was elementary or commonplace.

She also testified that it is very common for child sexual abuse victims to know their perpetrators, for sex offenders to take risks with children even with other children or adults around, and for the abusive relationship to be incestuous. She also testified that, in her experience, perpetrators of sexual abuse have tried to explain away allegations by alleging that things were \"misconstrued\" or that a child did not understand what was happening. And she testified that a sex offender can be emboldened if they are able to successfully abuse a child without being caught. These characteristics have direct connections to this case-Perez knew Ana and Brianna, his grandchildren, and any sexual abuse was incestuous by its nature, the abuse the children described occurred with other family members nearby, and Perez attempted to counter their allegations by explaining them as misconstructions or that the children simply did not understand what was happening.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   So contrary to Perez's assertion otherwise, Edwards's testimony was sufficiently linked to the facts of this case.
