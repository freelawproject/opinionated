We also conclude that the trial court did not err by imposing civil penalties against LRO for each mailer sent to consumers. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 LRO is a California based company that solicits business in a number of jurisdictions, including Washington. LRO engages in the sale of goods and services, including marketing and selling copies of real property deeds. It is registered as a foreign limited liability company in Washington and has a mailbox at a United Parcel Service store in Olympia. Roberto Romero and his wife, Laura Romero, own, manage, and operate LRO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I. THE MAILERS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 In 2012, LRO began sending mailers to Washington consumers who had either recently purchased or refinanced a home. LRO also sent similar mailers to consumers in other states. In its mailer, LRO offered its product, a copy of the consumer's property deed, \"the only document that identifies [you] as the property owner of [your home] by a recently recorded transferred title on the property\" and a \"property profile\" that provided\n   the \"property address, owner's name, comparable values, and legal description or parcel identification number, property history, neighborhood demographics, public and private schools report.\" Clerk's Papers (CP0 at 24. LRO charged $89 for its product. A copy of the mailer envelope follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   CP at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 The envelope contained LRO's two page mailer. It had no graphics or logos, only text.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The first page listed LRO's Olympia address at the top of the page and, underneath, the consumer's name, address, and a barcode.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A copy of the first page follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   CP at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b66 Underneath the disclaimer was a detachable coupon. The coupon included a \"PROPERTY ID NO.,\" a reference to the $89 \"SERVICE FEE,\" a \"PLEASE RESPOND BY\" date, and \"CHECK NO.\" CP at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b67 The second page of the mailer contained a list of largely irrelevant legal definitions related to real property and property ownership. Near the bottom of the page, a fourth disclaimer read in the same type:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   DISCLAIMER: * Local Records Office is not affiliated with any State or the United States or the County Records. Local Records Office is an analysis and retrieval firm that uses multiple resources that provide supporting values, deeds, and evidence that is used to execute a property reports [sic] and deliver a requested deed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Local Records Office is not affiliated with the county in which your deed is filed in, nor affiliated with any government agencies. This offer serves as a soliciting for\n   services and not to be interpreted as bill due.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   CP at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b68 LRO tracked the total number of mailings, complaints, stop payment requests, and refund requests it received, but did not track information as to customer satisfaction with its product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b69 Between June 2012 and February 2016, LRO mailed 256,998 solicitations to Washington consumers. Nine thousand six hundred ninety-five Washington consumers purchased LRO's product, a 3.9 percent response rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b610 During this time, the State received numerous complaints regarding LRO's solicitations. Numerous government offices, media outlets, and consumer watchdog agencies nationwide disseminated consumer alerts regarding LRO's mailer, many of which characterized the mailer as a scam.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   II. THE LAWSUIT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b611 In November 2013, the State filed a lawsuit against LRO and the Romeros, alleging a violation of the Consumer\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Protection Act (CPA).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two years later, the State moved for summary judgment. It argued that LRO's mailer was a deceptive act that created a net impression that it was from a government agency or was a bill consumers had to pay. The State further argued that no material issues of fact were in dispute, and that the only disputed issue involved a question of law. The issue was whether LRO's mailer was unfair or deceptive. The State requested that LRO be enjoined from their allegedly deceptive practices and moved for restitution, civil penalties, and attorney fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b612 LRO filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment. It argued that, as a matter of law, LRO's mailer was not a bill and was not deceptive in that regard; neither LRO's envelope nor mailer as a whole resembled a mailing from a government agency or title company; and, that the disclaimers LRO used were sufficient to counter any net impression that the mailer was a bill or from a government agency or title company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b613 The State supported its motion with 25 declarations from Washington consumers who received LRO's mailer. Some consumers stated that the timing of the mailer coupled with the \"official looking\" envelope and the Olympia address made it seem like it demanded attention and came from a government organization. CP at 625. Some stated that, upon receiving the mailer, they believed there was a problem with their property transaction. Others believed the mailer either came from a government agency or was a bill. Some believed that the sender would penalize them for failing to pay $89. Consumers also stated that the \"respond by\" date created a sense of urgency to comply. Even after reading the mailer and its disclaimers in full, some believed the mailer was suspicious, and that LRO was attempting to mislead or deceive homeowners. Others declared that only after paying and receiving a \"very unofficial looking property profile\" from LRO did they realize they were \"scammed\" and they asked for a refund. CP at 635, 638, 649.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b614 The State also submitted evidence that deeds were typically one to two pages in length, and that, by law, the Auditor's Office charged nominal amounts for certified and non-certified copies of deeds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   It also submitted evidence that companies such as HouseFax.com offered detailed property profile reports for free and charged $19 thereafter for additional reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b615 Additionally, the State submitted evidence of enforcement actions or settlements multiple other states entered into with LRO regarding the same or similar deceptive conduct. It also submitted evidence that in 2011, Romero voluntarily surrendered his California real estate license to settle an action by the California Department of Real Estate which alleged \"misrepresentations\" and \"fraud and/or dishonest dealing[s]\" with consumers. CP at 415.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b616 Both parties supported their motions with their respective experts' reports and\n   deposition testimony. The State retained Dr. Anthony Pratkanis, a psychology professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Pratkanis taught courses in social psychology, research methods, consumer psychology, marketing management, and buyer behavior. His primary area of research and study involved social influence and belief formation, including deceptive advertising and sales practices. He published numerous books and articles on these topics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b617 Pratkanis reviewed the consumer declarations and complaints, consumer alerts from various government authorities, LRO's mailer, and LRO's response rate. Citing to studies and articles, Pratkanis opined that the response rate for LRO's mailers in Washington was \"two to three times the expected rate of average response for comparable mailers.\" CP at 353. He noted that LRO's mailer enjoyed a high response rate, even though it failed to use many of the most effective methods used in direct mail to increase response rates, \"such as offering free gifts and free trials, providing money-saving offers, highlighting testimonials concerning the value of the product, and featuring prominently money-back guarantees of satisfaction.\" CP at 353. As to the significance of complaint rates, he cited to a number of studies and opined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   In general, consumers do not often complain even when dissatisfied with a purchase and rarely complain to third parties such as the government. ... When confronted with a defective service or product, the two most common responses by consumers ... is to (a) do nothing or (b) take private action such as quit purchasing the product or engage in negative word of mouth of the product.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   CP at 370.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b618 Pratkanis opined that LRO engaged in a deceptive sales practice by leading consumers to believe they received a bill from a government agency or a title company, or that they needed to have a copy of a deed to prove ownership of their home. In reaching his opinion, Pratkanis used established theories, his knowledge of influence tactics, and the science of consumer behaviors and social influence. While he did not conduct an independent survey or focus group, he conducted a \"social influence analysis\" by reviewing the mailer and the influence tactics LRO used. CP at 993. In its response to the State's motion, LRO objected to Pratkanis's opinion, arguing that it was \"demonstrably unscientific\" and \"not admissible under ER 702.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   CP at 1009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b619 LRO retained Dr. Albert Bruno, a marketing professor at Santa Clara University. Bruno taught courses in marketing, marketing research, and marketing strategy. Bruno opined that LRO's response rate was not necessarily an indication of a deceptive marketing strategy. He further noted that LRO's complaint rate was \"relatively low\" and that Pratkanis failed to review the complaint rate and refund requests. CP at 1048.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b620 Bruno further opined that LRO's mailer actually did a poor job of engaging potential consumers. He did not address the composition of LRO's mailer in his report, but testified during his deposition that the mailer had a \"flat\" effect and that it could be \"enhanced.\" CP at 446. He opined that LRO's complaint rate was significantly lower than would generally be expected for such a mailer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b621 In response to why some consumers had to go to their escrow officer for further clarification regarding LRO's mailer, Bruno stated that \"it takes all kinds\" and that the government could not protect against every individual who misinterpreted the mailer. CP at 893. He stated, \"It kind of says a population is made up of very smart people who don't read, very dumb people that can't read, and people that get confused every second of the day by everything.\" CP at 893. Bruno also did not conduct focus groups. He did not review any consumer complaints or consumer alerts in reaching his opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b622 The trial court partially granted the State's motion, denied LRO's motion, and permanently enjoined LRO from engaging in any other deceptive practices. The court ruled that, as a matter of law, LRO's mailer\n   was unfair and deceptive because it had the capacity to deceive a substantial portion of the public.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   It specified that LRO \"created the deceptive net impression\" that its mailer was \"from a governmental agency or was a bill that Washington consumers were obligated to respond to or pay.\" CP at 1182-83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The court also ruled that the State proved all elements of a CPA violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   III. CIVIL PENALTIES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b623 At a later hearing, the trial court heard argument on civil penalties. The State argued that the court should impose a $10 penalty for each of the mailers sent that did not result in a purchase, and $89 for each of the mailers sent that did result in a purchase. LRO argued that ordering both restitution and civil penalties was excessive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b624 Both parties cited to\n   <em>\n    United States v. Reader's Digest Association, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1185535\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/662/955/\">\n    662 F.2d 955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3rd Cir. 1981), which outlined five factors that a trial court may use to determine the penalty amount. The trial court stated that it would consider the factors, but it was not bound by them. The court noted that the maximum penalty allowed by statute would be roughly $23 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b625 The trial court imposed a $2,569,980 penalty against LRO. The court reached that amount by assessing a $10 penalty for each of LRO's 256,998 solicitations mailed to Washington consumers between June 2012 and February 2016. In selecting a single penalty amount for all solicitations, the trial court chose not to distinguish between consumers who accepted LRO's offer and those who did not. The court reasoned that regardless of the outcome, \"the unfair and deceptive act ... happened when the Defendants mailed out the mailer.\" RP (Mar. 16, 2016) at 67. The court found that LRO did not submit evidence of its inability to pay any imposed penalties, and further reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   This civil penalty will eliminate any benefits derived by the Defendants from their deceptive practices, and also will vindicate the authority of the [CPA] to protect Washington consumers from unfair and deceptive acts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [T]he Court also finds that Defendants ... acted in bad faith. The acts and practices described herein were not isolated instances of misjudgment, but rather, an intentional and deliberate\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   practice perpetuated between June 2012 and February 2016. Defendants' violations caused substantial injury to the public and as early as 2013 Defendants were put on notice by Plaintiff that the [LRO] solicitation had the capacity to deceive. Defendants nevertheless continued to disseminate thousands of solicitations in Washington.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   CP at 1308.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b626 The trial court entered a judgment for the State and ordered LRO to pay restitution and attorney fees and costs, in addition to civil penalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b627 LRO appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   I. SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b628 LRO argues that the trial court erred by granting the State summary judgment by concluding, as a matter of law, that its mailer was deceptive and in violation of the CPA because it had the capacity to deceive a substantial portion of the public. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   A.

LRO' S MAILER HAD THE CAPACITY TO DECEIVE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE PUBLIC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b639 LRO argues that the State failed to establish that LRO's mailer had the capacity to deceive a substantial portion of the public that the mailer was from a government agency. It argues that the State failed to quantify the alleged deception or establish that the mailer would likely deceive reasonable consumers. LRO's argument flows from the mistaken premise that capacity to deceive under the CPA is a question of fact. Again, the trial court properly analyzed the issue as a question of law. LRO's arguments therefore misconstrue the CPA and the State's burden of proof. LRO's interpretation that the CPA requires the State to show intent to deceive, or to prove actual deceit, is incorrect. We reject as irrelevant LRO's assertion that, as a factual matter, the mailer was not deceptive. Our sole task is to determine whether, as a matter of law, LRO's mailer has the capacity to deceive a substantial portion of the public. We conclude that it does. i. LRO' S MAILER CONVEYED A NET IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS FROM A GOVERNMENT AGENCY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b640 The undisputed facts are as follows: LRO sent the mailer in this case to over 200,000 consumers, generating over 9,000 paid responses. There is no question that the mailers reached a substantial portion of the public. Numerous consumers complained that they believed the mailer was from a governmental agency or a bill they were required to pay. In their declarations, the consumers stated that the \"respond by\" date also created a sense of urgency to comply. Some consumers, even after reading the mailer and its disclaimers, felt like LRO attempted to mislead homeowners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b641 The State need only show that the act or practice of sending LRO's mailer \"had the capacity to deceive a substantial portion of the public.\"\n   <em>\n    Panag\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4001497\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/166/27/#p47\">\n    166 Wash.2d at 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=204%20P.3d%20885\">\n    204 P.3d 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As the State's expert testified,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   the mailer in\n   this case repeatedly featured the official-sounding name of the sender-\"Local Records Office\"-and contained the prominent banner reading \"County Public Information.\" The mailer appeared governmental in its formatting and language. It bore a return address of the same city as the seat of our state government. The envelope referenced the United States code. After reviewing the record, we agree that as a matter of law the mailer in this case had the capacity to deceive. Based on the net impression conveyed by the mailer, an ordinary consumer could reasonably have been misled to believe it was a government document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b644 LRO argues that the consumer declarations submitted by the State did not establish the mailer's capacity to deceive a substantial portion of the public. It argues that the declarations only showed that consumers who skimmed through the mailer and assumed it was from a government agency were not \"reasonable\" consumers. Br. of Appellant at 26. Again, these arguments misconstrue the issue at bar as a factual question. It is not. Establishing the speed at which so-called \"reasonable\" consumers read their mail is not part of the \"unfair or deceptive\" legal analysis under the CPA. Nor is the State required to establish whether consumers were actually deceived.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   This argument is irrelevant and falsely premised on LRO's argument that we are making a factual determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b645 LRO also argues that the State failed to quantify the alleged deception. Br. of Appellant at 25-26. It argues that over 96 percent of the mailer's recipients did not respond to the mailer and that the State received few complaints relative to the number of mailers sent. Br. of Appellant at\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   25. Again, LRO's argument misses the point. Even assuming LRO's factual assertions are accurate, they are irrelevant to whether the State has met its burden under the CPA. The State is not required to prove actual deception nor to quantify the exact number of consumers that were deceived.\n   <em>\n    Kaiser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4014235\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/161/705/#p719\">\n    161 Wash.App. at 719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=254%20P.3d%20850\">\n    254 P.3d 850\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   ii. LRO' S MAILER CONVEYED A NET IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS A BILL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b646 LRO argues that the State failed to establish that LRO's mailer had the capacity to deceive a substantial portion of the public that it was a bill. LRO asserts that the State did not adequately support its assertion that the mailer's inclusion of personalized information, a reply coupon, and the phrase \"Please Respond By\" were \"elements ... common to bills and not solicitations.\" Br. of Appellant at 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b647 Once again, LRO's argument incorrectly frames the issue on appeal as a factual question of evidentiary sufficiency. As discussed above, whether the mailer had the capacity to deceive is a question of law. Based on the undisputed facts, we conclude that the net impression the mailer conveyed had the capacity to deceive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b648 LRO focuses on a few aspects of the mailer to argue that the State failed to prove that the mailer looked like a bill. LRO misconstrues the State's burden. As a matter of law, the State only needed to show that LRO's mailer had the capacity to deceive, not that it had \"elements common to bills and not solicitations.\" Br. of Appellant at 33. Moreover, LRO's selective focus on certain characteristics is inconsistent with established case law. Under the CPA, a deceptive act or practice is measured by the \" 'net impression' \" on a reasonable consumer.\n   <em>\n    Panag\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4001497\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/166/27/#p47\">\n    166 Wash.2d at 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=204%20P.3d%20885\">\n    204 P.3d 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Cyberspace.Com LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3336776\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/453/1196/#p1200\">\n    453 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1200 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b649 The mailer in this case could have been reasonably mistaken for a bill. The State's expert opined that the mailer mimicked a bill by including: the recipient's per\n   sonalized information; reply coupon; the frequent presence of the name \"Local Records Office\"; the banner reading \"County Public Information\"; LRO's Olympia address; a specified but artificial deadline; and the second page of the mailer which was filled with largely irrelevant, but authoritative language. The expert also stated that Romero knew consumers were more inclined to respond if he posted a deadline on the mailer, and opined that $89 for a copy of a deed and property profile was not an accurate representation for such documents. Citing to studies, the expert further opined that the \"Please Respond\" message created a sense of urgency to respond-\"rush[ing] the consumer into compliance,\" CP at 356,-and that such deadlines increased the probability of response. He concluded that, given the mailer's features, the use of an artificial deadline was a deceptive strategy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b650 After reviewing the record, we agree. The particular mailer in this case was deceptive because it had the capacity to convince reasonable consumers that it was a bill the consumer had to pay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   iii. THE DISCLAIMERS DID NOT CURE THE POTENTIAL FOR DECEPTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b651 Lastly, LRO argues that its \"conspicuous\" disclaimers countered any of the mailer's misleading impressions. Br. of Appellant at 35-38. The State argues that LRO's disclaimers are insufficient to cure the mailers' capacity for deception. Again, we agree with the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b652 Washington and federal courts have recognized that disclosures or disclaimers \"do not always cure the potential for deception.\"\n   <em>\n    Mandatory Poster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12452500\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/199/506/#p520\">\n    199 Wash.App. at 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=398%20P.3d%201271\">\n    398 P.3d 1271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Panag\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4001497\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/166/27/#p47\">\n    166 Wash.2d at 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=204%20P.3d%20885\">\n    204 P.3d 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Cyberspace.Com\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3336776\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/453/1196/#p1200\">\n    453 F.3d at 1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
