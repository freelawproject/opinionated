Accordingly, we affirm the limited judgment in favor of plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The relevant facts on remand are undisputed. Plaintiff Kevin Rains fell almost 16 feet to the ground when a defective wood board broke at his job site. He suffered severe injuries that resulted in paraplegia. He brought a claim of strict products liability against the retailer, Stayton Builders Mart, and the manufacturer of the defective board, Weyerhaeuser Company. His wife, plaintiff Mitzi Rains, brought a claim for loss of consortium against those same parties. The jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiffs and found that Kevin had suffered $5,237,700 in economic damages and $3,125,000 in noneconomic damages, and that Mitzi had suffered $1,012,500 in noneconomic damages. The jury also found that Weyerhaeuser was 45 percent at fault, Stayton was 30 percent at fault, and Kevin was 25 percent at fault for his injuries. After trial, Weyerhaeuser moved to reduce each of plaintiffs' noneconomic damages awards to $500,000 based on ORS 31.710(1). The trial court denied that motion, concluding that Article I, section 17, of the Oregon Constitution precluded ORS 31.710(1) from limiting noneconomic damages on plaintiffs' claims. Accordingly, the court, after accounting for Oregon's comparative-fault scheme and the jury's finding that Kevin was 25 percent at fault, entered a limited judgment awarding Kevin\n   $6,272,025 and Mitzi $759,375 against Weyerhaeuser and Stayton.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Weyerhaeuser appealed the limited judgment, asserting, as relevant on remand, that the trial court had erred by not reducing plaintiffs' noneconomic damages awards under ORS 31.710(1) to $500,000. At the time of Weyerhaeuser's appeal, existing case law dictated that the state of the common law in 1857 determined whether Article I, section 17, limited the legislature's authority to alter a cause of action or reduce the amount of a jury award.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Klutschkowski v.

However, it did away with the construct from\n   <em>\n    Smothers\n   </em>\n   that, to determine if the remedy clause guarantees a remedy for a certain claim, courts had to determine whether, at the time that the Oregon Constitution was drafted in 1857, the common law of Oregon recognized a cause of action for the alleged injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smothers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9452399\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/332/83/\">\n    332 Or. at 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9452399\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/332/83/\">\n    23 P.3d 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In addition, the Oregon Trial Lawyers Association (OTLA) appeared as\n   <em>\n    amicus curiae\n   </em>\n   and filed a brief in support of plaintiffs, and the Oregon Liability Reform Coalition and Associated Oregon Industries\n   (collectively AOI) appeared as\n   <em>\n    amicus curiae\n   </em>\n   and filed a joint brief in support of Weyerhaeuser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs acknowledge on remand that\n   <em>\n    Horton\n   </em>\n   foreclosed any argument that Article I, section 17, prohibited application of ORS 31.710(1) to their damages awards. Instead, plaintiffs ask us to affirm the trial court's limited judgment in their favor because, under\n   <em>\n    Horton\n   </em>\n   , the application of ORS 31.710(1) in this case violates the remedy clause of Article I, section 10. In particular, plaintiffs argue that application of ORS 31.710(1) violates the remedy clause in this case because it would leave them without a substantial remedy. OTLA supports plaintiffs' argument and also asserts that ORS 31.710(1) is facially unconstitutional under the remedy clause because it imposes a \"substitute remedy without any regard to the underlying injury\" and fails to provide \"any benefit in exchange for the remedy it purports to limit\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , it does not provide a\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Weyerhaeuser argues that plaintiffs' challenge to ORS 31.710(1) under the remedy clause is precluded because they are raising it for the first time on remand. Alternatively, Weyerhaeuser contends that, even if we consider plaintiffs' alternative basis for affirmance, ORS 31.710(1) does not violate the remedy clause in this case because the statute provides a \"substantial remedy\" to Kevin, and the remedy clause does not apply to Mitzi's loss of consortium claim because \"Oregon law does not recognize a 'property' right to non-pecuniary services, society, and companionship from a spouse.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   WAIVER\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We begin with the threshold question of whether we are precluded from considering\n   plaintiffs' alternative basis for affirmance because they raise it for the first time on remand. Weyerhaeuser asserts that general waiver principles or the \"law of the case\" doctrine preclude our consideration of plaintiffs' remedy clause argument because plaintiffs failed to raise it as an alternative basis for affirmance in their initial briefing on appeal. Before we address the substance of Weyerhaeuser's arguments, we briefly revisit how the parties litigated the noneconomic damages cap below and on appeal.\n   After the jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiffs, Weyerhaeuser moved to reduce the noneconomic damages awarded to plaintiffs to $500,000 based on ORS 31.710(1). Initially, plaintiffs opposed that motion, arguing solely that capping their noneconomic damages would violate Article I, section 17. Later, however, they filed an additional opposition brief that raised the remedy clause in Article I, section 10, and the reexamination clause in Article VII (Amended), section 3, as constitutional impediments to applying the cap. As to the remedy clause, plaintiffs asserted that, under\n   <em>\n    Smothers\n   </em>\n   , a statute could not deny a party a remedy that existed in 1857, and any statute that failed to provide a plaintiff with an adequate substitute remedy violated the constitution. Plaintiffs noted that all three of the constitutional provisions that they had cited in opposition to Weyerhaeuser's motion required an analysis of the historical origins of their causes of action. In plaintiffs' view, the common law recognized causes of action for products liability and loss of consortium, so all three constitutional provisions prohibited application of ORS 31.710(1). The trial court never reached plaintiffs' remedy clause arguments because it denied Weyerhaeuser's motion on the basis of Article I, section 17. After the limited judgment was entered, Weyerhaeuser appealed, assigning error to the trial court's ruling. On appeal, the parties argued about the historical origins of plaintiffs' claims, albeit in the context of Article I, section 17. Plaintiffs did not renew their remedy clause arguments as an alternative basis for affirmance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   With that background in mind, we turn to Weyerhaeuser's argument that the law of the case doctrine precludes our consideration of plaintiffs' remedy clause challenge, and conclude that the doctrine does not apply in this circumstance. The law of the case doctrine establishes that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \" 'when a ruling or decision has been once made in a particular case by an appellate court, while it may be overruled in other cases, it is binding and conclusive both upon the inferior court in any further steps or proceedings in the same litigation and upon the appellate court itself in any subsequent appeal or other proceeding for review.' \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Kennedy v.

Here, no appellate court has made a binding \"ruling or decision\" on whether the remedy clause precludes application of ORS 31.710(1) in this case. As noted, the trial court decided the statutory cap issue on the basis of Article I, section 17, and neither we nor the Supreme Court addressed whether the application of ORS 31.710(1) in this case would violate the remedy clause. Furthermore, plaintiffs are advancing their remedy clause argument on remand, not in a \"subsequent appeal.\" For those reasons, the law of the case doctrine does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Weyerhaeuser's argument based on the \"waiver rule\" is equally unavailing. Weyerhaeuser maintains that plaintiffs waived their remedy clause argument because they failed to raise it as an alternative basis for affirmance in their original briefing on appeal. Weyerhaeuser relies on several federal circuit court cases as establishing a \"waiver rule\" that bars litigation of issues that a party could have raised in an earlier appeal in the case.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Medical Center Pharmacy v.

Accordingly, the purpose of the waiver rule recognized by the federal courts and our Supreme Court is, in large part, based on judicial efficiency concerns.\n   In short, those concerns are not present here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Vasquez\n   </em>\n   , we recently considered a similar argument. 288 Or.App. at 509-10,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=406%20P.3d%20225\">\n    406 P.3d 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case, we exercised our discretion to consider \"right for the wrong reason\" arguments raised for the first time on reconsideration. We noted that it was appropriate to consider an argument made for the first time on reconsideration when the reasons for the waiver rule are not implicated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 510,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=406%20P.3d%20225\">\n    406 P.3d 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We noted that the plaintiffs were not seeking a piecemeal appeal, had not shifted positions on reconsideration, and had raised arguments that were consistent with judicial efficiency.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=406%20P.3d%20225\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus,\n   <em>\n    Vasquez\n   </em>\n   was a \"unique case\" in which we considered right for the wrong reason arguments made for the first time on reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Similarly here, the reasons for the waiver rule identified in\n   <em>\n    Kentner\n   </em>\n   and the federal cases cited by Weyerhaeuser are not in play. It is significant that, in the interim between plaintiffs' initial briefing as respondents on appeal and their supplemental briefing on remand,\n   <em>\n    Horton\n   </em>\n   significantly altered the legal analysis required to determine the constitutionality of statutory damages caps. As we have noted, at the time of Weyerhaeuser's appeal, arguments related to Article I, section 17, and Article I, section 10, both required an analysis of the historical origins of the claims at issue. Accordingly, even if plaintiffs had asserted the remedy clause as an alternative basis to affirm the trial court's ruling, our analysis of that issue would have required us to look at the historical origins of plaintiffs' claims-just as we did in evaluating the parties' arguments under Article I, section 17. Further, it is worth noting that, because\n   <em>\n    Smothers\n   </em>\n   had held that the remedy clause provided no protection for injuries for which no cause of action had existed in 1857, plaintiffs did not have an incentive to raise the remedy clause as an alternative basis for affirmance because, in essence, if their argument failed under Article I, section 17, it was likely to fail under Article I, section 10. Accordingly, we do not consider plaintiffs' attempts to defend the trial court's ruling based on the changed legal landscape as \"seeking a piecemeal appeal\" nor is their alternative basis for affirmance a\n   \"shift in position\" that undermines judicial efficiency. Here, the unique circumstances of the litigation and the significant change of law in between the initial appeal and remand convinces us that consideration of plaintiffs' remedy clause argument is consistent with judicial efficiency and does not run afoul of the waiver rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Because Weyerhaeuser's waiver and law of the case arguments fail, we next consider plaintiffs' remedy clause arguments as an alternative basis to affirm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     State v.

Weyerhaeuser does not dispute that it is appropriate to consider that alternative basis to affirm, and we conclude that it is.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   REMEDY CLAUSE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Before we evaluate whether the remedy clause of Article I, section 10, prohibits application of ORS 31.710(1) to plaintiffs' noneconomic damages awards, we must decide a\n   threshold issue raised by Weyerhaeuser with respect to Mitzi's loss of consortium claim. The remedy clause provides, in part, that \"every man shall have remedy by due course of law for injury done him in his\n   <em>\n    person, property, or reputation\n   </em>\n   .\" Or. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 10 (emphasis added). Weyerhaeuser asserts that Mitzi's claim is not protected by that clause because a loss of consortium claim does not involve an injury to her \"person, property, or reputation.\" In arguing that point, Weyerhaeuser classifies Mitzi's claim as a claim for a \"property right\" to nonpecuniary \"services, society, and companionship.\" In Weyerhaeuser's view, the Supreme Court concluded in\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Juarez v. Windsor Rock Products, Inc.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2522661\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/341/160/\">\n    341 Or. 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2522661\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/341/160/\">\n    144 P.3d 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006), that there is no \"property right\" for such a claim and thus there is no \"injury to property\" for purposes of the remedy clause. In other words, Weyerhaeuser argues that the remedy clause does not apply to Mitzi's loss of consortium claim because her \"property right\" claim is not a claim for injury to property covered by the remedy clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   AOI expands on Weyerhaeuser's argument, contending that a contemporary claim for spousal loss of consortium\n   seeks compensation for injury to a \"relational interest\" not a property interest. AOI argues that\n   <em>\n    Juarez\n   </em>\n   classified aspects of the plaintiffs' claims as \"relational interests\" that are \"not a loss of any property interest for which Article I, section 10, guarantees a remedy.\" Accordingly, AOI concludes that the only damages to Mitzi that are limited by ORS 31.710(1) compensate for the loss of aspects of her relationship with Kevin and, because those \"relational interests\" are not \"property interests,\" they are not protected by the remedy clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Mitzi counters that\n   <em>\n    Juarez\n   </em>\n   is not controlling because it was narrowly decided on the basis of different claims, arguments, and injuries. She also asserts that Weyerhaeuser mischaracterizes the nature of her claim. At the outset, she acknowledges that, historically, a loss of consortium claim was based on the idea that the husband had a \"property right\" to the domestic services of his wife, which included emotional losses such as love, affection, companionship, and sexual relations. However, she contends that her spousal loss of consortium claim seeks recovery for \"emotional harms\" that are regarded as an injury to the person under the contemporary understanding of such claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We begin with\n   <em>\n    Juarez\n   </em>\n   . The plaintiffs in that case were the mother and adult children of a man, Juarez, who had died in an accident at work.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2522661\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/341/160/\">\n    341 Or. at 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2522661\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/341/160/\">\n    144 P.3d 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Moreover,\n   <em>\n    Juarez\n   </em>\n   involved arguments about the validity of a \"common-law\" wrongful death action, the overlay of the workers' compensation exclusive remedy provision, and was reviewed by the Supreme Court based solely on the allegations in the complaint because it involved a dismissal under ORCP 21 A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Third, it appears that the court's brief discussion of whether the plaintiffs had alleged an injury to their \"own lives, limbs, bodies, or reputations\" was limited to the narrow facts of that case. That is to say, given the context of the discussion, we do not understand\n   <em>\n    Juarez\n   </em>\n   to stand for the broad proposition that any claim for \"loss of society, companionship, guidance, and emotional support\" necessarily does not allege an \"injury to person.\" Rather, the court took the limited view, without explanation, that the adult children and parent of the decedent in that case had not alleged an injury to their \"bodies.\" In fact, the court emphasized the limited nature of its holding, emphasizing that, \"[w]e must decide whether\n   <em>\n    these\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs have alleged a claim that the remedy clause * * * protects.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2522661\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/341/160/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2522661\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/341/160/\">\n    at 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2522661\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/341/160/\">\n    144 P.3d 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).

It appears important to the court's ultimate conclusion that the plaintiffs' complaint fell short of alleging \"that they possess any property right that defendant's conduct has infringed\" such as a \"legal interest\" in the decedent's income, his services, or financial assistance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2522661\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/341/160/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2522661\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/341/160/\">\n    at 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2522661\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/341/160/\">\n    144 P.3d 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, we understand the discussion of \"property rights\" in\n   <em>\n    Juarez\n   </em>\n   to focus on the plaintiffs' specific allegations of economic injury (\"loss of services and financial assistance\") and to\n   have concluded that those allegations, and only those allegations, failed to allege a \"property right.\" Left out of that discussion were the plaintiffs' allegations that sought redress of noneconomic harms, such as loss of society or companionship. For those reasons, we do not believe that\n   <em>\n    Juarez\n   </em>\n   requires the conclusion that Mitzi's loss of consortium claim seeks redress for injuries that are not protected by the remedy clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   To the contrary, we agree with Mitzi that, whatever the historical origins of a loss of consortium claim, in modern parlance Mitzi's claim alleges an injury to person that is protected by the remedy clause. Without going into great detail about the historical development of spousal loss of consortium claims, we note that, beginning in the mid-twentieth century, courts began to recognize that the nature of loss of consortium had changed from being primarily an economic injury to being primarily an emotional injury. Jo-Anne M. Baio,\n   <em>\n    Loss of Consortium: A Derivative Injury Giving Rise to a Separate Cause of Action\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20Fordham%20L.%20Rev.%201344\">\n    50 Fordham L.

Dobbs,\n   <em>\n    The Law of Torts\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 310 (2000) (recognizing loss of consortium as a \"species of emotional harm\"). And, although no existing Oregon case explicitly addresses whether a spousal loss of consortium claim is a type of \"injury to person,\" it is analogous to other tort cases that have recognized emotional harm as an injury to person. For example, the Supreme Court recently held that plaintiffs who witnessed the death of a family member, but were not themselves physically injured, could pursue a claim for negligently caused emotional distress.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Philibert v. Kluser\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187446\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/698/\">\n    360 Or. 698\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187446\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/698/\">\n    385 P.3d 1038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). Although a loss of consortium claim seek redress for loss of sexual relations,\n   emotional support, attention and companionship of the injured spouse, which are different in many ways from the shock or fright of losing a family member, both injuries involve a loss of emotional wellbeing. And, both injuries \"are real and of the same essential quality, although the general emotional distress claim may be generated by an immediate shock, while the consortium claim may be generated by a long-term awareness of loss.\" Dobbs,\n   <em>\n    The Law of Torts\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 310 at 841-42. In short, we conclude that, given the nature of a loss of consortium claim and the nature of other claims that are considered bodily injuries, it would be incongruous to conclude that the type of injury suffered by Mitzi is not an \"injury to person\" that is protected by the remedy clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Finally, we consider plaintiffs' argument that reducing their noneconomic damages awards under ORS 31.710(1) is unconstitutional under the remedy clause. We begin with a brief overview of\n   <em>\n    Horton\n   </em>\n   , as well as our recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Vasquez\n   </em>\n   , which applied\n   <em>\n    Horton\n   </em>\n   to ORS 31.710(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Horton\n   </em>\n   , the court identified three general categories of legislation that it had considered in determining the limits that the remedy clause places on the legislature:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \"(1) legislation that did not alter the common-law duty but denies or limits the remedy a person injured as a result of that breach of duty may recover; (2) legislation that sought to adjust a person's rights and remedies as part of a larger statutory scheme that extends benefits to some while limiting benefits to others (a\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   ); (3) legislation that modified common-law duties or eliminated a common-law cause of action when the premises underlying those duties and causes of action have changed.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    Schutz\n   </em>\n   , 288 Or.App. at 486,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=406%20P.3d%2066\">\n    406 P.3d 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing\n   <em>\n    Horton\n   </em>\n   ). In\n   <em>\n    Horton\n   </em>\n   , the court examined its case law regarding those categories and set out some guiding principles for evaluating whether legislative action violated the remedy clause. As noted, the court did away with the idea that the state of the common law in 1857 had anything to do with the constitutionality of legislation challenged under the remedy clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   At this point, we turn to our recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Vasquez\n   </em>\n   because it guides our analysis in this case and answers some of the arguments advanced by the parties. In\n   <em>\n    Vasquez\n   </em>\n   , we concluded that ORS 31.710(1) falls within the first category of cases identified by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Horton\n   </em>\n   . 288 Or.App. at 521,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=406%20P.3d%20225\">\n    406 P.3d 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is, the noneconomic damages cap in ORS 31.710(1) does not alter a common-law duty, but it\n   limits the remedy that a person injured as a result of a breach of that duty may recover. Second, we rejected the argument that ORS 31.710(1) is facially unconstitutional under Article I, section 10.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 522,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=406%20P.3d%20225\">\n    406 P.3d 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
