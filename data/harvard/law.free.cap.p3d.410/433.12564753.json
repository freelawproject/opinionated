Arizona Revised Statutes \u00a7 13-753(B) states the trial court shall order a pretrial ID evaluation in every capital case unless the defendant objects. If an objection is lodged, the defendant waives the right to a pretrial evaluation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 We hold a defendant cannot void his waiver under \u00a7 13-753(B) by later withdrawing his objection. We also hold, however, that a defendant's waiver does not deprive the court of its discretionary authority to order a pretrial ID evaluation if the defendant later requests or consents to one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 In January 2015, Apolinar Altamirano was charged with first degree murder. Following his indictment, the State filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty. In April 2015, the trial court ordered Altamirano to undergo an ID prescreening evaluation pursuant to \u00a7 13-753. Altamirano objected to the evaluation but also stated he did \"not waive his right to raise these issues at a later time, if appropriate, and his refusal to participate in the evaluation [ ] pursuant to the Court's order ... should not be deemed or construed as a waiver of that right.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 In May 2017, more than two years after filing his objection, and only four months before the scheduled trial date, Altamirano filed a motion \"withdraw [ing] his objection to court-ordered testing\" and \"requesting that the statutory requirements of A.R.S. \u00a7 13-753(B) be applied.\" Over the State's objection, the trial court granted the motion. The court concluded that \u00a7 13-753(B) permits Altamirano to reinstate his right to a pretrial ID evaluation by withdrawing his objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 The State filed a special action with the court of appeals, which declined to exercise jurisdiction. The State then filed a petition for review with this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 We granted review because this case involves a legal issue of statewide importance. We have jurisdiction pursuant to article 6, section 5(3), of the Arizona Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 We review the trial court's interpretation of a statute de novo.\n   <em>\n    Parrot v.

Stated another way, under the statute, the court is required to order an ID evaluation; the defendant does not have to request an evaluation, nor is he required to make any showing to obtain one.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12 If the defendant objects to prescreening, he waives his right to a pretrial determination of his intellectual status.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .;\n   <em>\n    Escalante-Orozco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310295\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/254/\">\n    241 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   287 \u00b6 134,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310295\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/254/\">\n    386 P.3d at 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This waiver provision is, by its terms, limited to a defendant's right to obtain a pretrial evaluation; a defendant may still present evidence of his ID status during the penalty phase.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ; \u00a7 13-753(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 13 Altamirano argues that \u00a7 13-753(B) permits him to void any waiver by withdrawing his objection. We disagree. Altamirano's construction of the statute renders the waiver provision meaningless. If, as Altamirano contends, he can withdraw his objection at any time before trial and obtain a pretrial evaluation, there is, effectively, no statutory waiver. \"We presume the legislature did not intend to write a statute that contains a void, meaningless, or futile provision\"; thus, \"[w]hen possible, we interpret statutes to give meaning to every word.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Pitts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1460875\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/178/405/#p407\">\n    178 Ariz. 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 407,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1460875\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/178/405/#p407\">\n    874 P.2d 962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 964 (1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 Accordingly, we conclude that \u00a7 13-753(B) prohibits Altamirano from reinstating his right to a pretrial ID evaluation by withdrawing his objection. And this conclusion is not altered by Altamirano's qualified objection in which he tried to avoid waiver by preserving \"his right to raise these issues at a later time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 15 As noted above, a defendant's waiver under \u00a7 13-753(B) only applies to his\n   <em>\n    right\n   </em>\n   to a pretrial ID determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. The waiver provision does not, however, prohibit the court from ordering an ID evaluation despite a defendant's earlier waiver. Section 13-753(B) authorizes courts in capital cases to order a prescreening determination of a defendant's ID status.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-753(H) (stating that if a \"trial court\n   <em>\n    finds\n   </em>\n   that defendant has an [ID],\" it \"shall dismiss the intent to seek the death penalty,\" and \"shall not impose a sentence of death on the defendant\") (emphasis added). And courts generally have the authority to evaluate a criminal defendant's mental status before trial in both capital and noncapital cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-754 (authorizing a court, unless defendant objects, to order a competency exam in a capital case); A.R.S. \u00a7 13-4503 (stating courts have the authority to order a competency exam in a noncapital case); A.R.S. \u00a7 13-4506 (permitting a court to order an insanity examination).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 16 However, the court's authority to order an examination is not unlimited. Because a defendant has the right to object to an ID evaluation, the court may not order an examination unless the defendant either requests or consents to the examination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 14. Additionally, in making a post-waiver determination, the court must consider whether ordering an evaluation would prejudice the state or the victims. Such prejudice includes, but is not limited to, whether the evaluation would require the court to continue an existing trial date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. Const. art. 2, \u00a7 2.1 (A)(10) (stating the\n   victim has a right \"[t]o a speedy trial ... and prompt and final conclusion of the case\"). Moreover, if the court, after considering all the above factors, decides to deny the defendant's request, the defendant may still offer evidence of his ID status during the penalty phase. A.R.S. \u00a7 13-753(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 17 For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the trial court's order, and we remand this case for that court to consider Altamirano's request for an ID evaluation applying the guidelines set forth in this opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
