In this case, the state moved before trial for a ruling on the admissibility of defendant's prior acts. The state presented a detailed account of the facts of this case and the testimony it sought to present. Because, as explained below, detailed recital of the facts is not necessary, we present only a general outline. The charged crimes took place at the victim's apartment. Defendant threatened and assaulted the victim repeatedly, prevented her from leaving her apartment, and broke her cell phone by throwing it against the wall because he was afraid that she would call the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The evidence of prior acts that the state sought to introduce involved S and K, two previous girlfriends of defendant. The state recounted several incidents of violence against S and K, some of which resulted in convictions and some of which did not. As explained below, the trial court allowed evidence only about the incidents that resulted in convictions. Those incidents are as follows: Defendant stayed in K's vehicle after she repeatedly told him to get out and he took K's cell phone to prevent her from calling the police; he also turned the steering wheel while K was driving, causing the car to go into the other lane of traffic. For that conduct, defendant was convicted of interfering with making a report. As to S, defendant accused her of cheating on him and punched her in the head. Defendant was convicted of assaulting S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The state argued that the evidence of that conduct by defendant against S and K was admissible under OEC 404(3) for three reasons: to show intent under the doctrine-of-chances theory set out in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Because we conclude that it was admissible under the second sentence of OEC 404(3), we need not consider the state's argument that it was nevertheless admissible for propensity purposes, which the state presents as an alternative basis for affirmance.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Outdoor Media Dimensions Inc. v.

However, the court also limited the evidence of defendant's violence against S and K to descriptions of the incidents that resulted in convictions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    At trial, the state presented testimony from K and S recounting the events that led to defendant's convictions and the fact that he had been convicted. As noted above, the jury acquitted defendant of attempted second-degree assault and convicted him of the other six charges.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    On appeal, defendant assigns error to the court's admission of evidence of his prior acts against S and K. He argues that the evidence of his conduct against S and K \"was not relevant to defendant's mental state other than by\n    showing his propensity to commit acts of domestic violence.\" In defendant's view, the evidence was not admissible under the doctrine of chances because, as he argued below, his conduct against S and K was not similar enough to the charged conduct to satisfy the\n    <em>\n     Johns\n    </em>\n    test. Nor was it admissible as evidence of \"hostile motive,\" he argues, because prior acts can show \"that a hostile relationship existed between the defendant and the victim\" only when \"the misconduct and the charged crime involve[ ] the\n    <em>\n     same\n    </em>\n    victim.\" (Emphasis in defendant's brief.) Defendant also contends that the trial court erred in failing to conduct OEC 403 balancing on the prior acts evidence that it admitted.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    The state responds that the evidence was admissible on both the doctrine-of-chances theory and the hostile-motive theory and that defendant's OEC 403 argument is not preserved.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    As a preliminary matter, we note that is not clear from the record that the trial court admitted the evidence regarding S under the hostile-motive theory. As noted, the state argued that the evidence regarding both S and K was admissible under both the doctrine of chances and a hostile-motive theory. The record does not reveal any analysis by the trial court that would have caused it to treat the evidence regarding defendant's conduct against S differently from the evidence regarding defendant's conduct toward K. Moreover, the court instructed the jury the same way with respect to all of the evidence. However, as explained above, the court's order states that the evidence regarding K is \"relevant to prove intent and hostile motive,\" but the evidence regarding S is \"relevant to prove intent.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    Nevertheless, even if the trial court did not admit the evidence regarding S under a hostile-motive theory, the parties litigated that theory in the trial court, and we\n    agree with the state that its hostile-motive argument presents an appropriate alternative basis on which to affirm.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      State v.

We disagree. Defendant requested OEC 403 balancing on \"[acts] that are uncharged or that type of thing.\" He did not request balancing on the evidence that the court did admit, which, as explained above, was exclusively evidence regarding incidents that resulted in convictions.
