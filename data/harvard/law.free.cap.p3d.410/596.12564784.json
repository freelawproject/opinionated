(father) appeals the trial court's order denying as moot his C.R.C.P. 60(b) motion to vacate its prior orders entered in the dependency and neglect proceeding regarding his child, C.G.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 We consider, as a matter of first impression, whether the orders became moot following the child's death. Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that father's request for relief under C.R.C.P. 60(b) was not moot. Alternatively, we are persuaded that father has established that his request for relief meets the \"capable of repetition yet evading review\" and \"public interest\" mootness exceptions. Accordingly, we reverse the order, and remand the matter to the trial court for a determination on the merits of father's C.R.C.P. 60(b) motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 In March 2006, the Jefferson County Division of Children, Youth and Families (Division) filed a dependency and neglect petition and assumed temporary custody of the then five-year-old child and his younger half-sibling. The petition asserted that the child's father, identified as John Doe, \"whereabouts unknown,\" had abandoned him. One day after filing the petition, the Division moved to serve John Doe by publication. The court granted the request. Approximately one week later, the Division published notice of the proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 In May 2006, the court placed the child in the temporary custody of Jon Phillips, the father of the child's half-sibling. In November 2006, the court adjudicated the child dependent and neglected by default as to John Doe. The court subsequently granted an allocation of parental responsibilities (APR) for the child to Phillips and terminated its jurisdiction over the proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 The child died a year later. Phillips was convicted of first degree murder and child abuse resulting in death.\n   <em>\n    People v.

The claims were brought under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) for violation of the child's substantive due process rights.\n   <em>\n    Schwartz v.

He sought to vacate the trial court's orders, among others, that (1) found John Doe in default; (2) transferred temporary legal custody of the child to Phillips; (3) adjudicated the child dependent and neglected; (4) awarded APR to Phillips; and (5) terminated the court's jurisdiction over the proceeding. Specifically, father asserted that because the Division had failed to exercise due diligence to ascertain his identity before it served him by publication, the default judgment and all later orders were void for lack of due process under C.R.C.P. 60(b)(3). Alternatively, he asserted that the orders should be vacated because the Division had committed fraud on the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 In the motion and in reply to the Division's response that the matter was moot, father maintained that the relief he requested would have a practical effect on an existing controversy - the federal\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   action. He explained that vacating the orders would remove any doubt that the child was in the state's custody up until the time that he was killed and, thus, would establish that the child had an ongoing special relationship with the state. In requesting a hearing on his motion, he expounded that his request for relief affected the only issue currently pending in the federal action-the child's custodial status with the state-and voiding the orders would likely enable him to defeat a pending motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9 Without holding a hearing, the trial court denied father's motion as moot. It\n   concluded that setting aside the judgment would have no practical legal effect on the dependency and neglect proceeding, which related solely to the child's status and protection; that father's argument that the motion could impact his federal action was without merit; and that none of the exceptions to the mootness doctrine applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    II. Mootness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 Father contends that the trial court erred in finding that, in light of C.G.'s death, his request for C.R.C.P. 60(b) relief was moot. We conclude that father's request for relief is not moot because of the collateral consequence in the dependency and neglect orders in father's federal action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    A.
