Ms. Widdison argues that the jury instructions contained numerous errors and that evidence of specific instances of conduct relevant to her uncle's violent character was erroneously excluded. Because the trial court improperly resolved the disputed factual question of whether Ms. Widdison resided in her uncle's home and accordingly declined to give the defense's proposed instruction regarding the duty to retreat in one's residence, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b62] We reorder, rephrase and clarify the issues as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   I.

Accordingly, we address the remaining issues only to the extent our resolution will be helpful to the district court on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b64] Ms. Widdison resided with her uncle, Mr. Jones, off and on, usually six or more months at a time, for five years. Beginning February 22, 2016, Ms. Widdison again began staying with Mr. Jones. On Sunday, February 28, Mr. Jones brought home a case of beer and a bottle of rum and shared it with Ms. Widdison. They drank and watched television for most of the afternoon and into the evening. At around 4:30 that afternoon, Mike Nygard, a friend of Mr. Jones, stopped by. He testified that both Ms. Widdison and Mr. Jones were very drunk and were arguing. He stayed for several hours, and at one point took Ms. Widdison to his home. He took her\n   back at approximately 7:30 p.m., but did not go inside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b65] About a half hour later, Mr. Nygard received the first in a series of voicemails from Ms. Widdison. Mr. Nygard did not listen to the voicemails until later that evening when Ms. Widdison's mother telephoned him. Ms. Widdison's mother and stepfather had received a voicemail from Ms. Widdison in which she said, \"I've got a bleeder\" and indicated she needed help. In response, they contacted Mr. Nygard and asked him to check on Widdison and Jones. Mr. Nygard listened to his voicemails. In the final voicemail, Ms. Widdison repeated the statement, \"cleanup on aisle nine\" several times. Mr. Nygard called 911.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b66] When the sheriff's officers arrived, Ms. Widdison came outside, said something they did not understand, and went back into the home. They entered and found Mr. Jones lying on the floor, covered with blood, and stating something about molesting little girls. Ms. Widdison made statements indicating that Mr. Jones had \"tried touching\" her. Bloody footprints matching Ms. Widdison's boots surrounded Mr. Jones, and the blood on the carpet had dried by the time the officers arrived. Two bloody knives were found in the kitchen sink. EMTs arrived shortly after the sheriff's officers and began to administer first aid. Mr. Jones was hospitalized and treated for a cut on his hand and three stab wounds, one in his thigh and two in his neck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b67] Mr. Jones did not have a clear recollection of the events leading up to the incident. He did testify that when their argument began to escalate, he told Ms. Widdison that she had to leave his home. Ms. Widdison testified that the conflict arose because Mr. Jones insisted that she give him oral sex in exchange for staying at his home. She stated that he threatened her with a knife and pinned her to the ground, and that she wrestled the knife away from him. She recalled nothing about the stabbing or a second knife. Ms. Widdison also testified that she was afraid Mr. Jones was going to kill her and that he had threatened her with weapons before. The defense presented two additional witnesses. Darcey Fulmer, another of Mr. Jones' nieces, testified that Mr. Jones had a propensity for violence and inappropriate sexual solicitation and touching, especially when he was drunk. The second witness, Mr. Jones' nephew, Yancey Norton, also testified regarding Mr. Jones' reputation for violence and for making unwanted sexual advances. Mr. Norton recounted an incident in which Mr. Jones had locked him and Ms. Widdison in the basement and threatened to kill them with a gun he was holding. The district court interrupted the testimony and prohibited the defense from presenting that or other testimony regarding specific instances of Mr. Jones' conduct. The defense rested without calling two additional family members who had been listed as witnesses to testify regarding Mr. Jones' reputation and propensity for violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b68] The district court instructed the jury regarding both aggravated assault and attempted second-degree murder. The instructions included instructions on self-defense, the right to arm, and the definition of \"maliciously\" as applied to attempted second-degree murder. The court refused Ms. Widdison's proposed instruction on the \"castle doctrine.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   These instructions are discussed in detail below. The jury returned guilty verdicts on both counts, and the district court sentenced Ms. Widdison to concurrent sentences of twenty-five years on the attempted second-degree murder charge and eight to ten years on the aggravated assault charge. This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I.

The question of whether a cohabitant may assert the castle doctrine against another cohabitant is a question of first impression in Wyoming. Accordingly, we first consider this issue. Because we conclude that the castle doctrine applies between cohabitants, we will also consider whether the district court's refusal to give the castle doctrine instruction was erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Cohabitants and the use of the castle doctrine\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b610] The majority of jurisdictions that have considered the issue conclude that a cohabitant does not have a duty to retreat in his own home when, through no fault of his own, he is assailed by another cohabitant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Linda A.

These courts reason that it would be illogical to require retreat when one is attacked in one's own home by a cohabitant, but not when attacked by a stranger. \"The danger posed and the sanctuary of the dwelling is the same regardless of the status of the attacker.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

But self-defense in the home is based on the premise that the home is \"a place critical for the protection of the family.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11609144\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/594/897/#p900\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11609144\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/594/897/#p900\">\n    at 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Requiring retreat from the home before acting in self-defense would require one to leave one's safest place. As Justice Cardozo explained in\n   <em>\n    People v. Tomlins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1209535,68767\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny/213/240/\">\n    213 N.Y. 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20N.E.%20496\">\n    107 N.E. 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1914), \"[i]t is not now and never has been the law that a man assailed in his own dwelling is bound to retreat. If assailed there, he may stand his ground and resist the attack. He is under no duty to take to the fields and the highways, a fugitive from his own home. * * * Flight is for sanctuary and shelter, and shelter, if not sanctuary, is in the home.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20N.E.%20496\">\n    107 N.E. at 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court in\n   <em>\n    Tomlins\n   </em>\n   went on to explain that the no retreat from the home rule was the same regardless of whether the aggressor was an intruder or a coresident.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b611] In contrast, a minority of jurisdictions distinguish encounters between cohabitants and intruders and require retreat when one is attacked by a cohabitant. Those courts focus on the \"entitlement of both combatants to occupy the house and the fact that they usually are related, and reason that the parties have some obligation to attempt to defuse the situation.\"\n   <em>\n    Cooper v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7903142\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/512/1002/#p1005\">\n    512 A.2d 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1005-06 (D.C. Ct. App. 1986) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b612] We conclude that the majority rule is the better-reasoned approach. When a person is attacked within her dwelling, the right to defend herself and the privilege of non-retreat should not depend upon the identity of the attacker. \"Further, forcing a resident to retreat from the home is at odds with the historical notion of the home as a place critical for the protection of the family.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Carothers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11609144\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/594/897/#p900\">\n    594 N.W.2d 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 901 (Minn. 1999). In addition, applying the castle doctrine to cohabitants will better protect victims of domestic violence. As the Florida Supreme Court recognized when it abandoned the minority view, \"placing a duty to retreat from the home on the defendant may serve to legitimize the common myth [that victims of domestic violence are free to leave the battering relationship any time they wish to do so, and that abuse could not have been so\n   bad because otherwise she would have left] and allow prosecutors to capitalize upon it.\"\n   <em>\n    Weiand v.

App. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [\u00b613] Finally, our holding is compatible with longstanding self-defense principles. Beginning with\n   <em>\n    Palmer v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8515668\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wyo/9/40/\">\n    9 Wyo. 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=59%20P.%20793\">\n    59 P. 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 795 (Wyo. 1900), we have consistently held that when a person without fault is attacked in his home, he may defend himself. In\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   , we first adopted the castle doctrine. We explained that \"the law does not require that [a person in his own home] shall avoid the necessity by retreating before his assailant. His house is his castle, and when it is invaded he is deemed to be 'at the wall,' and no further retreat is required.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (citations omitted). We established that a person in his own home has a right to defend himself against any person who attacks him:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Every man has a right to pursue his peaceful avocations in his own house and about his own premises, unmolested by threats or violence, or unlawful interference by\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     any other person or persons\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ; and if, while pursuing these avocations, he is violently attacked in a manner indicating a purpose to perpetrate a known felony upon him, such as murder, mayhem, or the like, under such circumstances he is not obliged to retreat, but may pursue his adversary until he has freed himself from all danger.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 796 (emphasis added) (citation omitted).

Ms. Widdison testified that she considered Mr. Jones' home to be her residence; she had been living there off and on for a period of years; and she used that address on her drivers' license. The State questioned her regarding her residence on cross-examination:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [PROSECUTION]: So in relation to your residence, Mr. Jones' residence is the one that you've been allowed to live at most often, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [MS.

However, even the district court recognized that the determination needed to be made in the face of conflicting evidence.

Ms. Widdison's testimony that Mr. Jones had threatened her with a knife and pinned her to the ground before she wrestled the knife away, if believed by the jury, would have given the jury a basis upon which to conclude that Mr. Jones (and not Ms. Widdison) was the first aggressor. If the jury concluded that Mr. Jones was the first aggressor and that the home was Ms. Widdison's residence, it would have been properly instructed that, under the castle doctrine, Ms. Widdison was \"entitled to stand her ground and use such force as was reasonably necessary....\" However, based on the instructions given, if the jury determined that Mr. Jones was the initial aggressor, it was instructed that Ms. Widdison had to consider reasonable alternatives, which may include retreat, before resorting to deadly force.

There was a reasonable probability that, but for the jury's lost opportunity to determine the factual question of whether Ms. Widdison resided in Mr. Jones' home, the jury would have found that Ms. Widdison acted in self-defense and the outcome of the case would have been different.

The defendant would be justified even though the appearance of danger later proved to be false and there was actually neither purpose on the part of the assailant to kill the defendant or do the defendant serious bodily harm nor imminent danger that it would be done, nor actual necessity that deadly force be used in self-defense. If the person so confronted acts in self-defense upon such appearance of danger from honest belief, the right of self-defense is the same whether the danger is real or merely apparent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Instruction No. 21 stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   It is lawful for a person who is being assaulted to defend herself from attack if she has reasonable grounds for believing and does believe that bodily injury is about to be inflicted upon her.

Second, even absent additional clarifying language, the language contained in the instructions referred to the charges to which they applied.

Verbal provocation without more is generally insufficient to justify an initial aggressor.

To excuse a failure to retreat, it is necessary that the defendant's peril would be increased, or that it reasonably appeared that it would be increased, by retreat.

She argues that here the prosecution never took the position that she acted in self-defense at all (and by implication never argued that Ms. Widdison was the first aggressor) and, as a result, the instruction did not apply. Because Ms. Widdison's position was that she acted in self-defense and Mr. Jones was the aggressor, the question of who was the first aggressor was at play. In\n   <em>\n    Drennen\n   </em>\n   , we held that \"[i]n cases where the determination of which party was the aggressor is in dispute, the jury should be specifically instructed as to the definition of 'aggressor' so it can resolve the factual issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 32,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6963943\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/311/116/\">\n    311 P.3d at 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To excuse a failure to retreat, it is necessary that the defendant's peril would be increased, or that it reasonably appeared that it would be increased, by retreat.
