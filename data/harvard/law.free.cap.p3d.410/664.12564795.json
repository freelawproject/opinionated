(father) appeals from the judgment terminating the parent-child legal relationship between him and his daughter, L.K. We affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 On cross-appeal, the Moffat County Department of Social Services (MCDSS) challenges the trial court's order requiring payment of $400 to father's attorney, as a discovery sanction, on the basis that, among other reasons, it violated sovereign immunity. This question has not been addressed in Colorado. After considering federal precedent, we conclude that, because this sanction violated sovereign immunity, it must be set aside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 In August 2013, MCDSS devised a protective plan for L.K., then five years old, after her outcry over sexual abuse by father. MCDSS placed L.K. with M.K. (grandmother), and contact between father and L.K. was prohibited. In October, after father was seen contacting L.K. in violation of the protective plan, MCDSS removed her from grandmother's home. Then it filed a petition in dependency and neglect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 At the first hearing, the court advised father that he was the focus of a criminal investigation arising from L.K.'s report of abuse; the offenses being investigated were \"serious offenses,\" which could lead to a lengthy prison term; and he should be careful about what he said because his statements could be available to other people and could potentially be used against him in a criminal case. The court also advised him that if L.K. was adjudicated dependent and neglected, a treatment plan would be adopted for him; if he failed to comply with it, either MCDSS or L.K.'s guardian ad litem (GAL) could move to terminate his parental rights; and if the court found that \"sufficient proof\" had been presented, his parental rights would be terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 Father stipulated that L.K. was dependent and neglected because she lacked proper parental care. The court accepted his admission and adjudicated L.K. dependent and neglected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 MCDSS proposed a treatment plan for father that required him, among other things, to successfully complete sex offender treatment. Although the plan did not specifically require him to take a polygraph examination, it did require him to \"participate in a psychosexual evaluation and complete other assessments required by the evaluator\" and \"complete therapy according to SOMB standards.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 When the court approved the treatment plan, father was not present-allegedly because MCDSS failed to advise him of a change in the hearing date-and he was not represented by counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The attorney for MCDSS told the court that father continued to deny having sexual contact with L.K. but had indicated that he understood MCDSS would be seeking treatment for alleged improper sexual contact. Counsel also said that she believed father would say that he was \"not in favor\" of such treatment, but she was under the impression that he would be willing to do it if the court ordered it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 Later, and still without counsel, father sent a letter to the court objecting to \"taking a lie detector test.\" But he did so on the ground that he understood such tests were \"unscientific\" and had a large margin of error. He did not express any fear that a polygraph examination might require him to incriminate himself. And otherwise, he did not contest the treatment plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 In January 2014, father retained counsel, who told MCDSS that father could not complete SOMB-approved treatment because he refused to admit that he had sexually\n   abused L.K. and no criminal charges were pending against him. At a later status hearing, counsel provided this information to the court, and the caseworker confirmed that SOMB-approved providers would not treat father under these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 Father's retained counsel also requested a protective order under section 19-3-207, C.R.S. 2015, precluding use of any statements made during treatment in later criminal proceedings. The court entered the order. But the court never ruled on father's letter objecting to \"taking a lie detector test.\" Nor did his attorney ask the court to treat the letter as a motion and rule on it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 In April 2014, father completed a sex offense specific evaluation by an SOMB-listed evaluator. Noting that father completely denied any inappropriate sexual behavior, the evaluator recommended that father take a polygraph examination to determine the next step. If the results indicated that he was truthful, he would not be viewed as an appropriate candidate for offense specific treatment. But, if the results showed deception and he continued to deny inappropriate sexual behavior, he could participate in a \"denier's intervention\" program \"for the purpose of helping him reduce his denial and defensiveness in preparation for a traditional offense specific treatment program.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12 MCDSS proposed that father's treatment plan be amended to include the evaluator's recommendations. This time, he did not object to any aspect of the amended plan. The court amended the plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 13 After father completed the first polygraph examination in June 2014, efforts were made to find a treatment provider for him. But, during a hearing on September 17, he told the court that he still could not find a treatment provider who would work with him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 14 In October 2014, the court expressed concern that father's treatment plan might be \"impossible\" because he could not find a provider who was willing to treat him. The court ordered MCDSS to find a provider for father. MCDSS was not successful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 15 In January 2015, at the court's request, father moved to modify his treatment plan. He requested, among other things, that any reference to SOMB requirements or guidelines be eliminated, and that the therapy requirement be modified to remove any reference to denier's treatment or SOMB offense specific treatment. The motion did not specifically address completing a polygraph examination. Following a hearing, the court denied the motion and ordered father to participate in denier's treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 16 Father was referred to an SOMB-approved provider for denier's treatment in March 2015. The provider tried several approaches to help him \"open up\" about his behavior, but nothing worked. Father met with the provider only four times. And he did not meet with or attempt to contact the provider after May 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 17 Father told MCDSS that he could not pay for the second polygraph examination that was required as part of denier's treatment. After MCDSS agreed to pay for the examination, it was rescheduled for August. But father was terminated from treatment on July 20, under SOMB standards that require termination if a denier continues to be in full denial after ninety days. He never took the examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 18 After denier's treatment ended, MCDSS moved to terminate father's parental rights, citing his failure to comply with his treatment plan. During the three-day termination hearing, father's attorney cross-examined witnesses and made arguments on father's behalf. However, father chose not to testify and his attorney did not present any evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 19 Relying on the testimony of the denier's treatment provider and other witnesses, the court found, among other things, that father had been referred for a polygraph examination as part of denier's treatment, but he had not appeared for the examination. The court granted the termination motion, citing father's failure to successfully complete treatment designed to address the allegations of \"sexual misbehavior\" with L.K. as sufficient evidence that father was unable or unwilling to provide nurturing and safe parenting to adequately address her needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   II. Failure to Take the Polygraph Examination\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 20 Father first contends the trial court committed reversible error by considering the denier's treatment polygraph examination as evidence supporting its determination that he failed to successfully complete his treatment plan. We perceive no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A. Additional Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 21 The court allowed MCDSS to present evidence of efforts to schedule an appointment for a polygraph examination during denier's treatment and evidence that father did not keep the appointment. In granting the termination motion, the court cited father's failure to successfully complete treatment designed to address the allegations of \"sexual misbehavior\" with L.K. The court specifically referred to father's failure to take the second polygraph examination required by the denier's treatment program as evidence of his failure to successfully complete treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   B. Preservation and Standard of Review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 22 Father preserved this issue by raising it in his closing argument at the termination hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whether the trial court improperly considered father's failure to take the polygraph examination is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

Law\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 23 \"Evidence of polygraph test results and the testimony of polygraph examiners are per se inadmissible in both criminal and civil trials.\"\n   <em>\n    People in Interest of M.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6997307\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/215/1237/#p1248\">\n    215 P.3d 1237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1248 (Colo. App. 2009). In\n   <em>\n    M.M.\n   </em>\n   , which involved termination of parental rights, the division held that evidence of polygraph examinations should not have been admitted, and the trial court should not have listened to or considered the opinions of any experts based in whole or in part on polygraph results.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6997307\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/215/1237/#p1248\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6997307\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/215/1237/#p1248\">\n    at 1250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   D. Application\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 24 According to father, the question before the trial court was whether evidence of polygraph examination\n   <em>\n    results\n   </em>\n   could be considered. Not so. The record shows the question to have been whether evidence of\n   <em>\n    compliance\n   </em>\n   (or lack thereof) with a polygraph examination requirement should be admitted and considered, and for what purpose. Because father never took the polygraph examination required for denier's treatment, the court had no results to consider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 25 Father does not dispute either that his treatment plan required him to participate in denier's treatment or that a polygraph examination is required in denier's treatment. For these reasons, the court concluded that it could properly admit evidence of efforts to schedule an appointment for a polygraph examination during denier's treatment and evidence that father did not keep the appointment. We agree with the court that admitting this evidence did not violate the prohibition against considering polygraph results. Based on L.K.'s outcry over sexual abuse by father, the mandatory participation in sex offender treatment, and the treatment requirement that he take a polygraph examination, father's failure to take the examination was a proper matter for the court to consider in determining whether he had successfully completed his treatment plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 26 Therefore, we conclude that the court did not err in admitting evidence of father's failure to take the polygraph examination required as part of the denier's treatment component of his treatment plan and considering this evidence in terminating his parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   III. The Burden of Proof\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 27 Next, father contends the burden was on MCDSS to prove by clear and convincing evidence that his parental rights should be terminated, but the trial court erred by unfairly shifting the burden of proof to him when he decided not to testify in the termination hearing. Again, we perceive no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A. Additional Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 28 Neither MCDSS nor the GAL attempted to call father to testify at the hearing. On the second day of the termination hearing, after MCDSS and the GAL had rested, the court inquired whether father intended to present any evidence. After consulting with his attorney and being advised by the court of the consequences of his decision, father declined to testify or present any other evidence. At that time, neither father nor his attorney mentioned a concern over self-incrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 29 Later, the court asked the parties to address in their closing arguments whether it could draw a negative inference from father's failure or refusal to participate in the polygraph examination required by denier's treatment. The court cited\n   <em>\n    Asplin v. Mueller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10428552\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/687/1329/\">\n    687 P.2d 1329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Colo. App. 1984), as a potentially relevant case, but it acknowledged that the opinion did not appear to be \"on point.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   B. Preservation and Standard of Review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 30 Father preserved the issue of whether the trial court improperly considered his choice not to testify when his counsel raised it in his closing argument at the termination hearing. However, counsel sought to dissuade the court from relying on\n   <em>\n    Asplin\n   </em>\n   by arguing that an adverse inference could not be drawn because unlike in that case, father had not declined to testify on Fifth Amendment grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 31 \"The proper burden of proof is a question of law which we review de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    McCallum Family L.L.C. v.

Application\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 35 Father argues, as he did below, that\n   <em>\n    Asplin\n   </em>\n   is inapposite because he did not assert his privilege against self-incrimination as a reason for declining to testify at the termination hearing. Instead, father continues, because he merely chose not to put on evidence, the court could not draw an adverse inference from this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 36 In closing argument, father's counsel understandably addressed whether the trial court could draw an adverse inference. After all, the court had raised\n   <em>\n    Asplin\n   </em>\n   sua sponte. But by any fair reading, the record tells us that the trial court did not draw an adverse inference from father's failure to testify or otherwise put on evidence. Still, father persists with this argument on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 37 True enough, in the court's oral findings, it recognized \"[t]he question about [father] not participating in the second polygraph examination and whether that can be used to draw an adverse inference.\" But then the court explained that, as with any respondent parent's failure to comply with a portion of a treatment plan:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   I would draw an adverse inference from that behavior. [Father] made a decision. And the reason for the decision doesn't really matter too much. He knew what was required, I'm convinced of that. He knew how to meet the requirement, and I'm convinced of that. He made a decision to stop complying.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 38 In the written \"Order Concerning Motion to Terminate Parent Child Relationship,\" the trial court noted only that father had not testified. Then, and without making any reference to either\n   <em>\n    Asplin\n   </em>\n   or drawing adverse inferences, the court found-from the testimony of other witnesses and not disputed by father-that he did not participate in a polygraph examination as required by the denier's treatment element of his treatment plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, the court further found that \"father failed to complete the treatment plan.\" The record supports the court's holding that father's failure to successfully complete his denier's treatment-because he did not participate in a required polygraph examination-was similar to holding that a parent's failure to participate in any other activity required by the parent's treatment plan, such as drug testing to complete substance abuse treatment, resulted in a lack of compliance with the treatment plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 39 Therefore, we conclude that when father failed to present evidence, the court did not improperly shift the burden of proof, infringe on father's privilege against self-incrimination, or draw impermissible adverse inferences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   IV. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 40 Finally, father contends MCDSS did not prove its case by clear and convincing evidence. Specifically, he asserts the absence of such evidence that he had sexually abused L.K., which was the basis for the petition in dependency and neglect. We reject this contention because the question of father's wrongdoing was not at issue in the termination hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   A. Additional Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 41 In terminating father's parental rights based on his failure to complete his treatment plan, the court did not make any findings whether father had sexually abused L.K. And the court specifically noted in its termination order that whether father in fact sexually abused L.K. was not an issue for it to decide at the termination hearing. Instead, the court found that the issue before it was whether father had complied with his treatment plan.

But proof of abuse would not be necessary if the child is determined to be dependent and neglected on other grounds, such as lack of proper parental care as provided in section 19-3-102(1)(b).

Additional Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 49 Both parties chose to handle discovery in a more formal manner than is typical of a juvenile court proceeding. Father propounded formal discovery requests to MCDSS. MCDSS filed a \"Certificate of Compliance Pursuant to [C.R.C.P.] 26(a)(1)\" to document each group of documents produced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 50 On May 9, 2014, father moved to compel discovery, asserting that although MCDSS had produced sixty-two pages of \"alleged discovery,\" those documents did not include anything in several categories that had been requested several months earlier, and MCDSS had not responded to an interrogatory submitted at the same time. He requested an order compelling MCDSS to respond to his discovery requests as well as sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 51 Several months later, MCDSS responded to the motion to compel, explaining that it had not responded earlier because the attorney for MCDSS believed that the \"remainder of discovery\" sought by father had been provided to him on May 13, 2014. Citing section 13-17-102(8), C.R.S. 2015, which provides that section 13-17-102\"shall not apply to ... matters brought under the provisions of the 'Colorado Children's Code,' \" MCDSS also argued that attorney fees could not be awarded in juvenile matters. Father replied, detailing his reasons for dissatisfaction with the response to his discovery requests and renewing his request for sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 52 During a later review hearing, the motion to compel was raised, the trial court asked about sovereign immunity, the parties presented arguments, and an agreement on how discovery would be handled going forward was reached. A few weeks later, the court entered an order granting father's motion for sanctions. The court approved the new \"open file\" policy that MCDSS was adopting, but it found that a discovery violation had occurred. Adding that \"this is not the first time that this court has heard similar complaints\" about MCDSS, the court ordered MCDSS to pay $400 to father's attorney as a sanction under C.R.C.P. 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 53 MCDSS moved to vacate the sanction order under C.R.C.P. 59.

With certain exceptions not applicable here, section 24-10-108, C.R.S. 2015, provides that \"sovereign immunity shall be a bar to any action against a public entity for injury which lies in tort or could lie in tort regardless of whether that may be the type of action or the form of relief chosen by a claimant.\" Injury is defined as \"death, injury to a person, damage to or loss of property, of whatsoever kind, which, if inflicted by a private person, would lie in tort or could lie in tort.\" \u00a7 24-10-103(2), C.R.S. 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 62 This definition of injury shows why the CGIA is inapplicable to discovery sanctions.

Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b6 71 The judgment terminating the parent-child legal relationship between father and L.K. is affirmed. The order requiring MCDSS to pay $400 to father's attorney, as well as the order denying post-trial relief to MCDSS, is reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   JUDGE ASHBY and JUDGE HARRIS concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    SOMB refers to the Sex Offender Management Board. \u00a7 16-13-902(2), C.R.S. 2015.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    Initially, father was not eligible for court-appointed counsel based on his earnings. When the treatment plan was proposed, he had not yet retained private counsel. However, the trial court found that father had \"had knowledge and notice\" of the hearing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    However, father's counsel did not then argue, nor had he argued at any earlier stage of the proceedings, either that father had been coerced into participating in denier's treatment or that the polygraph examination required by this treatment implicated father's privilege against self-incrimination. Father does not make either argument on appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    Article II, section 18 of the Colorado Constitution similarly provides that \"[n]o person shall be compelled to testify against himself in a criminal case.\" Father does not argue that article II, section 18 provides any greater protection than the Fifth Amendment at trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    Although we discern no principled difference between the court's oral findings and its written order, \"when a court makes oral findings and conclusions that differ from its final written rulings, the final written order controls.\"\n    <em>\n     Thyssenkrupp Safway, Inc. v.
