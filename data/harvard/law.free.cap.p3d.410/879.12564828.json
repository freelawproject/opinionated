The respondent failed to file an answer. On May 15, respondent emailed a document titled Motion to Continue the hearing date. The hearing panel filed an order on May 17, denying respondent's motion. On May 19, respondent filed a proposed probation plan. On May 23, respondent filed a document entitled \"pleading\" in which he admitted that he violated KRPC 1.1, 1.3,\n   1.5, 1.16, 3.2, 3.4(c), 8.3, and 8.4(d), and Kansas Supreme Court Rules 207 and 211. Respondent also stipulated that he violated KRPC 8.1(b) ; however, the disciplinary administrator did not charge respondent with violation of that rule. A hearing was held on the complaint before a panel of the Kansas Board for Discipline of Attorneys on May 23, where the respondent was personally present. The hearing panel determined that respondent violated KRPC 1.1 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 289) (competence); 1.3 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 292) (diligence); 1.4(a) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 293) (communication); 1.5 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 294) (fees); 1.15(a) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 328) (safekeeping property); 1.16(d) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 333) (termination of representation); 3.2 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 343) (expediting litigation); 3.4(c) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 347) (fairness to opposing party and counsel); 8.4(d) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 381) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice); 8.3(a) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 380) (reporting professional misconduct); Kansas Supreme Court Rule 207(c) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 246) (failure to report action); and Kansas Supreme Court Rule 211(b) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 251) (failure to file answer in disciplinary proceeding).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Upon conclusion of the hearing, the panel made the following findings of fact and conclusions of law, together with its recommendation to this court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Findings of Fact\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"DA12242\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"12. After being admitted to practice law in Kansas, the respondent established an immigration practice. In addition to his Kansas office, the respondent opened an office in Sioux City, Iowa.

For further explanation, the respondent stated that he does not keep client funds, that he worked only on immigration cases, that all fees are earned on a flat fee basis, and that the flat fees are deposited into his business account.

That is when I was contacted by the office, and was told that they would refund the fee to me, because I was not going to be practicing in Iowa. They then refunded the fee, and I made arrangements with the office rental company to close and move out of the office, which I did. No deadlines were ever issued to me on when I had to leave the State.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   'Subsequently, after closing the office they filed a complaint against me for not closing the office and for not paying the\n   fee. I submitted to them a written letter from the property company that I had indeed closed the office. The part where I faltered was that I did not shut down the office website immediately, and to the disciplinary agency in Iowa that was evidence that I was still practicing there. So I then submitted documents that showed I did indeed shut down the website, and had vacated the office, and the State of Iowa.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   'The above actions did not satisfy them. They did not set any deadline for me to close the business, and I did pay the fee, but they returned it to me. I provided evidence that I had closed the office and left the State. I feel like they are treating me unfairly since I am not a licensed attorney in the State of Iowa, but there was no reasoning with them, even after I submitted the necessary evidence. They decided to railroad me because they knew I would have no ability to defend myself. I object to their decision to file a complaint against me.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   In his response, the respondent did not address his failure to establish and maintain a trust account in Iowa.

The respondent was not competent to assist J.W., T.W., and E.V., in their immigration matters. The respondent failed to file necessary paperwork in the immigration cases to achieve the clients' goals. In E.V.'s case, the respondent failed to comprehend the difference between an E-2 Visa, which was necessary for E.V. to work in the United States, and an I-94, which is essentially an extension of the E-2 Visa that expires when a person leaves the country, or a Visa waiver, which does not permit a person to work and only allows a person to be in the United States for up to three months. Further, the respondent was not competent to determine what assistance C.W. needed to accomplish her goals or to understand basic differences in date formatting between the United States and United Kingdom. The hearing panel concludes that the respondent lacked the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation of J.W., T.W., E.V., and C.W., in violation of KRPC 1.1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   \" KRPC 1.3\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   \"74.

Additionally, the respondent failed to timely request additional documentation from J.W. and T.W. to include additional family members as sponsors. The respondent failed to diligently and promptly represent E.V. by filing for and obtaining an E-2 Visa. Finally, the respondent failed to diligently and promptly represent C.W. by timely requesting additional documents from C.W. to provide the British Passport Office. The respondent's lack of diligence caused his clients injury in each case.

In fact, during the hearing in this matter, the respondent indicated that he did not understand what a trust account was and asked one of the panel members to explain it to him. Further, by placing the client funds in his operating account and then reporting that account number in the malpractice garnishment action, the respondent placed his clients' funds in jeopardy of being used to pay the civil judgment against him. By failing to have trust accounts and by failing to deposit unearned fees as well as funds held on behalf of clients into a proper trust account, the hearing panel concludes that the respondent violated KRPC 1.15(a).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   \" KRPC 1.16\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   \"78.

The respondent did not file exceptions to the panel's final hearing report; however, respondent filed a document entitled \"pleading\" in which he admitted that he violated KRPC 1.1 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 289) (competence); 1.3 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 292) (diligence); 1.5 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 294) (fees); 1.16 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 333) (termination of representation); 3.2 (2018 Kan. S. Ct.

He also admitted, but was not charged with, violating KRPC 8.1(b) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 379) (failure to disclose a fact necessary to correct a misapprehension known by respondent).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Furthermore, the evidence before the panel establishes by clear and convincing evidence the charged misconduct violated KRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a), 1.5, 1.15(a), 1.16(d), 3.2, 3.4(c), 8.4(d), 8.3(a), Kansas Supreme Court Rule 207(c), and Kansas Supreme Court Rule 211(b), and it supports the panel's conclusions of law. We adopt the panel's conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   The only remaining issue before us is the appropriate discipline for respondent's violations. At the panel hearing, the Deputy Disciplinary Administrator recommended indefinite suspension from the practice of law. The respondent recommended probation according to his probation plan. The panel did not recommend probation because respondent failed to timely file his probation plan. The panel agreed with the Deputy Disciplinary Administrator and recommended indefinite suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   At the hearing before this court, the Deputy Disciplinary Administrator again recommended indefinite suspension. Respondent agreed with that recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   This court agrees with the recommendation of the Deputy Disciplinary Administrator and holds that respondent's license to practice law in the state of Kansas be indefinitely suspended and that he undergo a reinstatement hearing pursuant to Rule 219(d) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 264).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   CONCLUSION AND DISCIPLINE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Matthew Edgar Hult be and he is hereby disciplined by indefinite suspension in accordance with Supreme Court Rule 203(a)(2) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 234), effective on the filing of this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the costs of these proceedings be assessed to the respondent and that this opinion be published in the official Kansas Reports.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
