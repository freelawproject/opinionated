There was \"bad blood\" between Carson and J.M., and they unfortunately crossed paths. The two men engaged in a prolonged \"fight\" inside the house that involved \"a whole bunch of people,\" including S.B., who \"had a little conflict going [with Carson],\" and lasted five or ten minutes before being broken up. Carson displayed a gun at some point during this confrontation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 The fight soon resumed outside in what witnesses described as chaotic conditions (\"A whole bunch of people were running and arguing, yelling\"; \"[E]verybody just ran outside, and everybody was pushing\") until several people, including J.M. and S.B., \"jumped\" Carson, hitting and kicking him as he was on the ground. According to one witness, Carson pulled out a gun and \"started like swinging it to [J.M. and S.B.],\" who responded by physically fighting Carson. Someone yelled, \"He has a gun,\" and people began to run away. Shots were fired, and J.M. and S.B. were shot and killed. B.C. was shot but survived. The gun was never found. But police discovered a bloodied knife on the ground near S.B.'s body at the end of a trail of blood drops, and a second bloodied knife was found tucked inside S.B.'s belt. Neither was tested for fingerprints or DNA. Carson fled and was later arrested in Michigan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 The State charged Carson with two counts of second degree murder and two counts of aggravated assault. During the subsequent jury trial, Carson did not testify. His principal defense was that he was not the shooter. But Carson also requested a self-defense instruction. The trial court denied the request, reasoning \"the court legally cannot give a self-defense instruction\" because Carson denied he had shot the victims. The jury found Carson guilty on all counts, and the court imposed sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 The court of appeals reversed the murder convictions and sentences and remanded for a new trial because the trial court had erroneously refused to give a self-defense instruction as to those two victims.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In effect, once sufficient self-defense evidence is admitted, the absence of self-defense becomes an additional element the state must prove to convict.
