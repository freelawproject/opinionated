Following a jury trial in Bernalillo County metropolitan court, he was convicted of aggravated driving under the influence of a drug (DUI), possession of drug paraphernalia, and failing to maintain lane. The district court affirmed these convictions. On appeal to this Court, Defendant raises five challenges to the aggravated DUI conviction: (1) the trial court erred when it denied Defendant's motion to strike three potential jurors for cause, thus denying Defendant a fair trial; (2) there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that Defendant was guilty of aggravated DUI; (3) the trial court erred by denying Defendant's motion for a mistrial due to the prosecutor's comments regarding the legal standard for DUI; (4) NMSA 1978, Section 66-8-102(D)(3) (2016) is unconstitutional because it criminally punishes defendants for refusing to submit to a warrantless blood draw; and (5) on the same constitutional grounds, fundamental error occurred when the prosecutor commented during closing argument on Defendant's refusal to submit to the blood draw.

Pursuant to the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, a state cannot criminally punish an individual for refusing to submit to a warrantless blood draw. However, we also conclude that the constitutional proscription announced in\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   does not extend to the introduction of evidence of, or a prosecutor's comment on, such refusal to consent. Thus, the trial court did not err by allowing the prosecutor to comment during closing argument on Defendant's refusal to submit to a blood draw. We are not persuaded by Defendant's remaining arguments. We thus affirm in part and reverse in part, and remand for entry of judgment and sentence for violation of the underlying DUI offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Defendant's Arrest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {4} Deputy Sarah Young of the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Department was on duty during the early morning hours of November 7, 2013. She was traveling westbound on Montano Boulevard in Albuquerque, New Mexico (Montano), in the same direction as a sport utility vehicle (SUV) that was ahead of her and was traveling in the far right lane. The deputy observed the SUV cross over the solid painted lane divider into the right shoulder lane three times. Deputy Young then observed the vehicle move the opposite direction into the far left lane and appear to graze the concrete lane divider. After the SUV turned southbound onto Coors Boulevard, Deputy Young initiated a traffic stop. When she made contact with Defendant, who\n   was the driver of the SUV, the deputy smelled the odor of burnt marijuana coming from the vehicle. Deputy Young then asked Defendant whether there was anything in the vehicle she should be aware of, and Defendant produced a marijuana pipe from the center console. Based on the odor of burnt marijuana, the marijuana pipe, and how Defendant was driving, Deputy Young called dispatch to request a DUI officer. Deputy Johan Jareno responded to the call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {5} When Deputy Jareno arrived, he was briefed by Deputy Young and then made contact with Defendant. Deputy Jareno also smelled the odor of burnt marijuana coming from the vehicle, and Defendant admitted to Deputy Jareno that he had smoked marijuana \"a couple hours\" earlier. Deputy Jareno asked Defendant if he would perform standardized field sobriety tests (FSTs) and Defendant agreed. Defendant followed Deputy Jareno's instructions for the horizontal gaze nystagmus test, but missed the heel-to-toe twice, turned incorrectly, and used his arms for balance during the walk-and-turn test. Defendant also failed to follow Deputy Jareno's instructions during the one-leg stand test, hopping once and failing to look at his foot or keep his hands by his sides.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {6} Deputy Jareno testified that standardized FSTs help a law enforcement officer assess a driver's ability to operate a motor vehicle safely, because \"the tests are divided attention tests that require multitasking, as does driving.\" FSTs are designed to assess a person's intoxication regardless of the intoxicating substance. Deputy Jareno had training in Advanced Road Impairment Detection and Enforcement, where he learned how to identify drugs by look, smell, and consistency, and he also received specialized training as a Drug Recognition Examiner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {7} Following completion of the initial FSTs, Deputy Jareno then decided to give Defendant two alternate tests. For the first test, Deputy Jareno asked Defendant to estimate thirty seconds of time. When Defendant performed this exercise, forty-one seconds actually passed. For the second test, Deputy Jareno asked Defendant to recite the alphabet from J to Y, but Defendant was able to recite the alphabet only between J and P. Based on the results from the standardized FSTs and the two alternate tests, Deputy Jareno concluded that Defendant was not able to safely operate a vehicle and arrested him for DUI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {8} For Defendant's part, he testified that \"he did not feel intoxicated and thought he was safe to drive.\" He testified that his truck was \"beat up\" and that he had \"blown out\" the suspension, causing the truck to sway between the lanes because the road was \"very bumpy.\" Defendant also testified that he believed his driving was fine and that his vehicle did not strike the barrier. Defendant also denied that the marijuana pipe he turned over to Deputy Young belonged to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {9} After Defendant's arrest, but while still on the scene, Deputy Jareno read Defendant a scripted advisory statement for implied consent that states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   You are under arrest for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor and/or drug[s]. The New Mexico Implied Consent Advisory [sic] requires you to submit to a breath test, a blood test, or both to determine the alcohol or drug content of your blood. After you take one or both of our tests, you will have the right to choose an additional independent test. ... Do you agree to take our test or tests-yes or no?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant stated that he understood the advisory and he agreed to be tested. Deputy Jareno transported Defendant to a police station where Defendant was administered a breath test. The test showed negative for alcohol. Deputy Jareno then asked Defendant to submit to a blood test and Defendant refused. Deputy Jareno then stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   I cannot force you to take our test but if you refuse you will lose your New Mexico driver's license or non-resident operating privilege for up to one year. If you are also found guilty in court of driving while under the influence you may receive a greater sentence because you refused to submit to be tested.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant still refused to submit to a blood test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III. District Court Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {10} The metropolitan court (trial court) jury found Defendant guilty of possession of drug paraphernalia, failure to maintain traffic lane, and aggravated DUI. The trial court entered its sentencing order and judgment on July 14, 2014. Defendant appealed his conviction to the district court, asserting error based on the trial court's denial of his motion to strike the three potential jurors for cause, the claimed lack of sufficient evidence to prove failure to maintain traffic lane, the claimed lack of sufficient evidence to prove Defendant was guilty of DUI, and the trial court's denial of his mistrial motion based on the prosecutor's claimed misstatement of the law during closing argument. In a motion to dismiss, the State contended that Defendant had waived any claim of error with respect to the sufficiency of the evidence. In its memorandum opinion entered on July 29, 2015, the district court did not address the State's waiver argument and instead proceeded to address the merits of Defendant's arguments, but ultimately found no reversible error and affirmed the sentencing order. Defendant timely filed his notice of appeal to this Court. We note that the State has not appealed the district court's de facto denial of its motion to dismiss, and thus we do not address the waiver issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Trial Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Denying Defendant's Motion to Strike Jurors for Cause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {11} Defendant's jury selection argument focuses on two members of the venire panel, Baker and Romero, who were not selected to serve on the jury, and one, Lucero, who was selected as a juror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {12} During voir dire, in response to a question from defense counsel (\"How many of you think that if you have used drugs or alcohol, no matter in what amount, in just the slightest amount, that you are not okay to drive?\"), Baker stated, \"I don't allow drugs of any sort, even one drink is breaking the law.\" Baker spoke only the one time during voir dire. Defense counsel never followed up with Baker to ascertain whether, notwithstanding his incorrect understanding of the law, he still could follow the court's instructions and decide the case fairly and impartially.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {13} Later during voir dire, defense counsel asked the following question: \"Ms. Lucero? Okay. Let's see-how do you feel about ... the questions regarding whether if you've used any amount of marijuana, whether or not you're safe to drive-do you think that's the case?\" Lucero responded, \"Yes it is because it's endangering himself and endangering other people.\" That response was the only time that Lucero spoke during voir dire. Defense counsel did not follow up with Lucero to ascertain whether she could follow the court's instructions and decide the case fairly and impartially.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {14} Defense counsel then asked Romero the following question: \"Ms. Romero, I guess the same question to you-what do you think-would somebody who had any amount of marijuana in their system, would they be unable to drive safely?\" Romero responded, \"Well yeah, they'd be unable to drive because it's illegal to drink and drive.\" Similar to Baker and Lucero, defense counsel did not follow up with Romero to ascertain whether she could follow the court's instructions and decide the case fairly and impartially. That was the only time she spoke during voir dire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {15} Outside the presence of the venire panel, defense counsel moved to strike Baker, Lucero, and Romero, as well as another panel member, Pilcher, for cause. As is discussed below, the trial court agreed to strike Pilcher, but otherwise denied the motion. During the course of selecting the six members of the jury, defense counsel used one of Defendant's two peremptory excusals to strike Baker, but accepted Lucero. During the course of selecting an alternate juror, defense counsel exercised Defendant's remaining peremptory challenge on Romero.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {16} Defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to strike Baker, Lucero, and Romero for cause. Defendant asserts that all three stated that, because marijuana is illegal, a driver who uses any amount cannot drive safely. In response, the State argues that Defendant failed to demonstrate how these three panel members were unwilling or unable to decide the case based\n   on the evidence and the trial court's instructions. The State also points out that, of the three panel members that Defendant moved to strike, only one, Lucero, actually served on the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {17} \"Trial courts ... are given broad discretion in overseeing the voir dire process. ... The trial court, who is listening first hand to counsel's questions and the panel members' responses, is in the best position to determine whether voir dire has sufficiently exposed any biases that may preclude jurors from acting fairly and impartially.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

On appeal, he challenged the trial court's refusal to excuse for cause three members of the venire panel based on the fact that, during voir dire, two of the panel members commented generally about the defendant's decision to not testify and the third commented about the defendant's status as a convicted felon.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 12. This Court noted that these comments implicated rules regarding the presumption of innocence, the privilege not to testify, and the rules of evidence limiting character and propensity evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12. This Court then observed that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [the d]efendant is trying to convert a juror's admission of a layperson's natural response into prima facie evidence of impermissible bias. Evidentiary rules restricting the use of propensity evidence reflect a judgment that the probative value of such evidence is outweighed by unfair prejudice, confusion, and waste of time. Although these rules and the policies they represent may be known to and accepted by lawyers, they are not necessarily familiar to non-lawyers, who routinely rely on information about a person's past behavior in making social and business judgments. The fact that a juror is unaware at the outset of a criminal trial of the complicated scheme regulating the use of collateral offenses/character evidence is not at all surprising and should not, of itself, give rise to a presumption that a juror is incapable of following the trial court's instructions on the proper uses of evidence of collateral offenses. Indeed, the very purpose of instructions is to educate jurors about the applicable law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12 (citations omitted). This Court concluded that, with respect to all three panel members, the defendant failed to demonstrate that any of the three panel members was \"biased or otherwise incapable of deciding [the] case on the facts established at trial and the trial court's instructions on the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {19} Defendant's jury selection argument herein can be resolved on similar grounds. The three panel members in question simply expressed their layperson views about the physiological effects of marijuana and/or the law governing driving under the influence of drugs. Defense counsel did not follow up on those questions and inquire whether they could and would follow the trial court's instructions on the law and decide the case on the basis of the testimony and exhibits that were introduced into evidence. In the absence of that information, we decline to speculate about whether any of the three members would not have obeyed the trial court's instructions and instead would have decided the case on the basis of their layperson views or any actual biases. We therefore conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion during jury selection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In other words, under the Act, the exigent circumstances exception is not available to New Mexico law enforcement to obtain a blood test where a driver is arrested for DUI and refuses to consent to the test. Further, law enforcement generally may not seek a warrant for a blood test of a motorist who is arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or other drug, the only exceptions being where the driver has either caused death or great bodily harm, or committed a felony and chemical tests will produce material evidence in the felony prosecution.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=893%20N.W.2d%20411\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, it is a moot point whether in this case the State could establish exigent circumstances to justify an involuntary blood test of Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {32} As stated above, Section 66-8-102(D)(3) provides that aggravated DUI consists of \"refusing to submit to chemical testing, as provided for in [the Act], and in the judgment of the court, based upon evidence of intoxication presented to the court, the driver was under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs.\" The offense thus consists of\n   the underlying offense of driving under the influence of alcohol or another drug, plus refusal to consent to a blood test. Section 66-8-102(E) imposes criminal penalties for the act of refusal, in addition to those imposed for the underlying offense: for a first aggravated DUI offense, \"the offender shall be sentenced to not less than forty-eight consecutive hours in jail.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=893%20N.W.2d%20411\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In light of\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , and consistent with\n   <em>\n    Vargas\n   </em>\n   , we hold that Section 66-8-102(D)(3) is unconstitutional to the extent violation of it is predicated on refusal to consent to a blood draw to test for the presence of any drug in the defendant's blood.

Defense counsel argued that the prosecutor's statement called for speculation. Both the prosecutor and the judge pointed out that the prosecutor's statement concerned consciousness of guilt, and the judge overruled the objection. The prosecutor continued, stating: \"It was [D]efendant's fear that drove him to refuse that [testing].\" Later, at the end of his initial closing argument, the prosecutor stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   It's his admissions, the odor, his performance on the field sobriety tests, his poor driving, his refusal. He's under the influence. [D]efendant believes he's sober but the evidence points otherwise. That's his belief, an individual who admittedly was smoking marijuana, and that can play into your credibility assessment of him. I don't believe he was being dishonest. I believe he was impaired. The State asks you to find [D]efendant guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Defense counsel did not object to this statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {35} During his rebuttal following defense counsel's closing argument, the prosecutor stated, \"He was honest, so there should be some other reason as to why he would refuse the test. ... Ladies and Gentlemen, yes, he was honest with you, and handed the pipe over, admitted to smoking-until he was arrested for [DUI]. ... Until there's the very real probability that the blood needle goes into his arm and he gets tested and there is no doubt that he is under the influence.\" Defense counsel then objected, and the parties approached the bench for a sidebar conference. Defense moved for a mistrial. The trial judge denied the motion, but stated, \"I am concerned about saying sticking the needle in his arm that would have proven beyond-that would have proven he was guilty, because he can't prove that, that's purely speculation, so I'll sustain the objection to that, and I think you need to withdraw that statement.\" The prosecutor then continued his rebuttal, stating, \"Ladies and Gentlemen, counsel has pointed out that I made a bit of a misstatement there. Just because he had his blood drawn wouldn't have removed all doubt. The State still would have to produce\n   that evidence in court. But [D]efendant was afraid of it.\" Defense counsel did not object to this statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {36} Based on\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , and reasoning that he should not be penalized for asserting his Fourth Amendment right, Defendant urges that the trial court also erred in allowing the prosecutor to argue during final argument that Defendant's refusal to consent to a blood test was evidence of consciousness of his guilt. For the same reasons this Court considers Defendant's constitutional challenge to his aggravated DUI conviction notwithstanding his failure to preserve the claimed error, we also will consider this argument. Therefore, it is not necessary to undertake the plain or fundamental error analysis that Defendant pursues. However, we reject the substance of the argument and determine that the trial court did not err in allowing the comment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Birchfield\n    </em>\n    and Its Predecessors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {37} As mentioned above,\n   <em>\n    Neville\n   </em>\n   addressed the constitutionality of a South Dakota law that expressly permitted the introduction of evidence of a motorist's refusal to consent to a BAT. South Dakota courts had concluded that the statute violated the federal constitutional privilege against self-incrimination on the theory that introducing evidence of refusal to consent to a blood test was analogous to introducing evidence of a criminal defendant's refusal to testify. The United States Supreme Court disagreed. The Court noted that most state courts that had considered the question had concluded that refusal to submit is a physical act rather than a communication, and therefore not encompassed by the privilege. Instead, \"evidence of refusal to take a potentially incriminating test is similar to other circumstantial evidence of consciousness of guilt, such as escape from custody and suppression of evidence.\" 459 U.S. at 560-61,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200055\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/553/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court ultimately grounded its ruling, however, on the alternative rationale that, because a defendant has a choice in taking or refusing to take the test, the blood test is not coerced, and therefore the refusal is not protected by the privilege.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 561-64,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200055\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/553/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It follows, therefore, that introduction of evidence of such refusal does not violate the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {38} The Court did not address in\n   <em>\n    Neville\n   </em>\n   whether the admission of evidence of refusal to consent to a blood test infringed on a defendant's Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches. Since\n   <em>\n    Neville\n   </em>\n   , however, the United States Supreme Court has spoken to that question twice. First, the court addressed the question in\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   in connection with its holding that the natural metabolization of alcohol in the bloodstream does not constitute a per se exigency that justifies non-consensual, warrantless blood testing. In response to the state's argument that its compelling interest in combating drunk driving justified a per se exigency exception, the Court noted with approval the availability of other means of addressing the problem, including introduction of evidence of refusal to consent to a BAT:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   States have a broad range of legal tools to enforce their drunk-driving laws and to secure BAC evidence without undertaking warrantless nonconsensual blood draws.

Defendant failed the standardized FSTs.

It also says that even if you do not have that level of alcohol in your blood, that it is by level of \"impairment.\" So the level of impairment is really what they go on. It's not, even if you are under the legal amount, if you cannot drive safely, then you shouldn't be driving. Um, after that it goes for alcohol and tobacco-or not tobacco-but, ... marijuana or any other impairing substances, even medicated, prescribed drugs ... affect how you can function behind the wheel of a car. And if you have anything that impairs your ability to drive, you shouldn't be driving. And that's\n   different for different people. Some people can probably down a couple of beers and be functioning behind the wheel of a car, but other people probably have half a beer and not be able to function. So really it's level of function and then whatever the legal standard is of ... allowed substance in the bloodstream.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   I believe that no one should be drinking or doing alcohol or drugs anyway, but that's-if it's legal, then they can do it. But, I don't believe if they are under the influence ... that they should be driving.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   [To determine whether somebody is unable to drive,] I would need to know ... how much alcohol is in their bloodstream and I would need to know if they have passed or failed the ... sobriety tests-the coordination. So if the officer is of [the opinion] that they had passed within satisfactory measures, then I would be okay with that. But if they- had shown that they had not passed the ... coordination the other tests that the officer's conduct, then as far as I'm concerned, he's impaired.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {53} Following completion of voir dire, and while the trial court and counsel were selecting the jury but outside the presence of the venire panel, the prosecutor made the following comment about Pilcher: \"As far as a non-attorney juror, I think that Mr. Pilcher has most accurately stated what the standard is for driving while intoxicated out of any individual I've ever run across. This is an individual who knows the law and accurately recited it to the court. He doesn't drink. He doesn't use drugs. But he's also said he will follow the law and he has to find impairment in order to convict and this is an individual who actually knows the law.\" The prosecutor continued, \"And Your Honor, regarding the statement of law, there is actually case law and if the court wants me to go get it right now, I will, that says driving while impaired to the slightest degree is exactly the same as driving while incapable of operating safely. The Court of Appeals has decided that that language is basically interchangeable and means the same thing.\" The trial court ultimately struck Mr. Pilcher for cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Prosecutor's Comments During Closing Argument on the Legal Standard for DUI\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {54} During the State's closing argument, the prosecutor distinguished the correct standard for DUI with drugs (incapable of safely driving a vehicle ( Section 66-8-102(B) )), from the standard for DUI with alcohol (impairment to the slightest degree ( Section 66-8-102(A) ; UJI 14-4501 NMRA)).\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The prosecutor then stated, \"Any impairment by a drug renders you incapable of operating a vehicle[.]\" Defense counsel immediately objected and moved for a mistrial. The trial judge sustained the objection, characterizing the prosecutor's statement as \"a misstatement of the law\" and telling the prosecutor to rephrase his statement, but denied the mistrial motion. The prosecutor suggested rephrasing to say \"any intoxicating drug,\" although it is unclear what exactly the prosecutor planned to say, and the trial judge added \"may impair.\" The prosecutor then continued with closing argument by stating, \"Defendant was impaired by marijuana, and there's plenty of evidence to support that. And any impairment, the smallest impairment by an intoxicating drug makes you unsafe. Half a second difference is unsafe. Six seconds, six seconds is way unsafe. Not even noticing that you've grazed a barrier because you're high is unsafe.\" Defense counsel did not object to this rephrasing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Trial Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Denying a Mistrial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {55} Defendant insists that the trial court \"abused its discretion in refusing to grant a mistrial in the face of the prosecution's continuing efforts to mislead the jury with misstatement and misapplication of the law.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {56} First, the prosecutor's comments during jury selection were made to the trial court out of the presence of the venire panel. Whether or not the prosecutor's characterization of the law was incorrect, Defendant cannot claim any resulting prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {57} Second, after the prosecutor stated in closing argument that, \"Any impairment by a drug renders you incapable of operating a vehicle,\" the trial court sustained defense counsel's objection, characterized the prosecutor's statement as \"a misstatement of the law\" and told the prosecutor to rephrase his statement. We cannot say that these actions by the trial court, together with the definition of the offense contained in the instructions that the jury ultimately received and to which Defendant does not object, did not eliminate any prejudice that Defendant otherwise might have suffered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   {58} Further, following the trial court's instruction to rephrase his statement, the prosecutor stated: \"[D]efendant was impaired by marijuana, and there's plenty of evidence to support that. And\n   <em>\n    any impairment, the smallest impairment by an intoxicating drug makes you unsafe\n   </em>\n   . Half a second difference is unsafe. Six seconds, six seconds is way unsafe. Not even noticing that you've grazed a barrier because you're high is unsafe.\" Defense counsel did not object to this rephrasing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   {59} The emphasized language essentially repeats the prosecutor's previous misstatement of the law. But he then blunted any impact of the error by equating \"impairment\" to the evidence of Defendant's unsafe driving as opposed to his mental state. We note as well that, prior to making this comment, the prosecutor himself had articulated the difference in the legal standards for driving under the influence of alcohol versus drugs. Consequently, we view the error as harmless under the circumstances. But in any event, defense counsel failed to object, and therefore waived the error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   {60} Third, Defendant suggests that the lengthy statement of venire panel member Pilcher had already tainted the jury's collective thinking and predisposed them to apply an incorrect legal standard for establishing driving under the influence of a drug. This amounts to speculation. There is no evidence that the jury members did not follow the trial court's instructions regarding this standard and that the jury generally must follow its instructions. The trial court is given, and must exercise, considerable discretion in evaluating the propriety of argument and in curing any alleged defects. The trial court denied Defendant's motion for new trial, stating that the prosecutor's comments had not deprived Defendant of a fair trial. \"We believe that the court acted within the proper bounds of its discretion, and we will not reverse a decision denying a new trial on such a record.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
