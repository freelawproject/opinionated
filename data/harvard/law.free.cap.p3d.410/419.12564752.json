A.R.S. \u00a7 8-863(C) ; Ariz. R.P. Juv. Ct. (\"Rule\") 66(D)(2). We address here how the statute and rule apply when a parent, without good cause, appears late for a termination adjudication hearing, after the juvenile court has already found waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 We hold that a parent who fails to timely appear for a duly-noticed termination adjudication hearing has \"failed to appear\" under \u00a7 8-863(C) and Rule 66(D)(2). We further hold that if a juvenile court, faced with a parent's non-appearance, exercises its discretion to proceed with the hearing in the parent's absence after finding waiver of the parent's legal rights, the rights waived include the parent's due process rights to be present and to participate and testify in the hearing. If the parent never appears, when the hearing concludes the parent will be deemed to have admitted the factual allegations in the motion. On the other hand, if the parent appears late, but before the termination adjudication hearing is concluded, the parent may exercise his or her rights to testify, present evidence, and participate for the duration of the hearing; thus, the waiver of the parent's legal rights is effective only until the parent's arrival and then ends. The tardy parent, however, may not seek to start the hearing anew by re-examining witnesses or reopening evidence that has already been presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 These waiver rules, however, do not apply to a parent's right to counsel at a termination adjudication hearing, a right that is unaffected by the parent's appearance or absence. A parent's counsel may fully participate in the hearing, including by contesting the motion's factual allegations. Finally, we hold that when a juvenile court finds that a parent waived his or her legal rights, the state must nevertheless satisfy its burden of proof by presenting sufficient evidence to establish an alleged ground for termination and for a finding that termination is in the child's best interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 Brenda D. is Z.D.'s biological mother. Z.D. was born in 2005 with Down Syndrome and has permanent special needs. In July 2014, DCS took custody of Z.D. and filed a petition alleging that Z.D. was dependent due to Brenda's neglect. The juvenile court found Z.D. dependent in May 2015. The court ordered a case plan of family reunification. Over several months, DCS provided Brenda with various reunification and rehabilitative services, but Brenda's participation in those services was, at best, sporadic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 In October 2015, DCS filed a motion to terminate Brenda's parental rights. (DCS also filed a motion to terminate Z.D.'s multiple alleged fathers' parental rights, which are not at issue here.) As grounds for the severance, DCS alleged Brenda's history of substance abuse and Z.D.'s out-of-home placement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 8-533(B)(3), (B)(8)(a), (B)(8)(c) (authorizing, respectively, termination based on substance abuse, and out-of-home placement for six months and for fifteen months).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 In early November, the juvenile court held an initial termination hearing, which Brenda attended. At that hearing the court scheduled the termination adjudication hearing for two days beginning on June 15, 2016,\n   at 1:30 p.m. The court provided Brenda with a written notice (\"Form 3\") that contained the following provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   You are required to attend all termination hearings. If you cannot attend a court hearing, you must prove to the Court that you had good cause for not attending. If you fail to attend the Initial Termination Hearing, Termination Pretrial Conference, or Termination Adjudication Hearing without good cause, the Court may determine that you have waived your legal rights, and admitted the allegations in the motion/petition for termination. The hearings may go forward in your absence, and the Court may terminate your parental rights to your child based on the record and evidence presented.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Ariz. R.P. Juv. Ct. Form 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 Form 3 also stated that the termination adjudication hearing was scheduled for June 15 and 16 at 1:30 p.m. Brenda signed the form, which the juvenile court also read in open court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 65(D)(3) (requiring the juvenile court at the initial termination hearing to notify a parent of the substance of Form 3). Brenda indicated that she understood the notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 Nevertheless, Brenda did not appear on June 15, the first scheduled day of the termination adjudication hearing. Instead, she called the court and claimed that she was experiencing severe back pain. The court continued the start of the hearing until the next day and ordered Brenda to appear in person with medical documentation of her back pain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9 The following day, however, Brenda again failed to appear at the 1:30 p.m. scheduled start time. She called the court stating that she was running ten minutes late. But when the court began the hearing at 1:50 p.m., Brenda was still absent. After noting that the State's counsel, the DCS case manager, the guardian ad litem, and Brenda's counsel were all present, the juvenile court found that Brenda did not have \"good cause for her failure to appear\" and that she \"waived her right to contest.\" The court also instructed Brenda's counsel that he only had \"an opportunity to address ... the weight of the evidence, not the admissibility of the evidence\" during the hearing. Brenda's counsel did not object.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10 The court proceeded with the termination adjudication hearing. After the State questioned the DCS case manager, the guardian ad litem elicited testimony from that witness supporting termination of Brenda's parental rights. Brenda's counsel, in turn, cross-examined the case manager about Brenda's history of substance abuse, participation in rehabilitative services, and behavior during supervised visitations with Z.D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11 After the DCS case manager finished testifying, the juvenile court noted at 2:14 p.m. that Brenda had \"just walked in.\" The court then reviewed several exhibits and found that DCS had proven all three statutory grounds for termination by clear and convincing evidence. While the court was in the process of finding by a preponderance of the evidence that termination was in Z.D.'s best interests, Brenda interjected, \"No, it's not\" and \"I'm a good mom.\" In addition, Brenda asked to \"say something,\" but the court denied her request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 12 The juvenile court finished making its findings relating to Z.D.'s best interests and then terminated Brenda's parental rights. The court stated, however, that if Brenda presented appropriate documentation of her back pain, she could move for reconsideration of the court's finding that she did not have good cause for her failure to appear at both scheduled days of the termination hearing. Brenda did not move for reconsideration, produce any medical documentation, or otherwise challenge the court's finding of no good cause for her failure to appear on the first scheduled day of the termination hearing and for her tardy arrival on the hearing's second scheduled day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13 The court of appeals, though accepting the juvenile court's finding that Brenda \"had no good cause for her failure to appear at the start of the termination hearing,\" reversed the termination order and remanded for further proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Brenda D. v.

According to DCS, \"Only after finding that the [non-appearing] parent\n   has waived her rights may the juvenile court proceed in the parent's absence,\" because \"proceeding with the hearing in the parent's absence\" without first finding waiver would violate the parent's due process rights. Brenda counters, and the court of appeals agreed, that a parent \"has not failed to appear without good cause merely by arriving tardy at a termination hearing\" for purposes of \u00a7 8-863(C) and Rule 66(D)(2), and thus she did not waive any of her legal rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 19 We agree with DCS. Both \u00a7 8-863(C) and Rule 66(D)(2) are premised on a juvenile court having previously scheduled a termination adjudication hearing and having properly notified a parent of the hearing date and scheduled start time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 64(C) (identifying the hearing notice's contents, including potential consequences of \"failure to appear\" at termination adjudication hearing); Rule 65(D)(3) (requiring juvenile court to advise parent at initial termination hearing of Form 3 contents and consequences of failure to appear at termination adjudication hearing, and to \"make specific findings\" on those points). The statute and rule implicitly, but necessarily, require a parent's timely appearance at the termination adjudication hearing and authorize a juvenile court, in its discretion, to find waiver of a parent's legal rights if she fails to timely appear. Rule 66(D)(2) clearly contemplates that a hearing will proceed in a parent's absence only after the juvenile court determines that the parent has \"failed to appear.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 20 When a parent fails to appear at a duly-noticed termination adjudication hearing, a juvenile court may invoke the substantive effects of that failure, including proceeding with the hearing in the parent's absence, only after finding that the procedural prerequisites have been met. Rule 66(D)(2) requires the court to find that the parent had previously been notified of \"the consequences of failure to appear.\" That notice must also include \"a warning that the hearing could go forward in the absence of the parent.\" Rule 66(D)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Rule 64(C) (requiring notice to \"advise the parent ... that the hearing may go forward in the absence of the parent\"). If we interpreted Rule 66(D)(2) as Brenda suggests, then such a warning would be unnecessary or meaningless because a juvenile court could only determine whether a parent has \"failed to appear\" at the end of the hearing, and therefore a hearing could not \"go forward\" without the parent.

Contrary to its assertions, our interpretation of \u00a7 8-863(C) and Rule 66(D)(2) neither results in \"grave consequences\" for a parent who \"arrives even minutes late for a termination adjudication hearing without good cause,\" nor \"dilutes the state's burden of proof\" by \"robb[ing] [such a parent] of the ability to test the state's evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48, 54.

Although claiming that its differing \"interpretation\" of the statute and rule is \"correct,\"\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44, the dissent does not persuasively refute that our interpretation comports with the relevant text and its underlying policies, accommodates constitutional rights and concerns, and more readily lends itself to reasonable application in juvenile court practice. (The dissent, for example, does not say what a juvenile court may or must do if a tardy parent, without good cause, appears at the very end of a termination adjudication hearing right before the evidence is closed.) The dissent also is internally inconsistent, construing \u00a7 8-863(C) as authorizing the juvenile court to find waiver only at the close of evidence and only as to \"\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   legal rights\n   <em>\n    from that point forward\n   </em>\n   ,\" when the statute's \"plain language\" does not say that.\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 28 At bottom, however, there is very little practical difference between our positions. The dissent asserts that Rule 64(C) (which addresses only the notice and not the hearing itself) \"implicitly authorizes the juvenile court to proceed in the parent's absence\" as long as all procedural notice requirements have been met.\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52. But the reason a hearing may constitutionally \"go forward\" in a parent's absence is because the juvenile court is authorized to find, at the start of the hearing, that the parent waived her right to be present and participate, as the dissent acknowledges.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 29 The dissent is instead based on its disagreement with our holding that (1) before the juvenile court may find, at the start of the hearing, that the parent waived her right to be present, it must first find that the parent \"failed to appear\"; and (2) a \"failure to appear\" occurs if the parent does not timely attend. As discussed above, however, our holding is based on \u00a7 8-863(C), Rule 66(D)(2), and Rule 64(C), all of which support our interpretation. For example, Rule 64(C), on which the dissent relies, provides that the notice must inform a parent that \"failure to appear\" at the termination adjudication hearing \"may result in a finding that the parent ... has waived legal rights.\" The dissent would permit the juvenile court to find that a tardy parent waived the limited right \"to participate at the scheduled time,\"\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52, but does not address the condition explicitly provided in Rule 64(C) for a juvenile court to have that authority. Stated differently, when read as a whole and in context, Rule 64(C) (like \u00a7 8-863(C) and Rule 66(D)(2) ) vests the juvenile court with discretion to find that the parent \"waived legal rights\"\n   <em>\n    only after\n   </em>\n   the court first finds that the parent \"fail[ed] to appear.\" The dissent ignores that explicit condition in Rule 64(C), focuses instead on isolated words and phrases in the rule, and strangely analogizes to a criminal procedure rule that contains no such condition, Ariz. R. Crim. P. 9.1.\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. Finally, we respectfully disagree with the dissent's reading of\n   <em>\n    Marianne N.\n   </em>\n   as authorizing a juvenile court to \"go forward\" with a termination adjudication hearing in a parent's absence without finding that the parent failed to appear and waived legal rights.\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.

The consequences of a parent's failure to appear are discussed above and identified in both the statute and rule.

Simply put, it is unfair not to notify a parent in advance that if she arrives even minutes late for a termination adjudication hearing without good cause, and despite the presence of an attorney representing her interests, the juvenile court could find she waived all legal rights and is deemed to have admitted the allegations supporting termination of her parental rights. And imposing these sanctions at the commencement of the hearing unacceptably dilutes the state's burden of proof because the parent is robbed of the ability to test the state's evidence.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11307633\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/745/#p747\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11307633\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/745/#p747\">\n    at 747-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11307633\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/745/#p747\">\n    102 S.Ct. 1388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Before a State may sever completely and irrevocably the rights of parents in their natural child, due process requires that the State support its allegations by at least clear and convincing evidence.\"). Interpreting the statute and rule as operating at the close of evidence if a parent has failed to appear avoids this result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 49 The Majority acknowledges the due process implications of reading the statute and rule as permitting the juvenile court to make the waiver and admission finding at the commencement of the hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. To avoid a violation, the Majority creates a limited and revocable waiver of legal rights and directs that the admission of allegations must occur only if the parent fails to attend any part of the hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-31, 40-42. But the language used in \u00a7 8-863(C) does not support this framework, a shortfall the Majority fails to explain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 50 Whenever a parent \"does not appear\" at the hearing, \u00a7 8-863(C) authorizes the juvenile court to find that \"the parent has waived the parent's legal rights\" and is immediately deemed to have admitted the petition allegations. Under the statute's plain language, this authority is categorical. If this authority can only be exercised at the commencement of the hearing, as the Majority holds, the parent would waive all legal rights, which would include the right to an attorney and for that attorney to cross-examine witnesses and present evidence, and the petition's legal and factual allegations would be deemed admitted. If the authority can only be exercised at the close of evidence, as I conclude, the parent would waive all legal rights from that point forward and the petition's allegations would be deemed admitted, which would restrict the parent's ability to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal. But nothing supports the Majority's hybrid view that the legal rights waived at the start of the hearing under \u00a7 8-863(C) and Rule 66(D)(2) are only those attendant to the parent's presence, that the waiver is revoked if the parent arrives after the hearing commences, or that the court can apply the waiver and admission sanctions at different times. Indeed, the admission of allegations is explicitly triggered \"by the failure to appear,\" which according to the Majority occurs, if at all, at the commencement of the hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 8-863(C). Although the Court should construe an ambiguous statute to avoid unconstitutionality, as the Majority purports to do here, it should not rewrite the statute to do so.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

I disagree, because Rule 64(C) provides a stand-alone basis for doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 52 Rule 64(C) implicitly authorizes the juvenile court to proceed in the parent's absence if the parent is notified in advance of the termination adjudication hearing that the hearing may \"go forward\" in her \"absence\" and \"result in the termination of parental rights based upon the record and evidence presented.\" Because \"going forward\" may\n   only occur at the commencement of the hearing, a parent is explicitly informed of what may occur if she does not arrive timely. Thus, if the juvenile court finds that the parent was given proper notice under Rule 64(C) and yet failed to appear on time, the court can find a voluntary waiver of the parent's right to participate at the scheduled time and then proceed with the hearing.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manuel M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3423767\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/218/205/\">\n    218 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   211 \u00b6 20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3423767\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/218/205/\">\n    181 P.3d at 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (acknowledging that a parent's nonappearance can constitute a constructive waiver of rights that the parent had been specifically informed could be lost by failing to appear).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 53 The Majority asserts that Rule 64(C)\"vests the juvenile court with discretion to find that the parent waived legal rights\n   <em>\n    only after\n   </em>\n   the court first finds that the parent 'failed to appear.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. But the \"go forward\" provision in Rule 64(C) stands apart from the \"failure to appear\" language in the rule, and nothing conditions the court's ability to \"go forward\" on an exercise of its discretion under \u00a7 8-863(C) and Rule 66(D)(2). Just last year we recognized that the \"go forward\" provision operates independently.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marianne N.\n   </em>\n   , 243 Ariz. at 57-58 \u00b6 22,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=401%20P.3d%201002\">\n    401 P.3d at 1006-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing that Rule 64(C)\"authorizes the juvenile court to 'go forward' with a termination adjudication hearing at the time scheduled for a pretrial proceeding if the parent fails to attend without good cause\" and the court is\n   <em>\n    then\n   </em>\n   authorized to \"proceed as contemplated by \u00a7 8-863(C)\" and \"find that a parent has waived her legal rights by failing to appear at the termination adjudication hearing\"). Procedural rules authorizing a court to proceed in the absence of a party given notice of the proceeding are not unique.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Crim. P. 9.1 (authorizing the court to \"go forward in the defendant's absence\" if he was given \"notice of the date and time of the proceeding, notice of the right to be present, and notice that the proceeding would go forward\" in his absence).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 54 Interpreting \u00a7 8-863(C) and Rule 66(D)(2) to mean that an untimely appearance during a termination adjudication hearing is a failure to appear under these authorities, with grave consequences flowing from that determination, is both unsupported by the language of these provisions and constitutionally troubling. Here, Brenda appeared late to the termination adjudication hearing and therefore waived her right to personally participate in the proceedings held before her untimely appearance because she had been informed that the hearing would go forward in her absence. But she did not fail to appear as contemplated by \u00a7 8-863(C) and Rule 66(D)(2). Although the juvenile court erred by finding a waiver of Brenda's legal rights and an admission of the termination allegations at the commencement of the hearing, Brenda has not shown fundamental error. Thus, although I disagree with the Majority's interpretation of \u00a7 8-863(C) and Rule 66(D)(2), I too would affirm the termination order.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
