On appeal, defendant raises two assignments of error. We reject without discussion the second assignment, which challenges the proportionality of defendant's sentence under\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     State v. Rodriguez/Buck\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670897\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/46/\">\n    347 Or. 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670897\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/46/\">\n    217 P.3d 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). We write to address the first assignment, in which defendant argues that the trial court plainly erred in failing to\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   strike the testimony of a witness who said that she \"totally believed\" the victim's disclosure of abuse. For the reasons explained below, we conclude that the trial court did not plainly err, and we therefore affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant was charged by indictment with one count of first-degree sexual abuse based on his alleged contact with a 13-year-old girl, B. Defendant waived his right to a jury trial. At the bench trial, the state presented evidence consisting of B's own testimony as well as the testimony of witnesses who described what B had told them about defendant's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The evidence established that defendant moved in with B, her mother, and her older brother when B was seven or eight years old. B testified that in November or December 2012, when she was 13, defendant touched her vaginal area over her clothes. B testified that she shared that information with her friend, D, within several days of the incident. Several months later, in March or April 2013, B and D together told D's mother, Strawn, about the incident. Strawn testified that she did not immediately share B's disclosure with authorities because B had asked her not to, explaining that she feared the consequences if defendant got in trouble because he was the sole provider for the family. In the course of the state's direct examination of\n   Strawn, the prosecutor asked Strawn to describe her reaction to B's disclosure, and Strawn testified, \"That it wasn't right. I was a little bit, you know, a little shocked at it, because [defendant's] always been, you know, so, like a father figure to her. But, I mean, I totally, I believed her.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   There was also evidence that after making her disclosures to D and Strawn, B told her mother about the\n   incident. According to the mother's testimony, B told her that defendant had touched her by the \"buttocks\" and \"crotch,\" and that B responded by kicking him and leaving the room. B's mother told B to let her know if it happened again, but she did not confront defendant or otherwise disclose the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The incident came to the attention of police in July 2013 when the Department of Human Services (DHS) informed Detective Webb that a parent had overheard a conversation between the parent's child and the child's friend, in which the friend said that B said defendant had touched her. The parent interpreted the account as a description of child sexual abuse and made a report to DHS. Webb testified that he interviewed B, who made statements incriminating defendant. B was later interviewed at a child abuse assessment center by a forensic interviewer, Hasbrouck, who also testified at trial. Hasbrouck testified that B described defendant's touching her \"crotch\" and \"butt,\" and that B also said she had reported the incident to D, Strawn, and her own mother shortly after it occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant's theory at trial was that the abuse never occurred and that B had fabricated the allegations. In support of that theory, defendant's closing argument emphasized what he called \"astounding\" discrepancies between B's accounts of the incident in her various disclosures. Importantly for purposes of this appeal, defendant also attempted to establish that neither Strawn nor B's mother believed B's disclosures. In cross-examination of both witnesses, defendant highlighted their failures to report the incident to authorities, suggesting that those failures reflected their opinions that B was not credible. In closing argument, defendant argued that Strawn had failed to act because she did not believe B:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"[I]s it reasonable to believe that, if [Strawn] really believed [B], that she's going to sit on this information, that she's not going to walk in to [the law office where Strawn worked] and say 'god, I got a tough situation here, I got this sweet kid and she's telling me this sex abuse happened. And I just want to help her and I don't want there to be repercussions. So what do we do? Do we go to the police first or DHS?'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Is it reasonable to believe that [Strawn], with her background, is just going to sit on this information if she really believed it? Or. isn't it obvious that [Strawn] had some real doubts about the story, about the likelihood of this having happened, about the manner in which this is described, and so she doesn't go to her trusted employer or anyone else to discuss this.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant made a similar point as to B's mother, arguing that she would have said something to someone if she believed B's account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court convicted defendant and sentenced him to the mandatory prison term of 75 months under ORS 137.700.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On appeal, in his first assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred in not striking Strawn's testimony on direct examination that she \"totally believed\" B's disclosure. Defendant concedes that he did not preserve that error by objecting below, but argues that the trial court's failure to\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   strike that portion of Strawn's testimony is plain error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

As noted, a central part of defendant's strategy was to cast doubt on whether Strawn and B's mother believed B's disclosures of abuse. That was a theme during defendant's cross-examination of both witnesses as well as his closing argument. In that light, it is at least plausible that defendant made a strategic choice not to object to Strawn's testimony on direct examination that she \"believed\" B, precisely because defendant intended to\n   place that \"belief\" in issue himself by suggesting reasons to doubt it. If defendant's counsel intended to \"open the door\" to an inquiry into whether Strawn believed B, he may have expected that the prosecution would have been permitted to respond by eliciting Strawn's vouching testimony on re-direct examination, making an objection pointless.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

The case turned on the credibility of B, because the state's evidence consisted of B's testimony and the testimony of other witnesses who testified about what B had told them. One of those witnesses was Strawn, the mother of a friend of B's, D. At the outset of its direct examination of Strawn, the state elicited testimony that Strawn had a close relationship with B. Strawn testified, \"I believe I know [B] pretty well. I talk to her a lot. She * * * and [D] were like inseparable for quite a while.\" Strawn also characterized her relationship with B as \"almost\n   the same\" as her relationship with her own daughter, noting that B \"could talk to [her] about anything.\" Thereafter, when asked about her reaction to B's report that defendant had abused her, Strawn testified that she \"totally believed\" B. In my view, Strawn's testimony that she \"totally believed\" B was impermissible vouching under\n   <em>\n    Vargas-Samado\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Higgins\n   </em>\n   , and the trial court's failure to strike it,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , was plain error under\n   <em>\n    Higgins\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The state and majority do not dispute that Strawn's testimony that she \"totally believed\" B was impermissible vouching. But the state argues, and the majority agrees, that the trial court did not plainly err in failing to strike the testimony because defendant may have had a strategic reason for not objecting to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   I respectfully disagree. As mentioned, it is error for a trial court to fail to strike vouching testimony elicited by the state or volunteered on the state's examination, unless the record supports a plausible inference that the defendant made a strategic choice to not object to the testimony.\n   <em>\n    Ramirez-Estrada\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4330427\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/260/312/#p325\">\n    260 Or.App. at 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4330427\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/260/312/#p325\">\n    317 P.3d 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, for example, in\n   <em>\n    Higgins\n   </em>\n   , we rejected the state's claim that the defendant had failed to object to impermissible vouching testimony because he \"might not have wanted to cause the jury to 'dwell on' \" the testimony, where \"nothing in the record indicat[ed] that [the] defendant made any kind of strategic choice not to object[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233420\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/258/177/#p180\">\n    258 Or.App. at 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233420\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/258/177/#p180\">\n    308 P.3d 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Higgins\n   </em>\n   , we also noted that we are \"particularly reluctant\" to draw an inference that a defendant failed to object to impermissible vouching testimony \"in a case that rests almost entirely on the complainant's testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In this case, defendant's defense was that B had fabricated the allegations against him because she was angry with him and wanted attention from others. In support of his assertion that B was not credible, defendant pointed out the inconsistencies in B's statements and that neither\n   Strawn nor B's mother relayed B's reports to authorities. Given that defense, it is not plausible that defendant made a strategic choice not to object to Strawn's testimony that she \"totally believed\" B. That testimony was completely contrary to both defendant's general assertion that B was not credible and his specific assertion that Strawn had not believed B's report to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Contrary to the majority's conclusion, it is not plausible that defendant made a strategic choice not to object to Strawn's impermissible vouching testimony so that he could put Strawn's belief in B's report at issue. Defendant's assertion that Strawn did not believe B was based on Strawn's failure to relay B's report to authorities; it was not dependent on Strawn making an in-court statement about whether she believed B. Defendant was in a position to challenge Strawn's belief based on Strawn's conduct, and he would not have, by making such a challenge, \"opened the door\" for Strawn to engage in impermissible vouching.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     State v.

Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Higgins\n   </em>\n   , we exercised our discretion to review the trial court's failure to strike,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , the complainant's mother's testimony that she knew the complainant \"wasn't lying.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233420\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/258/177/#p180\">\n    258 Or.App. at 181-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233420\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/258/177/#p180\">\n    308 P.3d 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

I disagree. We have expressly rejected the assertion that we should assume that a trial court conducting a bench trial did not consider erroneously admitted evidence.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Lopez-Cruz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222495\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/256/32/\">\n    256 Or.App. at 38-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222495\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/256/32/\">\n    299 P.3d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that, in a case that is largely dependent on a complainant's credibility, a reviewing court must conclude that the admission of impermissible vouching testimony was not harmless, unless the trial court states that it did not rely on the testimony);\n   <em>\n    Almanza-Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4210740\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/242/350/#p351\">\n    242 Or.App. at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4210740\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/242/350/#p351\">\n    255 P.3d 613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that, although the trial court did not mention the challenged evidence in its findings of fact, its failure to do so did not mean that the court did not consider the evidence). Moreover, such an assumption\n   would be particularly unwarranted here, because the state's case depended on B's credibility, which was the subject of Strawn's impermissible vouching testimony, and because the state emphasized that testimony in its closing argument to the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The majority acknowledges that we have corrected the erroneous admission of vouching testimony in other cases involving bench trials, but asserts that those cases are distinguishable because they \"involved vouching testimony by an\n   <em>\n    expert\n   </em>\n   witness.\" 289 Or.App. at 397 n. 1, 410 P.3d at 351 (emphasis added). It is true that Strawn was not an expert witness, in that she did not have professional expertise in the assessment of children's reports\n   of abuse, but the state presented her as someone who had personal expertise regarding B, given their close relationship. As we observed in\n   <em>\n    Higgins\n   </em>\n   , impermissible vouching testimony by a witness who is \"privy to the complainant's behaviors, characteristics, and past experiences\" carries an increased risk of affecting a factfinder's assessment of the complainant's credibility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In sum, because the trial court plainly erred by failing to strike,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , the clear vouching testimony elicited by the state in its examination of Strawn, a person whose opinion regarding the credibility of B's report could carry significant weight, I would, as we have in similar cases, reverse and remand this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Therefore, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    The majority suggests that, if the trial court erred in admitting Strawn's impermissible vouching testimony, this is not an appropriate case for us to exercise our discretion to review the error because the testimony is not \"as dangerous\" as other vouching testimony. 289 Or.App. at 397, --- P.3d at ----. In support, the majority cites\n    <em>\n     Hanson\n    </em>\n    . But\n    <em>\n     Hanson\n    </em>\n    concerned whether the record supported an inference that the defendant made a strategic choice not to object to the challenged vouching evidence, not whether it was unlikely that the evidence affected the verdict. Moreover, we based our conclusion regarding the possibility that the defendant made a tactical decision not to object on several factors, which are not present in this case, including that the challenged testimony was \"not directly related to the victim's allegations of sexual abuse, but, instead, was aimed at a collateral issue\" and, as discussed above, was \"intentionally brought up and used by defendant on cross-examination.\"\n    <em>\n     Hanson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187087\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/280/196/#p203\">\n     280 Or.App. at 204\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187087\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/280/196/#p203\">\n     380 P.3d 1136\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
