P. 35(c) motion of defendant, Israel Chavez-Torres, concluding as a matter of law that\n   <em>\n    Martinez-Huerta\n   </em>\n   foreclosed a hearing to determine whether Chavez-Torres' allegations, if true, would establish justifiable excuse or excusable neglect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 Because we do not read\n   <em>\n    Martinez-Huerta\n   </em>\n   the same way, and because we further conclude that Chavez-Torres alleged facts that, if true, would establish justifiable excuse or excusable neglect, we reverse and remand the case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 Chavez-Torres is a citizen of Mexico who came to the United States with his family when he was a child. While in high school, Chavez-Torres pleaded guilty to first degree criminal trespass. The trial court sentenced him to probation, which he successfully completed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 Seventeen years after his criminal trespass conviction, the United States Department of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings, alleging that Chavez-Torres was not legally present in the United States and had been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6 Chavez-Torres consulted with an immigration attorney who advised him that because of his conviction, he was not eligible for cancellation of removal from the United States. The immigration attorney also advised him that his plea counsel may have been ineffective in not advising him of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 7 Chavez-Torres moved for postconviction relief from his criminal trespass conviction under Crim. P. 35(c). He alleged that, despite the fact that he had informed plea counsel that he was not a citizen of the United States, counsel had advised him to accept the plea agreement without telling him that the guilty plea carried a risk of adverse immigration consequences. He claimed that, had plea counsel properly advised him of this risk, he would have rejected the plea offer and insisted on going to trial. As a result, he asserted that his plea and conviction were constitutionally infirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 8 Chavez-Torres acknowledged that his postconviction motion was untimely. But he alleged that the untimeliness resulted from circumstances amounting to justifiable excuse or excusable neglect because he had no reason to question the constitutional validity of his criminal trespass conviction until the initiation of the removal proceedings. It was only then, he alleged, that he learned his trespass conviction prevented him from remaining in the United States and that his plea counsel may have rendered ineffective assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 9 The district court summarily denied Chavez-Torres' motion. It found that (1) the motion was filed beyond the three-year deadline for postconviction challenges; (2) given the passage of time, \"the prejudice to the state's case would be great\"; and (3) Chavez-Torres had failed to assert facts \"amounting to justifiable excuse or excusable neglect.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II. Justifiable Excuse or Excusable Neglect\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10 Chavez-Torres contends that the district court erred in summarily denying his postconviction motion based on the statutory time bar because (1) he asserted facts that, if true, would establish justifiable excuse or excusable neglect; and (2) the finding that the State would suffer \"great\" prejudice has no record support. We agree as to both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A. Governing Standards\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 A defendant has three years to file a Crim.

The Postconviction Allegations\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 15 Chavez-Torres' postconviction motion alleged that (1) he \"told [his counsel] that he was not a citizen of the United States\"; (2) \"[o]n the advice of his attorney,\" he accepted the plea offer; (3) his attorney \"did not advise him that the plea would prevent him from becoming a lawful permanent resident\" or \"prevent him from applying for cancel[l]ation of removal\"; (4) he was \"unaware\" that the plea would \"prevent him from remaining in the United States\"; (5) he successfully completed his probation in 1998; and (6) he did not learn that his conviction had adverse immigration consequences until the removal proceedings were initiated. In support of his postconviction motion, Chavez-Torres attached his plea agreement, which-unlike some such agreements-contained no notice of possible immigration consequences. And he attached his plea transcript, which again did not refer to possible immigration consequences.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 16 The prosecution did not respond to the postconviction motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 17 Despite the uncontested allegations, the district court summarily denied the postconviction motion. Specifically, relying on\n   <em>\n    Martinez-Huerta\n   </em>\n   , the district court concluded, as a matter of law, that an attorney's failure to advise a client of adverse immigration consequences \"does not establish justifiable excuse or excusable neglect.\" And it concluded that the prejudice to the State's case \"would be great.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Martinez-Huerta\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 18\n   <em>\n    Martinez-Huerta\n   </em>\n   did not address the issue presented here. That is, it did not consider whether allegations that an attorney affirmatively advised her non-citizen client to accept a plea, without also advising the client of related possible immigration consequences, are sufficient to warrant a hearing on justifiable excuse or excusable neglect. Rather,\n   <em>\n    Martinez-Huerta\n   </em>\n   concluded that the defendant's allegation there-that his counsel gave him \"affirmative and erroneous\" advice-was sufficient to warrant a hearing to determine whether the defendant could establish justifiable excuse or excusable neglect.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18. We thus do not agree with the district court that\n   <em>\n    Martinez-Huerta\n   </em>\n   stands for the general proposition that an attorney's mere failure to advise a client of adverse immigration consequences, under the circumstances alleged here, is insufficient, as a matter of law, to establish justifiable excuse or excusable neglect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 19 To be sure, and as the People stress,\n   <em>\n    Martinez-Huerta\n   </em>\n   observed that \"[g]enerally, the absence of, or failure to give, advice does not establish justifiable excuse or excusable neglect.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17.

We thus do not agree that\n   <em>\n    Alexander\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Slusher\n   </em>\n   created a per se rule that an allegation that an attorney failed to give advice-which the attorney has an affirmative legal duty to give-is insufficient to warrant a hearing to determine whether a defendant can demonstrate justifiable excuse or excusable neglect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 21 The People next argue that Chavez-Torres' \"ignorance of the law\" should not excuse his failure to file a timely postconviction motion. In so arguing, the People rely on\n   <em>\n    People v.

But\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Vigil\n   </em>\n   are unhelpful for the same reason that\n   <em>\n    Alexander\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Slusher\n   </em>\n   are not helpful. These cases do not involve counsel's affirmative legal duty to advise a client regarding the risk of immigration consequences. Instead, they recognize the principle that a defendant's ignorance regarding the postconviction time bar cannot constitute justifiable excuse or excusable neglect.\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11537569\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/981/624/#p626\">\n    981 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   626 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vigil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11836817\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/955/589/#p591\">\n    955 P.2d at 591-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 22 But Chavez-Torres has not alleged he should be excused simply because he was unaware of a statutory deadline. He alleged that his plea counsel advised him to plead guilty to criminal trespass, knowing he was not a citizen and without satisfying her legal duty to advise him of the related immigration consequences. And until he became aware of plea counsel's alleged failure to fulfill her legal duty, he asserts that he had no reason to question the constitutionality of his conviction. Chavez-Torres thus alleged facts directly implicating two\n   <em>\n    Wiedemer\n   </em>\n   factors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wiedemer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10352938\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/852/424/\">\n    852 P.2d at 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (whether and when the defendant had reason to question the constitutionality of his conviction).

If such were the case, the supreme court would not have developed a multi-factor inquiry to determine whether a defendant has established justifiable excuse or excusable neglect. Whether a defendant has a present need to challenge a conviction is simply one part of the inquiry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wiedemer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10352938\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/852/424/\">\n    852 P.2d at 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 24 Under these circumstances and in light of Chavez-Torres' Crim.

The Remaining Factors\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 25 As a second basis for summarily denying Chavez-Torres' postconviction motion, the district court found that \"the prejudice to the state's case would be great\" due to the passage of time. The record, however, does not support this factual finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 26 Whether relevant files and witnesses exist is a factual inquiry that must be determined on a case-by-case basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wiedemer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10352938\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/852/424/\">\n    852 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   441 ;\n   <em>\n    Martinez-Huerta\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 13. The answer will not always be the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 27 Although it appears that Chavez-Torres' postconviction motion was sent to the district attorney's office, the prosecution did not object or respond. Nor did the district court seek or require a response. And-as Chavez-Torres points out-the record here includes the plea agreement and the transcripts of the providency hearing and sentencing\n   proceedings. He also alleged that plea counsel is still a practicing Colorado attorney. Absent a response from the prosecution, we cannot say whether this record is sufficient for the prosecution to defend the postconviction motion. At any rate, the existing record does not support the district court's finding that the State will suffer \"great\" prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 28 Finally, other than the passage of time, it is unclear whether the district court considered and weighed the remaining\n   <em>\n    Wiedemer\n   </em>\n   factors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wiedemer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10352938\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/852/424/\">\n    852 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   442 n.20 (\"[T]he best approach for determining whether a defendant satisfies the justifiable excuse or excusable neglect standard under \u00a7 16-5-402(2)(d) is a weighing of the various interests at stake.\"). Specifically, Chavez-Torres alleged that having followed his counsel's advice to accept the plea offer, without discussion of the immigration consequences, he had no reason to question the constitutional validity of his guilty plea until he consulted with an immigration attorney about his removal proceedings. Chavez-Torres thus alleged facts that implicate the second and third\n   <em>\n    Wiedemer\n   </em>\n   factors (whether and when he had reason to question the constitutionality of his conviction). But the record is silent with respect to whether the district court considered and weighed these factors.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.
