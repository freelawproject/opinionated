We hold that when such a defendant possesses an item that is statutorily defined as contraband, the state need prove only that the defendant knowingly possessed the item, not that the defendant knew it was contraband.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 In October 2014, officers booked Darrel Scott Francis into the Navajo County Jail Annex on charges unrelated to this case. Upon booking, officers took and bagged Francis' personal property, including clothing and a cellphone. The next day, Francis asked to call his attorney. When the officer could not find the attorney's number, Francis told her he had it in his cellphone, which the officer retrieved to obtain the number. Later, Francis was transferred to the main jail, where an officer confiscated a cellphone held by Francis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 The State charged Francis under A.R.S. \u00a7 13-2505(A)(1) and (A)(3) with two counts of promoting prison contraband, one for obtaining or possessing the cellphone in the jail annex or during transport and the other for taking it inside the jail grounds. Before trial, the superior court ruled that the State need not prove that Francis knew the cellphone was contraband. The jury found Francis guilty, and the court sentenced him to two concurrent five-year prison terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 The court of appeals reversed Francis' convictions and sentences, applying A.R.S. \u00a7 13-202(A) to conclude that the State had to prove that Francis knew that the cellphone was contraband.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In light of its ruling, the court of appeals declined to address Francis' argument that the trial court also erred by allowing the State to call his former lawyer to testify about Francis' prior convictions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310468\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/449/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 454 \u00b6 24 n.6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310468\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/449/\">\n    388 P.3d at 848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 We granted review to clarify what the state must prove to convict a defendant under A.R.S. \u00a7 13-2505(A), a recurring issue of statewide importance.

As this case involves the intersection of multiple statutes, we construe them together,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=403%20P.3d%20145\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 148 \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=403%20P.3d%20145\">\n    403 P.3d at 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , seeking to give meaning to all provisions.\n   <em>\n    Collins v.

Section 13-2501(1) defines \"contraband\" as \"any dangerous drug, narcotic drug, marijuana, intoxicating liquor of any kind, deadly weapon, dangerous instrument, explosive, wireless communication device, multimedia storage device or other article whose use or possession would endanger the safety, security or preservation of order in a correctional facility.\" It is uncontested that Francis knew he possessed a cellphone at the relevant times and that a cellphone is a \"wireless communication device\" defined as contraband under \u00a7 13-2501(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 Francis argues, and the court of appeals majority agreed, that the State had to prove that he knew that the cellphone was contraband. The court of appeals relied on A.R.S. \u00a7 13-202(A), which provides that \"[i]f a statute defining an offense prescribes a culpable mental state that is sufficient for commission of the offense without distinguishing\n   among the elements of such offense, the prescribed mental state shall apply to each such element unless a contrary legislative purpose plainly appears.\"\n   <em>\n    Francis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310468\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/449/\">\n    241 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   452 \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310468\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/449/\">\n    388 P.3d at 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because \u00a7 13-2505(A) requires a defendant to \"knowingly\" obtain or possess contraband, the court construed it \"to require proof not only that the defendant knowingly obtained or possessed a proscribed object, but also that the defendant knew the object was contraband, within the meaning of the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310468\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/449/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 453 \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310468\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/449/\">\n    388 P.3d at 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 The statutory scheme as a whole, however, does not require proof that Francis knew the cellphone was statutorily defined as \"contraband.\" Section 13-105(10)(b) defines \"knowingly\" in this context to mean \"that a person is aware or believes that the person's conduct is of that nature or that the circumstance exists. It does not require any knowledge of the unlawfulness of the act or omission.\" Section 13-204(B) further establishes that \"[i]gnorance or mistake as to a matter of law does not relieve a person of criminal responsibility.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 Reading the statutes together refutes Francis' argument and the court of appeals' conclusion that it was necessary for the State, in addition to proving that Francis knew he had a cellphone, to also prove he knew it was contraband. Had \u00a7 13-2505(A) proscribed possession of wireless communication devices instead of listing it among other items under the category \"contraband,\" there would be no question that the State would only have to prove that Francis knew he possessed a cellphone because \"knowingly\" would relate directly to the wireless communications device. The outcome is not different merely because the legislature defined contraband in a separate section. Because \"contraband\" is a statutorily defined term, \u00a7 13-2505(A) effectively prohibits the \"knowing\" possession of the items listed in \u00a7 13-2501(1). It does not by its terms require a defendant to know that such items cannot be lawfully possessed while in a correctional facility or while being transported to one, which comports with the other statutes generally declaring that knowledge of unlawfulness is not an element of crimes and that ignorance of the law is not a defense. Francis' unawareness that his cellphone was contraband was \"ignorance or mistake as to a matter of law,\" which is not a defense and thus knowledge of his cellphone's legal status is not an element of the crime unless the legislature clearly so states.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-204(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 This construction gives effect to all five statutes at issue. It requires proof that Francis knowingly committed every element of the crime ( \u00a7 13-202(A) ), including that he knowingly obtained or possessed (and took into a correctional facility) contraband ( \u00a7 13-2505(A)(1), (A)(3) ), the definition of which includes cellphones (\u00a7 13-2501(1) ), but knowledge of its unlawfulness is not an element of the crime (\u00a7 13-105(10)(b) ), and about which Francis' ignorance or mistake is not a defense (\u00a7 13-204(B) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 Our decision is in line with United States Supreme Court jurisprudence. That Court has repeatedly held that knowledge of an act, even without understanding its legal significance, can establish the culpable mental state necessary for conviction of a crime that must be \"knowingly\" committed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McFadden v.

The government could show that the defendant knew that the substance was controlled or an analogue, even if he did not know its identity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590298\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2298/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Or, more relevant here, he could be convicted if he \"knew the specific features of the substance that make it a 'controlled substance analogue.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590298\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2298/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting 21 U.S.C \u00a7 802(32)(A) ).
