Over the course of a few months he filmed his stepsister on one occasion and her husband on three occasions. Once the filming did not capture anyone. A jury convicted Mason of four counts of voyeurism and one count of attempted voyeurism. On appeal, he claims that his multiple convictions for the same victim violated his double jeopardy rights, and that there was insufficient evidence that he filmed for the purpose of sexual gratification. He also argues that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct, that his counsel was ineffective, and that several of his conditions of community custody are unlawful. We agree with Mason's challenges to the conditions of community custody, but conclude that his other claims lack merit. We affirm his conviction, but remand for the trial court to strike, and/or amend the unlawful community custody conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    FACTS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 In the early morning hours of November 28, 2015, Jack Keend used the bathroom that he shared with his wife, Hannah, and her stepbrother, Eric Mason. He noticed a camera inside a wicker decoration on top of the toilet. Jack removed the camera and brought it to his father in law, Doug Peterson. They confronted Mason, who denied responsibility. Jack and Doug turned the camera on and watched video of Mason setting it up. Doug called the police. An officer came to the house and arrested Mason. In reference to the camera, Mason said to the officer, \"[t]here's nothing on there.\" Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) at 132.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 A detective analyzed the contents of the camera, which contained five separate videos, four of which recorded\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Hannah or Jack in the bathroom. In the beginning of the first video, recorded on October 4, 2015 at 10:32 p.m., Mason is seen setting up the camera. The camera points toward the shower, and Hannah is seen from the shoulders up entering and exiting the shower.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Three other videos show Jack using the bathroom. Each begins with Mason setting up and angling the camera toward the door, so the whole bathroom can be seen. At a certain point, Jack enters the bathroom, urinates, and exits. These videos were recorded on October 6 at 9:50 p.m., October 7 at 10:41 p.m., and November 27 at 11:53 p.m. One video, recorded November 22 at 9:42 p.m., shows only Mason setting up the camera, with no other person entering the bathroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Mason was charged with four counts of voyeurism, one count of attempted voyeurism, and possession of methamphetamine. At trial, Mason admitted filming, but said the videos were \"not sexual at all.\" VRP at 227. He explained that his purpose was to make Jack feel violated because Jack had previously\n   walked into Mason's room while his girlfriend was partially dressed. Mason also said that he was collecting video evidence that Jack cooked the family dinner after urinating and not washing his hands. Mason intended to make a presentation to the family \"so they can digest their own dysfunction.\" VRP at 226.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Hannah testified that she always showered between 10:30pm and midnight. In closing, the State urged that the jury infer that the timing of Mason's recordings, all initiated between 9:42 p.m. and 11:53 p.m., showed his intent to capture Hannah undressed in the bathroom. The State also argued that the jury could infer Mason's purpose from his careful readjustment of the camera after his first attempt failed to capture Hannah's full body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 The jury convicted Mason as charged. His sentence included community custody conditions. The court also ordered that he pay a $500 victim assessment and $200 criminal filing fee. Mason appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Double Jeopardy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 Mason argues that the unit of prosecution for voyeurism is per victim, so his three voyeurism convictions for Jack violate double jeopardy. The State argues that the unit of prosecution here is per viewing, so the three recordings support three convictions. Because both parties are correct, Mason's claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 Mason's double jeopardy claim raises an issue of statutory interpretation, which we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    State v.

It unambiguously makes each instance of filming a separate violation of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b612 Mason disputes that the statute permits a unit of prosecution that is per instance of filming. He contends that the correct unit\n   of prosecution is per victim. In his view, the three counts involving Jack should have been charged as one count. In support of this contention, he relies on\n   <em>\n    State v. Diaz-Flores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3982212\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/148/911/\">\n    148 Wash.

We held that \"[t]he plain language of the voyeurism statute establishes that the legislature intended the unit of prosecution to be each victim whose right to privacy is violated.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 917,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=201%20P.3d%201073\">\n    201 P.3d 1073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Mason's reliance on the case is misplaced, however, because there, unlike in this case, neither victim was viewed more than once. Thus we did not have occasion to consider whether double jeopardy precluded multiple punishments for the same victim viewed multiple times. As discussed above, now having considered that question in light of the statute, we conclude it does not. In addition to establishing the unit of prosecution to be each victim, as we held in\n   <em>\n    Diaz-Flores\n   </em>\n   , the statute also clearly makes each instance of filming a separate criminal act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b613 Here, Mason made each recording separated by at least 24 hours, which are clearly distinct instances of filming that support multiple convictions. We hold that the convictions do not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b614 The remainder of this opinion has no precedential value.

Hannah showered between 10:30 p.m. and midnight, and the filming always began between 9:42 p.m. and 11:53 p.m. A rational juror could reasonably infer from this timing that Mason intended to film Hannah during her shower, and that his purpose was sexual gratification. In addition, Mason first pointed the camera straight toward the shower, and captured only brief, blurry images of Hannah from the shoulders up. Mason then adjusted the camera for a clear view of the entire bathroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b619 Mason cites his own testimony to argue that he filmed for a nonsexual purpose.

The prosecutor went on to argue that this initial denial demonstrated that Mason's testimony about a nonsexual motive was not credible. Mason argues that the quoted portion of the closing statement constitutes prosecutorial misconduct. In isolation, that section does ask the defendant to explain a lack of culpability. But viewed in the context of the argument as a whole that the State was discussing the defendant's credibility, which Mason placed at issue through his testimony.

He maintains that the trial court erred in assessing the mandatory $500 victim assessment and $200 court costs without a determination of whether he had the future ability to pay. Mason relies on\n   <em>\n    Blazina\n   </em>\n   , which requires an individualized inquiry for discretionary LFOs. The trial court here did not impose discretionary LFOs. We have previously held that\n   <em>\n    Blazina\n   </em>\n   does not apply to mandatory LFOs, and that a challenge to whether a LFO violates due process is not ripe for review until the State attempts to collect the obligation.

His arguments on sufficiency of the evidence and double jeopardy were adequately addressed by his counsel in the opening brief, so they are not proper for a statement of additional grounds under RAP 10.10. His remaining arguments lack merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b631 Mason first argues that the prosecutor's objection to defense counsel's closing argument relieved the State of its burden and eroded the presumption of innocence. Mason objects to the following exchange:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   [Defense counsel:] The issue of arousal, gratification is a completely different issue. And the State has not introduced any evidence to show that my client would try to be aroused by his stepsister, by seeing his stepsister.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Mr. Anderson: Objection, Your Honor.

Mason contends that the trial court's ruling augmented the potential prejudice, because it gave judicial imprimatur to the prosecution's objection. We fail to see how either the objection or the court's ruling thereon, shifted the burden of proof or eroded the presumption of innocence. We reject Mason's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b632 Mason next argues that the information was insufficient because it did not identify a specific victim for attempted voyeurism in count four. In addition to adequately identifying the crime charged, the charging document must allege facts supporting every element of the offense.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Under the cumulative error doctrine, a defendant may be entitled to a new trial when cumulative errors results in a trial that is fundamentally unfair.\n   <em>\n    State v.
