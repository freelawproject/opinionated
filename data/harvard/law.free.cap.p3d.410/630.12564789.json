Fritsche (husband) appeals from the district court's order dismissing his complaint, which asserted fraud, theft, and conversion claims against Elizabeth Fritsche Thoreson (wife). We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 Husband and wife filed for divorce in 2006. The final decree was issued in April 2007 and incorporated the parties' negotiated allocation of marital assets. In January 2013, wife allegedly disclosed, for the first\n   time, income of $69,399 that she had earned in 2011 from an employment-related lawsuit. In July 2013, wife filed sworn financial statements that allegedly disclosed, for the first time, a pension from IBM in the amount of $111,575.94. In the parties' original memorandum of understanding, wife stated that she did not then hold retirement benefits with IBM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 In November 2013, husband filed with the domestic relations court a motion to modify the final decree under C.R.C.P. 16.2. Through this motion, husband sought to reopen the settlement agreement for a determination of the appropriate allocation of these previously undisclosed assets. The court did not rule on the motion within the sixty-three day period required by C.R.C.P. 59(j) and, thus, it was deemed denied in January 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 In June 2014, husband filed a motion for relief from judgment under C.R.C.P. 60(a) and (b) in the district court. In August 2014, the district court denied the motion, ruling that because, under C.R.C.P. 16.2(e)(10), the domestic relations court lost jurisdiction over the case five years after the final decree was issued, husband's motion, which was filed about six and one-half years later, was untimely. Husband then filed an independent equitable action in district court, asserting fraud, theft, and conversion claims against wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 In October 2014, wife moved to dismiss husband's complaint under C.R.C.P. 12(b)(5), 16.2(e)(10), and 60. The district court granted wife's motion, ruling that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [the] case is dismissed pursuant to the holding in\n   <em>\n    In re Marriage of Schelp,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6992761\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/228/151/\">\n    228 P.3d 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Colo. 2010). [Husband's] sole avenue for relief is (was) the domestic relations case, but any such claims are barred by the five-year statute of limitations. [Husband] has failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted under any theory of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II. Discussion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 Husband has raised numerous issues in his opening brief; however, many overlap or are repetitive. Thus, we reduce his contentions of error into two basic questions: (1) Did the district court err by concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain husband's claim because his only recourse was in the domestic relations court, which lost jurisdiction five years after the entry of final orders; and (2) did the district court err by concluding that husband had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted? We answer both questions \"no.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 We review the district court's dismissal of husband's complaint de novo, accepting all allegations of material fact in the complaint as true.\n   <em>\n    Bristol Co. v.

Rule 16.2(e)(10)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 The first basis for the district court's dismissal was its interpretation of Rule 16.2(e)(10) and\n   <em>\n    Schelp\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Rule 16.2(e)(10) provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   it is the duty of parties to an action for decree of dissolution of marriage, legal separation, or invalidity of marriage, to provide full disclosure of all material assets and liabilities. If the disclosure contains misstatements or omissions, the court shall retain jurisdiction after the entry of a final decree or judgment for a period of 5 years to allocate material assets or liabilities, the omission or non-disclosure of which materially affects the division of assets and liabilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Rule 16.2(e)(10) also provides that it \"shall not limit other remedies that may be available to a party by law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 9 In\n   <em>\n    Schelp,\n   </em>\n   the supreme court held that Rule 16.2(e)(10) rendered Rule 60(b)'s six-month jurisdiction window inactive and \"[did] not allow the trial courts to retain jurisdiction to modify property divisions based on disclosures made pursuant to petitions for dissolution that were filed before the effective date of [ Rule 16.2(e)(10) ].\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6992761\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/228/151/\">\n    228 P.3d at 152, 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, we conclude that\n   <em>\n    Schelp's\n   </em>\n   holding is not relevant here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 10 Further, because it does not affect the outcome of this case, we will assume, without deciding, that after implementation of Rule 16.2, a party to the original domestic relations proceedings may file an independent equitable action in district court related to the domestic relations court proceedings after the expiration of that five-year period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   B. Failure to State a Claim\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 11 The second basis for the district court's dismissal is its conclusion that husband failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. We perceive no basis for reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 12 Generally, a party may facially attack a prior judgment or decree on the grounds of fraud or mistake.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Marriage of Gance,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9451800\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/36/114/#p117\">\n    36 P.3d 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 117 (Colo.
