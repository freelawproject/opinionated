(2017), and participated in a hearing on the guardian ad litem's (\"GAL\") motion to terminate the parent-child legal relationship between the mother and the child. The trial court denied the motion. Neither the Department nor the GAL appealed the trial court's ruling. Instead, the foster parents appealed, seeking to reverse the trial court's order. The narrow question before us is whether the foster parents had standing to appeal the trial court's ruling. The court of appeals concluded they did. We granted the GAL's petition for a writ of certiorari to review the court of appeals' decision and now reverse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 We hold that, although section 19-3-507(5)(a) permits foster parents to intervene in dependency and neglect proceedings following adjudication, foster parents here do not have a legally protected interest in the outcome of termination proceedings, and section 19-3-507(5)(a) does not automatically confer standing to them to appeal the juvenile court's order denying the termination motion at issue, where neither the Department nor the GAL sought review of the trial court's ruling. Moreover, because the GAL is statutorily obligated to advocate for the best interests of the child, including on appeal, there is no need to confer standing on foster parents to represent the best interests of the child on appeal. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the case with instructions to dismiss the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b63 When C.W.B., Jr. was four weeks old, he underwent open heart surgery. At a follow-up appointment six weeks later, doctors discovered fractures to his femur and skull-injuries consistent with child abuse. The hospital contacted the Montezuma County Department of Social Services (\"the Department\"), and the Department filed a petition in dependency and neglect on June 24, 2014. The trial court granted temporary custody of C.W.B., Jr. to the Department and the Department eventually placed him with foster parents, J.S. and A.S. C.W.B., Jr.'s mother (\"Mother\") and father (\"Father\") both admitted that the child was dependent or neglected pursuant to section 19-3-102(1)(c), C.R.S. (2017), due to an injurious environment. The trial court then adjudicated the child as dependent or neglected and adopted treatment plans for both parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b64 Father was later arrested for child abuse charges and pled guilty to one felony count of child abuse. The Department moved to terminate Father's parental rights. The trial court granted the motion after a hearing in February 2016. Father is not a party to this appeal and Father's parent-child legal relationship with C.W.B., Jr. is not at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 Mother initially had some trouble complying with her treatment plan, and by late September 2014, the trial court had changed the permanency plan to adoption with the concurrent plan of family reunification. However, throughout early 2015, Mother began to participate more consistently in the treatments outlined in her treatment plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 Meanwhile, in April 2015, the foster parents moved to intervene in the dependency and neglect proceedings under section 19-3-507(5)(a). The trial court granted the motion and allowed the foster parents to participate as intervenors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 Mother continued to work on her treatment plan, and in June 2015, she moved to change the permanency goal back to reunification. At a permanency hearing in October 2015, the court ordered more frequent visitations for Mother but did not formally change the permanency plan. However, in November 2015, the Department reported that Mother had successfully completed her treatment plan and requested that the permanency goal be changed from adoption back to reunification within six months, by March 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 In December 2015, the Department filed an update with the court in which it proposed that C.W.B., Jr. be moved to a new foster home closer to Mother's residence to facilitate visits with her. The Department also expressed concern that the current foster parents appeared to present a conflict with the Department's requested goal of reunification because they were too attached to the child and \"want[ed] adoption to happen for them.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 Later that month, the GAL moved to terminate Mother's parental rights, contending that she had not complied with her treatment plan and was an unfit parent. Nevertheless, in mid-January 2016, the trial court modified the permanency goal back to reunification and ordered overnight visits with Mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 After a two-day hearing in April 2016, the trial court denied the motion to terminate Mother's parental rights, ultimately finding that Mother had reasonably complied with the treatment plan and that the GAL had failed to prove that she was an unfit parent. Neither the Department nor the GAL appealed the trial court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 Instead, the foster parents, in their role as intervenors in the dependency and neglect case, and acting alone, filed an appeal in the court of appeals, seeking reversal of the trial court's order denying the motion to terminate Mother's parental rights. The Department filed a brief in response, asking the court of appeals to uphold the trial court's order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 After reviewing the foster parents' petition on appeal, the court of appeals issued an order to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed for lack of standing. In response, the foster parents argued that they had standing to appeal under section 19-3-507(5)(a) and this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    A.M. v. A.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6979999\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/296/1026/\">\n    2013 CO 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 40,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6979999\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/296/1026/\">\n    296 P.3d 1026\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1038, which held that \"foster parents who meet the required statutory criteria to intervene may participate fully in the termination hearing without limitation.\" The court of appeals subsequently ordered supplemental briefing on the standing issue. In their supplemental brief, the foster parents argued that they had standing to appeal because they had been made a party to the case under section 19-3-507(5)(a) and that no party currently represented the child's best interests because the GAL had not filed an appeal. The GAL and Office of the Child's Representative filed supplemental briefs opposing the foster parents' standing to appeal, arguing that the GAL has exclusive statutory authority to represent the child's best interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b613 In a published, split decision, the court of appeals affirmed the trial court's order denying the termination motion.\n   <em>\n    People in Interest of C.W.B., Jr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20COA%2068\">\n    2017 COA 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , --- P.3d ----. Relevant here, the panel majority held that the foster parents had standing to appeal the trial court's order denying the termination motion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9-19. It reasoned that the foster parents suffered an injury in fact \"inasmuch as they were arguably positioned to adopt the child in the event the mother's parental rights had been terminated.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. The majority concluded that this injury was to a legally protected interest because section 19-3-507(5)(a) allows foster parents to intervene in the dependency and neglect proceedings as a matter of right, and it inferred from this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    A.M.\n   </em>\n   that \"the statute gives qualifying foster parents a right to represent the best interests of the child, and therefore a stake in the outcome of the controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 16-17. On the merits, the panel majority nevertheless upheld the trial court's order, concluding that the trial court applied the correct legal standard in denying the termination motion and that the trial court's findings adequately supported its order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 31, 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b614 Judge Harris dissented, concluding that the foster parents did not have standing to appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42 (Harris, J., dissenting). Judge Harris acknowledged that the foster parents had a statutory right under section 19-3-507(5)(a) to intervene in the dependency and neglect proceedings pending before the trial court. However, she reasoned, section 19-3-507(5)(a) does not automatically confer standing to appeal the outcome of those proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 57-58. Rather, section 19-3-507(5)(a) confers only a procedural right to participate in the proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 62-63, 65. Because the foster parents participated fully in the hearing on the termination motion, Judge Harris concluded that they suffered no injury and therefore lacked standing to appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 66. Judge Harris further concluded that section 19-3-507(5)(a) does not give foster parents standing to assert the best interests of the child on appeal and she disagreed with the panel majority's reliance on this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    A.M.\n   </em>\n   to conclude otherwise.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 71, 80, 82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b615 We granted the GAL's petition for a writ of certiorari to review the court of appeals' ruling that the foster parents had standing to appeal the trial court's order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b617 We first review Colorado's standing doctrine relevant to our inquiry in this case. Next, we explain the statutory framework in which dependency and neglect cases proceed, and the rights and duties those statutes confer on the parties involved in the case. Finally, with these principles in mind, we conclude that the foster parents here do not have standing to appeal because they have not suffered an injury in fact to a legally protected interest as a result of the trial court's order. Although section 19-3-507(5)(a) gives qualifying foster parents the right to intervene in dependency and neglect proceedings, the foster parents here do not have a legally protected interest in the outcome of termination proceedings, and section 19-3-507(5)(a) does not automatically confer standing to them to appeal the juvenile court's order denying the termination motion at issue, where neither the Department nor the GAL sought review of the trial court's ruling. Nor is it necessary to allow foster parents to assert the best interests of the child on appeal, because the Children's Code expressly charges the GAL with doing so. For these\n   reasons, we hold that the foster parents here did not have standing to appeal the trial court's ruling denying the GAL's motion to terminate the mother's parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In other words, our holding in\n   <em>\n    A.M.\n   </em>\n   was based on the foster parent intervenors' ability to provide the court with valuable and current information about the children in their care, as evidenced by the statutory criteria allowing qualifying foster parents to intervene.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19-3-507(5)(a) (providing that \"foster parents who have the child in their care for more than three months\n   <em>\n    who have information or knowledge concerning the care and protection of the child\n   </em>\n   may intervene\") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b630 We explained that foster parents often have valuable information about the children in their care and that they are often uniquely positioned to provide a juvenile court with the most up-to-date status of the child.\n   <em>\n    A.M.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 35,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6979999\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/296/1026/\">\n    296 P.3d at 1036-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Indeed, in response to the contention that foster parents' full participation at a termination hearing would violate the biological parents' procedural due process rights, we observed that the foster parents' participation could decrease the risk of an erroneous termination decision by the juvenile court\n   and thereby actually safeguard the biological parents' due process rights.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6979999\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/296/1026/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b631 Thus, we held in\n   <em>\n    A.M.\n   </em>\n   that qualifying foster parents are permitted to intervene without limitation and participate fully at the termination hearing because section 19-3-507(5)(a) implicitly recognizes that they have important information that will improve the accuracy of the juvenile court's determination at the hearing, as evidenced by the statutory criteria for intervention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b632 Our decision in\n   <em>\n    A.M.\n   </em>\n   was also driven by the timing requirements for the dispositional hearing.\n   <em>\n    A.M.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6979999\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/296/1026/\">\n    296 P.3d at 1032-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under section 19-3-507(5)(a), only foster parents who have had the child in their care for more than three months (approximately ninety days) may intervene in ongoing proceedings.

Additionally, children under six years of age are subject to expedited placement procedures under section 19-1-102(1.6), making it unlikely that a dispositional hearing for a child under six would ever happen more than ninety days after a child had been placed in foster care.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6979999\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/296/1026/\">\n    296 P.3d at 1032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With this timing conundrum in mind, we observed that limiting foster parent intervenors' participation to the dispositional hearing would lead to an absurd result: \"The General Assembly, having granted foster parents the ability to advocate for the child's best interests as intervenors, did not, in the same breath, confine that ability to a hearing in which there is no practical likelihood that foster parents would be able to participate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6979999\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/296/1026/\">\n    296 P.3d at 1033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b633 This statement, however, did not suggest that foster parents, as a matter of law, have a legally protected interest in a relationship with the foster child sufficient to confer them with an independent right to pursue termination of the parent-child legal relationship where the State and the GAL no longer seek to do so.

Indeed, all actions under the Children's Code should advance the best interests of the children involved.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 19-1-102, C.R.S.

The GAL is expressly authorized by statute to advocate for the child's best interests at all stages of the proceedings,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19-3-203(3), and there is no indication that the GAL was unable or unwilling to do so in this case. Indeed, the GAL filed the termination motion. The GAL then chose not to appeal the trial court's denial of that motion. The GAL filed a supplemental brief on the issue of standing in the court of appeals, and participated fully at this court by filing the petition for review and a merits brief. Contrary to the foster parents' contention before the court of appeals, the GAL's decision not to pursue an appeal does not equate to a failure to represent the child's best interests. Like all attorneys in the state, a GAL is subject to the professional duties of diligence and competent representation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Colo. R.P.C. 1.1, 1.3. Further, added safeguards exist to ensure GALs carry out their statutory duties effectively.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Chief Justice Directive 04-06 at 15 n.1 (revised Jan. 1, 2016) (providing that, if an issue arises regarding an attorney's ability to competently or adequately represent a child's best interest, the court shall immediately contact the Office of the Child's Representative, which shall resolve the complaint, including through removal and replacement of the attorney).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b637 Finally, the circumstances of this case illustrate the potential practical problems involved in allowing foster parents, acting alone, to appeal a trial court's ruling denying a motion to terminate parental rights. The record here indicates that the Department believed the foster parents in this case had become attached to the child and wanted to adopt, and thus had become an obstacle to the permanency goal of reunification. Under these circumstances, the foster parent intervenors arguably had a conflict of interest between the best interests of the child (as represented by the GAL) and their personal interests in wishing to adopt the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b638 Section 19-3-507(5)(a) gives qualifying foster parents the right to intervene in dependency and neglect proceedings after adjudication and, as we held in\n   <em>\n    A.M.\n   </em>\n   , to participate fully in the termination hearing. However, section 19-3-507(5)(a) does not necessarily give foster parents a legally protected interest in the outcome of termination proceedings. We conclude that section 19-3-507(5)(a) does not, as a matter of law, automatically confer standing to foster parents to appeal a juvenile court's ruling denying a motion to terminate parental rights, where neither the Department nor the GAL sought review of the trial court's ruling. We further conclude that the foster parents here have not established standing\n   on the facts of this case.

The majority holds that, \"although section 19-3-507(5)(a) permits foster parents to intervene in dependency and neglect proceedings following adjudication, foster parents do not have a legally protected interest in the outcome of termination proceedings, and section 19-3-507(5)(a) does not automatically confer standing to them to appeal....\" Maj. op. \u00b6 2.

That is, just as the statute permits foster parents to intervene at the trial-level dependency and neglect proceedings and participate fully without satisfying Colorado's traditional standing requirements, it also confers standing on the foster parents to appeal a juvenile court's order denying a motion to terminate a parent-child legal relationship regardless of whether the State or the guardian ad litem (\"GAL\") appeals. Accordingly, I would hold that parties who enter a lawsuit pursuant to an unconditional statutory right to intervene-like the foster parents here-need not prove a direct interest in the litigation to participate fully at the trial level or on appeal because the legislature has already declared their interest sufficient for standing purposes. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Section 19-3-507(5)(a) Confers Standing Upon Qualifying Parties at all Stages of Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b640 First, the plain language of section 19-3-507(5)(a), as we interpreted it in\n   <em>\n    A.M.\n   </em>\n   , expresses the General Assembly's intent that qualifying foster parents be permitted to participate fully at all stages of litigation. The majority concludes that, because section 19-3-507(5)(a) does not include specific language conferring the right to appeal, the intervening foster parents do not have that right. That logic is backwards and conflicts with our interpretation of section 19-3-507(5)(a) in\n   <em>\n    A.M.\n   </em>\n   A statutory right to intervene is full and unlimited\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   it is specifically limited by statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    A.M.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6979999\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/296/1026/\">\n    296 P.3d at 1033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    A.M.\n   </em>\n   -which the majority does not overrule-we held that, because section 19-3-507(5)(a)\"does not contain any explicit limit to the rights of intervenors, nor does it limit the substance of intervenor participation,\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6979999\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/296/1026/\">\n    296 P.3d at 1032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the intervening foster parents \"are afforded the same degree of participation as all other parties, and such participation is not limited to the dispositional hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6979999\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/296/1026/\">\n    296 P.3d at 1033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We held that the trial court \"did not err in affording the foster parents full party status at the termination hearing\" and that, \"[a]s intervenors, the foster parents were properly permitted to make opening statements, cross-examine witnesses, introduce evidence, make evidentiary objections, and give closing argument.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6979999\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/296/1026/\">\n    296 P.3d at 1037-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We reasoned that, had the General Assembly intended to prevent foster parents from fully participating in trial-level dependency and neglect proceedings, it would have limited their rights to those granted in section 19-3-502(7), which allows foster parents to participate in dependency and neglect proceedings only as non-party witnesses or observers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6979999\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/296/1026/\">\n    296 P.3d at 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, we recognized that the General Assembly granted the\n   additional right of intervention to foster parents who have the child in their care for more than three months and have knowledge concerning the care and protection of the child, meaning that qualifying foster parents who intervene pursuant to section 19-3-507(5)(a) obtain full party status.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6979999\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/296/1026/\">\n    296 P.3d at 1037-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Notably, our conclusion did not turn on whether the foster parents in\n   <em>\n    A.M.\n   </em>\n   had standing. To the contrary, our opinion implies that section 19-3-507(5)(a) confers standing upon qualifying individuals, allowing them to intervene at the trial level and participate fully without meeting traditional standing requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b641 The same reasoning that allowed us to conclude that the foster parents in\n   <em>\n    A.M.\n   </em>\n   could participate fully in the trial proceedings without meeting the traditional standing requirements applies to the foster parents' ability to appeal here. I would hold that, by granting the foster parents in this case the unconditional right to intervene, the General Assembly declares their interest sufficient for standing purposes both at the trial level and on appeal. The General Assembly does not explain in section 19-3-507(5)(a) its reasons for granting foster parents an unconditional right to intervene, but its decision to do so is instructive. Section 19-3-507(5)(a) gives qualifying foster parents the autonomy to intervene, with or without representation, on their own initiative and without permission from the State or the GAL. This suggests that the General Assembly believed that foster parents who have had the child in their care for more than three months have a legitimate role to play in the termination proceedings separate from the interests represented by the State and the GAL. The majority admits that, as we explained in\n   <em>\n    A.M.\n   </em>\n   , \"the State has a significant interest in promoting the welfare of children and ensuring that termination proceedings are accurate and just, and that this interest is best advanced by giving consideration to all relevant evidence, whatever the source, including foster parents.\" Maj. op. \u00b6 29. According to the majority, however, that interest ends with the trial court's decision regarding termination. I would hold that the State's interest in obtaining a just result in termination hearings continues throughout all stages of the litigation and so too does the foster parents' right to participate. This is a logical extension of our holding in\n   <em>\n    A.M.\n   </em>\n   Just as qualifying foster parent intervenors have the unconditional statutory right to participate without limitation in trial-level dependency and neglect proceedings, so too may they appeal the result of those proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b642 Additionally, the majority suggests that, because the GAL is statutorily obligated to advocate for the child's best interests at all stages of the litigation, \"we need not confer standing to foster parents here to assert the rights of the child.\" Maj. op. \u00b6 36. But that is not our decision to make. In addition to providing statutory duties for GALs, the General Assembly chose to confer standing on individuals who meet the requirements of section 19-3-507(5)(a) so that they may participate in all stages of dependency and neglect proceedings. We may not second-guess that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b643 The majority also relies on\n   <em>\n    Diamond v.

Unlike what the U.S. Supreme Court has done with F.R.C.P. 24(a)(2) -requiring Article III standing to enter the case at the trial level and to appeal\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   -the majority splits the baby, requiring intervenors to demonstrate standing to appeal but not to appear before the trial court. That holding is unprecedented. Neither this court nor the U.S. Supreme Court has held that parties with an unconditional statutory right to intervene must satisfy the traditional standing requirements at either the trial court or on appeal. To the contrary, such a requirement renders C.R.C.P. 24(a)(1) moot and prevents the General Assembly from conferring the right to intervene on parties it considers to have a legitimate stake in a case. The majority treats the foster parent intervenors here as though they intervened under C.R.C.P. 24(a)(2) and must continually prove their stake in the case. A right to intervene pursuant to statute is different in kind and should be treated differently than a right to intervene under C.R.C.P. 24(a)(2). In the latter circumstance, a litigant proves to the court that they deserve to be a party to a case; in the former circumstance, the General Assembly determines that a litigant deserves to be a party to a case. Requiring all intervenors to meet Colorado's standing requirements on appeal, as the majority does, renders C.R.C.P. 24(a)(1) and (a)(2) identical procedural mechanisms. I would hold that intervenors entering a case pursuant to C.R.C.P. 24(a)(1) have standing to participate fully at trial and on appeal because the legislature has declared their interest sufficient for standing purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
