He alleges that (1) the trial\n   court judge was required to recuse; (2) his trial counsel's conflict of interest denied him the right to a fair trial; (3) the district court denied him due process by failing to conduct a meaningful hearing on his pro se pretrial motions for new counsel; (4) the district court erred in denying his motion for an independent physical examination of J.M.; (5) a mistrial was required after the jury mistakenly viewed the unredacted version of the victim's intake interview; (6) the district court erred in failing to provide the jury with a unanimity instruction on four of the counts charged; (7) the district court provided an erroneous limiting instruction on prior crimes or civil wrongs evidence; (8) the prosecutor committed reversible misconduct in closing argument; and (9) cumulative error denied him a fair trial. As an alternative, Moyer asks this court to remand for a\n   <em>\n    State v.

On February 18, 1995, they had their first child, J.M. After J.M. was born, the couple married and had four more children, H.M., K.M., S.M., and D.M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Jessica encouraged Moyer to spend more time with the couple's children because she felt Moyer was not sufficiently involved in their lives. But Jessica was not pleased when Moyer began spending time alone with J.M. behind closed doors in the master bedroom, to the exclusion of the younger children. When J.M. was about 11 years old, Moyer began showering with J.M., until Jessica said that she did not like that. When Jessica asked Moyer about condoms that were missing from her dresser, he responded that the children were probably playing with them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In August of 2008, the Moyers moved from Denver to Goodland, Kansas. Moyer continued to spend more time with J.M. than the other children. When Jessica inquired about this dynamic, Moyer explained that he wanted to \"finish what [he] started with [J.M.].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 5, 2009, J.M. told Jessica that Moyer had been sexually abusing her. J.M. explained that the abuse started when she was 11 years old, after she began menstruating. J.M. gave Jessica several items as evidence of the sexual relationship: two used condoms that J.M. secretly kept from sexual encounters with Moyer in Denver, a recording of a sexual encounter between J.M. and Moyer that occurred in the shed outside of the family's Goodland home, a rag that J.M. used to clean herself after the sexual encounters in Goodland, and a notebook containing an agreement between J.M. and Moyer enumerating a points system Moyer designed detailing the number of points J.M. must obtain in order to complete the sexual relationship with Moyer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The next day, after Moyer went to work, Jessica and J.M. went to the sheriff's office to report Moyer's abuse. One of the officers set up an intake interview for J.M. with the Western Kansas Child Advocacy Center (hereinafter \"intake interview\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The intake interview included a voluminous account of Moyer's sexual abuse of J.M., beginning when she was 11 years old and continuing up to the day she reported it to Jessica. J.M. discussed each of the specific acts that the State ultimately relied upon to convict Moyer, as well as numerous other, uncharged acts of sodomy and sexual intercourse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The State charged Moyer in a third amended complaint with five counts of sexual abuse against J.M.: aggravated criminal sodomy in\n   violation of K.S.A. 21-3506(a)(1) (sodomy with a child under 14 years of age), aggravated indecent liberties with a child in violation of K.S.A. 21-3504(a)(1) (sexual intercourse with a child who is 14 or more years of age but less than 16 years of age), and three counts of criminal sodomy in violation of K.S.A. 21-3505(a)(2) (sodomy with a child who is 14 or more years of age but less than\n   16 years of age). The case proceeded to trial, where J.M.'s testimony was consistent with her intake interview, recounting that the sexual abuse began when she was 11 years old and the family was living in Denver. To begin, Moyer manually touched J.M.'s vagina. The abuse progressed to J.M. performing oral sex on Moyer and then to vaginal and anal intercourse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When the family moved to Goodland, Moyer took J.M. to a shed by their house and explained a coding system that enumerated the sexual acts J.M. must perform on him. J.M. explained that number 1 was a \"[h]and job,\" number 2 was a \"[b]low job,\" number 3 was \"[w]hen he went inside [her] vagina,\" number 4 was \"[w]hen he was on top,\" and number 5 was \"[i]n my butt.\" J.M. also described a notebook containing an agreement between J.M. and Moyer, which was titled \"Computer Software\" and the first line of which read: \"Start: 30,000 mega bites.\" J.M. explained that she could earn points for performing sexual acts, but she could lose points for certain actions, and the 30,000 reference was to the number of points she had to earn to complete her sexual relationship with Moyer. Further, when Moyer grounded J.M., she had to earn points through the number coding system and she also received money for reaching a certain number of points.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   J.M. explained the terms used in the agreement: \"\n   <em>\n    start &amp; run\n   </em>\n   \" meant when she \"went up and talked to him to get the stuff started\"; \"\n   <em>\n    auto run\n   </em>\n   \" meant when she \"went up to him on [her] own, and then [she] ... asked what [she] wanted to do to him on [her] own\"; \"\n   <em>\n    auto run supreme\n   </em>\n   \" meant \"[w]e do it all the way, and don't, like, tell him, like, I don't know what to do next, or something like that\"; \"\n   <em>\n    act\n   </em>\n   \" meant when she would \"go up and do it\" on her own; and \"\n   <em>\n    EWD\n   </em>\n   \" and \"\n   <em>\n    EWOD\n   </em>\n   \" meant \"[e]at with drink\" and \"eat without drink,\" and both referred to \"eating\" Moyer's ejaculate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The agreement also has a \"virus\" heading, which J.M. testified set forth actions that would take away points. For instance, if she\n   talked or pushed Moyer away while Moyer was touching her, he would take away 100 points. If she used her teeth or vomited during a \"blow job,\" she lost 100 points. Finally, a \"[n]o response\" meant that she lost 100 points because she did not do anything sexual with Moyer all day. At trial, an expert in handwriting analysis testified it was \"highly probable\" that Moyer prepared the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After explaining the agreement, J.M. testified that Moyer sexually abused her in the shed outside of the family's home, in her parent's bedroom, in her sister H.M.'s bedroom, in her bedroom, in the kitchen, and in the living room. This abuse included Moyer touching her breasts, J.M. giving Moyer \"blow jobs,\" Moyer being \"on top\" of her, and sexual intercourse. Much of J.M.'s testimony was not tied to a certain date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   J.M. also discussed specific events that she was able to link to more definite time frames. On October 2, 2008, when J.M. was 13 years old, she hid an audio recorder in the shed in order to record Moyer's abuse. J.M. testified that on that day, Moyer made J.M. give him a \"blow job.\" There are sounds on the audio recording indicative of sexual acts taking place, and, at one point, Moyer whispered, \"try, try, try go further.\" J.M. asked \"what if I did this to [M.M.],\" one of her friends from school. Moyer told J.M. to \"wait till you get married to do that.\" J.M. also asked Moyer, \"can you feel the cotton in my mouth,\" and Moyer made an affirmative noise. About a minute later, J.M. asked Moyer, \"You know that thing that hangs down ... when you go up, it makes me [inaudible].\" Moyer then told J.M. to whisper things like that. Later in the audio recording, Moyer used the number coding system discussed above and told J.M. what to work on to \"make it faster.\" Moyer also told J.M. \"instead of talking to me once a day, the more the merrier.\" In her intake interview and at trial, J.M. explained \"talking\" means sexual acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The next instances of sexual abuse J.M. tied to a specific date occurred on February 19, 2009. On this date, J.M. was 14 years old. Moyer took her to Walmart to make a list of items she wanted for her birthday. On the way home, Moyer drove to his work and parked the minivan behind his work truck. In the back of the minivan, J.M. gave Moyer two \"blow jobs\" and Moyer had sex with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   J.M. said Moyer did not ejaculate that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The State submitted J.M.'s birthday list into evidence. The list indicated the points J.M. earned that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   J.M. also testified about two specific instances of abuse that occurred in April of 2009. The first happened when Moyer licked her vagina in the family's bathroom. The second, Moyer's last act of sexual abuse, occurred in her parents' bedroom when J.M. \"touch[ed] [Moyer] on the penis and then g[a]ve him a blow job.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) Tricia Carney testified regarding the physical examination she performed on J.M., explaining that the vaginal area is treated like a clock for purposes of identifying the location of injuries. Carney noticed J.M. had thinning to the 6 o'clock area of her hymen and what appeared to be a healed abnormality at the 8 o'clock area. Carney explained that her education and training have taught her that injuries from the 3 to 9 o'clock area are significant for mounting injuries. Mounting injuries occur when the penis has direct first contact with the vaginal area during intercourse. Carney testified that the location of J.M.'s injuries was consistent with the sexual history J.M. provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Kansas Bureau of Investigation (KBI) conducted a sexual assault investigation of the Moyer's home and minivan. KBI forensic scientist James Newman's role in the investigation was to look for seminal fluid. Newman did not find seminal fluid in the house, shed, or minivan. Newman noted that he did not look for seminal fluid on the master bedroom bedding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Newman also conducted deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing on one of the condoms and the rag J.M. saved from her sexual encounters with Moyer. Newman did not test the other condom because it did not contain seminal fluid. Newman compared the DNA profile on a sample cut from the rag and swabs from the tested condom to known DNA samples from Jessica, J.M., and Moyer. The DNA profile on the rag and on the inside of the tested condom matched the known sample for Moyer. On the swab from the outside of the condom, Newman found a partial DNA profile consistent with J.M.'s profile. The swab from the outside of the condom also contained DNA from another individual, but the profile did not contain enough information to compare it to the known profiles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   None of the DNA profiles from the evidence were consistent with Jessica's DNA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Obstetrician-gynecologist Dr. Merle J. Hodges testified in Moyer's defense. Hodges reviewed Carney's report and the photographs associated with J.M.'s physical examination. He testified that J.M. had damage to her hymen and there was \"no doubt she had penetration of her vagina.\" But he explained that injuries to the hymen can be caused by nonsexual means such as falling off a bicycle, doing the splits, first-time tampon use, or masturbation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Unlike Carney, Hodges did not see hymenal thinning at 6 o'clock or damage at 8 o'clock. He noted a tear on the hymenal ring at 11 o'clock that is unusual for someone of J.M.'s age whose vagina has never been penetrated. He testified he could not know whether the tear fit the description of events in this case. He explained he would expect to see more gaping of the hymenal opening and a less intact hymen for a 14-year-old person who has had fairly vigorous intercourse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Moyer also presented forensic scientist Stephanie Beine as an expert. Beine reviewed the KBI findings and believed the results were correct. However, she pointed out that it was unusual that the KBI did not locate any seminal evidence in the house or minivan. She also found it unusual that J.M.'s DNA was not found on the rag. Additionally, she noted that DNA testing cannot confirm whether the DNA profiles on the condom were deposited as part of the same incident or as part of unrelated incidents. Further, she pointed out the DNA on the outside of the condom did not necessarily come from a bodily fluid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Beine opined that Moyer's other daughters should have been tested. She pointed out that only a partial DNA profile, 9 or 13 locations, was obtained from the outside of the condom. She testified that unrelated persons can share DNA across 9 or up to 13 locations and related persons would share even more common locations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Moyer testified on his own behalf, denying that he had sexually abused J.M. He related that Jessica told him he needed to spend more time with J.M. and when he did, Jessica used it against him. Jessica threatened to divorce him because he was spending too\n   much time with J.M. and not enough time with his other children. He further explained that J.M.'s abuse allegations came after a particularly contentious day in the Moyer family, during which the family had to tow their car and Moyer became angry with his family for not helping him during the process. Moyer had also grounded the children from the family's computer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Moyer admitted drafting the agreement that allegedly contained a points system for sexual acts. But he denied that the document was related to sex. Instead, he created the document to explain to J.M. how a computer works.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Moyer also confirmed that the voices in the audio recording from the shed are his and J.M.'s. However, he denied that sexual abuse occurred in the shed. Instead, he explained that J.M. was doing her math homework and the references to 1 through 5 were about that homework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The jury convicted Moyer as charged. The district court denied Moyer's motion to depart from the mandatory minimum Jessica's Law sentence on count 1. The district court imposed a hard 25 sentence for count 1 and an additional 118 months' imprisonment for counts 2-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Moyer's appeal was docketed on November 17, 2010. Therefore, this court has jurisdiction over his appeal under K.S.A. 22-3601(b)(1) (life sentenced imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 21-4643 ).\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   L. 2011, ch. 100, sec. 9(b)(3), effective July 1, 2011 (excepting Jessica's Law cases from direct appeal to the Supreme Court). We take the liberty of considering Moyer's issues in a different order than he presents them in his brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   INDEPENDENT PHYSICAL EXAMINATION OF VICTIM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Three months after the complaint was filed, the defense filed a motion for an independent forensic medical examination of J.M. The State responded that J.M. had already undergone a physical examination and that a second exam was unwarranted. In an amended motion, the defense argued that the State's examination was performed by a registered nurse practitioner and that the defendant was entitled to a forensic examination by a medical doctor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The district court conducted a hearing on the motion, at which\n   it utilized the factors set forth in\n   <em>\n    State v. McIntosh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1488351\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/274/939/#p953\">\n    274 Kan. 939\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 953,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1488351\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/274/939/#p953\">\n    58 P.3d 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002), to assist in the determination of whether the defendant has established a compelling reason for an independent physical examination. In denying Moyer's motion, the district judge announced: \"I do not believe, based upon the testimony that has been presented to me today, or the statements at least made by the parties, that a forensics exam is warranted, and I will deny the defense's motion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   But the district court also informed the parties that it would reconsider its ruling if Moyer's expert could give any reasons why a second or independent examination was necessary. The record does not indicate that Moyer's expert opined that an independent examination was necessary or that Moyer requested reconsideration of the court's ruling. Nevertheless, Moyer challenges the district court's assessment of the\n   <em>\n    McIntosh\n   </em>\n   factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   This court reviews a district court's denial of a motion for an independent physical examination for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    McIntosh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1488351\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/274/939/#p953\">\n    274 Kan. at 953\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1488351\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/274/939/#p953\">\n    58 P.3d 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Consequently, to prevail, Moyer must convince us that the district court abused its discretion by being arbitrary, fanciful, or unreasonable. But the court's methodical use of established protocol belies the notion that it was arbitrary or fanciful. Therefore, the only remaining avenue available to Moyer is to convince us that the district court was unreasonable,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that no reasonable person would have found that there was no compelling reason to order an independent physical examination of J.M. after considering and applying the\n   <em>\n    McIntosh\n   </em>\n   factors. He fails to carry that burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   For instance, under the first factor, the district court determined that J.M.'s age of 14 years old was \"[y]oung enough that an exam, a trial and testimony will have a detrimental effect.\" The consideration of the age factor also dovetailed into the other factors of the degree of intrusiveness and the debilitating effects of the examination, which the district court found also counseled against ordering an independent physical examination. Moyer argues that J.M. was older than the 11-year-old victim in\n   <em>\n    McIntosh\n   </em>\n   ; that J.M.'s videotaped interview revealed that she was a \"mature and self-possessed girl\"; and that the district court was wrong to disagree with the defense assessment of the victim as a \"strong\" individual who could endure the testing without lasting effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Essentially, Moyer would have us reweigh the evidence and make our own factual findings that contradict the trial court's assessment of these factors. But that is not our role here. It matters not a whit whether an appellate jurist might have made a different decision. \"While others might disagree with the trial judge, if reasonable persons\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   agree [with the trial judge] it cannot be said that the trial judge abused [his or her] discretion.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

The district court's assessment of the factors relating to the potential impact upon the victim of ordering another examination were well within the bounds of reasonable debate, so that we can find no abuse of discretion there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   More importantly, however, Moyer failed to proffer any compelling evidentiary reason for an independent examination. As the\n   State explained to the district court, any acute injuries would have been healed long before the time of the proposed independent examination and the SANE nurse had obtained over 30 colposcope slides of the victim's vagina and anus, which any defense expert could use to opine on whether the victim's allegations were supported by the physical evidence. Even then, the district court exercised its discretion under the probative value factor with extreme caution, specifically advising the defense that the matter was open for reconsideration if its expert could provide a valid reason that an independent examination was necessary. Pointedly, neither an expert's reason nor a defense reconsideration request ever materialized. Most reasonable persons under that scenario would agree with the district court's determination that the defendant had failed to show a compelling reason for an independent physical examination of the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We do note, however, that Moyer also complains about the prosecutor's conduct on cross-examination. The State fervently argued against another physical examination of the victim on the basis that it was unnecessary because the defense's expert could use\n   the existing evidence to form an opinion as to whether the victim suffered injuries consistent with her allegations. Then, at trial, the prosecutor endeavored to impeach the defense's doctor expert on the basis that the expert had not conducted his own physical examination of the victim. While such a trial tactic might provide a ground for another type of complaint, it does not render the trial court's pretrial determination that there was no compelling reason to order an independent physical examination of the victim an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   ERRONEOUS SHOWING OF VICTIM'S UNREDACTED INTAKE INTERVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Prior to opening statements, the district court ruled that the intake interview of J.M. would be admissible at trial if certain portions were redacted per the parties' agreement. Then, during the State's case-in-chief, the court admitted into evidence the redacted version of the intake interview, albeit the record does not indicate that it was played for the jury at that time. While admitting the\n   redacted interview, the court admonished the jury not to concern itself \"with the fact that certain portions of the recording have been redacted, nor should you draw any inferences, either for or against the Defendant or the State, because of this.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   While the original unredacted version of the intake interview was not officially admitted into evidence, the court granted the State's request to have an unredacted version follow the record for appellate purposes. That request by the State and subsequent decision by the court provided the logistics for the evidentiary faux pas that followed: During jury deliberations, the court received notice that the jury was watching the unredacted intake interview,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the jurors were considering evidence that the trial judge had ruled that they could not consider because it was prejudicial to the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   As soon as the court became aware that the jury was watching the original unadmitted recording, the trial judge notified both parties and went into the jury room to order the jury to turn off the DVD. The jurors told the judge that they had reached the point in the videotape where there was a break. The parties agreed that the court would give the jurors the following admonition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   \"You have inadvertently viewed an unredacted version of the intake interview of Kelly Robbins. You're admonished to not consider what you have already viewed, but that you must consider [the redacted version] in its place.... You should watch the redacted version up to the point you stopped watching, however, you are welcome to watch beyond that point.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   \"Mr. Pianalto will be coming in and setting up the equipment necessary to view this. Please do not deliberate while Mr. Pianalto is in the room, nor can he be asked or answer any questions.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Burton Pianalto was the law enforcement investigator on the case and the person who had custody of the recordings. Moyer argues that, notwithstanding the trial judge's attempt to cure the error with an admonition, the jury's viewing of excluded evidence was reversible error that mandated the granting of his mistrial motion. The State counters that the error was harmless, because the prejudicial evidence of which the defense complains was similar to other admitted evidence that the jury heard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \"On appeal, a trial court's decision denying a motion for mistrial\n   is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.

In other words, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion on the first step of the analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Before the district court, the defense argued that three segments of the unredacted forensic interview heard by the jury were highly prejudicial to the defense. The first segment was J.M.'s description of an event where Moyer was physically abusive to H.M. and Jessica. Specifically, J.M. explained that event as Moyer grabbing H.M. by the hair, throwing her down, and throwing a pop can at her, after which he put his hand on Jessica's arm. In the second challenged segment, J.M. described Moyer threatening to kill Jessica and the other children; Moyer getting angry at the other children and calling them names; and Moyer threatening to \"get rid of\" J.M. and one of her sisters, which J.M. explained meant finding the children new parents. The third segment involved Moyer walking around the house naked; Moyer asking his daughters to walk around without shirts; and Moyer asking H.M. and J.M. to kiss him while they were not wearing shirts. This segment also included J.M.'s statement that her sisters had told her that Moyer had not done anything sexual to them. The district court opined that the trial could continue with the jury admonition without injustice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   We have an advantage over the district court in analyzing the second step-the damaging effect of the fundamental failure in the proceedings-because we can look at the entire record of the trial, including what transpired after the district court denied the mistrial motion.\n   <em>\n    Waller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417481\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/299/707/#p722\">\n    299 Kan. at 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417481\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/299/707/#p722\">\n    328 P.3d 1111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Appellate courts reviewing the second part for an injustice may take a broader view than the trial court because appellate courts may examine the entire record.\").

In this case, that review reveals that other evidence that was admitted by the district court created the same type of prejudicial negative\n   inferences\n   that Moyer attributes to the erroneously admitted evidence. In other words, the prejudicial effect of the challenged evidence was ameliorated by the fact that there was properly admitted inculpatory evidence of the same ilk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   For instance, similar to the threats of physical harm that were supposed to be redacted, there was evidence admitted in which J.M. related that Moyer, at different times, had threatened to hurt Jessica and/or to kill J.M., if she told anyone about the sexual abuse. Moreover, the evidence of the violent event with H.M. and Jessica was no more damning than the admitted inculpatory evidence of the numerous uncharged sexually violent acts of sodomy and sexual intercourse, beginning when J.M. was 11 years old. J.M. related one such event occurring in Denver in which Moyer made her get on her knees \"like a dog\" and he put his penis in her \"butt.\" Given the tenor of the evidence as a whole, the trial judge's determinations that the jury would heed his directive to disregard the improperly submitted evidence and that the jury was still \"in an appropriate position to make a decision based solely upon [the] evidence\" were reasonable findings,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , not an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   UNANIMITY INSTRUCTIONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Pursuant to the defense's request, the district court instructed the jury that it had to be unanimous on the particular act that constituted the crime of aggravated criminal sodomy, as charged in Count 1 of the charging document. But the court did not give a unanimity instruction on the other four counts: criminal sodomy in count 2; aggravated indecent liberties with a child in count 3; criminal sodomy in count 4; and criminal sodomy in count 5. Moyer makes the contradictory assertions that his trial attorney \"argued for an unanimity instruction on each of the five counts\" but that the clearly erroneous standard is applicable on this issue.

Here, the State attempted to prosecute only those sexual acts for which J.M. could identify a date of occurrence and then the prosecutor further focused the jurors' attention on the specific acts by describing where and how they occurred. With the exception of the count 2 criminal sodomy charge, discussed below, we can discern no room for jury confusion as to the particular sexual act for which the State was prosecuting Moyer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   With respect to the count 2 sodomy charge, the State has candidly admitted that its election may not have completely solved the multiplicity problem.

She first testified that she earned points for doing \"two 2s,\" explaining that \"2s\" were \"blow jobs.\" Later, she testified \"I had to give him\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   blow job.\" (Emphasis added.) In her videotaped intake interview, J.M. only discussed performing one act of oral sodomy on Moyer in the minivan. In short, the jury heard evidence that may have been confusing as to the specific act that the State had elected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The State does not argue that these two acts of sodomy were unitary conduct, which might well have been the case.

Although J.M. was consistent about what happened, her testimony was ambivalent about the number of times it happened in the van on the Walmart trip. Nevertheless, we are firmly convinced that, viewing the entire record-including Moyer's general denial-there is no reasonable probability that the result would have been different if the jury had been instructed that it had to be unanimous as to the specific act of fellatio that constituted the criminal sodomy on that date in the minivan on the Walmart trip.

The statutory reference was to the 2009 amendments to K.S.A. 60-455, which were effective April 30, 2009,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , after the crimes were committed but before Moyer's trial.

The relevant amended subsection reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   \"(d) Except as provided in K.S.A. 60-445, and amendments thereto, in a criminal action in which the defendant is accused of a sex offense under articles 34, 35 or 36 of chapter 21 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, ... and amendments thereto, evidence of the defendant's commission of another act or offense of sexual misconduct is admissible, and may be considered for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant and probative.\" K.S.A. 2014 Supp. 60-455.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The district court first determined that the amendments were procedural in nature and, therefore, their provisions could be applied in Moyer's trial.

Statements based on evidence, even when discussing the credibility of witnesses, do not constitute prosecutorial misconduct. See\n   <em>\n    State v.

Each was accompanied by a discussion of the evidence presented at trial, and this all-important context persuades us that the prosecutor was merely asking the jury to draw permissible inferences from that evidence.\"). In short, it is not misconduct for a prosecutor to comment on the amount of physical evidence presented in a case. See\n   <em>\n    State v.

Consequently, we need go no further on that part of the statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The second part of the argument is more problematic in that, as the State concedes, it stated a fact that was not in the record,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that there is always much physical corroborating evidence in these cases. This court has \"consistently found prosecutorial misconduct when a prosecutor argues facts that are not in evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State does not convince us that this case presents an exception to that rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Nevertheless, under the second factor-whether the comment was motivated by ill will-we observe that \"the statement does not appear to have been deliberate, repeated, or in apparent indifference to a court's ruling.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , 298 Kan. at 1052,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417323\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/298/1040/#p1050\">\n    318 P.3d 1005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To the contrary, as the State points out, this comment appears to undervalue the large amount of physical evidence presented in this case. In other words, the comment was more detrimental to the State than the defense by saying that the large amount of evidence was not extraordinarily compelling in this case because it was typical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Finally, under the third factor, Moyer argues that the evidence against him was not overwhelming, while the State contends that the physical evidence corroborating J.M.'s testimony constituted overwhelming evidence. Although not absolutely controlling, Moyer's argument suffers from a misstatement of the testimony regarding the DNA analysis performed on the condom. Moyer incorrectly argues that the DNA profile on the outside of the tested condom was not tested against Jessica's DNA. The forensic scientist compared the partial DNA profile on the outside of the condom to the known DNA sample from Jessica and determined that\n   Jessica's DNA profile was not found. Moreover, the evidence included J.M.'s intake interview, J.M.'s trial testimony, the DNA evidence presented, the evidence of J.M.'s sexual trauma, and, perhaps most compelling, the audio recording from the shed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   In sum, when the prosecutor's isolated comment is considered against the record as a whole, we hold that there was no reasonable possibility that the erroneous statement contributed to the guilty verdict. Moyer is entitled to no relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   TRIAL JUDGE RECUSAL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The assigned trial judge's son, Officer Jason Showalter, was involved in the case. He accompanied the principal investigator, Detective Burton Pianalto, to effect Moyer's arrest. Originally, the State endorsed Officer Showalter as a witness. Moyer moved for the recusal of Judge Showalter, arguing that his son's involvement in the arrest and his witness status \"would give an impression to the jury of favoritism or more significant weight\" to his testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The State responded that it did not intend to call Officer Showalter in its case-in-chief and, therefore, the officer would only be called if the defense thought his testimony was necessary, which the State did not anticipate. The district court resolved the potential conflict by altering the evidence in the case,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the court formally struck Officer Showalter as a witness and denied Moyer's motion. Later, the district court granted a defense motion in limine precluding any mention of Officer Showalter's name during the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   On appeal, Moyer contends that the conflict triggered a duty for the trial judge to recuse from the case, rather than to attempt to ameliorate the effect of the conflict. He does not point to any actual prejudice flowing from the judge's refusal to recuse, but, citing to\n   <em>\n    State v.

In contrast, Moyer was not faced with an eleventh hour disclosure by the district court, but rather he had ample time to file a motion for recusal.

Accordingly, Moyer's recusal claim under K.S.A. 20-311d is necessarily denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   <em>\n    Code of Judicial Conduct Basis for Recusal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Moyer argues that the Kansas Code of Judicial Conduct (the Code) required Judge Showalter to recuse. Kansas Supreme Court Rule 601B, Canon 2 (2014 Kan. Ct. R. Annot. 761), states: \"A judge shall perform the duties of judicial office impartially, competently, and diligently.\" Rule 2.11 of this Canon addresses disqualification: \"A judge shall disqualify himself or herself in any proceeding in which the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\" 2014 Kan. Ct. R. Annot. 767. Moyer points to Rule 2.11(A)(2)(c) and (d), which requires disqualification under the following specific circumstances:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   \"(2) The judge\n   <em>\n    knows\n   </em>\n   that the judge, the judge's spouse or\n   <em>\n    domestic partner\n   </em>\n   , or a person with the\n   <em>\n    third degree of relationship\n   </em>\n   to either of them ... is:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   \"(c) a person who has more than a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   interest that could be substantially affected by the proceeding; or\n   \"(d) likely to be a material witness in the proceeding.\" 2014 Kan. Ct. R. Annot. 767-68.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   The Code's terminology section states that \" '[d]e minimis,' in the context of interests pertaining to disqualification of a judge, means an insignificant interest that could not raise a reasonable question regarding the judge's impartiality.\" Rule 601B (2014 Kan. Ct. R. Annot. 753).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Interestingly, the preamble to the Code indicates that the purpose of the Code is to \"establish[ ] standards for the ethical conduct of judges and judicial candidates.\" 2014 Kan. Ct. R. Annot. 752. Pointedly, the Scope section admonishes that \"[t]he Code is not designed or intended as a basis for civil or criminal liability\" and that it is not \"intended to be the basis for litigants to seek collateral remedies against each other or to obtain\n   tactical advantages in proceedings before a court.\" 2014 Kan. Ct. R. Annot. 753. Arguably, the Code was not intended to create a cause of action for litigants, albeit we have previously considered the Code as a separate basis for recusal. The State has not asked us to change that tack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   A case in point is\n   <em>\n    State v.

In similar fashion, we would reject the notion that Judge Showalter would have a \"pro-prosecution\" bias simply because his son is a law enforcement officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   But what distinguishes\n   <em>\n    Logan\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Weinberger\n   </em>\n   from our case is that the judges' sons in those cases did not actively participate in the case over which the judge was presiding. Here, we are not merely concerned that Officer Showalter was employed by the law enforcement agency that investigated Moyer. Rather, the judge's\n   son actively participated in the defendant's arrest and was a witness in the proceeding over which Judge Showalter was presiding. The State's choice not to call Officer Showalter in its case-in-chief did not destroy his status as a witness nor did it erase the direct evidence that Officer Showalter possessed. As the prosecutor acknowledged, there was a possibility that the defense might want to put him on the stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Moreover, it gives us pause that a judge would order that his son be stricken as a witness-essentially ordering that the evidence be altered-in order to avoid recusal. Nevertheless, the focus here is not on whether\n   the judge attained the aspirational goal of avoiding any appearance of impropriety when viewed generally. Rather, the focus is on assuring that the defendant obtained a fair trial, free from any bias or prejudice that might flow from the judge's familial relationship with a participant, when viewed from the jury's perspective.

To begin, the record on appeal reflects only two motions: one filed by Moyer on July 1, 2009, and the other filed by Mason on October 29, 2009. Moyer's July motion to dismiss Mason stated his dissatisfaction with Mason's level of communication about his case and declared: \"I fired Mr. Mason, because I feel that he is bias[ed], he wants to plea bargain me out, and he doesn't come over to the jail to go over my case.\" Mason's October motion to change attorney, filed on behalf of Moyer, had attached a note from Moyer indicating that he was \"firing\" Mason and asked for an \" 'emergency motion' \" to appear in front of the district court to \"change to a different court appointed attorney!\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Next, the record indicates that the district court did provide Moyer due process. On November 2, 2009, the district court held a hearing to address Moyer's motion to change attorney, at which the judge asked Moyer to\n   explain his request. Moyer indicated that there had been a loss of communication and unproductive meetings because he and Mason \"talk about the same stuff over and over\"; that his biggest concern was Mason's failure to line up expert witnesses to rebut and point out inconsistencies in the State's evidence; and that Moyer felt Mason was \"fully qualified\" to answer his questions, but that he was not doing so in a timely fashion. Moyer,\n   Mason, and the district court discussed Moyer's concerns, and, at the end of the hearing, the court determined that the attorney/client relationship between Mason and Moyer was not materially broken down. See\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , 300 Kan. at 575,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417330\" index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/300/565/#p577\">\n    331 P.3d 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If a defendant seeks substitute counsel, the defendant 'must show \"justifiable dissatisfaction\" with his or her appointed counsel,' which can be 'demonstrated by showing a conflict of interest, an irreconcilable disagreement, or a complete breakdown in communication between counsel and the defendant.' [Citation omitted.]\"). Consequently, the court denied the motion for new counsel, albeit Moyer does not argue that the motion denial was erroneous,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that the court should have found justifiable dissatisfaction.

After advising the court that J.T. was apparently not available to testify on Moyer's behalf, Mason made a record of the events leading to Moyer's desire to call J.T. as a defense witness and the issues presented because of J.T.'s failure to testify. The timeline is as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   On April 9, 2009, the court appointed Mason to represent Moyer in this case. On November 9, 2009, the State filed a motion in limine to prohibit any evidence of subsequent sexual conduct of J.M. or H.M. In that motion, the State discussed an event reported on August 4, 2009, alleging that J.M. and her younger sister H.M. had exposed their chests to Kelly Traxel, J.T.'s father, in order to stay at the Traxel home longer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   On December 14, 2009, Mason was appointed as guardian ad litem for J.T. in a Child in Need of Care (CINC) matter. J.T.'s\n   CINC case did not involve Moyer. The district court pointed out that Mason was the only local attorney willing and capable of taking CINC cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   In January 2010, Mason participated in J.T.'s CINC hearing as her guardian ad litem. The duty of a guardian ad litem is to \"represent the best interests of the child,\" K.S.A. 2014 Supp. 38-2205(a), and the guardian ad litem \"shall continue to represent the client at all subsequent hearings in proceedings under this code, including any appellate proceedings, unless relieved by the court upon a showing of good cause or upon transfer of venue.\" K.S.A. 2014 Supp. 38-2205(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   After the CINC hearing concluded, Mason informed J.T. that he represented Moyer and asked J.T. if he could speak to her about\n   J.M. and H.M. She agreed to talk with Mason and explained that she knew J.M. and H.M.; that she was aware of the sexual abuse allegations J.M. made against Moyer; and that J.M. and H.M. had told her that the allegations made against Moyer were false. J.T. told Mason that she was willing to testify in Moyer's case. Mason believed that J.T.'s testimony would \"have had nothing to do with the State's Motion In Limine\" regarding J.T.'s father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Close to the trial date, Mason attempted to locate J.T. to subpoena her to testify, and he learned she was at the St. Catherine's Hospital psychiatric ward in Garden City. Mason discussed with Moyer the dangers of calling a witness suffering from mental problems, but Moyer said he still wanted J.T. to testify. After Mason contacted J.T. to assess her ability to testify and to determine the substance of her testimony, he subpoenaed her. But Mason was informed that J.T.'s doctor would not approve J.T. coming to Goodland to testify because she needed to go immediately to a residential psychiatric treatment facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Mason acknowledged the potential conflict of interest created because of his roles as J.T.'s guardian ad litem and Moyer's defense attorney, and he admitted to the court that he had not obtained a written waiver of conflict from either Moyer or J.T. But he nevertheless asserted: \"I don't believe that there's a conflict under the circumstances.\" That assertion was followed by a discussion of submitting the testimony of an unavailable witness, in which Mason asserted that there would be \"an absolute conflict of interest if the question would be whether I would be presenting-presenting that evidence to the Court or to the jury. I can't do that because I'm Mr. Moyer's attorney, but the information that came to me came only to me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   The State responded by pointing out that Mason had failed to advise the court about this potential conflict of interest at any of the earlier court hearings. Further, the State argued that the potential conflict of interest was a secondary consequence of the defense counsel's failure to properly subpoena J.T.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   The district court made the following findings on the record, with emphasis added:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-203\">\n   \"Then the situation is this as near as I can tell: This case has been lengthy in its preparation, the counsel have been extremely professional in the submissions so far.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-204\">\n   \"It would appear to me that the State and the Defense have both been given a wide latitude in regards to presenting their cases and their theories. I understand that Mr. Moyer is given the authority to have the theory of his defense and that the jury should weigh that theory of defense.\n   <em>\n    I also note that the subpoena was issued just this morning\n   </em>\n   . Whether it's valid, whether it's invalid will be decided by others, not me because the bottom line is this:\n   <em>\n    I find that first of all, in the first issue in regards to the conflict of the guardian ad litem, whether he should have been talking, whether he shouldn't have been talking, I understand completely why Defense has done what they've done, they've said what they've said.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-205\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    I have found that Mr. Mason's behavior in the past has always been to the utmost of the legal and ethical duties that are required. If there is an issue, if there is a problem, then those problems will be dealt with by others.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-206\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-207\">\n   \"The issue, the critical issue that I see is really twofold for the day, and that is the testimony of the unavailable witness or\n   pseudo-unavailable witness really is more conflicted than the Defense says, because we have not only the question of the testimony only coming through a defense counsel, which it cannot and should not come through; but the-second of all is if she is allowed to testify, we have got to confirm that she is in a mental state where she could testify, and we don't have that knowledge, we don't have the doctors or whatever to deal with that knowledge at this point.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-208\">\n   \"And so what I am going to do is this: I'll give you a bit of an out. I expect that the testimony will continue from Mr. Moyer. If we find at the completion of that testimony that [J.T.] is available to travel here first thing in the morning and that there is somebody willing to testify that she is competent and capable to testify, then I will allow that to take place.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-209\">\n   \"If, however, you cannot show that, then I specifically find that the Defense has had an ample opportunity to prepare their case, that there has not been a subpoena issued prior to today's date, and that we're going to go forward and this case will be concluded and taken to the jury in an appropriate fashion.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   At the conclusion of Moyer's testimony, the parties had another chambers conference regarding J.T.'s availability to testify. Mason explained that his law partner had spoken with a screening therapist at St. Catherine's who explained that a doctor informed the screening team that J.T. \"would be extremely unreliable in any testimony and would lack any credibility whatsoever.\" The screening therapist could not tell the law partner whether J.T. was competent to testify. The therapist relayed that J.T. was being sent to a psychiatric\n   residential treatment facility where she would not be free to leave and that they did not recommend that she be forced to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   The court noted: \"It would appear then that the possibility of [J.T.] being capable of testifying is extraordinarily small, and even if she were, there's a question as to any value that her testimony would be given.\" Mason told the court, \"That is exactly my assessment of it, Your Honor,\" and asked for additional time to speak with his client about the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   The court granted this request and after the conference, the following information was placed on the record:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-213\">\n   \"MR. MASON: ... Although my client believes that the evidence that [J.T.] would testify to, as he understands it, would be beneficial to him based on what I've already put on the record, we have also expressed-discussed the fact that the information that we have from two different individuals involved in the screening processes, that her testimony today would be extremely unreliable and lack any credibility and that the State would have the opportunity to bring that to the jury's attention; and therefore, it would not be appropriate to use [J.T.'s] testimony today.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   The court then had Moyer confirm that he understood what Mason had said and that he agreed with the decision to proceed. Moyer also told the court that he was satisfied with Mason's representation to that point. But the district court made no explicit finding with respect to whether a conflict of interest existed. Rather, as noted above, the judge said that he understood Mason's action, that Mason's past behavior had always been ethical, and that \"if there is a problem, then those problems will be dealt with by others.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   This court has held \"repeatedly that a district court abuses its discretion when it fails to inquire into a potential conflict that is made known to it.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

For instance, the information coming out of the facility where J.T. was located suggested that it would not be in J.T.'s best interests to be forced to testify at Moyer's trial. As J.T.'s guardian ad litem, Mason had the statutory obligation to advocate for her best interests, albeit we do not know whether that duty to J.T. still existed at the time that Mason owed Moyer a duty to present the best possible defense at trial. And if those contradictory loyalties coexisted, was it possible for Mason to objectively advise Moyer on whether to attempt to force J.T.'s testimony?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   On the other hand, the State argued to the district court that J.T.'s apparent unavailability was a consequence of Mason's failure to properly issue and serve a subpoena forcing her appearance. If that is true, then Moyer's Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel might well have been denied because of Mason's ineffectiveness, rather than, or in addition to, his conflict of interest.\n   <em>\n    State v.

But Moyer's last issue specifically asks for a\n   <em>\n    Van Cleave\n   </em>\n   remand, albeit the request is conditioned upon our finding no other reason to reverse. Nevertheless, Moyer alleges ineffective assistance of counsel, including the conflict of interest complaint, with sufficient specificity to warrant a remand to resolve the issues.

Defense counsel argued that Officer Showalter's involvement in the arrest and status as a witness in the case \"would give an impression to the jury of favoritism or more significant weight\" to Officer Showalter's testimony. In response, the State informed the court that it did not intend to call Officer Showalter in its case-in-chief and, therefore,\n   the officer would only be called if the defense thought his testimony was necessary, which the State did not anticipate. The judge apparently realized the conflict and formally struck Officer Showalter as a witness and denied Moyer's motion. At a later pretrial hearing, defense counsel requested redaction of Officer Showalter's name from trial documents and that Officer Showalter \"simply be referred to as the other deputy\" during testimony. The prosecutor asked the court to overrule the motion and pointed out that counsel's earlier motion to recuse was improper as to form because the defendant did not file an affidavit under seal and give the motion to the chief judge. Nevertheless, Judge Showalter granted the motion, stating, \"This is a molehill in which we have a mountain of evidence and under the circumstances, in an abundance of caution, I see no substantial problem for the State to simply redact or erase Officer Showalter's involvement in this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   K.S.A. 20-311d states that \"a party must first file a motion for change of judge; if that motion is denied, then the party must immediately file a legally sufficient affidavit alleging grounds set forth in the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Sawyer\n   </em>\n   , 297 Kan. at 908,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417311\" index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/297/902/#p909\">\n    305 P.3d 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While Moyer and his counsel did not comply with the second step by failing to file an affidavit once the initial motion was denied, the judge's actions of removing his son as an endorsed witness and then later ordering redaction of his son's name from various pieces of evidence acknowledge the inherent conflict that arose under the facts presented here. The judge's focus on the evidentiary impact on the jury is not the sole basis of the conflict. In fact, it should have become self-evident that it was the judge's presence in the case-not his son's-that necessitated the precautionary actions taken. Typically, redaction is the result when inadmissible information is contained in otherwise admissible evidence, it is not necessitated by a conflict of interest of the presiding judge. At this juncture, the judge at a minimum should have questioned his continued presence and addressed whether his son's involvement in the prosecution of the case impacted Moyer's ability to receive a fair trial in light of K.S.A. 20-311d. This is especially true since the State had just brought to the court's attention the requirements of the statute. It should have been patently obvious that simply removing his son's name from\n   the endorsed witness list in the complaint and then erasing his involvement from among the information before the jury,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the evidence in the case, did not resolve the glaring lapse regarding the ethical obligation that arises under our code of judicial conduct. A duty to recuse existed under these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   Kansas Supreme Court Rule 601B, Canon 2 (2014 Kan. Ct. R. Annot. 761), states: \"A judge shall perform the duties of judicial office impartially, competently, and diligently.\" Rule 2.11(A) of this Canon addresses disqualification: \"A judge shall disqualify himself or herself in any proceeding in which the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\" 2014 Kan. Ct. R. Annot. 767. Rule 2.11(A)(2)(c) and (d)\n   <em>\n    requires\n   </em>\n   disqualification under the following specific circumstances:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-228\">\n   \"(2) The judge\n   <em>\n    knows\n   </em>\n   that the judge, the judge's spouse or\n   <em>\n    domestic partner\n   </em>\n   , or a person with the\n   <em>\n    third degree of relationship\n   </em>\n   to either of them ... is:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-229\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-230\">\n   \"(c) a person who has more than a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   interest that could be substantially affected by the proceeding; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-231\">\n   \"(d) likely to be a material witness in the proceeding.\" (Emphasis added.) 2014 Kan. Ct. R. Annot. 767-68.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   A judge's obligation not to hear or decide matters in which disqualification is required applies regardless of whether a motion to disqualify is filed. Rule 2.11, comment 2. (2014 Kan. Ct. R. Annot. 769).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   More than a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   interest can be presumed under these circumstances. The Code's terminology section states that \" '[d]e\n   minimis,' in the context of interests pertaining to disqualification of a judge, means an insignificant interest that could not raise a reasonable question regarding the judge's impartiality.\" Rule 601B (2014 Kan. Ct. R. Annot. 753). Officer Showalter's interest is certainly more than de minimis in that the trial and the verdict serve to validate the appropriateness of his involvement in the arrest of Moyer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   The real question then becomes how a parent, especially one who has the responsibility of presiding judge, could not be affected by a legal proceeding in which his or her child has more than a de minimis interest. It seems clear that under our rules, a duty\n   to recuse existed and that the actions previously taken by Judge Showalter to erase his son's name as a participant in the case did not eliminate the inherent bias created under the circumstances of this case. At a minimum, his interest is not merely insignificant; it raises a reasonable question regarding his impartiality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   Regardless, ordering that his son's name be erased from both police reports and witness lists did not eliminate Officer Showalter's actual involvement in the arrest and subsequent detainment of Moyer. In many, if not most, serious criminal cases, the circumstances surrounding the arrest of a suspect are a critical focus of pretrial motions to suppress or dismiss. Here, it is more likely than not that Officer Showalter would be a material witness to events leading up to and including the arrest and subsequent detainment of Moyer. Thus, Officer Showalter was likely to be a material witness in the case and under our code; the judge had a duty to recuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   Finally, I would find that recusal was required under the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. As the majority points out, \"The United States Supreme Court has characterized the Due Process Clause as the ' \"constitutional floor\" ' on recusal claims, with the ceiling set by ' \"common law, statutes, or the professional standards of the bench and bar.\" '\n   <em>\n    Caperton\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    v.

Employing an abuse of discretion standard, I would find that the record establishes that the trial court, while less than articulate in its rulings, conducted an adequate inquiry into the potential conflict of interest, made a sufficient record of that inquiry, and found that no conflict of interest existed. Further, I would find that Moyer has not made the necessary showing in order to obtain a\n   <em>\n    State v.

As such, I would affirm the results below, thus allowing Moyer to litigate his ineffective assistance of counsel claims in a subsequent proceeding brought pursuant to K.S.A. 60-1507.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   The majority is unclear as to exactly how the trial court abused its discretion. It is true that a district court's complete failure to inquire into a possible conflict of interest is an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v. Prado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417774\" index=\"294\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/299/1251/#p1260\">\n    299 Kan. 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1256-57,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417774\" index=\"295\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/299/1251/#p1260\">\n    329 P.3d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). Here, however, the majority acknowledges there was an inquiry. The majority does find that the trial court failed to make an adequate record and points to the fact that the \"district court made no explicit finding with respect to whether a conflict of interest existed.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Moyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418155\" index=\"296\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/302/892/#p933\">\n    302 Kan. 892\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 933,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418155\" index=\"297\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/302/892/#p933\">\n    360 P.3d 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). While true-and while certainly less than ideal-this\n   failure, when viewed in the context of the entire record, does not constitute an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   In fact, the district court did make a finding, though not explicit, that no conflict of interest existed. The district court made a clear record that Jeffery Mason (Moyer's counsel) did not believe he had a conflict; that the State did not believe Mason had a conflict; and that Moyer himself did not believe his counsel had a conflict. Furthermore, after learning the particular facts of\n   the concurrent representation Mason was engaged in, the trial court explicitly ruled: \"[I]n regards to the conflict of the guardian ad litem ... I understand completely why Defense has done what they've done\", and, \"I have found that [defense counsel's] behavior in the past has always been to the utmost of the legal and ethical duties that are required.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   While not perfect, I cannot find that this ruling, coming as it did in the specific context of the court's inquiry in this case, was an abuse of discretion. The majority moves from this finding-or lack thereof-to hold that the district court did not make a record sufficient for us to determine on review whether Moyer met his burden to \" ' \"establish that the conflict of interest adversely affected his counsel's performance.\" ' \"\n   <em>\n    Prado\n   </em>\n   , 299 Kan. at 1260,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417774\" index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/299/1251/#p1260\">\n    329 P.3d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v. Vann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3252888\" index=\"299\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/280/782/\">\n    280 Kan. 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 792,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3252888\" index=\"300\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/280/782/\">\n    127 P.3d 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [ (2006) ] ). This is followed by the majority's \"what if?\" speculation about how Mason might have compromised his duty to adequately and effectively represent Moyer.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418155\" index=\"301\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/302/892/#p933\">\n    302 Kan. at 934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418155\" index=\"302\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/302/892/#p933\">\n    360 P.3d 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is, however, a far more reasonable explanation for what the majority characterizes as the trial court's failure to \"make[ ] the determinations necessary for us to assess the impact [of the conflict of interest] on Mason's performance.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418155\" index=\"303\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/302/892/#p933\">\n    302 Kan. at 934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418155\" index=\"304\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/302/892/#p933\">\n    360 P.3d 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Simply put, there was no need for the inquiry to continue after the trial court found that no conflict of interest existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   Finally, beyond the kind of hypothetical scenarios conjured by the majority, Moyer advances no argument to support the conflict of interest he now alleges. To the contrary, the record shows Mason's diligent efforts to obtain J.T. as a witness once he discovered her missing on the eve of trial. Mason repeatedly communicated with J.T. and her doctors to determine her availability and issued a subpoena once he discovered J.T.'s hospital stay would not be\n   temporary. On the record before us, it is clear it was J.T.'s doctor's decision that prohibited her from appearing to testify during the trial. Moreover, the record also reveals legitimate reasons why J.T.'s testimony would likely have been detrimental to Moyer and his defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   In short, I would find that Moyer has failed to sustain his burden to establish either that the trial court abused its discretion or that he is entitled to a\n   <em>\n    Van Cleave\n   </em>\n   remand for further factual findings. In\n   <em>\n    Van Cleave\n   </em>\n   , we held that \"it is incumbent upon appellant's counsel to do more than read the record and then determine that he or she would have handled things differently.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1432253\" index=\"305\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/239/117/\">\n    239 Kan. at 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1432253\" index=\"306\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/239/117/\">\n    716 P.2d 580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We noted: \"Except in the most unusual cases, to assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel without any independent inquiry and investigation apart from reading the record is questionable to say the least.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1432253\" index=\"307\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/239/117/\">\n    239 Kan. at 120-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1432253\" index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/239/117/\">\n    716 P.2d 580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Until now, we have regularly refused to grant a requested\n   <em>\n    Van Cleave\n   </em>\n   remand when counsel fails to do more than simply review the record and argue on appeal that trial counsel should have acted differently.

I would continue to adhere to\n   <em>\n    Van Cleave\n   </em>\n   's commitment to grant a remand only in \"the most unusual cases.\" This would leave Moyer free to pursue his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in a subsequent action brought pursuant to K.S.A. 60-1507.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   BILES, J., joins the foregoing dissenting opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
