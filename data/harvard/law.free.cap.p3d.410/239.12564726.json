MILES HANISEE, Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   {1} Defendant John Farish appeals from the district court's on-record affirmance of his convictions in metropolitan court for driving a vehicle with defective equipment, pursuant to NMSA 1978, Section 66-3-801(A) (1991), and driving under the influence (DUI), pursuant to NMSA 1978, Section 66-8-102 (2010). Defendant argues that the officer who stopped his vehicle lacked reasonable suspicion to support the stop. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {2} At approximately 1:30 a.m. on April 13, 2012, Defendant was stopped by Bernalillo County Sheriff's Deputy Peter Martinez on Monta\u00f1o Road near Fourth Street in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The basis for the stop was that Deputy Martinez believed Defendant was violating Section 66-3-801(A) by driving a vehicle with defective equipment, specifically an improperly functioning left taillight.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant's left taillight consisted of two bulbs: a larger upper bulb, and a smaller lower bulb. While the lower bulb was lit, the upper bulb was not. After first observing Defendant's vehicle, Deputy Martinez followed Defendant for approximately one-quarter mile, during which time he also \"observed some driving behaviors that were possible for someone who might be under the influence.\" Specifically, he observed Defendant swerve within the lane twice in a manner that nearly drove over the lane markings, though he never saw Defendant leave the lane or touch the markings. Deputy Martinez testified that there were no other violations of law and that his only basis for stopping Defendant was the perceived taillight violation. Upon making contact with Defendant, Deputy Martinez noticed that Defendant had bloodshot, watery eyes and the smell of alcohol coming from his facial area. Deputy Martinez then initiated a DUI investigation, and Defendant was subsequently charged with DUI (first offense) and operating a vehicle with defective equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {3} Prior to trial, Defendant requested and the metropolitan court held an evidentiary\n   hearing on the question of reasonable suspicion. After Deputy Martinez testified to the above-cited facts, Defendant argued that the charges against him should be dismissed because the testimony indicated that Defendant had two taillights that were in \"working condition,\" meaning that Deputy Martinez lacked reasonable suspicion of a violation of either Section 66-3-801(A) providing, among other things, that it is a misdemeanor to operate a vehicle \"which ... is not at all times equipped with such lamps and other equipment in proper condition and adjustment as is required by [ NMSA 1978, \u00a7\u00a7 66-3-801 to -887 (1978, as amended through 2017) ],\" or Section 66-3-805(A) (setting forth specific requirements for tail lamps), and that there was no other reasonable basis for the stop. Defendant argued that \"the light, maybe a bulb, being out was not reason enough to pull over [Defendant.]\" Alternatively, Defendant argued that the stop was pretextual. The State argued that Deputy Martinez had reasonable suspicion because part of Defendant's left taillight was not lit, meaning it was not \"in proper condition\" as required by Section 66-3-801(A). The State also argued that Defendant failed to meet his burden of establishing that the stop was pretextual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {4} The metropolitan court found that Deputy Martinez had reasonable suspicion to stop Defendant's vehicle based on Deputy Martinez's observation that part of Defendant's taillight was not illuminated. It reasoned that \"[one] light not working out of a two-part light would still be a defective equipment [violation]\" under Section 66-3-801, i.e., it was a per se violation. The metropolitan court further found that there was no testimony elicited to support Defendant's argument that the stop was pretextual and therefore denied Defendant's motion to dismiss on that basis as well. Defendant was subsequently convicted of DUI (first offense) and driving a vehicle with defective equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {5} In his on-record appeal to the district court, Defendant argued that the trial court misapplied Section 66-3-801 because \"a plain reading of [ Section 66-3-801 ] indicates that defective equipment is defined in [S]ections 66-3-801 through 66-3-887[,]\" making it necessary to \"analyze [S]ection 66-3-805(A), which defines functioning tail lamps[.]\" Section 66-3-805(A) provides that \"[e]very motor vehicle ... shall be equipped with at least two tail lamps mounted on the rear\" and that such lamps \"shall emit a red light plainly visible from a distance of [500] feet to the rear[.]\" According to Defendant, Deputy Martinez failed to articulate facts that would support reasonable suspicion that Defendant had violated Section 66-3-805(A) because Deputy Martinez conceded that he was, at all times, within 500 feet of the rear of Defendant's vehicle, thus making any suspected violation speculative rather than reasonable. The district court agreed with Defendant that \"there can be no violation of Section 66-3-801 with respect to defective tail[ ]lights without reference to Section 66-3-805\" and concluded that \"to the extent Deputy Martinez relied on Section[s] 66-3-801 [and -805(A) ] for a per se violation, the [district c]ourt agrees the officer made a mistake of law.\" However, the district court construed Section 66-3-805(C) as providing an independent basis supporting the existence of reasonable suspicion. According to the district court, Section 66-3-805(C) requires that \"if a tail lamp is wired to be lighted, it must be lit when it is dark.\" Thus, reasoned the district court, because Deputy Martinez articulated facts that would support the conclusion that Defendant violated Section 66-3-805(C) because the upper, larger portion of one of Defendant's taillights was not lighted at 1:30 a.m. when it would have been dark, there was reasonable suspicion to stop Defendant. Accordingly, the district court affirmed Defendant's convictions. Defendant now appeals to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Statutory Interpretation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {6} \"Statutory interpretation is an issue of law, which we review de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State argues that Deputy Martinez's testimony supported a conclusion that he had reasonable suspicion to investigate a potential equipment violation under either Sections 66-3-805(A) or (C). The State also challenges the district court's conclusion that \"there can be no violation of Section 66-3-801 with respect to defective tail[ ]lights without reference to Section 66-3-805\" and argues that Section 66-3-801(A) provided an independent basis for a violation because Defendant's left taillight was \"in such unsafe condition as to endanger any person.\" We consider the parties' arguments in turn and, ultimately, whether the facts in the record support the conclusion that Deputy Martinez had reasonable suspicion that Defendant was committing a traffic violation by driving a vehicle with a malfunctioning taillight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Section 66-3-805(A)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {9} Defendant argues that there are insufficient facts to support a finding that Deputy Martinez had reasonable suspicion that Defendant violated Section 66-3-805(A) by driving a vehicle with a left taillight in which the larger upper bulb was not working. In order to have such reasonable suspicion, the officer must be able to articulate facts that would support a reasonable inference that the subject vehicle's taillights failed to \"emit a red light plainly visible from a distance of [500] feet to the rear.\" Section 66-3-805(A);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dopslaf\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362063\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nmca/2015/098/4362063/\">\n    2015-NMCA-098\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=356%20P.3d%20559\">\n    356 P.3d 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Deputy Martinez conceded that he was never 500 feet or more away from Defendant's vehicle and that his opinion that Defendant's vehicle would not be visible at a distance of 500 feet was \"an assumption based off of prior inciden[ts he has] had viewing vehicles.\" Both the metropolitan\n   court and the district court agreed that Deputy Martinez's testimony failed to establish facts that would support reasonable suspicion of a violation based on Section 66-3-805(A). We, too, conclude that Deputy Martinez's speculative testimony as to whether Defendant's left taillight would or would not have been visible from 500 feet away is insufficient to establish reasonable suspicion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Section 66-3-805(C) provides, in its entirety:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Either a tail lamp or a separate lamp shall be so constructed and placed as to illuminate with a white light the rear registration plate and render it clearly legible from a distance of [50] feet to the rear. Any tail lamp or tail lamps, together with any separate lamp for illuminating the rear registration plate, shall be so wired as to be lighted whenever the headlamps or auxiliary driving lamps are lighted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Divorcing the provision's second sentence from the first, the district court construed the second sentence to \"mean that if a tail lamp is wired to be lighted, it must be lit when it is dark.\" Applying its interpretation of Section 66-3-805(C) to the facts, the district court noted that Deputy Martinez \"articulated facts to support a reasonable suspicion [that] Defendant violated Section 66-3-801 because his tail[ ]lights were not lit as required by Section 66-3-805(C).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {11} We conclude that the district court erred in interpreting Section 66-3-805(C). \"When expounding a statute, we must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Starko, Inc. v.

Read in its entirety, Section 66-3-805(C) deals primarily, if not exclusively, with illumination of the rear registration plate. The first sentence requires that the license plate be visible 50 feet away. The second sentence, requiring any tail lamp or lamps to \"be so wired as to be lighted\" in conjunction with headlamps, can best be understood as further requiring that the tail lamps and rear registration plate area illuminate simultaneously with headlamps. Because the gravamen of Section 66-3-805(C) is directed toward the license plate being illuminated and there was no testimony whatsoever regarding whether or not Defendant's license plate was, or any indication that the requisite wiring was unlinked to the headlamps, the district court improperly relied upon Section 66-3-805(C) to find that Deputy Martinez had reasonable suspicion of a violation based solely upon a partial failure of one taillight to fully illuminate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {12} At this juncture of the analysis, Defendant appears to argue that our inquiry ends and reversal is required because Deputy Martinez failed to articulate facts sufficient to support the existence of reasonable suspicion that Defendant had violated Section 66-3-805(A) or (C) and because there is no independent basis for a taillight violation under Section 66-3-801(A).

We initially note that our case law is clear that the New Mexico Constitution affords no greater protection against investigatory traffic stops than does the Fourth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

We next note that\n   <em>\n    Heien\n   </em>\n   does not alter the basic reasonable suspicion analysis under the Fourth Amendment but merely provides that an officer's mistake of law, if reasonable, does not make a stop per se unreasonable and thus a violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heien\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12593411\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/530/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that \"the mistake of law relates to the antecedent question of whether it was reasonable for an officer to suspect that the defendant's conduct was illegal.

Moreover, we note that Defendant does nothing more to develop his argument than provide an explanation regarding why he did not raise this issue below and cite a single, distinguishable case for the proposition that \"the New Mexico Constitution provides greater protection [regarding mistakes of law] as the exclusion of evidence illegally obtained does not rely upon deterrent effect or judicial integrity but rather vindicates the right of the individual and effectuates the law of the pending case.\" As is well-established practice in appellate review, we decline to speculate as to what the specific basis for Defendant's argument may be.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Section 66-3-901 did not provide an additional,\n   independent criminal basis to violate the Motor Vehicle Code and thereby establish reasonable suspicion for Deputy Martinez to stop Defendant's vehicle. Because the majority's ruling is one of \"first impression\" and focuses on statutory construction to arrive at a right for any reason determination, my analysis shall address each distinct issue separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {24} First, both the majority and I could find no New Mexico case to support the position that Section 66-3-901 provides an independent basis to establish a \"criminal violation\" of the Motor Vehicle Code, either in general or specifically, and that the present state of our judicial precedent only recognizes criminal lighting violations that are based upon the specific lighting requirements set forth in Sections 66-3-801 to -805.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Majority Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 16-19. The original predecessor to Section 66-3-901 was NMSA 1953, Section 64-21-1(a) (1953). Historically, a statutory requirement for safety inspections and certificates also existed and required a state approval certificate for all motor vehicles.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NMSA 1953, \u00a7 64-21-2 to -4 (1953).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {25} Under the statutory scheme involving an official certificate of inspection and approval, our Supreme Court recognized that civil liability could exist against the owner of an uncertified vehicle in order to establish a presumption of civil negligence based upon the \"defective condition of the brakes\" and the requirements of Sections 64-21-1 to -8 (1953).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ferran v.

However, our appellate courts have never recognized Section 64-21-1 (1953) and its present-day successor, Section 66-3-901, as the basis for establishing a misdemeanor crime arising from a lighting equipment violation that is more specifically addressed under the other provisions of the Motor Vehicle Code.
