Garden City Janitorial has a workers' compensation insurance policy from the Montana State Fund (State Fund). On May 18, 2011, Ailer filed a claim with the State Fund, reporting that he injured his arm in the crash. Ailer asserted his symptoms worsened even after receiving continued medical treatment. Ailer was ultimately released to full-duty employment by Dr. Stephen Powell on October 4, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 On October 6, 2011, Ailer began seeing a physical therapist, Kristen Green. Ailer asked Green for a note to give to his employer\n   that would restrict him from lifting a heavy floor burnisher while at work. Green wrote a letter and Ailer gave it to his employer, Cory Miller. The day after receiving this letter, Miller trained Ailer and Ailer's coworker, Jeff Russell, to safely lift the burnisher and unload it from the back of the work truck using a ramp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Ailer filed a second workers' compensation claim with the State Fund, reporting that his arm went numb as he was lifting the burnisher into the work truck on October 16, 2011, and it fell on him. Russell and Chelsea Chafee, another coworker and Ailer's fianc\u00e9e at the time, were with Ailer when this accident occurred. Russell and Chafee took Ailer\n   to the emergency room at Community Medical Center in Missoula. Ailer complained of pain, numbness and a pin-pricking sensation in his neck and back. During the months following the accident, Ailer complained to doctors that he was in extreme pain, could not use his right arm and leg, and could not walk without the use of a cane. The State Fund accepted Ailer's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 On March 12, 2012, Russell told Miller that Ailer's accident with the burnisher was staged. Russell reported to Gaylen Buchanan, a Special Investigator for the State Fund, that Ailer and Chafee asked Russell to put the burnisher on top of Ailer after they finished a job cleaning the O'Reilly's auto parts store in Missoula. Russell stated that Ailer wanted it to look like an accident so that Ailer could file a workers' compensation claim. Russell was reluctant but agreed to help after Ailer and Chafee promised to pay Russell $20,000 from the settlement of Ailer's claim. Russell stated that the three of them drove a few blocks away from the auto parts store to carry out the plan. Russell and Chafee placed the burnisher on Ailer's chest and rolled it back and forth to create an injury. However, Ailer was not satisfied with the result and asked Russell to punch Ailer several times. After doing so, Russell and Chafee took Ailer to the Community Medical Center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Buchanan began to investigate Russell's claim that the accident was staged. Buchanan discovered evidence that Ailer's complaints and claims did not align with his physical symptoms, or lack thereof. The State Fund referred the case to the Montana Department of Justice, Division of Criminal Investigations for further investigation. DCI Agent Butch Huseby was assigned the case. Agent Huseby focused on Ailer's medical reports and interviewed many of the doctors and medical staff that had treated Ailer since his injury in October 2011. Agent Huseby noted that all of the doctors agreed Ailer showed no medical signs of trauma or injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 On March 14, 2014, Ailer was charged by Information with Theft,\n   a felony, for purposely and knowingly staging a work accident on October 16, 2011, for the purpose of filing a false workers' compensation insurance claim with the State Fund. Trial commenced on December 7, 2015. On December 11, 2015, a jury found Ailer guilty of Theft, by common scheme, of workers' compensation benefits provided under the Workers Compensation Act exceeding $1,500 in value. Ailer's sentencing hearing was held on March 24, 2016. On April 11, 2016, the District Court deferred sentencing for six years and ordered Ailer to pay restitution in the amount of $70,680.34. The District Court found that the total amount of loss incurred by the State Fund was $64,025.34 and imposed additional statutory and administration fees. Ailer appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 Ineffective assistance of counsel claims are mixed questions of law and fact, which we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Both prongs of the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   test must be satisfied for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim to be successful.\n   <em>\n    Whitlow\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 Ailer alleges his trial counsel was ineffective for three different reasons. First, Ailer argues that his trial counsel was ineffective because counsel failed to object when Agent Huseby testified: \"I looked into the statute to see what elements of theft are involved in this case and did he purposely and knowingly commit a crime to get to this end, and I would say he did.\" Ailer alleges he was prejudiced because Agent Huseby testified to the ultimate issue in the case and Ailer's intent. Second, Ailer argues his trial counsel was ineffective because counsel failed to rebut a \"material misstatement of fact\" regarding whether Ailer had been treated for conversion disorder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cecelia Robinson, a claims adjuster for the Montana State Fund, testified that Ailer was never treated for conversion disorder and the State Fund never approved any payments for conversion disorder treatment. Ailer alleges that his trial counsel should have corrected Robinson and pointed to claims review analysis forms that were examined by Robinson and reflected treatment for conversion disorder and approved payments for such. Third, Ailer argues his trial counsel was ineffective because counsel failed to object to the prosecutor asking Ailer on cross\n   examination if other witnesses were lying when Ailer's testimony conflicted with testimony given by the State's witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b614 Putting aside the question of whether counsel's approach was deficient, Ailer fails to establish how Ailer's trial counsel's failure to object during Agent Huseby's testimony prejudiced him. Even if counsel had objected to Agent Huseby's statement, Ailer fails to show how the result of the proceeding would have been different. If anything, Agent Huseby's testimony was cumulative and added nothing to what had already been covered by the principal fact witnesses at trial. Clearly the jury would have formed their views of the case based on the credibility of those principal witnesses, rather than a minor comment from the investigator regarding his opinion. Both Russell and Chafee testified regarding Ailer's intent when they stated that the three of them staged the burnisher incident with Ailer so that Ailer could obtain worker's compensation benefits. Based on our review of the record, trial counsel's failure to object to Agent Huseby's characterization of Ailer's actions as fraudulent did not prejudice Ailer's defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b615 Likewise, Ailer fails to demonstrate how his trial counsel's failure to rebut Robinson's testimony regarding whether Ailer had been treated for conversion disorder prejudiced him. That issue was addressed multiple times throughout the trial. Shortly before Robinson testified that Ailer had never been treated for cognitive disorder, she\n   stated that she was aware that Ailer had been diagnosed with conversion disorder but did not think it was related to \"either Work Comp incident.\" Tollison treated Ailer in 2014 and testified that two previous providers diagnosed Ailer with conversion disorder. Tollison proceeded to describe the specifics of conversion disorder and how it applied in Ailer's case. Based on our review of the trial transcript, trial counsel's failure to correct Robinson's statement would not be a factor that could change the final outcome of this proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b616 Finally, Ailer was not prejudiced when his trial counsel failed to object when the State asked Ailer if the other witnesses were lying on points of disagreement. It is within the district court's discretion to allow \"were they lying\" questions.\n   <em>\n    State v. Hart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1275714\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/303/71/\">\n    2000 MT 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 43,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1275714\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/303/71/\">\n    303 Mont. 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1275714\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/303/71/\">\n    15 P.3d 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The principal role of the jury in this case was to decide the credibility of the witnesses. Notably, in order to acquit Ailer in this proceeding, the jury would need to have developed reasonable doubt regarding the credibility of the other witnesses. Montana law has allowed counsel to ask a defendant if other witnesses in their case lied during their testimony.\n   <em>\n    State v. Webster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1143639\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/326/112/\">\n    2005 MT 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1143639\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/326/112/\">\n    326 Mont. 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1143639\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/326/112/\">\n    107 P.3d 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Hart\n   </em>\n   , we decided that the use of\n   \"are they lying\" questions is of probative value in certain situations such as when \"clarifying a particular line of testimony, in evaluating the credibility of a defendant who is claiming that everyone else is lying, or when a witness flatly denies the occurrence of events.\"\n   <em>\n    Hart\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 40 (citing\n   <em>\n    State v. Pilot\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=595%20N.W.2d%20511\">\n    595 N.W.2d 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 518 (Minn. 1999).) Here, Ailer claimed that everyone else was lying and flatly denied that the burnisher incident was posed. Counsel's failure to object when the State asked Ailer if Russell and Chafee were lying did not prejudice Ailer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b617 After a review of the record we conclude that Ailer was not prejudiced by his trial counsel's actions. He has not shown a reasonable probability exists that, but for counsel's alleged errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\n   <em>\n    Bomar\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 8.

However, evidence of prior acts is \"admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\" M. R. Evid. 404(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b620 On April 22, 2015, the District Court denied Ailer's motion in limine, which argued that evidence of Ailer's wage garnishment was a prior bad act and inadmissible evidence under M. R. Evid. 404(b). Ailer alleges \"the use of outstanding debts serves only to malign a defendant and characterize him as dishonest, untruthful, and desperate for money.\" The District Court found that although wage garnishment may be considered as a prior bad act, it was admissible to prove motive and found the prejudicial effect of the evidence did not outweigh its probative value. We agree with the District Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b621 Other courts have taken a similar approach. In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, evidence of Ailer's wages being garnished just a week prior to the burnisher incident occurred is evidence of Ailer's motive to commit theft. This is not to say that every person in debt has a motive\n   to commit theft. Our holding is narrow to the specific facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b622 This Court has established that even if evidence of a prior bad act is admissible, it may be excluded if \"the nature of the evidence might tempt the jury to decide the case against the defendant on an improper propensity basis.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Considering a point made by Ailer in his appellate brief that many Americans possess debt, it is unlikely that a jury would conclude that Ailer \"had defrauded credit card companies and so defrauded the State Fund in a similar way.\" The unlikelihood of this impropriety is supported by the manner in which evidence of Ailer's debt was presented during trial. The State did not use the evidence of Ailer's wage garnishment to characterize him as dishonest or untruthful such as Ailer suggests. The State established the fact that Ailer was in \"substantial\" debt and noted the day Miller told Ailer that Ailer's wages would be garnished. Evidence of Ailer's wage garnishment was logically used to establish motive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b623 The District Court concluded that the prejudicial effect of the evidence did not outweigh its probative value. The prejudicial effect of evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts will substantially outweigh its probative value if the jury is prompted to decide the case on an improper basis.\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts will always have some prejudicial effect on a criminal defendant.\n   <em>\n    Southern\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 38. The State's use of Ailer's wage garnishment was probative in establishing his motive to pose the burnisher incident and did not unfairly prejudice Ailer. The District Court did not abuse its discretion when it found that Ailer's wage garnishment was admissible evidence pursuant to M. R. Evid. 404(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b624\n   <em>\n    3. Whether the District Court had substantial evidence to support its restitution order.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b625 If a victim suffers a pecuniary loss as a result of a criminal offense, the sentencing court must order the offender to pay restitution. Section 46-18-201(5), MCA. The District Court found that the total amount of loss incurred by the State Fund as a result of Ailer's actions\n   was $64,025.34. Taking into account statutory and administration fees, the District Court ordered Ailer to pay restitution in the amount of $70,680.34. Ailer alleges the District Court erred when it awarded restitution without substantial evidence supporting the State Fund's pecuniary loss. Ailer relies on two cases previously decided by this Court:\n   <em>\n    State v. Aragon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4035907\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/374/391/\">\n    2014 MT 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4035907\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/374/391/\">\n    374 Mont. 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4035907\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/374/391/\">\n    321 P.3d 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, these cases are materially different from the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b626 In\n   <em>\n    Aragon\n   </em>\n   , there were two estimates as to the damages and restitution amount, which were \"entirely devoid of context or explanation about the difference between the two.\"\n   <em>\n    Aragon\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 17. No witnesses testified before the district court as to the amount lost. This Court held that without any testimony or other evidence to explain the different estimates, neither estimate was supported by substantial evidence. Here, the District Court heard testimony from Suzanna Simmons, a former claims examiner for State Fund, who provided an in-depth explanation of the amounts State Fund paid out to Ailer after his second claim for workers' compensation was filed. The documents Simmons used to calculate the State's proposed restitution amount were admitted into evidence as exhibits during the sentencing hearing, further explaining what was paid out to Ailer and when it was paid out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b627 In\n   <em>\n    Coluccio\n   </em>\n   , this Court concluded that testimony by the decedent's wife who estimated counseling expenses, made assumptions about future home repair costs, and gave her husband's potential earning capacity did not constitute substantial evidence of the restitution amount without further support. Ailer argues that like the decedent's wife in\n   <em>\n    Coluccio\n   </em>\n   , the State's restitution witness muddled her calculations. Ailer alleges that Simmons failed to concretely distinguish between the payments State Fund made regarding Ailer's first claim in May 2011 and\n   his second claim in October 2011. Ailer alleges some of the medical benefits paid to Ailer should relate back to his May 2011 claim, which would reduce the overall restitution amount awarded by the District Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b628 Simmons affirmed numerous times throughout the sentencing hearing that her calculations related strictly to Ailer's second workers' compensation claim, which had a different claim number than his first claim. Simmons emphasized the fact that Ailer was released back to full duty on October 4, 2011, which was thirteen days before he filed the burnisher claim. In Simmons' opinion, Ailer's release date separated his claims and the correlating benefit payments from State Fund. Simmons also noted her reliance as a claims examiner on what\n   Ailer told his doctors about his injury. Based on these and other key pieces of information, Simmons testified that the money paid out to Ailer related to injuries sustained from the burnisher incident, and not injuries sustained from his May 2011 accident and claim. Substantial evidence was admitted to support the District Court's restitution award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b629 The District Court did not err when it denied Ailer's ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Ailer has not satisfied his burden to establish that he was prejudiced by his trial counsel's actions. The District Court did not err when it admitted evidence of Ailer's debt and wage garnishment as motive evidence under M. R. Evid. 404(b). Substantial evidence supports the District Court's restitution order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b630 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We Concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   LAURIE McKINNON, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   JAMES JEREMIAH SHEA, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   BETH BAKER, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   DIRK M.
