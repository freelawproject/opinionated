Pursuant to a plea agreement, Appellant entered an unconditional\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   guilty plea to one count of second degree murder.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-2-104\">\n    Wyo.

This Court subsequently entered an \"Order Granting Motion for Extension of Time to File\n   <em>\n    Pro Se\n   </em>\n   Brief.\" This Court ordered that Appellant \"may file with this Court a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   brief specifying the issues he would like this Court to consider in this appeal.\" This Court also provided notice that, after the time for filing a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   brief expired, this Court would \"make its ruling on counsel's motion to withdraw and, if appropriate, make a final decision on this appeal.\" On January 24, 2018, Appellant filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   pleading titled, \"Appellant's Brief in Opposition to 'Brief of Appellant Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Anders v.

With respect to Appellant's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   pleading, this Court finds that Appellant's opposition does not provide any reason to believe that appellate counsel filed an inadequate\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief. Instead, this Court finds that, based on the record extant, the\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief adequately discusses and refutes the potential issues here. Finally, for the sake of clarification, this Court notes it reviewed the portion of the change of plea transcript that was filed under seal.
