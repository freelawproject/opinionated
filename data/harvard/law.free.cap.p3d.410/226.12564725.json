GARCIA, Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   {1} Defendant, Fabian Lopez, was convicted of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, following a workplace altercation. Defendant raises multiple issues on appeal, including whether the over two hundred day delay between conviction and sentencing violated due process. As an issue of first impression, we conclude that Defendant failed to show prejudice and that no due process violation occurred. On Defendant's remaining arguments raised on appeal, we hold that there is no reversible error. As such, we affirm Defendant's conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {2} In February 2011, Saul Montano (Victim or Mr. Montano) and Defendant both worked at the Midway Dairy in Portales, New Mexico. Defendant speaks very little Spanish and Mr. Montano speaks very little English. On February 13, 2011, the two men engaged in an altercation which seemingly resulted from their limited proficiency in the language spoken by the other party. While the two men were working, they began verbally arguing and at first, Jesus Acosta, a witness to the altercation, believed the two men were just kidding around. Mr. Acosta testified that a third person was mistranslating what Defendant and Mr. Montano were saying to each other. Defendant testified that he believed that Mr. Montano was gay and was trying to come on to him, saying \"open [your] butt hole.\" Mr. Montano testified that he said to Defendant \"make way asshole\" while trying to get by him in the dairy. Defendant became furious and he yelled at Mr. Montano that he was not gay. The two men went outside and both men testified that the other threw the first punch. They scuffled for a few minutes and Defendant ended up on the ground. Defendant testified that he had his shirt over his head, which caused him to panic. Mr. Montano admitted that he was going to continue to punch Defendant, but Defendant pulled a knife out of his boot. Defendant then stabbed Mr. Montano one time in his upper leg near his buttocks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {3} State Police Agent Noe Alvarado was dispatched to the home of Mr. Montano, where he was receiving medical attention from paramedics. Agent Alvarado then went to the dairy to speak with Defendant, where Defendant's wife gave Agent Alvarado the knife used in the altercation. Defendant admitted to Agent Alvarado that he had an argument with and then stabbed Mr. Montano.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {4} Defendant was arrested and then released on bond on February 16, 2011, and remained out on bond during the entirety of the proceedings. A preliminary hearing was held in Roosevelt County Magistrate Court on April 13, 2011. On April 14, 2011, the State filed a criminal information charging\n   Defendant with aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, pursuant to NMSA 1978, Section 30-3-5(A), (C) (1969), and attached a list of witnesses for trial, including Agent Alvarado and Mr. Montano. On June 24, 2011, the State filed a second witness list adding Mr. Acosta with his address as the Midway Dairy in Portales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {5} A hearing was held on August 19, 2011, regarding Defendant's motion for discovery. The State notified the district court that discovery had been available on the database since April 28, 2011. Defendant filed a motion to suppress Mr. Montano's testimony on September 9, 2011, claiming the State failed to produce the \"alleged victim\" for an interview. The district court held a hearing on Defendant's motion on December 9, 2011. The State argued that it had set up two courtesy interviews with Mr. Montano but that he did not show up to either. The district court instructed Defendant to subpoena Mr. Montano and if then he did not appear, it would consider suppressing his testimony. Defendant issued a subpoena for an interview with Mr. Montano at his New Mexico address on December 16, 2011. However, service was not completed because Mr. Montano had moved to Buckeye, Arizona, a fact noted in the State's supplemental witness list filed on December 13, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {6} Trial was scheduled for September 18, 2012, but Defendant filed a motion to continue that setting, agreeing to waive time until the next setting. Defendant's motion was granted. Defendant renewed the motion to suppress Mr. Montano's testimony on September 18, 2012. Trial was rescheduled for October 17, 2012. At the docket call on October 9, 2012, Defendant realized that the December 2011 subpoena was served to Mr. Montano's prior address. The State and Defendant filed a joint motion to continue the October 2012 trial setting in an attempt to get Mr. Montano to New Mexico for an interview, agreeing that the delay in time would count against the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {7} On May 13, 2013, Defendant did not appear for the scheduled docket call and a bench warrant was issued. The bench warrant was later quashed, and Defendant notified the district court that his son had been in the hospital. At the hearing, defense counsel indicated that she had interviewed Mr. Montano by phone. On October 17, 2013, Defendant filed a motion to continue the next scheduled pretrial conference, agreeing to waive the time limits until the next setting. The trial was again rescheduled for March 26, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {8} Following a jury trial, Defendant was convicted of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon on March 26, 2014. The district court ordered a pre-sentence report from adult probation on October 20, 2014. A supplemental criminal information was filed by the State, and the district court sentenced Defendant as a habitual offender, pursuant to NMSA 1978, Section 31-18-17 (2003) with one year to serve and three years suspended. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {9} Defendant makes the following arguments: (1) the delay in holding Defendant's sentencing hearing violated Defendant's right of due process; (2) defense counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to assert Defendant's right to a speedy trial; (3) the district court erred in allowing the witness, Mr. Acosta, to testify because the State failed to disclose his address; and (4) the district court made several errors that denied Defendant a fair trial, including holding the trial at the Yam Theater and admitting certain testimony by Agent Alvarado as well as the photographs of the knife used in the altercation. Finally, Defendant argues that the cumulative impact of the errors at trial was so prejudicial that he was denied a fair trial and reversal is required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Due Process in Delayed Sentencing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {10} The New Mexico appellate courts have on several occasions analyzed cases where defendants have faced delays in the imposition of a sentence or in the enforcement of a sentence.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The district court was not in Portales, New Mexico for two weeks because it presided over a murder trial in Tucumcari, New Mexico sometime in May or June. The district court judge was then on medical leave for six weeks at the end of July. The district court sent notice on October 2, 2014, for the sentencing hearing to take place on October 20, 2014. Defendant obtained a copy of the pre-sentence report on October 16, 2014, and filed a motion to dismiss on October 22, 2014. Throughout the delay, Defendant was out on bond, was employed, and even requested further time at sentencing to get his affairs in order.

As such, Defendant did not meet his burden of proof under either theory, and we conclude that there was no violation of Defendant's right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment in the delay that occurred prior to his sentencing hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Betterman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596703\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1609/#p1612\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing that \"[i]t would be an unjustified windfall, in most cases, to remedy sentencing delay by vacating validly obtained convictions\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Recently in\n   <em>\n    State v. Castro\n   </em>\n   , this Court determined that a prima facie case for ineffective assistance of counsel was established under the facts that included defense counsel's failure to ever assert the defendant's speedy trial rights, pro forma or otherwise.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12167392\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nmca/2016/085/12167392/\">\n    2016-NMCA-085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 46, 48,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=381%20P.3d%20694\">\n    381 P.3d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, this case is easily distinguished from\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {20} In\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   , defense counsel never asserted the defendant's right to a speedy trial\n   at any time during the nearly four years that his case was pending.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46. In the present case, although it appears from the record that defense counsel failed to assert Defendant's right to a speedy trial at every available juncture, defense counsel made one pro forma assertion to the magistrate court of Defendant's Sixth Amendment right and several mentions of the lengthy time line of the case to the district court. Furthermore, in\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   this Court specifically discussed defense counsel's failure to communicate with his client, focusing his efforts on receiving payment for past work, and his several motions to withdraw.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. The defendant in\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   also presented an affidavit attesting to his desire to assert his speedy trial right.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The record before us presents no such facts or assertions by Defendant. It is not disputed that defense counsel for Defendant may have asserted Defendant's right to a speedy trial more vigorously and could have requested a speedy trial ruling from the district court during the three years it took to bring this simple aggravated battery case to trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Leon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4191871\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nmca/2013/011/4191871/\">\n    2013-NMCA-011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 20,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=292%20P.3d%20493\">\n    292 P.3d 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing a presumption of counsel's ineffectiveness when constitutional rights are implicated and counsel fails to preserve a defendant's right to appeal).

Here, defense counsel was diligent in moving to have the testimony of the Victim suppressed after he twice failed to attend scheduled interviews. Although Defendant's defense counsel ultimately interviewed Mr. Montano over the phone because he had moved to Arizona, it is possible that defense counsel hoped that Mr. Montano would either continue to elude her or fail to appear altogether for trial, requiring the State to drop the charges. Furthermore, because defense counsel was diligent, on multiple occasions, in asserting Defendant's argument regarding the State's failure to provide access to Mr. Montano, we see no reason to doubt her competency to vigorously represent Defendant at trial. Taking into account defense counsel's level of competency with regard to preparation for trial as well as the other plausible explanation for failing to more vigorously assert Defendant's speedy trial right, based upon the facts known to this Court, we agree that defense counsel was likely making specific, reasoned decisions in her representation of Defendant in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12167392\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nmca/2016/085/12167392/\">\n    2016-NMCA-085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 50,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=381%20P.3d%20694\">\n    381 P.3d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding \"no rational or strategic basis\" for the defense counsel's failure to act regarding the assertion or preservation of the defendant's right to a speedy trial).

Rule 5-501(A)(5) NMRA states that the State shall disclose to the defendant a \"written list of the names and addresses of all witnesses which the prosecutor intends to call at the trial[.]\" The State has a continuing duty under Rule 5-505(A) NMRA to disclose \"additional material or witnesses which [the prosecutor] would have been under a duty to produce or disclose [by] ... promptly giv[ing] written notice to the other party ... of the existence of the additional material or witnesses.\" The assessment of sanctions for a violation of discovery \"depends upon the extent of the [g]overnment's culpability weighed against the amount of prejudice to the defense.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State filed an updated witness list on June 24, 2011, including the name of Mr. Acosta and an address at the Midway Dairy. The prosecutor for the State located Mr. Acosta only thirty-six hours prior to trial after searching for him. Defendant was then given the opportunity to interview Mr. Acosta in person prior to his testimony. Given that Mr. Acosta was the only witness to the events between Defendant and Mr. Montano, it would have been an extreme sanction to exclude his testimony where there is no evidence that the State failed to timely disclose his identity, the State searched to locate him for an interview, and Defendant was ultimately able to interview him prior to his testimony.

However, the testimony did not affect Defendant's substantial rights in the present case. The fact that Defendant was the individual who stabbed Mr. Montano was not in dispute. Mr. Montano testified to the fact that Defendant stabbed him and was subject to cross-examination by Defendant. Defendant also testified that, during the fight, he was swinging the knife at Mr. Montano and hit him. As such, Agent Alvarado's testimony was simply cumulative evidence that corroborated the testimony of both Defendant and the Victim. As such, Agent Alvarado's testimony does not implicate a violation of the confrontation clause and any error that may have occurred would be harmless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
