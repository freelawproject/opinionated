Butler and Matthew D. Williams, both Maricopa County residents (collectively, \"Defendants\"). The trial court denied Defendants' motion for change of venue. We reverse and hold that venue does not properly lie in Navajo County as to any of the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 In March 2013, BLF entered into a legal-services agreement (the \"Representation Agreement\" or \"Agreement\") with the Hospital to draft an employment contract for the Hospital's CEO. The Hospital is in Navajo County. The Representation Agreement stated that BLF would provide \"legal services\" to the Hospital and that Everett S. Butler, BLF's sole member, would have \"primary responsibility\" for representing the Hospital. In addition to an hourly fee, the Hospital agreed to reimburse BLF for costs incurred on its behalf, including \"travel, parking, computerized legal research, long distance calls, photocopying, court costs and filing fees, court transcripts, messenger services, etc.\" The Representation Agreement was written on BLF's letterhead and displayed BLF's Phoenix address, but it was silent as to where BLF was to perform its services under the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 The relationship between the parties soured. In January 2016, the Hospital sued BLF, Butler, and Williams, a non-member attorney employed by BLF. The complaint alleged legal malpractice, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 Defendants moved to transfer venue to Maricopa County pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 12-404(A). They argued that because all Defendants resided in Maricopa County, venue in\n   Navajo County was improper unless a statutory exception applied under A.R.S. \u00a7 12-401.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 The trial court denied the motion.

The court did not address any other exception. The court of appeals declined special-action review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 We granted review to consider (1) whether BLF \"contracted in writing to perform an obligation\" in Navajo County, and (2) whether an LLC is an \"other corporation\" contemplated by the venue statute.

Therefore, according to the Hospital, BLF's obligations under the Representation Agreement could not be performed without \"acting within\" Navajo County, \"whether by traveling there physically or by causing effects within that county by use of the Internet and other communication methods.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12 But for venue to lie in Navajo County, the Representation Agreement must have\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   performance there, \"either expressly or by necessary implication.\"\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1237907\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz-app/6/1/#p2\">\n    6 Ariz.

To determine whether the Representation Agreement so required, we consider not only its text but also the allegations in the complaint, construing them in the Hospital's favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tribolet v.

Here, the Representation Agreement did not specify any place of performance. Moreover, nowhere in its complaint does the Hospital allege that the Representation Agreement required BLF to perform legal services in Navajo County. Indeed, the complaint is silent as to where BLF was to perform its obligations. Likewise, nothing in the Representation Agreement implied that BLF must do any work in Navajo County. Thus, neither the Representation Agreement nor the complaint provides any support for finding that BLF was required, expressly or by necessary implication, to perform in Navajo County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 13 The trial court misconstrued\n   <em>\n    Morgensen\n   </em>\n   by finding that the Agreement implicitly required performance in Navajo County because the Hospital \"exclusively contracted business\" there. Although the Hospital is in Navajo County, \"[t]he determining factor is not whether the contract requires the\n   <em>\n    plaintiff\n   </em>\n   to perform in the county of suit, but whether it requires the\n   <em>\n    defendant\n   </em>\n   to so perform.\"\n   <em>\n    Morgensen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1595423\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/127/55/#p56\">\n    127 Ariz. at 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1595423\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/127/55/#p56\">\n    617 P.2d at 1173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Venue as to the Attorney Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 14 The Hospital also claims venue is proper as to Butler and Williams individually under subsection (5) because, under the PLLC statute, each member or employee of a PLLC remains \"\n   <em>\n    personally\n   </em>\n   liable for any results of the negligent or wrongful acts, omissions or misconduct committed by him or by any person under his direct supervision and control while performing professional services on behalf of the limited liability company.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 29-846 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 15 This argument is unavailing. Subsection (5) applies only to \"[p]ersons who have contracted in writing to perform an obligation.\" Here, neither attorney entered into the Representation Agreement; rather, BLF did. As the Hospital acknowledges, although Butler signed the Agreement, he did so as BLF's agent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 29-654 (describing\n   when a member or manager is an agent of an LLC). But when an LLC binds itself to a contract through an agent, only the LLC, not the agent, is bound to the contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Queiroz v.

And in no event would the Representation Agreement create venue as to Williams, who did not sign the Agreement and is not even a member of BLF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 17 Furthermore, even if the subsection (5) exception applied to BLF, venue would still not lie as to Butler and Williams. Section 12-401(7) provides: \"When there are several defendants residing in different counties, action may be brought in the county in which any of the defendants reside.\" This permits defendants to be subject to venue outside their county of residence, but only if another defendant is a resident in the county of suit. BLF is not a resident of Navajo County, so \u00a7 12-401(7) would not make venue proper as to Butler and Williams under subsection (5) or any other exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Actions Against \"Other Corporations\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 18 Section 12-401(18) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Actions against railroad companies, insurance companies, telegraph or telephone companies, joint stock companies and other corporations may be brought in any county in which the cause of action, or a part thereof, arose, or in the county in which the defendant has an agent or representative, owns property or conducts any business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Subsection (18) does not refer to LLCs, so it does not on its face apply to BLF.

The venue statute itself does not define \"corporation.\" Statutes in title 10, although limited to specific sections, define various types of \"corporation[s]\" by reference to their governing statutes.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , A.R.S. \u00a7 10-140(14) (\" 'Corporation' ... means a corporation for profit ... that is incorporated under or subject to chapters 1 through 17 of this title.\"). No statutory definition of \"corporation,\" however, includes LLCs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 20 The Arizona Constitution states, \"The term 'corporation,' as used in this article, shall be construed to include all associations and joint stock companies having any powers or privileges of corporations not possessed by individuals or co-partnerships....\" Ariz. Const. art. 14, \u00a7 1. The \"powers or privileges\" of corporations are found in A.R.S. \u00a7 10-302.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reilly v. Clyne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8505104\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/27/432/#p435\">\n    27 Ariz. 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 435-36,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8505104\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/27/432/#p435\">\n    234 P. 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1925). These powers are quite similar to those of a domestic LLC, which are addressed in A.R.S. \u00a7 29-610(A). Nevertheless, an LLC does not fall within the constitutional definition, which by its terms is limited to article 14. But more importantly, the LLC statute's placement in the overall statutory scheme, its history, and its structure reflect the legislature's intent to create a new form of unincorporated business entity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 21 Limited liability companies are statutorily created entities formed pursuant to the Arizona Limited Liability Company Act (\"ALLCA\"). A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 29-601 to -858.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The legislature placed ALLCA within title 29, which governs partnerships, whereas corporations are governed by title 10. The inclusion of ALLCA under a separate title from corporations bespeaks a legislative intent to\n   create an entity distinct from corporations. And the legislature expressly recognized that an LLC organized outside Arizona is an \"unincorporated entity.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 29-601(13) (defining \"foreign limited liability company\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 22 Legislative history is likewise bereft of any suggestion that LLCs fall within the subsection (18) exception. Partnerships have never been included in an exception in the venue statute and are therefore covered by the general venue rule under \u00a7 12-401.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rev. Stat. Ariz. Terr., Civ. Code, \u00a7 17-85 (1901). And because ALLCA was enacted long after the general venue statute and the corporation exception, the legislature could not have intended to include LLCs in an exception to the venue statute when it was enacted. Nor has the legislature since manifested any intent to include them.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Collins v. Stockwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"716101\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/137/416/#p420\">\n    137 Ariz. 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 420,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"716101\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/137/416/#p420\">\n    671 P.2d 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 398 (1983) (\"Courts will not read into a statute something that is not within the manifest intent of the Legislature as gathered from the statute itself.\"). To the contrary, the inclusion of ALLCA in title 29 suggests that the legislature did not consider LLCs to be \"other corporations\" for venue purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 23 Furthermore, the LLC structure is sufficiently different from that of corporations that an LLC does not naturally fall within the scope of \"other corporations\" in subsection (18). An Arizona LLC is a distinct business entity that is neither a partnership nor a corporation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Limited liability companies are statutorily-created entities, designed primarily to provide the personal liability protection found in a corporate structure, while allowing the LLC members the state and federal tax benefits generally provided in a partnership setting.\"\n   <em>\n    TM2008 Invs., Inc. v. Procon Capital Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324798\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/234/421/\">\n    234 Ariz. 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 424 \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324798\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/234/421/\">\n    323 P.3d 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 707 (App. 2014). Although corporations and LLCs have overlapping statutory powers, an LLC can waive any of these powers in its articles of organization. \u00a7 29-610(B). And LLCs have features shared by neither corporations nor partnerships: for instance, unlike both corporations and partnerships, LLC members do not owe each other fiduciary duties unless they are expressly included in the LLC operating agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    TM2008 Invs.\n   </em>\n   , 234 Ariz. at 424-25 \u00b6\u00b6 13-15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324798\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/234/421/\">\n    323 P.3d at 707-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, an LLC's organizational flexibility is one of its central characteristics: an LLC may be managed directly by its members, making it more like a partnership, or it may be managed by a manager or group of managers, making it more like a corporation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 29-632(A)(6), (B)-(C). Although some LLCs, because of their specific articles of organization, may more closely resemble a corporation, LLCs as a class are not sufficiently like corporations to be included in the \"corporation\" exception for venue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 24 The trial court erred when it applied the subsection (18) exception on the basis that LLCs, like corporations, are amenable to \"veil-piercing,\" that is, subjecting their members to personal liability via the alter-ego doctrine. Venue and the alter-ego doctrine reflect different policy considerations. Venue is based on convenience in choosing the site for litigation,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Sil-Flo Corp. v. Bowen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"610263\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/98/77/#p83\">\n    98 Ariz. 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 83,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"610263\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/98/77/#p83\">\n    402 P.2d 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1965), whereas the alter-ego doctrine attempts to prevent \"fraud,\" \"misuse,\" and \"injustice\" arising from misuse of the corporate form of organization,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NetJets Aviation, Inc. v. LHC Commc'ns, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4129333\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/537/168/#p176\">\n    537 F.3d 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 176-77 (2d Cir. 2008). Moreover, imparting such an expansive meaning to \"other corporations\" would substantially increase the reach of the exception. Absent legislative action, we \"will not enlarge or add to [this] express exception.\"\n   <em>\n    Wray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"651646\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/82/79/#p84\">\n    82 Ariz. at 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"651646\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/82/79/#p84\">\n    308 P.2d 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
