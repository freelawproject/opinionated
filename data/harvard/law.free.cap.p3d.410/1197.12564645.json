Arthur West made a PRA request to the City of Puyallup for records relating to a Facebook page associated with Julie Door, a Puyallup City Council member. The trial court ruled that Door's Facebook posts did not constitute public records and granted summary judgment in favor of the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 We confirm that a public official's posts on a personal Facebook page can constitute an agency's public records subject to disclosure under the PRA if the posts relate to the conduct of government and are prepared within a public official's scope of employment or official capacity. However, we hold that Door's particular Facebook posts at issue in this case were not public records as a matter of law because she did not prepare them within the scope of her official capacity as a City Council member.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's summary judgment order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 On March 25, 2016, West submitted a public records request to the City that asked for \"All City related public records sent to or received at Council Member Door's 'Friends of Julie Door' Facebook site, 2014-2016, or any such records in the possession of the City.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 215. Door was a member of the Puyallup City Council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 The City conducted a search of its official Facebook page for any records sent to the Friends of Julie Door Facebook page and located no such records. The City also searched its archiving system for all documents sent and received with the term \"Friends of Julie Door,\" and located one message to a City email address inviting the recipient to \"like\" the Friends of Julie Door Facebook page. The City produced a copy of that message to West. The City disclosed no other documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 West filed a PRA action against the City, alleging that the City violated the PRA by not disclosing posts on the Friends of Julie Door Facebook page. The City filed a summary judgment motion, arguing that the posts were not public records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 In support of its motion, the City submitted a declaration from Door. Door's declaration stated that the Facebook page did not contain any information related to the conduct of City government or the performance of any government function. She explained that the Facebook page was not used or intended to be used to conduct any governmental function and had not been used or referenced by the City at City meetings or cited in support of any agency action. She also stated that the page was publicly accessible, and that the account had received only one immaterial private message. Finally, Door stated that the Facebook page was a campaign site used for campaign purposes or to provide information to her supporters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Door's declaration did not state who had made the posts on the Friends of Julie Door Facebook page. However, Door never denied that she was the person who prepared the posts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 West filed a response to the motion, supported by his own declaration. He later filed a second declaration. His declarations included publically available posts from the Friends of Julie Door Facebook page, which West argued contained information related to City business and public comments on a decision before the City Council. These posts fell into three general categories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 First, several posts briefly referenced various issues, including completing a Sound Transit survey; the City's construction of new sidewalks; a project on a historic piece of farmland in the City; the Puyallup police chief's presentation regarding the police department's strategic plan; Door's participation in the Association of Washington Cities convention; Door's service on a scholarship committee; an open house regarding\n   the widening of Shaw Road in the City; the City's budget document; a link to another City Council member's Facebook page; registration for the National Night Out; the ribbon cutting for a new Pierce Transit connector; Sound Transit's options for parking improvement, a related survey, and an invitation to a City council meeting on the issue; Sound Transit's presentations at a City Council study session and a City Council meeting; Association of Washington Cities training; and a City Council meeting agenda.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 Second, several posts referenced and contained links to the City's official Facebook posts about various issues, including the City's water testing; regional growth; an open house regarding Sound Transit; a ribbon-cutting event for a new park; the City's public works department; car wash awareness month; City Council meeting agendas; volunteering for City boards and commissions; the city's Santa parade and tree lighting, the City's Concert in the Park program, a vacancy on the City's parks and recreation advisory board; meetings regarding housing focus groups; the City Council's decision to co-sponsor a parade for high school state champions; and a City Council study session and special meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    \u00b611 Third, a few posts referenced and contained links to the Puyallup Police Department's official Facebook posts about the city's homeless population, a jail camera lawsuit in federal court, and the block watch program.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    \u00b612 In addition, the Friends of Julie Door Facebook page contained comments from individuals regarding a few of the posts. Door did not respond to any of the comments. After West's PRA request, Door posted a message stating that she was prohibited from answering specific questions about the City's actions on Facebook and that questions should be directed to Door's work-related email address and telephone number.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    \u00b613 The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the City and dismissed West's PRA claims. The court ruled that Door's Facebook posts were not public records because they were not prepared, owned, used, or retained by the City and the City had no control over the Facebook page. The court also refused to adopt a rule that a Facebook post by an elected official that refers to a public agency is a public record.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    \u00b614 West appeals the trial court's order granting summary judgment in favor of the City.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    ANALYSIS\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    A.

PUBLIC RECORD ANALYSIS\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    \u00b624 Here, there is no dispute that the Friends of Julie Door Facebook posts were writings, and we assume without deciding that at least some of the posts related to the conduct of government or a government function. The primary question on appeal involves the third part of the RCW 42.56.010(3) definition: whether the City can be deemed to have \"prepared\" Door's Facebook posts. The answer depends on whether Door was acting within the scope of her employment or official capacity as a City Council member. We hold that Door was not acting within her official capacity when she prepared the Facebook posts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    1. Existence of a \"Writing\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    \u00b625 The first element of a public record under RCW 42.56.010(3) is the existence of a \"writing.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    RCW 42.56 .010(4) broadly defines \"writing\" to encompass \"every ... means of recording any form of communication.\" And RCW 42.56.010(3) states that definition of public record applies \"regardless of physical form or characteristics\" of the record.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    \u00b626 The City does not dispute that a message posted on Facebook constitutes a writing for purposes of the PRA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    2. Information Relating to Conduct of Government\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    \u00b627 The second element of a public record under RCW 42.56.010(3) is that the writing contain \"information relating to the conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function.\" \"This language casts a wide net.\"\n    <em>\n     Nissen\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6793756\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/183/863/#p879\">\n     183 Wash.2d at 880\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=357%20P.3d%2045\">\n     357 P.3d 45\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

On the other hand, almost all of the posts at least referred to government activities. Because the City does not expressly address this element in its briefing, we assume without deciding that at least some of the posts satisfy the second element of the public record definition.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    3. Records Prepared by a Government Agency\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    \u00b630 The third element of a public record under RCW 42.56.010(3) is that the writing be \"prepared, owned, used, or retained by any state or local agency.\" A \"local agency\" includes a city and \"any office, department, division, bureau, board, commission, or agency thereof.\" RCW 42.56.010(1).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    \u00b631 Here, West does not claim that the City owned, used, or retained the posts on the Friends of Julie Door Facebook page. Instead, he argues that the City, through its City Council member Door, must be deemed to have \"prepared\" the posts. We disagree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    a. Scope of Employment Requirement\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    \u00b632 The court in\n    <em>\n     Nissen\n    </em>\n    noted that because an agency must act through its employees and other agents, an act performed by an agency employee within the scope of his or her employment is tantamount to an act by the agency.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6793756\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/183/863/#p879\">\n     183 Wash.2d at 876\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=357%20P.3d%2045\">\n     357 P.3d 45\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Analysis\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    \u00b636 To determine whether Door was acting within the scope of her employment or official capacity as a City Council member when she prepared the Facebook posts, we must apply the three-part test outlined in\n    <em>\n     Nissen\n    </em>\n    : whether (1) her position required the posts, (2) the City directed the posts, or (3) the posts furthered the City's interests.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6793756\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/183/863/#p879\">\n     183 Wash.2d at 878\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=357%20P.3d%2045\">\n     357 P.3d 45\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    \u00b637 Door's position as a City Council member clearly did not require that she post on Facebook. And there is no evidence in the record that the City in any way directed that Door prepare the posts. The question here is whether Door's posts furthered the City's interests.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    \u00b638 The Supreme Court in\n    <em>\n     Nissen\n    </em>\n    did not provide much guidance regarding when an elected public official furthers an agency's interests. The court did state that a PRA claimant's allegation that the official prepared and received text messages in his \"official capacity\" was sufficient to meet the scope of employment requirement.\n    <em>\n     Nissen\n    </em>\n    , 183 Wsah.2d at 882-83,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=357%20P.3d%2045\">\n     357 P.3d 45\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The court also stated that using a private cell phone \"to conduct public business\" can create a public record.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 877,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=357%20P.3d%2045\">\n     357 P.3d 45\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . These comments indicate that an elected official who acts in an \"official capacity\" or \"conducts public business\" furthers the agency's interests.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    \u00b639 West urges us to adopt a bright line rule that a City Council member's Facebook post relating to a matter that will come before the City Council for a vote constitutes a public record. He argues that two specific posts fall within this category: a June 7, 2015 post and individual replies regarding the widening of Shaw Road (which West refers to as a pending land use decision), and two May 2016 posts and individual replies regarding a warehouse development adjoining Puyallup's eastern boundaries. West claims that these posts related to and solicited comments regarding land use issues pending before the City Council.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    \u00b640 However, there is no evidence in the record that the Shaw Road widening project involved a land use issue or that the project would require a decision by the City Council. The City characterizes this work as a routine public works project that would not require a land use determination.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    \u00b641 Regarding the warehouse development, the City presented unrefuted evidence that the project was outside the city limits and therefore would not involve City Council approval. In any event, the posts West references occurred after his PRA request in March 2016. Therefore, the City could not have provided those posts as responsive to\n    the request because they did not yet exist.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     West v. Dep't of Nat.

The Shaw Road post also would fall into this general category.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    \u00b643 However, there is no indication that Door was acting in her \"official capacity\" as a City Council member in preparing these posts. The Facebook page was not associated with the City and was not characterized as an official City Council member page. Instead, the Facebook page was associated with the \"Friends of Julie Door,\" which according to Door's declaration was used to provide information to her supporters.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    \u00b644 In addition, Door was not \"conducting public business\" on the Facebook page. The posts did not contain specific details of Door's work as a City Council member or regarding City Council discussions, decisions, or other actions. The posts merely provided general information about City activities and occasionally about Door's activities.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    \u00b645 Finally, in a broad sense Door's informational posts may have furthered the City's interests to some minimal extent by providing a certain segment of the public with information about City events and activities. However, this tangential benefit to the City is not sufficient to establish that Door was acting within the scope of employment or her official capacity in disseminating general information about the City.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    4. Summary\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    \u00b646 We hold that as a matter of law, the City cannot be deemed to have prepared the Facebook posts at issue here because Door did not prepare the posts within the scope of her employment or official capacity as a City Council member. In making the posts, Door was not acting in her official capacity, conducting public business, or otherwise furthering the City's interests.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    Therefore, we hold that the Facebook posts here were not public records under the PRA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    CONCLUSION\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    \u00b647 We affirm the trial court's order granting summary judgment in favor of the City and dismissing West's PRA action.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    We concur:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    JOHANSON, J.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    SUTTON, J.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-80\">\n     West argues that\n     <em>\n      Vermillion\n     </em>\n     is binding on this court under principles of collateral estoppel and res judicata, apparently because that case also involved the City of Puyallup, as well as under stare decisis.
