He argues-and the Court of Appeals agreed-that he was not required to register because his 1988 conviction of statutory rape in violation of a statute amended in 1979, was not a \"sex offense\" within the meaning of the current sex offender registration statute. We disagree. The prior sex offense of which Arnold was convicted meets the two critical prerequisites to a countable \"sex offense\" listed in former RCW 9.94A.030(46)(b) (2012): (1) that prior conviction was based on a statute that was \"in effect ... prior to July 1, 1976\" and (2) that prior conviction was based on a statute that is \"comparable\" to a current \"sex offense\" as defined in former RCW 9.94A.030(46)(a) (2012).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 The Court of Appeals, Division Three, reached a contrary conclusion in part because it felt bound by prior decisions of the two other divisions of the Court of Appeals.\n   <em>\n    In re Pers.

We reject this rule.

We therefore reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 This case involves statutory interpretation of the failure-to-register statute, RCW 9A.44.130. That statute\n   requires offenders who have been convicted of a \"sex offense\" to register as sex offenders at certain times, and it depends on RCW 9.94A.030 for the definition of a \"sex offense\" that triggers the registration requirement. RCW 9A.44.130(1)(a), .128(10)(a). That statute, former RCW 9.94A.030(46) (2012), includes within the definition of \"sex offense\" all felony violations of chapter 9A.44 RCW as well as several other categories. For example, it includes federal and out-of-state convictions that would be classified as sex offenses in this state. Notably, that statute also includes \"[a]ny conviction for a felony offense in effect at any time prior to July 1, 1976, that is comparable to a felony classified as a sex offense in (a) of this subsection.\" Former RCW 9.94A.44.030(46)(b) (2012).

This conviction is not listed in former RCW 9.94A.030(46)(a) (2012), which listed only crimes that were currently on the books. The question for us is whether it is included in former RCW 9.94A.030(46)(b) (2012). To fall within subsection (b)'s coverage, the conviction triggering the duty to register has to be based on a statute that (1) was \"in effect ... prior to 1976\"\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   (2) is \"comparable\" to a current offense listed in former RCW 9.94A.030(46)(a). As discussed below, Arnold's conviction meets both prerequisites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    A. Former RCW 9A.44.080 was in effect before July 1, 1976\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b615 The first prerequisite is that the crime of conviction-here, former RCW 9A.44.080 (1979)-must have been in effect \"prior to July 1, 1976.\" Former 9.94A.030(46)(b) (2012). The offense of which Arnold was convicted in 1988 was amended in 1979. It provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (1) A person over sixteen years of age is guilty of statutory rape in the second degree when such person engages in sexual intercourse with another person, not married to the perpetrator,\n   who is eleven years of age or older, but less than fourteen years old.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (2) Statutory rape in the second degree is a class B felony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Former 9A.44.080 (1979).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b616 A pre-July 1, 1976 statute, former RCW 9.79.210 (1975),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (1) A person over sixteen years of age is guilty of statutory rape in the second degree when such person engages in sexual intercourse with another person, not married to the perpetrator, who is eleven years of age or older but less than fourteen years old.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (2) Statutory rape in the second degree is a felony, and shall be punished by imprisonment in the state penitentiary for not more than ten years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   There is no debate that the elements of these statutes are the same.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The 1979 statute under which Arnold was convicted was thus in effect prior to July 1, 1976.

To determine whether the prior conviction statute and the current chapter 9A.44 RCW statute are comparable, we start with the elements of those crimes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite differences in language, the elements of Arnold's 1988 conviction are the same as, or encompass, one or more of the following chapter 9A.44 RCW felonies, depending on the age of the child: RCW 9A.44.073 (rape of a child in the first degree), RCW 9A.44.076 (rape of a child in the second degree),\n   RCW 9A.44.079 (rape of a child in the third degree), RCW 9A.44.083 (child molestation in the first degree), RCW 9A.44.086 (child molestation in the second degree), or RCW 9A.44.089 (child molestation in the third degree). In fact, there is no set of facts that would support a conviction under former RCW 9A.44.080 (1979) that would not also support a conviction of some felony under current chapter 9A.44 RCW.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b620 Indeed, Arnold does not argue to the contrary. He seems to concede that former RCW 9A.44.080 (1979) could also be charged as some felony listed in chapter 9A.44 RCW, depending on the age of the child. Instead, he argues that former RCW 9A.44.080 (1979) is not \"comparable\" under the analysis set forth in\n   <em>\n    Taylor.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    C.

It read former RCW 9.94A.030(46)(b) (2012)'s requirement that a prior conviction \"is comparable\" to a current chapter 9A.44 RCW felony as a requirement that the prior conviction be under a currently existing-\"is,\" not \"was\"-statute. For that reason, it ruled that former RCW 9.94A.030(46)(b)\"did not apply the duty to register to crimes not presently listed in chapter 9A.44 RCW,\" and called this lack of coverage a \"gap\" in the registration requirement.\n   <em>\n    Taylor,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4016397\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/162/791/#p799\">\n    162 Wash.App. at 798-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=259%20P.3d%20289\">\n    259 P.3d 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It agreed with Taylor that the sex offender registry statute did not apply to his conviction because former RCW 9A.44.090 (1979) was not a currently existing statute and was not scooped into the registration\n   requirement by the reference to pre-July 1, 1976 crimes because it was a post-1976 crime: \"[T]here is no provision, comparable to what was done for the pre-1976 convictions, for offenses listed in chapter 9A.44 RCW that existed after 1976 but were subsequently repealed.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4016397\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/162/791/#p799\">\n    162 Wash.App. at 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=259%20P.3d%20289\">\n    259 P.3d 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   courts seem to collapse the question of whether the defendant was convicted of violating a pre-July 1, 1976 statute with the question of whether the defendant was convicted of something comparable to a current chapter 9A.44 RCW felony. As to the first question, it is clear that the statutes under which Taylor, Wheeler, and Arnold were convicted all existed prior to 1976.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section I.A. Because the statutes existed prior to July 1, 1976, the backward-looking inquiry of former RCW 9.94A.030(46)(b) (2012) is fulfilled, and the court must proceed to the question of comparability,\n   <em>\n    see supra,\n   </em>\n   at Part I.B. As to that question, former RCW 9.94A.030(46)(b) (2012)'s use of the phrase \"is comparable\" cannot possibly bar the court from comparing the sex crime of conviction (which is identical to a pre-July 1, 1976 crime) with a current sex felony. We already know that we can\n   compare Arnold's violation of the 1979 statute to the current crime-the fact that the 1979 statute was identical to a pre-July 1, 1976 crime tells us that. The only remaining question is how that 1979 statute matches up against a current chapter 9A.44 RCW felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b624 For example,\n   <em>\n    State v.

When the Court of Appeals was created, the legislature defined it as a single court. But it also addressed the question of whether divisions of that single court could issue decisions that were in conflict. It assumed that such conflicts would arise. Rather than requiring the Court of Appeals to resolve those conflicts by one panel racing to a decision, or a second panel deferring to a prior decision, the Court of Appeals placed the duty to resolve those conflicts in the hands of this court, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   [C]ases involving substantive issues on which there is a direct conflict among prevailing decisions of panels of the court [of appeals] or between decisions of the supreme court ... shall be appealed directly to the supreme court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   RCW 2.06.030(e). Thus, under the statute creating the Court of Appeals, conflicts are resolved not by stare decisis within that court, but by review in our court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b630 Our court rules say the same thing.

They explicitly state this court has a duty to resolve\n   conflicts within the Court of Appeals. If one division were required to defer to the decisions of another division, there would be no need for such a rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b631 Washington court decisions follow this statute and those court rules. We recognize when there are conflicts in the Court of Appeals. We resolve them by granting review, not by telling the later panel to adhere to a decision of an earlier panel.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Weatherwax,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=188%20Wash.%202d%20139\">\n    188 Wash.2d 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 143,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=392%20P.3d%201054\">\n    392 P.3d 1054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) (\"This lack of statutory guidance has produced a conflict in the Court of Appeals.\");\n   <em>\n    State v\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Larson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12440941\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/184/843/#p847\">\n    184 Wash.2d 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 847,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20P.3d%20740\">\n    365 P.3d 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (\"We accepted review to resolve this conflict within the Court of Appeals between Division One and Division Two ....\");\n   <em>\n    State v\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Jones,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4017948\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/172/236/#p239\">\n    172 Wash.2d 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 239,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=257%20P.3d%20616\">\n    257 P.3d 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) (\"We affirm the decision of Division Two ... and disavow Division Three's holding.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b632 Although Division Three's decision relies largely on cases from this court, none of them discusses the relationship between the\n   divisions of the Court of Appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, they address the role of stare decisis in this court.

While intracircuit conflicts at the federal level are discouraged, intercircuit conflicts occur with some frequency\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, like our own court, the United States Supreme Court also considers these conflicts in its review of petitions for a writ of certiorari.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SUP. CT. R. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b637 To be sure, this approach can lead to conflicting decisions. For example, a single statewide agency can face conflicting obligations in different divisions. This court addressed a similar issue in\n   <em>\n    In re Personal Restraint of Smith,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"99019\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/139/199/\">\n    139 Wash.2d 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=986%20P.2d%20131\">\n    986 P.2d 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999). In\n   <em>\n    Smith,\n   </em>\n   we interpreted a statute addressing how to calculate a convicted prisoner's earned early release time. A single, prior Division Three opinion had addressed the same issue and ruled against the Department of Corrections (DOC). DOC followed that decision in that individual Division Three case-but declined to change its statewide policy. Our court criticized DOC for that decision, holding that DOC should have\n   followed that prior Division Three opinion partly because there were no other published Washington appellate court decisions that addressed those circumstances.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=986%20P.2d%20131\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 203 n.3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=986%20P.2d%20131\">\n    986 P.2d 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Statewide agencies and other entities cannot choose to ignore a published judicial decision. We recognize that the reality of conflicting decisions will create some confusion. However, our current system of rigorous debate at the intermediate appellate level creates the best structure for the development of Washington common law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b638 RCW 9A.44.130 includes convictions for violation of former RCW 9A.44.080\n   (1979) within its definition of \"sex offense.\" Arnold is therefore required to register as a sex offender under that statute.
