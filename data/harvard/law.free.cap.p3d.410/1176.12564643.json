Braa contends that the superior court erred by reasoning that such testing is not available in self-defense cases because a favorable test result would not identify a different person as the perpetrator of the crime.

Simeon Whitney was there playing pool with his brother, Roger Enick, and a\n   friend, Kenny Celestine. Whitney, Enick, and Celestine are Native American and went to Kuhnle's Tavern because it is a hangout for Native Americans.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Enick and another bar patron argued over a game of pool, and the other patron used racial slurs about Native Americans. At some point, Braa went over to the pool table and made offensive comments toward Enick. Whitney pushed Braa out of the way and told him, \"Leave my homeboy alone.\" Braa told Whitney, \"Go back to Mexico where you belong. You're a sub-human.\" When the bartender heard this, she told Braa that he would be asked to leave if he continued to talk that way. Braa did not comply, so she escorted him to the back door. A minute or two later, Whitney went out through the same door.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   A fight ensued between Whitney and Braa outside behind Kuhnle's Tavern. Witnesses saw Whitney repeatedly punch Braa and pull Braa's shirt up over his head. After the fight, Whitney started toward the back door of Kuhnle's, and Braa went over to his truck. Braa fired four to six shots at or toward the back door. Some witnesses saw Braa standing by his truck with the door open and his arm extended as he fired. Whitney staggered through the back door and collapsed by the bathrooms. When the bartender heard the gunshots and saw Whitney on the floor, she ducked down and called 911. Two witnesses saw Braa drive away in a white Chevy S-10 pickup.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   A police officer who happened to be a few blocks away heard the gunshots and responded to the scene. Whitney had a pulse but was bleeding from the abdominal area and was nonresponsive. He was airlifted to Harborview and died en route. Later, an autopsy determined Whitney had suffered four gunshot wounds. The wounds showed that the bullets traveled from back to front through Whitney's body. One bullet and fragments from another were recovered from his abdomen. Another bullet exited through the front of his abdomen. The cause of Whitney's death was shock, trauma, and loss of blood due to the gunshot wounds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Officers found bullet jacket fragments near where Whitney had lain. There were shell casings in the parking lot, as well as the book the defendant had been reading at the bar. Detectives recovered three bullets and bullet shrapnel from the back door area and the carpet just inside the back door. There were two indentations in the metal of the back door, which were consistent with bullet strikes. Detectives also located a bullet hole in an interior wall just inside the back door. Forensic analysis\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   later confirmed that the bullet taken from Whitney's abdominal wall and the bullet found by the back door were fired from the same gun. The four shell casings found in the parking lot were compared and it was forensically determined that all had been fired from one gun.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Braa lived in a two-bedroom trailer that he shared with a roommate, Lenny Graff. Braa returned home around 10:30 on the night of the crime and asked Graff to get some beer, which Graff did. Graff recalled that Braa looked like he had been in a fight, with black eyes and a bloody nose. When Graff returned with the beer, Braa had changed his clothes and no longer looked dirty or bloody. Graff asked what had happened, and Braa told him that he had \"killed a subhuman.\" When Graff asked what a subhuman was, Braa responded, \"It means if you're not white, you're not right.\" He told Graff he had been jumped by some Mexicans who wanted to steal his wallet. He refused to discuss further the topic of killing someone and asked Graff to lie and say he had been home all night.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   That night, Braa parked his car several feet further from the roadway than he usually did, and he did not move it for the next three days. On November 14, 2006, officers arrived at Braa's trailer to execute a search warrant and arrest him. They could see Braa inside, through the kitchen window. They announced their presence over the patrol car PA systems. They also used a \"hailer,\" a box equipped with a loudspeaker, a handle for throwing, and hundreds of feet of cable, to communicate with Braa. Several times, an officer announced, \"Kevin Braa, this is the Sheriff's\n   Office. We have a warrant for your arrest. Identify yourself and surrender,\" but Braa did not come out. Officers shone lights into the home, and a helicopter was also used to illuminate the area. After Braa failed to respond to repeated voice commands, officers deployed two pepper spray projectile canisters through a window of the trailer. Braa came outside a few seconds later, complied with officers' verbal instructions, and was taken into custody.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Four and a half months later, while doing yard work, Graff discovered a plastic garbage bag under the deck of the trailer. Inside, he discovered Braa's 9mm semiautomatic Ruger handgun. He called 911, and police picked up the gun. Forensic analysis confirmed that the bullet extracted from Whitney's\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   abdominal wall had been fired from that weapon and that one of the four spent shell casings found in the parking lot had also been fired from that weapon. The other bullets and casings were not analyzed because it had already been determined that they had been fired from the same weapon as the tested bullet and casing. An expert in trajectory analysis testified that at least one bullet had been shot from a height of about four and a half feet, within 10 feet of where bullet fragments were imbedded in the wall inside the tavern. The evidence was consistent with the trajectory from a gun held by a person of average height while standing up.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   At trial, Braa conceded that he shot the gun and argued that it had been in self-defense. He testified that he had a verbal exchange with some guys he thought were Mexican and that he had called them \"Mexicans\" and \"sub-humans\" and \"invited them to go back to their own country.\" He recalled that the bartender had asked him to be quiet and go sit down, and he testified that he did so. Shortly afterward, he left the bar through the back door and as he was leaving was hit over the head and lost consciousness. When he came to, he was being beaten by an unknown assailant. He did not fight back but tried to protect himself by curling up. He tried to get away but was beaten more and shoved to the ground. He thought he was going to be beaten until he was killed. After being slammed into a vehicle, he got his gun out and fired immediately. He testified that he was slumped, lying on the ground when he fired.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Braa was charged with second degree murder and, in the alternative, first degree manslaughter. The jury found Braa guilty of the alternate charge of first degree manslaughter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Braa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%201591369\">\n    2009 WL 1591369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b65 Nine years after his conviction, Braa filed a motion in the superior court seeking DNA testing of a drop of blood taken from the parking lot of the tavern on the night that Whitney was shot. Braa argued that the DNA test would reveal new information suggesting that Whitney had bled in the parking lot, thereby supporting Braa's trial defense that he had shot Whitney in self-defense while Whitney was standing in close proximity over him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b66 The superior court denied the motion on two separate grounds. The superior court first concluded that Braa failed to satisfy the DNA testing statute's requirement that the petitioner show that DNA testing is material to the identity of the perpetrator of the crime. This was so, the superior court concluded, because \"the identity of the shooter (the defendant) is undisputed.\" The superior court also concluded that Braa's motion failed to establish that \"favorable DNA evidence, when considered along with all of the other evidence, would not demonstrate his innocence on a more probable than not basis.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b67 Braa contends that the superior court erred by denying his postconviction motion to conduct a DNA test of the blood drop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b68 We review the superior court's decision on such a motion for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Logically, a person who does not commit a crime is not a perpetrator.

Instead, his defense was that\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   crime was committed because he acted in lawful self-defense. In this way, he attempted to show that he was not a perpetrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b616 A person who kills in lawful self-defense is not a perpetrator because justifiable homicide is not a crime.

The State argues that postconviction DNA testing is not available in self-defense claims, even if the test result might establish the innocence of the petitioner.

The statutory scheme places the burden of demonstrating the entitlement to a DNA test on the petitioner. RCW 10.73.170(2), (3). As an initial matter, Braa presents no argument or authority in support of his interpretation of RCW 10.73.170. Furthermore, neither our Supreme Court nor this court has held that a petitioner is entitled to additional inferences in his favor beyond the assumption of a favorable DNA test result.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

Nothing in the statutory scheme authorizes an inference in Braa's favor to be drawn from the inference of a favorable test result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b630 Braa wants it to be that the existence of a drop of Whitney's blood in the parking lot necessarily means that he suffered a gunshot at that spot. However, even if the drop of blood was Whitney's, this does not necessarily follow. That a drop of Whitney's blood came from a gunshot wound he incurred while standing near Braa is not the only possible conclusion available. Indeed, there are three possibilities as to how a drop of Whitney's blood might have been deposited in the parking lot: from the fistfight between Whitney and Braa, from Whitney's gunshot wound, or from a third party unintentionally tracking Whitney's blood from one location-e.g., near the rear door of the tavern-into the parking lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b631 At trial, Braa testified that, after he had been \"lifted up and slammed\" into a vehicle and was lying on the ground in fear for his life, he drew his gun, aimed upwards, and fired in the direction of the person standing in close proximity over him. This person was Whitney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b632 But even assuming that the drop of blood found in the parking lot was Whitney's, the evidence introduced at trial strongly contradicts Braa's self-defense theory. The evidence established that Whitney had been shot in the back at least three times. It further established that the bartender heard\n   a burst of gunshots contemporaneously with Whitney crashing through the rear door of the tavern, 30 feet away from where Braa was seen to have fired the gunshots. In addition, the evidence established that there was a great deal of blood in the area of the rear door of the tavern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b633 Moreover, three witnesses testified that they saw Braa firing a burst of gunshots in the direction of the rear door of the tavern while he was alone in the parking lot. One of the three eyewitnesses also testified that he saw Braa alone in the parking lot both\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the shots were fired. Two of the eyewitnesses also testified that they saw Braa fire his gun while standing up, rather than while lying on the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b634 Bullet trajectory analysis testified to at trial further supported that the gunshots were fired from a standing position. Additional analysis of the indentations in the walls of the tavern and bullet fragments found in and near the rear door of the tavern established that multiple gunshots had been fired in that direction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b635 In addition, other testimony showed that Braa hid the gun in question under his porch. This supported the State's theory that Braa had a guilty conscience arising from his slaying of Whitney. Such a guilty conscience is incompatible with Braa believing that he had acted in lawful self-defense by shooting Whitney. Braa also admitted that, before he went to the tavern's parking lot, he had been angry because a \"subhuman\" had pushed him and wounded his pride.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b636 On a more probable than not basis, a favorable DNA test result (that a drop of Whitney's blood was located in the parking lot) when considered alongside the evidence adduced at trial would not demonstrate that Braa is likely innocent. Accordingly, the superior court did not abuse its discretion by denying his request for DNA testing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b637 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Schindler, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Becker, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    RCW 9A.16.050 reads:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n    <strong>\n     Homicide-By other person-When justifiable.\n    </strong>\n    Homicide is also justifiable when committed either:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n    (1) In the lawful defense of the slayer, or his or her husband, wife, parent, child, brother, or sister, or of any other person in his or her presence or company, when there is reasonable ground to apprehend a design on the part of the person slain to commit a felony or to do some great personal injury to the slayer or to any such person, and there is imminent danger of such design being accomplished; or\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n    (2) In the actual resistance of an attempt to commit a felony upon the slayer, in his or her presence, or upon or in a dwelling, or other place of abode, in which he or she is.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    If the DNA belonged to Braa, it would not be favorable to him because it would prove nothing about Whitney's location when he was shot.
