J.</author>\n<p id=\"b1223-6\">Statement of Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-7\">On July 30, 1985, a complaint was filed in the Municipal Court for the Rio Hondo Judicial District charging respondent with being under the influence of an opiate in violation of Health and Safety Code section 11550, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-8\">On August 1, 1985, counsel for respondent, who was in custody, moved to dismiss the misdemeanor complaint under the provisions of Penal Code section 991 on the ground that there was no probable cause to believe that respondent had committed the charged offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1223-9\">During the hearing on the foregoing motion, the court considered the arrest report attached to the complaint, without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-10\">The report stated that on July 28, 1985, the arresting officers \u201c . . . saw two males walking on the sidewalk on the northside of the street in front of the \u2018Welcome Motel.\u2019 One of the males . . . [was] carrying a small brown bag partially folded down with a silver/blue can showing, distinctive of an alcoholic beverage.  Believing there was a beer in the bag, <em>we decided to contact the males </em>to wam/cite the male for . . . drinking an alcoholic beverage in public.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Upon contacting the man who held the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 14\">*Supp. 14</page-number>bag, (one James Grayson), and finding the beer can unopened, the officers had no further contact with him. However, one of the officers then noticed that respondent Ward\u2019s eyelids were droopy, and his movements slow. The officer observed Ward\u2019s pupils, and found them to be constricted, and by reason of his experience in arresting and/or observing persons under the influence of opiates, decided that Ward was under the influence of an opiate, and arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">Counsel for respondent, at the conclusion of the hearing, asked that the magistrate rule on the legality of the detention. In response thereto, the prosecutor asked whether the magistrate wished to calendar a motion under the provisions of Penal Code section 1538.5. To this, the magistrate replied: \u201cIt is a 991 motion here today, whether there is probable cause for arrest or whether it should be dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">On the following day, August 2, 1985, the prosecutor specifically objected to the magistrate\u2019s determining the validity of the detention on the motion under the provisions of Penal Code section 991. However, the court granted the foregoing motion on the ground that there was not \u201c . . . any probable cause for the stop in the first place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-6\">The People filed a timely appeal of and from the foregoing order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-8\">The People contend on appeal, as they did in the trial court, that the sole manner in which to challenge the legality of the detention and search in the case at bench is by a motion to suppress evidence under the provisions of Penal Code section 1538.5, and that respondent\u2019s filing of a motion for a determination of probable cause under the provisions of Penal Code section 991 was an attempt to bring a premature, unnoticed motion under Penal Code section 1538.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-9\">In this case of first impression, we hold that pursuant to a motion made under the provisions of Penal Code section 991, a trial court may properly consider the lawfulness of a detention or arrest in determining whether there is probable cause to believe that a defendant in custody has committed a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-10\">In <em>Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh </em>(1975) 420 U.S. 103 [43 L.Ed.2d 54, 95 S.Ct. 854], the Supreme Court held that a defendant has a Fourth Amendment right to a judicial determination by a neutral magistrate as to whether there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 15\">*Supp. 15</page-number>probable cause to believe that the defendant committed the crime with which he has been charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">In the light of the decision in <em>Gerstein, </em>the California Supreme Court unanimously held in <em>In re Walters </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 738 [126 Cal.Rptr. 239, 543 P.2d 607], that California procedures governing pretrial detention of those charged with misdemeanors, and arrested with or without a warrant, \u201c . . . do not presently comport with our implementation of the constitutional requirements of <em>Gerstein, </em>since the defendant is not afforded a post-arrest judicial determination that probable cause exists for his continued detention.\u201d (At p. 747.) The California Supreme Court held, in <em>Walters, </em>that <em>Gerstein </em>\u201cprobable cause\u201d hearings must be made available to defendants charged with the commission of a misdemeanor as well as to those charged with the commission of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">Our Supreme Court pointed out that the requirements of <em>Gerstein </em>with respect to felony cases was satisfied by virtue of the provisions of Penal Code section 995. (See <em>In re Walters, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d, at p. 752, fn. 8.) However, the court proceeded to hold, specifically, that a judicial determination of probable cause is required in every case in which a defendant charged with a misdemeanor is not released from custody prior to or at the time of arraignment, in the absence of a waiver of such determination. The court explained that since the posting of bail may impose an unwarranted burden on an accused, if probable cause to detain is lacking, he is entitled to have a determination made prior to electing whether to post bail, and that if the judicial officer finds that probable cause has not been established, the accused must be discharged from custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-7\">It is obvious that Penal Code section 991 is a legislative response to the requirements of <em>Walters. </em>In accordance with those requirements, section 991 provides that if a defendant charged with a misdemeanor is in custody at the time of arraignment, and has pleaded not guilty, \u201c . . . the magistrate, on motion of counsel for the defendant or the defendant, shall determine whether there is probable cause to believe that a public offense has been committed and that the defendant is guilty thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-8\">In <em>Walters, </em>the Supreme Court made it clear that the lawfulness of an arrest is to be considered at such a postarrest <em>Gerstein </em>hearing <em>(Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, supra, </em>420 U.S. 103). The Supreme Court held that the magistrate in that case had made a proper probable cause determination at arraignment, in that police reports relied on by the trial judge recited facts personally observed by the arresting officer, which formed the basis of the officer\u2019s conclusion that an offense had been committed by the defendant in his presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 16\">*Supp. 16</page-number>Similarly, Penal Code section 991, subdivision (c) provides that \u201c[i]n determining the existence of probable cause, the magistrate shall consider any warrant of arrest with supporting affidavits, and the sworn complaint together with any documents or reports incorporated by reference thereto, which, if based on information and belief, state the basis of such information, or any other documents of similar reliability.\u201d It is, accordingly, our determination that in so providing, the Legislature, following the specifications of <em>Walters, </em>has allowed a magistrate to determine the lawfulness of the custodial detention of a misdemeanant based upon the reading and consideration of an arrest report attached to the complaint, under the circumstances at bench.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">The People contend that Penal Code section 1538.5, subdivision (m) was amended in 1982 to include the reference to section 871.5 of the Penal Code as an additional means to test the legality of a search or seizure (Stats. 1982, ch. 1505, \u00a7 6.), and that if the Legislature had intended that Penal section 991 also provide a remedy to test the legality of a search or seizure, it would have amended section 1538.5, subdivision (m) to include a reference to section 991.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The People\u2019s contention, however, is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-5\">It is settled law that courts have a duty to construe Penal Code sections in harmony with one another, so as to give effect to each. <em>(Morse </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1974) 13 Cal.3d 149, 159 [118 Cal.Rptr. 14, 529 P.2d 46]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tideman </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 574, 583 [21 Cal.Rptr. 207, 370 P.2d 1007].) In this connection, we note that Penal Code sections 991 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 17\">*Supp. 17</page-number>1538.5 are not mutually exclusive, in that they serve different purposes.  The purpose of Penal Code section 991 is <em>not </em>to suppress evidence, but to provide a prompt means of protecting an accused\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights, by allowing a neutral magistrate to look at specified documents to determine whether probable cause to hold a misdemeanant in custody exists. As is explained in <em>In re Walters, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 738, without the protection now provided by Penal Code section 991, we would be leaving to the prosecution alone, the determination of probable cause to detain in custody. Penal Code section 991 is obviously meant to be a safeguard against the hardship suffered by a misdemeanant who is detained in custody, by providing that a probable cause hearing will be held immediately, at the time of arraignment, unless the court grants a continuance for good cause of not to exceed three court days. Contrariwise, a motion under the provisions of Penal Code section 1538.5 may be brought even as late as trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-5\">Moreover, successful motions under the two sections reach qualitatively different results. A successful motion to suppress evidence under Penal Code Section 1538.5 will remove specific evidence from the court\u2019s consideration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On the other hand, a successful probable cause challenge under the provisions of Penal Code section 991 results in the defendant\u2019s being discharged, subject, however, to the right of the prosecution to refile the complaint within 15 days of the dismissal. Such refiling is specifically provided for in Penal Code section 991, subdivision (e). (See fn. 1, <em>ante, </em>p. Supp. 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-6\">We hold that in the case at bench, the trial court properly dismissed the complaint and discharged respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-7\">The order of dismissal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-8\">Bernstein, J., and Soven, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1223-11\">Penal Code section 991 provides: \u201c(a) If the defendant is in custody at the time he appears before the magistrate for arraignment and, if the public offense is a misdemeanor to which the defendant has pleaded not guilty, the magistrate, on motion of counsel for the defendant or the defendant, shall determine whether there is probable cause to believe that a public offense has been committed and that the defendant is guilty thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-12\">\u201c(b) The determination of probable cause shall be made immediately unless the court grants a continuance for good cause not to exceed three court days.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-13\">\u201c(c) In determining the existence of probable cause, the magistrate shall consider any warrant of arrest with supporting affidavits, and the sworn complaint together with any documents or reports incorporated by reference thereto, which, if based on information and belief, state the basis for such information, or any other documents of similar reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-14\">\u201c(d) If, after examining these documents, the court determines that there exists probable cause to believe that the defendant has committed the offense charged in the complaint, it shall set the matter for trial [II] If the court determines that no such probable cause exists, it shall dismiss the complaint and discharge the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-15\">\u201c(e) Within 15 days of the dismissal of a complaint pursuant to this section the prosecution may refile the complaint. [1J] A second dismissal pursuant to this section is a bar to any other prosecution for the same offense.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1223-16\">Under the foregoing facts and circumstances, the officers\u2019 \u201ccontact\u201d of the two males was a detention.
