Middleton against William and Rosena Middleton, heirs at law of John Middleton, deo\u2019d, and two conveyances to him from said William B. Middleton, one dated March 3rd, 1857 and the other May 15th, 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-4\">The record shows that about the year 1857, 640 acres of the John Middleton headright certificate for 1280 acres of land was filed upon lands in Leon Co., but same was never patented by virtue thereof because the land proved to be appropriated public domain and covered by a valid and elder grant. At the spring term 1859 of the District Court of Leon Co., William B. Middleton obtained a judgment against William and Rosena Middleton the only heirs at law of said John Middleton, dec\u2019d, for the recovery of this same 640 acres of land, and authorizing him to have a certified copy of said decree as his muniment of title to said land. The deed of March 3rd, 1857, purports to convey the same 640 acres to appellee. The deed of May 15th, 1870, purports to convey the same land, and also that part of the John Middleton Headright certificate, that was located thereon, and to be supplemental to and confirmatory of the deed of March 3rd, 1857.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-5\">The record further shows that on December 22nd, 1874, William Middleton made affidavit that he was the only legal heir of John Middleton, dec\u2019d, and was the owner of 640 acres of his father John Middleton\u2019s Headright certificate for 1280 acres, and that he had never sold or conveyed same to any one, nor authorized any one to do so. On the same day Mathew and Susan Yarborough made affidavit that they were personally acquainted with William Middleton, the only child of John Middleton, dec\u2019d, and that said William was the only heir at law of said dec\u2019d. These affidavits were filed in the General Land Office, and on December 28 th, 1874, a certificate was issued by the Commissioner, pursuant to said affidavit of ownership for 640 acres, unlocated balance of said 1280 Headright certificate. This certificate for unlocated balance was located by S. G. McLendon, under a contract for one half of the land on the lands in dispute in Donley county; and on the 7th day of May, 1877, a patent issued to the heirs of John Middleton, dec\u2019d. On June 11th, 1877, William Middleton, conveyed 320 acres of this tract to S. G. McLendon, as the latter\u2019s locative interest, who, on same day, conveyed same 320 acres to appellant Park.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"A9dk\">Delany, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>The judgment upon which appellee relies,vested in his vendor W. B. Middeton, title to a tract of land in Leon County, describing it by metes and bounds. It makes no mention of the certificate by virtue of which the land was located. It could have been no more effctual to vest such title than would have been a conveyance of the same land to W. B. Middleton by the grantee of the certificate. The most that can be said is that the judgment passed to W. B. Middleton the right to procure a patent to the land, or if that could not be done on account of the conflict, then it gave him the right to raise the certificate and locate it elsewhere. But he did not do this. He did not file in the Land Office a copy of the judgment or notice that he had any interest in the certificate. The record of his judgment in Leon County was for this purpose wholly ineffectual.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Love vs. Berry 22 Tex., 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Bagget vs. McKenzie, 28 Tex., 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">In 1874 a certificate for this unlocated balance was issued to the heirs of the grantee, and in 1877 a patent issued to these heirs, for the land upon which the certificate had been located.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The legal title thus vested in the heirs. Nothing but an equity remained in appellee as the vendee of W. B. Middleton. William Middleton was the sole heir of the grantee of the certificate. The patent vested in him the legal title. That title passed to appellants as innocent purchasers for value and without notice of appellees\u2019 equities.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Love vs. Berry, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">For it is admitted that they had no actual notice, and there is nothing in the record to effect them with constructive notice. Their equities are equal to his, and they have the legal title.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">See Baggett vs. McKenzie 28 Tex., 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">We conclude that there is error in the judgment for which it should be reversed, and that such judgment shall be rendered by this Court as should have been rendered by the Court below \u2014 that is judgment for defendants \u2014 and we so award.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
