If, therefore, he permits one of the parties to withdraw his announcement of readiness for trial and to file additional pleadings, this court will hesitate to revise his action unless there is a manifest abuse of his discretion. (Whitehead v. Foley, 28 T. 1.) And in this case if the defendant\u2019s exceptions were well taken we should say that the judgment ought to be affirmed, notwithstanding the seeming irregularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The exceptions, taken as a whole, amount to a general demurrer, and jjorhaps something mo e. Their collective meaning is that the original and amended petitions do not set forth a good cause of action. This fact may be brought to the knowledge of the court at any stage of the trial; even after verdict it may be done by motion in arrest of judgment., but we do not think that the exceptions are well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">The first objects to that part of the pleadings which alleges slander as a cause of action. This is a sort of general demurrer to a part of the plaintiff\u2019s case, and it should have been overruled, for if he can establish his allegations under this head, we see no reason why he may not recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">The second exception is taken to that part of the case which set up as a cause of action, the malicious prosecution \u201cbecause the same as plead does not allege the want of probable cause.\u201d In this the defendant is mistaken; the want of probable cause is fully set forth by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">The third exception objects to that part of plaintiff\u2019s pleadings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>which relies upon duress, because the plaintiff does not allege that violence was offered to his person or that there was any threat of illegal imprisonment. \u201cIf,\u201d says Blackstone, \u201ca man through fear of death, or mayhem is prevailed upon to execute a bond or do any other legal act, these <em>* </em>* * may afterwards be avoided if forced upon him by a well grounded apprehension of losing his life or even his limbs, in case of his noncompliance;\" and after stating that this fear must be upon sufficient reason he quotes a passage from Bracton, which I will venture to translate, as follows: \u201cIt must not be the apprehension of some light and timid person; but such a fear as might alarm a resolute and determined man, for this fear must comprehend within itself peril of life or the danger of bodily torture.\" (1 Com. 130.) Thus stood the law of England for many centuries, but in process of time the courts have done much to mitigate its harshness.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Their decisions, however, made as occasion required, have hardly proceeded upon any definite rule except that of revolt against a barbarism of the law, it is therefore difficult to harmonize them upon any consistent principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">In the case o\u00ed duress of goods, some of the courts have resorted to the expedient of holding that when a man\u2019s property is wrongfully detained, and he pays money simply to obtain possession, and not by way of adjusting the matter, he may recover it back.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">In England this is put upon the ground that the money was not paid voluntarily, but under compulsion, and not on the ground that it was paid under duress, as technically understood. In such cases the question is whether the payment was voluntary or involuntary. (Metcalf on Con., pp. 25, 26.) Parsons, however, in his book on contracts, makes no distinction between compulsion and duress. He says, \u201ca contract made by a party under compulsion is void. It is not, however, all compulsion which has this effect, it must amount to duress, * * * imprisonment is duress, * * * but to have this effect, it must either be unlawful in itself, or if lawful, it' must- be accompanied with such circumstances of unnecessary pain, privation or danger, that the party is induced by them to make the contract.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">To understand what is here said about a lawful imprisonment being accompanied by circumstances of pain, privation, etc., it must be remembered that in England and in most of the American States, until a comparatively recent period, imprisonment for debt was lawful. In action of debt, dasumpsit, etc., upon claims for money, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>defendant, instead of being cited to appear and answer, as is the case in this, was often arrested and might bo lodged in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">In this state of the law, if a party, thus under arrest in an action of debt, entered into any adjustment of the matter with his adversary, he could not afterwards avoid it under the plea of duress, for his imprisonment was lawful. In such cases the creditor paid the costs of the imprisonment, and could control the action of the officer, very much as the plaintiff in execution can now control the action of the sheriff in the levy and sale of property. And he was often tempted by collusion with sheriffs, jailors and other officers to add to the harshness of the prisoner\u2019s confinement in order to hasten a settlement of the debt. These are the circumstances of unnecessary pain, privation, etc., which are generally alluded to in the books and unless we attend to this fact, we may be misled by such general expressions ar; those quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">We have in this State nothing like imprisonment for debt, or arrest upon civil process. To threaten with such imprisonment a citizen who had been long in the State and was familiar with its laws upon the subject, might be entirely harmless, because it would not probably alarm him; but to induce a foreigner who had just come into the country, to believe that such an arrest might be made and to threaten him with it in order to extort money from him, might be a very different thing. And to threaten to accuse a citizen of a felony in order to extort money from him is a grave offense against the criminal law. Penal Code, Art. 648; Paschal, Art. 2307.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">In this case the parties were not dealing at arms\u2019 length.\" The plaintiff is represented as occupying an humble and subordinate position; as having been long in the employ of the defendant and accustomed to look up to him as much his superior. He was almost entirely ignorant of the language of the country; knew nothing of its laws, and was morbidly timid about courts and judicial proceedings. The defendant appears to have been a well informed and determined man; powerful in the neighborhood where they both lived; unscrupulous in forming his plans, and ready and able to carry them out by any means, however questionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">The defendant knowing that the plaintiff has money and being himself largely indebted to him, knowing also his weakness and how easily he may be terrified by the threat of a criminal prosecution, deliberately determines to fabricate a story of his guilt, and by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>playing upon his fears, to extort from him his money and those evidences of debt. He arranges his plans skilfully, employing two eminent lawyers and assuring them of the pilaintiff's guilt, they all three come upon him when he is entirely alone; they charge him with having embezzled a large amount of his employer\u2019s money; they assure him that the proof of, his guilt is clear; that two witnesses who have been upon his track are ready to swear to it in open court; that he must settle in half an hour or he is a doomed man. In'vain he protests his innocence and pleads for time to consult counsel, the answer is prompt and decisive: settle at once or take the consequences. As soon as his fears are sufficiently wrought upon, he is told that this settlement shall not be final, but, that when he surrenders the money, notes, etc., he shall receive an instrument of writing to the effect that as soon as his innocence is established everything shall be restored, and so he yields to the demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Now the defendant, by his exceptions, admits that this whole story of guilt was a fabrication; that the plaintiff owed him nothing, yet he insists that no recovery can be had, because when the plaintiff gave up the money, etc., ho was not under duress; there was no threat of illegal imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The plaintiff, however, put the case upon the ground of gross fraud, imposition, undue advantage and oppression, which would be fully sufficient to set aside the supposed settlement. (1 Story\u2019s Ex. 523.) In such cases the question becomes one of consent, and it is whether the party made the agreement freely and advisedly, or was his consent obtained by the means just mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">In what has been said we have had reference to the case and the parties solely as they are presented in the pleadings and not as they may appear on the trial. As thei judgment must be reversed we may remark that on the former appeal, the eminent judge who delivered the opinion appears to have adopted from the books and to have applied to this case expressions which are properly applicable to a different class of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The language is as follows: \u201cThere can be no pretense that the alleged threats import a purpose to make, any unusual, harsh oppression, or illegal use of the process either civil or criminal with which it is insisted appellant was threatened.\u201d These expressions, as has already been shown, have their appropriate application to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>oases of imprisonment for debt, and others of a like character, if such.theie be; though fhey have boon sometimes (and as I think inadvertently) applied to eases of a different character. Upon this branch of the case the court appears to have followed the case of Harmon v. Hannon, 61 Maine 227. In that ease, however, the parties were on equal terms; they dealt at arm\u2019s length; one knew just as much about the gravity of the threat as the other; besides, the plaintiff admitted that he did not make the settlement from any fear of the threats against himself, though this was ground of his action, but stated that he had made it for another reason, which the court said might have been a good one, only that he had not set it up in his pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">Those are the only points which we think need be considered in the ease. Our opinion is that the judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Adopted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
