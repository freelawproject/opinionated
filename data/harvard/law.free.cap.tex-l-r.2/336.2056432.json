And also that all the requirements of rules 86 and 94 (47 Tex. 632 and 623) as to the manner in which a transcript shall be written, fastened together, sealed and endorsed must also be strictly followed in reference to certificates for affirmance. The reason which led to the adoption of these rules apply as forcibly to certificates of this character, as to transcripts; and this court has invariably enforced them, and dismissed certificates for want of a strict compliance with all their requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">As the opinion given in such cases were oral they may not have been made known to the profession generally, and hence the number of certificates which have come up to the present term lacking in some one or other of the essentials prescribed by the above rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">As our ruling in those matters is now put in writing there can be no excuse in the future for a recurrence of such errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The motion in the present case is gran ted and the judgment affirmed without reference to the merits.</p>\n<judges id=\"b337-8\">WILLIE, C.
