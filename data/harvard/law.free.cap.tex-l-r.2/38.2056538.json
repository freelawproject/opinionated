The contract as alleged in appellee\u2019s petition, was a parol contract. Appellees made out a claim of the indebtedness, certified and sworn to, which is attached to the petition. Appellant excepted to the sufficiency of the service of the claim, or account and return, general denial and special defense, denying any contract, verbal or otherwise, express or implied, or to pay any moneys whatever to appellee for the work and labor ^performed; also plea of offset and reconvention, and the further special plea that she, appellant, was a widow and head of a family, and that the property was her homestead, and that she never entered into any written agreement whereby a mechanic\u2019s lien was intended or created, and that the district court had no jurisdiction of the case, and also a sworn plea to the jurisdiction of the court, general and special exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-7\">The court overruled the appellant\u2019s pleas to the jurisdiction, general and special exceptions, and a jury was empanneled, and the cause went to trial at the June ter.m, 1879. There was a verdict for appellee for $54.00, and a lien upon the described property, with the judgment of the court for the money, and a foreclosure of a lien upon the dwelling house of appellant, with fifty acres of land described in the decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-8\">A motion was made for a new trial, which was overruled. Appellant appeals to this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-9\">The assignments of error are as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-10\">1st.

Error in the charge, and permitting the jury to find a verdict upon a <em>quantum </em>meruit, the suit being upon a contract.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"A2\">Delaney, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">Notwithstanding the vagueness of the assignments of error, two of them \u2014 the first and fourth \u2014 ought to be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">The first is, that the court erred in overruling the defendant\u2019s demurrer and pleas to the jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-11\">The demurrer was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-12\">The petition sets forth a. good cause of action, and is sufficient upon general demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-13\">One of the pleas, which in the record is called a plea to the jurisdiction, states that the amount claimed by the plaintiff is below che jurisdiction of the court, and is within the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace, and that the claim of a mechanic\u2019s lien is fraudulently set up in order to fix the court\u2019s jurisdiction, when, in truth, the property improved was the homestead of the defendant; but it is not alleged in this plea that the defendant was the head of a family. The other plea, filed at the same time, does properly present the question of homestead, but it was not presented as a plea to the jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-14\">The defendant asked a charge upon the same point, which was refused, a.ud these rulings are presented in a bill of exceptions. The court seems to have thought that the defendant\u2019s homestead was not exempt from the mechanic\u2019s lien claimed by the plaintiff, because she was not a married woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-15\">The constitution'(Art. 16, Sec. 50) provides that \"the homestead of a family shall be, and is hereby protected from forced sale, for the payment of all debts except for the purchase money thereof, <em>'* </em>the taxes due thereon, or for work and material used in constructing improvements thereon, and, in this last case, only when the work and material are contracted for in writing with the consent of the wife, given in the same maimer as is required in making a sale amd conveyance of the homestead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>The act of August 7th, 1876, which is copied into the revised statutes, provides (Sec. 4) that \u201cwhen lumber or material is furnished, labor performed, erection or repairs made upon a homestead, to fix a lien upon the same, it shall be the duty of persons, mechanics, artisans, lumber dealers, or laborers, who shall perform any labor or furnish any material upon or about the construction of any improvement or repairs upon a homestead, to make and enter into a contract in writing, setting forth-the terms of said contract, which said contract in writing shall be signed by the husband and wife, and acknowledged by her as required in making a sale of the homestead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">(R. S. Art. 3174, Acts 1876, p. 91, Sec. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">We construe these constitutional and statutory provisions to mean that in all cases where it is sought to fix a mechanic\u2019s lien upon the homestead the contiact must be in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">This will be put beyond dispute by reference to Art. 2341 of the R. S., which is as follows:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">\u201cThe exemption of the homestead, provided for in this chapter, shall not apply where the debt is due, * * * * 3d. \u2014 For work and material used in constructing improvements thereon; but, in this last case, such work and material must have been contracted for in writing, and the consent of the wife, <em>if there he </em>one, must have been given in the same manner as is by law required in making a sale and conveyance of the homestead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">This disposes of the entire case, for as the contract relied on was verbal, no lien could attach to the property, and the lien set up in the petition was the sole ground of the jurisdiction. We need not, therefore, consider the remaining questions. The judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">Adopted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
