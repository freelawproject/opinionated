Plaintiff had the right, upon the denial of this motion, to proceed under the method for the correction of a finding found in General Statutes, \u00a7 5832. <em>Hartford-Connecticut Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Cambell, </em>97 Conn. 251, 116 Atl. 186. This method requires the filing of a copy of the evidence within one week from the filing of the finding, unless the court shall for due cause extend the time for filing such copy.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">On motion of the plaintiff the trial court extended the time for filing the appeal. This did not extend the time for filing the copy of the evidence. The plaintiff filed his appeal within the extension granted by the court, but he did not then or thereafter move to extend the time for filing the evidence. Nothing further appears to have.been done until September 7th, when the trial judge refused to certify the evidence upon the ground that it was not filed with the clerk within the time prescribed by \u00a7 5832. On October 10th, the appellant-plaintiff moved in this court for an order that the evidence and rulings be certified and printed in accordance with the provisions of General Statutes, \u00a7 5832. The essential allegations of this motion are admitted; in them we find no facts alleged which would have constituted due cause and required the trial judge to have certified the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>dence. His refusal and the ground upon which it was based were in accordance with our practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The motion to order the trial court to certify the evidence and rulings is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The demurrer to the plea in abatement of the appeal is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">The motions to erase, and to dismiss the appeal are denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
