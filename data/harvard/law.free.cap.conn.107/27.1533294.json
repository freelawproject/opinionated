The verdict of $2,000 originally rendered was reduced to $1,500 by <em>remittitur </em>ordered by the trial court upon the motion to set aside the verdict. Whether the verdict, as so reduced, is still to be regarded as excessive will be considered subsequently.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-12\">The allegations of the complaint pertaining to the injuries claimed to have been sustained by the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>in the automobile collision in question were framed in technical language. They set up \u201cccchymosis\u201d over various parts of the body and limbs, causing soreness and lameness, and \u201cnervous hypertension and shock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">During the direct testimony of the plaintiff she stated that she was still under the care of a physician, and being inquired of as to what she was then suffering from, replied \u201cfrom sciatic rheumatism and a nervous breakdown.\u201d Before proceeding to cross-examine upon this subject defendants\u2019 counsel requested the court\u2019s opinion as to whether it was necessary to do so, in view of the complaint, which contained a number of medical terms of which he did not know the meaning but which he assumed did not include a claim of sciatica. The court ruled: \u201cSuppose you let it go for now. If, later in the case, you feel, on account of any developments, you should cross-examine further on it, I will permit you to do so.\u201d In accordance with this suggestion the line of cross-examination was not pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">Subsequently, a statement in a deposition of the plaintiff\u2019s attending physician that in the summer following the accident (which occurred on October 31st, 1925) the plaintiff had developed a trouble with the sciatic nerve of the hip directly over the area where a large amount of black and blue had been found after the accident, was objected to by defendants on the ground that the complaint contained no allegation supporting a claim for sciatica. Thereupon the court ruled: \u201cI will allow the reading of the deposition to proceed at this time without prejudice to your making any motions subsequently. I think we have still to learn a little more about this language before I can definitely rule on it.\u201d The reading of the deposition was then completed, including an opinion by the witness that plaintiff\u2019s difficulty with the sciatic nerve was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>attributable to the injury she had received in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">No explanation of the technical terms used in the complaint was made until a physician called by the defendants testified that \u201cecchymosis\u201d means \u201ca black and blue spot.\u201d Being asked, further, the meaning of \u201cnervous hypertension,\u201d he replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Hypertension means increased blood pressure, but what a nervous increased blood pressure may be I don\u2019t know. It may mean hypertension due to nervousness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Presumably because of a justifiable belief that, in view of this evidence and the previous rulings by the court above mentioned, sciatica as an element of damage was not regarded by the court as within the allegations of the complaint, and having no intimation to the contrary until the charge, hereinafter quoted, was given, the defendants made no request to cross-examine the plaintiff on the subject of sciatica, and offered no evidence pertaining thereto; neither did they save an exception to the ruling admitting the portions of the deposition above referred to, nor move to strike out the evidence relating to sciatica. However, they did request a charge that \u201cno verdict should be given for the plaintiff for any claim of sciatica, as there is nothing in the complaint that makes any such claim.\u201d The court, instead of complying, charged that \u201cthe allegations of the complaint are sufficiently broad to cover pain and suffering . . . from her sciatic nerve, provided you are satisfied that the evidence connects this pain and suffering and injury to this nerve with the accident in such a way as to make it the result of the accident and not from any other cause.\u201d The refusal to charge as so requested and the charge so given are assigned as error, and we are unable to agree with the trial court\u2019s construction of the complaint as stated in the charge. Upon the uncontradicted testimony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>quoted above, of the only witness skilled in medical nomenclature who undertook to translate the technical terms into language understandable by the court and jury, we think that the allegations in question fail to give the defendants the fair notice to which they were entitled if claim was to be made not only for the physical injuries described and for accompanying and continuing nervous shock, in the familiar and accepted sense of that term, but also for sciatica,\u2014a distinct and commonly known affection of a particular nerve, which developed months after the original injury. Of course, if this manifestation had causal connection with the original injury, the plaintiff would be entitled to allege and claim it as an element of damage and recovery, but we regard such a claim as being neither expressly nor by fair implication embraced within the allegations of the complaint as framed. The request to charge should have been granted, in substance, and the charge which was given instead was erroneous. <em>Longstean </em>v. <em>McCaffrey\u2019s </em>Sons, 95 Conn. 486, 490, 111 Atl. 788; <em>Stein </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>73 Conn. 524, 529, 48 Atl. 206. Upon the evidence as to the elements of damage other than sciatica, the amount of the verdict, even as reduced by <em>remittitur, </em>was clearly excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">There is error and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
