There was evidence tending to show that the plaintiff was hurt by slipping upon a piece of sheet metal about twenty-one feet long over which she was walking. It was described as designed to have the \u201ceffect of an ordinary suspension bridge, swinging up and down; it would give under your weight.\u201d It was part of a combination of artifices or mechanisms through which people were invited to walk by a \u201cbig grotesque looking face outside\u201d and a sign \u201cIt won\u2019t hurt you to laugh.\u201d There was an iron hand rail of which, as the plaintiff walked across the metal, she took sufficient hold to guide her steps. After testifying without objection that there was a reason why she did not take a firmer hold, she was permitted, subject to the defendant\u2019s exception, to state that the reason was that she \u201cfelt a little afraid of it,\u201d that she \"did not really know what to expect,\u201d that she \u201cwas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>afraid of shocks, ... an electric shock.\u201d The plaintiff also testified that she held tighter on the rail as she felt herself falling and had hold of it all the time. '</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">No reversible error is disclosed. Under these conditions the evidence was competent as bearing upon her due care. <em>Carriere </em>v. <em>Merrick Lumber Co. </em>203 Mass. 322, 327. A light hold upon a metallic hand rail in a place where constant surprises were to be anticipated might have been thought to be prudent. Moreover it does not appear that her injury resulted in any degree from the nature of her grasp upon the support.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
