No new evidence was presented before the Industrial Accident Board and the rulings and findings of the arbitration committee were affirmed and adopted. The board found that the employee had sustained a reduction of vision in the injured right eye to one tenth of normal with glasses as a result of a personal injury which arose out of and in the course of his employment; and that there was due the employee a weekly compensation of $10 for a period of fifty weeks, less an overpayment by the insurer of $8.57, the net sum due the employee being $491.43.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-5\">The judge made a decree in accordance with the d\u00e9cision of the Industrial Accident Board ordering the insurer to pay to the employee the sum named above.

Under the workmen\u2019s compensation act additional compensation is payable for certain specified injuries, among others, for \u201cthe reduction to one tenth of normal vision in either eye with glasses.\u201d St. 1911, c. 751, Part II, \u00a7 11 (6), as amended by St. 1912, c. 571, \u00a7 2; St. 1914, c. 708, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">The evidence on which the Industrial Accident Board found that the employee was entitled to the benefit of this provision was substantially undisputed. The vision of the employee\u2019s left eye is normal. That of the right eye, without a glass, is about one sixtieth. By covering the good eye, the vision of the injured eye alone, with a glass, is nearly normal. This however cannot be utilized when he uses the normal eye and the corrected eye together, as there is a lack of co-ordination or correlation, a sort of double vision. No glass that he could get for the injured eye would give him fused vision with the good eye. The result is that when both eyes are used together glasses are impracticable.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">The decision of the Industrial Accident Board was that \u201cthe employee, has sustained a reduction of vision in the injured eye to one tenth of normal with glasses.\u201d They reached this conclusion by taking into consideration the vision of the right eye as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>compared with the normal vision of both eyes used together. In doing so, we think the board correctly interpreted the intention of the Legislature. The construction contended for by the insurer would lead to the unreasonable result of allowing compensation for the loss of an eye, but none for an injury that rendered the eye worse than useless. On the testimony of the insurer\u2019s own expert the employee would enjoy normal vision with the left eye if the injured eye were removed entirely.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
