The bill alleged that after purchasing the farm and personal property from that defendant the plaintiffs, believing that the boundaries were as represented by him sold the farm and personal property to one Antonio Chaliux, and pointed out to him the boundaries which the defendant Charles Chamberlain had shown to them and represented to Chaliux that those were the boundaries of the premises they conveyed to him by their deed; that immediately before the filing of their bill the plaintiffs discovered that the representations made by the defendant Charles Chamberlain as to the acreage and his representations that the stones and iron pins pointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>out by him were the corners of his farm were false; that the plaintiffs thereupon felt bound to rescind the contract of sale they had entered into with Chaliux and rescinded that sale and thus at the time of filing this bill were the owners of the premises and the personal property conveyed to them by the defendants; that the plaintiffs called the attention of the defendants to the allegations set forth in the bill and demanded a return of the Friend Street premises, and offered to return to the defendants the premises conveyed to them and the personal property, but that the defendants refused to rescind the contract. The prayer asked that the defendants be ordered to rescind the contract and to execute, acknowledge and deliver to the plaintiffs a warranty deed of the Friend Street premises conveying a title thereto good in every manner as they had received the premises from the plaintiffs, upon the plaintiffs making such restitution to the defendants as the court should order, which the plaintiffs offered to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-5\">The case was referred to a master, who filed a report containing the findings that are stated in the opinion. The' defendants filed exceptions to the master\u2019s report, and the case was heard by <em>Wait, </em>J., upon the defendants\u2019 exceptions to the master\u2019s report and a motion of the plaintiffs to confirm the report. The judge made an interlocutory decree overruling the defendants\u2019 exceptions to the master\u2019s report, confirming the report and adopting \u201cthe findings therein.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-6\">Later by order of the same judge a final decree was entered, ordering that upon the payment or tender to the defendants by the plaintiffs of the sum of $186, and the return or tender of the personal property mentioned in the master\u2019s report and the delivery or tender of a good and sufficient warranty deed, conveying the premises at Savoy, Massachusetts, described in the deed of Charles Chamberlain to the plaintiffs dated July 18, 1914, to the defendant Charles Chamberlain, free from all incumbrances, and executed and acknowledged by the plaintiffs, the defendants should execute, acknowledge and deliver to the plaintiffs a good and sufficient warranty deed of the premises on Friend Street in Adams, Massachusetts, described in the deed of the plaintiffs dated July 18, 1914, free from all incumbrances, and further should pay to the defendants [plaintiffs]] their costs in the sum of $32.28.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-7\">The defendants appealed from the final decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number><em>P.

After deeds had been passed and change of occupancy effected, the plaintiffs discovered the fraud, and thereupon, instead of affirming the trade and suing at law for damages, they resorted to equity for rescission and appropriate relief. <em>Ginn </em>v. <em>Almy, </em>212 Mass. 486, 493. <em>Winston </em>v. <em>Pittsfield, </em>221 Mass. 356, 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Nor was it necessary, as the defendants contend, that before bringing suit the plaintiffs should offer to return the property they had received, which included not only the farm, but also some live stock, poultry, farming tools, carriages and harnesses. <em>Ginn </em>v. <em>Almy, </em>212 Mass. 486. The filing of the bill was sufficient notice of the election, and, if full restoration could not be made by either party;, compensation could be decreed. <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>223 Mass. 47. It is therefore of no consequence, that at the time the offer to rescind as alleged in the bill was made, the title was in one Chaliux to whom before they knew of the deception the plaintiffs had conveyed. The title having been held by them under a re-conveyance from Chaliux when the bill was filed, and they having offered in the prayer for relief to make such restitution as might be ordered, the only defence urged is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">But it was stated by the parties at the argument, that since the appeal the buildings on the premises conveyed by the plaintiffs have been partially destroyed by fire, and, if the defendants rec\u00f3tivey as ordered by the decree, the plaintiffs would not be re-vested with their former estate. It is settled that under such circumstances and where strict rescission, with specific performance is no longer possible, the bill can \u25a0 be retained for \u25a0 the assessment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>damages. <em>American Stay Co. </em>v. <em>Delaney, </em>211 Mass. 229, 233. <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Maxwell, ubi supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">The master having found that the shortage in area consisted of a tract of wood and timber land which he valued at $769.50, the counsel for the plaintiffs stated without any dissent being expressed by the counsel for the defendants, that, if entitled to prevail, they were willing to accept this amount in full satisfaction, and waive all rights to specific relief. The measure of recovery is thus brought within the rule, that in an action for fraud and deceit damages are measured by the difference between the actual value received, and what that value would have been if the representations had been true. <em>Thomson </em>v. <em>Pentecost, </em>210 Mass. 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The appeal vacated the decree as to the defendants, and under St. 1913, c. 716, \u00a7 2, this court, having before it \u201call the facts necessary for determining the question in dispute,\u201d can in conformity therewith direct the entry of a final decree. It follows that the decree appealed from must be amended by striking out after the words \"it is ordered, adjudged and decreed,\u201d the remaining terms to the words, \u201cand further shall pay to the defendants their costs in the sum of thirty-two dollars and twenty-eight cents,\u201d and by inserting in lieu thereof the words, \u201cthat the plaintiffs recover of the defendants the sum of seven hundred sixty-nine and fifty one hundredths dollars as damages,\u201d and by adding to the closing sentence, \u201cand execution for said damages and costs is to issue.\u201d As thus amended the decree is affirmed with costs of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
