The fifth policy on expiration was not renewed but a new policy was made in another company covering stock to the amount of $250 in addition to the amount apportioned to the house, barn and produce. The defendant makes no question as to the validity of the renewal policies or as to the substituted policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">It is further agreed that on March 27, 1912, the plaintiff secured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>a policy in the Orient Insurance Company in the Massachusetts standard form of fire insurance policy, for the term of three years, in the amount of $1,200, of which $1,100 covered a portion of the same property described and apportioned as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\">\u201cHouse Furniture Barn Wagons Stock</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">$400.00 $100.00 $350.00 $250.00 $100.00;\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">that one of the printed provisions which was attached to this policy was the following: \u201cE \u2014 In case of other insurance on any of the property mentioned in this policy, whether such other insurance is valid or not, or whether it covers the same permissions or hazards or in as general a location or not, this Company shall be liable only in proportion as this insurance bears to the whole insurance thereon;\u201d that at the time when this policy was issued the agent knew that there was prior insurance covering the property and so advised the Orient Insurance Company, and that through inadvertence and oversight the agent neglected to write upon the \u201cform\u201d or \u201crider\u201d attached to the said policy the words \u201cOther Insurance Permitted,\u201d which words the agent thought were printed in said \u201cform\u201d or \u201crider.\u201d It is further agreed that on April 25, 1913, the \u201cspecial agent\u201d of the Orient Insurance Company, who had general supervision of the company\u2019s business in the Massachusetts and Rhode Island territory, gave permission to the agent who issued the policy dated March 27, 1912, to issue to the plaintiff a second Orient policy, which was accordingly issued May 1, 1913, whereby the plaintiff was insured for the term of three years from that date for $1,200, of which $1,100 covered a portion of the same property as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">\u201cHouse Furniture Barn Wagons Stock</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">$400.00 $100.00 $350.00 $250.00 $100.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">On the \u201cform\u201d or \u201crider\u201d which was signed by the agent and attached to the policy in the manner provided for by St. 1907, c. 576, \u00a7 60, cl. 7, were written the words, \u201cOther Insurance Permitted,\u201d clause \u201cE,\u201d above quoted, was printed thereon and no limitation of the amount of such other insurance was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">It was further agreed that the agent, in his \u201cdaily, report\u201d to the home office of the Orient Insurance Company on the last policy, wrote \u201cAn additional policy No. 399602\u201d (the first policy), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>attached to the \u201cdaily report\u201d the letter of the \u201cspecial agent\u201d giving permission to issue to the plaintiff a second policy. The agreed facts contain no statement that the defendant assented to the additional insurance in excess of the amount limited at the time when placed. Nor does the plaintiff contend that the defendant ever knew that the excessive insurance had been obtained until after the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">As the case is before us on an appeal taken by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Superior Court following a submission to a judge of that court upon the agreed statement of facts, the only question presented is whether upon the agreed facts and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom the finding of the judge of the Superior Court for the defendant was unwarranted as a matter of law. St. 1913, c. 716, \u00a7 5. <em>Boston Lodge Order of Elks </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>217 Mass. 176, 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">We are of opinion that the provision in the policy of the defendant that \u201cIt is made a condition of this contract that the total insurance permitted, including the amount of this policy, is limited to $7,600,\u201d is not merely a representation, the violation of which does not avoid the policy unless there be fraud in the representation or the excess insurance be material to the risk, but is by the precise terms of the contract \u201ca condition\u201d or stipulation to be taken and read with the further provision of the contract that \u201cThis policy shall be void if . . . the. insured now has or shall hereafter make any other insurance on the said property without the assent in writing or in print of the Company.\u201d <em>Conway Tool Co. </em>v. <em>Hudson River Ins. Co. </em>12 Cush. 144. <em>Union National Bank of Oshkosh </em>v. <em>German Ins. Co. of Freeport, </em>71 Fed. Rep. 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The second Orient policy of insurance was issued to the. plaintiff by an agent of the insurance company with the written permission of the \u201cspecial agent\u201d of the company. It covered a portion of the same property as did the policy of the defendant. It bore a \u201cform\u201d or \u201crider\u201d attached to the policy upon which was written and signed by the agent \u201cas agent\u201d in the manner provided by St. 1907, c. 576, \u00a7 60, cl. 7, the words, \"Other Insurance Permitted,\u201d and the amount apportioned to the property covered by the policy of the defendant made the total insurance thereon including the amount covered by the policy of the defendant in excess of $7,600. We are of opinion that the second Orient policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>was a legal and valid contract of insurance; that the agreed facts warranted a finding that it was insurance in excess of $7,600; that it was made without the assent in writing or in print of the defendant, and without the knowledge of the defendant until after the fire. <em>Canton Co-operative Bank </em>v. <em>American Central Ins. Co. </em>219 Mass. 132, 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-3\">It is the settled law of-this Commonwealth that valid subsequent insurance avoids a prior policy if made in violation of a limitation or condition of that policy. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>23 Pick. 418. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>New England Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>6 Cush. 342. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Milford Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>170 Mass. 492, 496. <em>Northern Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Grand View Building Association, </em>183 U. S. 308. <em>Lindley </em>v. <em>Union Ins. Co. </em>65 Maine, 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">It becomes unnecessary to determine whether upon the agreed facts the first Orient policy could have been found to have been a legal and valid contract of insurance by reason of the acts and declarations of the agent and special agent of the Orient Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">It follows in accordance with the terms of agreement of the parties that judgment shall be entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
