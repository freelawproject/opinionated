J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aal\">The plaintiff was in the employ of the defendant at its power house. His work was to pull the ashes out from under the boilers, load them into a wheelbarrow or truck, take them to a pit and tip them into the pit, which commonly was partially filled with water. He had been thus engaged for more than a year. He had always found the ashes hot or \u201cred hot,\u201d and sometimes pieces of coal or \u201cbig chunks of coal\u201d came down with the ashes \u201calways hot.\u201d On. the occasion here in question, as he tipped the ashes into the pit, to quote his testimony, \u201cthe water flashed up with steam and heat . . . the ashes flared up right into his face and burned his eye: the ashes were red hot.\u201d The plaintiff \u201cmoved hot ashes into the pit at other times, at which times they flashed up the same as they had before into his eye. Sometimes the ashes didn\u2019t have a chance to cool.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>The defendant was not a subscriber under the workmen\u2019s compensation act. The only question is whether there was evidence of negligence of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\">The workmen\u2019s compensation act does not enlarge the duty of an employer who is not a subscriber, nor transform into negligence conduct which apart from that statute would impose no liability upon him. Negligence is a breach of some legal obligation, imposing the performance or omission of particular conduct. There can be no negligence where there is no duty. <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Turner Centre Dairying Association, </em>223 Mass. 386. <em>Bernabeo </em>v. <em>Kaulback, </em>226 Mass. 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">There is no evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant. There is no suggestion that this method of disposal of ashes was not proper and usual. It had been followed during the entire period, of the plaintiff\u2019s employment. He appears to have been fully aware of all the ordinary incidents of his work, including the matter of common knowledge that when a body is thrown into water there is liable to be a splash. No warning was required. <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Rosnosky, </em>195 Mass. 545. <em>Sakas </em>v. <em>Lumsden &amp; Van Stone Co. </em>214 Mass. 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Coal was fed to the boilers by a stoker, and there was a water pipe under the boilers from which, according to one witness, \u201clittle streams- of water trickle out ... to wet and dampen the ashes and, if the ashes stay there long enough, they become cool.\u201d According to another witness this water was \u201cto keep the clinker bar cool.\u201d There was testimony by the plaintiff that at the time of the accident this \u201cwater stopped to come down. . . . Sometimes the water did not come down when there was a fire.\u201d On all the testimony it could not have been found that the failure to cool the ashes with water constituted negligence of the defendant having a causal connection with the injury. <em>Archer </em>v. <em>Eldredge, </em>204 Mass. 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
