Negus.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-3\">The specifications concluded as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-4\">\u201cThe plaintiff says that it is impossible to answer more fully the specific interrogatories of the defendant in the manner and form in which the same are set forth in the defendant\u2019s motion for specifications, but the plaintiff more fully specifies as follows: That the conduct of the defendant and the said Mabel L. Negus prior to, and after, September, 1914, was such as to show an adulterous disposition; that the plaintiff was not at home after September 12, 1914, and had no intercourse with his wife the said Mabel L. Negus after that date; that the defendant during the months of December, 1914, and January and February, 1915, occupied the same house with the said Mabel L.

And the plaintiff says that Mabel L. Negus is his lawfully wedded wife; that the defendant on or about the first day of January A. D. 1915 at Montague in the county of Franklin and at divers other times did have unlawful carnal knowledge of the body of the said Mabel L. Negus and did beget upon the body of the said Mabel L. Negus a child, of which child she was delivered on the fifth day of October A. D. 1915; whereby and by reason whereof the plaintiff lost the aid, comfort, and consortium of his said wife and was otherwise greatly injured and damaged.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-10\">The amendment was allowed by <em>Aiken, </em>C. J. The defendant demurred to the third count of the declaration as amended on the ground that a declaration, that a child born by the plaintiff\u2019s wife after her marriage to the plaintiff was illegitimate, was inadmissible on the part of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>The demurrer was overruled by <em>Aiken, </em>C. J., and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-5\">The case was tried before <em>Aiken, </em>C. J. The evidence introduced is described in the opinion. The plaintiff made the following offer of proof: \"The plaintiff offers to show that from early September, 1914, until May, 1915, Negus, the plaintiff, did not have access to his wife; that during the months of January and February, 1915, Foote, the defendant, roomed and boarded in the house in which the plaintiff\u2019s wife lived and was the only man living there; that he had roomed and boarded there to some extent during November and December and there had been much intimacy between them for at least six months; that in midsummer Mr. Daly saw this woman in the family way in July and that she gave birth to a child on the fifth of October, 1915.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-6\">The Chief Justice ruled as follows: \u201cThe court excludes the offer to show the condition of Mrs. Negus in July and the birth of the child in October. I do not exclude any evidence of intimacy in respect to conduct further that you desire to show. You have already shown that. I do not know whether it is offered as an offer to show more than you have shown. If it is, I am not excluding it, but those two features of your offer I will exclude.\u201d The plaintiff excepted to the exclusion of the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-7\">The Chief Justice ruled that the action could not be maintained upon the evidence presented, and directed the jury to return a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b403-8\"><em>H. E. Ward, (F. L. Greene </em>with him,) for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b403-9\"><em>W. A.

While the action can be maintained without proof of adultery, <em>Nolin </em>v. <em>Pearson, ubi supra, Webber </em>v. <em>Benbow, </em>211 Mass. 366, 368, it is clear upon the record that to make out a case for the jury the plaintiff was obliged to offer evidence of his wife\u2019s infidelity in which the defendant was a participant. It has long been settled that previous acts of familiarity, unless in the discretion of the judge they are too remote, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>are admissible to show an adulterous disposition, and there is no difference between acts of familiarity and actual adultery, when offered for the purpose indicated, except in the additional weight and significance of the latter act. <em>Beers </em>v. <em>Jackman, </em>103 Mass. 192. <em>Thayer </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>101 Mass. 111. It was one link in the chain of proof to show adultery by the wife, and \u00e1s the jury would have been warranted in finding non-access by the plaintiff during the entire period covered by the offer of proof which was excluded, evidence that his wife had been delivered of a -child tended to prove the offence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morrissey, </em>175 Mass. 264. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>129 Mass. 474. But, if no evidence had been introduced from which in connection with the offer of proof the jury would have been warranted in finding that the defendant was the father, the plaintiff has not been prejudiced. \u201cThe evidence by which the act of adultery is proved is seldom direct. The natural secrecy of the act makes it ordinarily impossible to prove it, except by circumstantial evidence,\u201d and \u201cThe intent and disposition of the parties toward each other must give character to their relations, and can only be ascertained, as all moral qualities are, from the acts and declarations of the parties.\u201d To this end their antecedent and subsequent conduct are admissible if it has a tendency to prove the fact. <em>Thayer </em>v. <em>Thayer, ubi supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AQXV\">The ruling excluded proof of the birth of a child on October 5, 1915. If the jury found that the wife was delivered on this date they further could find in accordance with common knowledge and experience that the child was begotten nine months previously, or approximately in January, 1915. The defendant was employed as a chauffeur by the plaintiff\u2019s father-in-law, one Ross. The plaintiff with his wife and minor daughter kept house by themselves, but the defendant boarded and lodged with his employer. During the summer of 1914 the plaintiff\u2019s wife and the defendant \u201cwere riding together a good deal . . . were frequently in the garage together and often sat together upon the porch in the evening.\u201d And the plaintiff further testified that \u201chis wife frequently remained in the garage with Foote in the evening after every one else had left;\u201d that he had \u201cseen the lights go out, and I have waited perhaps fifteen minutes before my wife would show up;\u201d that \u201che remonstrated with his wife about her conduct and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>that such conduct on her part was the cause of his going away from his home\u201d finally in September, 1914, since which time he has not lived with his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The defendant testified that he knew of the plaintiff\u2019s absence, and that \u201csoon after Thanksgiving in 1914, at the request of Mrs. Ross, ... he boarded and roomed in the house of Mrs. Negus; . . . that he left the employ of Ross about February, 1915,\u201d but returned \" sometime in May, 1915,\u201d and then stayed at the Ross house where \u201che had a room on the second floor\u201d and \u201cthat Mrs. Negus had a room which did not adjoin his on the second floor.\u201d And a witness for the plaintiff testified that in July, 1915, when as the jury could say Mrs. Negus was well advanced in pregnancy and the defendant knew of her condition, he said, \u201cthat he would be very glad to marry her if it was so that he could, if it was so that she could get married.\u201d We are of opinion there was evidence from which the existence of an adulterous inclination or desire between the defendant and Mrs. Negus could be found, with an opportunity for coition at a period which would charge him with the paternity of the child. Or in other words, it was for the jury using the logic of common experience to consider, under appropriate instructions, cause and effect, and to determine whether all the circumstances were reasonably sufficient to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt, or whether they were equally compatible with his innocence. <em>Thayer </em>v. <em>Thayer, ubi supra. Beers </em>v. <em>Jackman, ubi supra. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bean, </em>137 Mass. 570, 571. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Hurley, </em>147 Mass. 387. <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>151 Mass. 532. The case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>107 Mass. 219, on which the defendant relies is clearly distinguishable. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morrissey, </em>175 Mass. 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The evidence should have been admitted, and the exceptions must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
