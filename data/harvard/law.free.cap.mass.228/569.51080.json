There was evidence warranting this finding. <em>Held, </em>that the finding of fact must stand.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-9\">Contract, by the assignee of Dora J.

The defendant filed no substitute bill until August 13, 1917. On July 31, counsel for the defendant mailed to John D. Mulloney, Esquire, counsel for the plaintiff, a letter, addressing it to \u2018John D. Mulloney, Esq., Pemberton Building, Brockton, Mass.\u2019 No notice of the filing of the bill of exceptions was given; nor was any notice relating to a bill of exceptions, other than the one referred to, at any time given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>\u201cThe true address of the counsel for the plaintiff was Pemberton Building, Boston, Mass., and the plaintiff\u2019s counsel had no office in Brockton.

His attorney made affidavit to the effect that he mailed a letter directed to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney which \u201chad not been returned to his office and that he was reasonably sure the address thereon had been changed from Pemberton Building, Brockton, Mass., to Pemberton Building, Boston, Mass, before the same had been mailed.\u201d An affidavit also was filed that no notice of the filing of the exceptions had been received by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. The judge made a finding of fact- that the letter purporting to be a notice was addressed to Brockton and not to Boston and that the true address was Boston, and that the plaintiff\u2019s attorney had no office in Brockton and that he received no notice. This finding of fact must stand. It is not unsupported by evidence. It may have been inferred rationally that the address on the letter had not been changed from Brockton to Boston. If that were so, no notice had been given as required by the Superior Court rules. The case falls within the principle of <em>Shawmut Commercial Paper Co. </em>v. <em>Brigham, </em>209 Mass. 199, and <em>Chertok </em>v. <em>Dix, </em>222 Mass. 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
