At the beginning of the trial the plaintiffs moved that the cases be dismissed for want of jurisdic-tion. The judge admitted evidence <em>de bene, </em>by which it appeared that in each of the four original actions brought in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston by trustee process, in which the Globe Optical Company was summoned as trustee, there was a report to the Appellate Division at the request of the alleged trustee, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>that in each case the Appellate Division ordered that the Globe Optical Company be charged as trustee and that in none of the cases was there any appeal to the Supreme Judicial Court for the Commonwealth under St. 1912, c. 649, \u00a7 9, as amended by St. 1914, c. 35, \u00a7 4.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-3\">The judge ordered that in each case the appeal be dismissed for want of jurisdiction and that the papers in the case be remanded to the Municipal Court of the City of Boston, and reported the cases for determination by this court.

L. c. 189, \u00a7\u00a7 45-49, where the trustee upon -.demand does not pay over to the officer goods, , effects or credits sufficient to satisfy the execution which is to be sued out from the court where judgment was rendered, and the execution is not satisfied -otherwise, \u201care part of one continued and connected course of proceedings,\u201d and that \u201cthe examination of the trustee\u201d in the scire facias \u201cis to be in the same manner and with the same effect\u201d as in the original action. It is plain that no provision is made for a jury trial] as the answers of the trustee to interrogatories propounded to the trustee in scire facias are to be considered as true and conclusive, although either party may allege and prove facts not stated or denied by the trustee, which may be material in determining how far the trustee is chargeable. <em>Bickford </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Lowell Railroad, </em>21 Pick. 109, 113. <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Sears, </em>111 Mass. 154. <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Meagher, </em>166 Mass. 152. <em>Koontz </em>v. <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, </em>220 Mass. 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">When thus used the scire facias is in no sense an independent civil action, but is a judicial writ to enforce a judgment charging the trustee either upon his answer admitting goods, effects or credits, or after he had been defaulted. <em>M\u2019Gee </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>14 Pick. 212, 215. <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Thrasher, </em>104 Mass. 373, 375. <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Bangs, </em>206 Mass. 408, 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">It follows that, the original actions not having ..been removed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>from the Municipal Court to the Superior Court in accordance with the St. of 1912, c. 649, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, as amended by St. 1914, c. 35, \u00a7 2, and St. 1914, c. 409, and the question whether the trustee was chargeable having been taken by him to the Appellate Division, who ordered that the trustee be charged, and no appeal from this order having been taken to this court under St. of 1912, c. 649, \u00a7 9, as amended by St. 1914, c. 35, \u00a7 4, the ruling that the Superior Court was without jurisdiction to entertain the appeals was correct. <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Bangs, </em>206 Mass. 408, 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">The order dismissing the appeals and directing that the papers be transmitted to the Municipal Court of the City of Boston is to stand. <em>Dion </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>128 Mass. 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
