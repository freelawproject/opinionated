The plaintiff, on his cross-examination, testified that, after he was thrown down, women who were thrown down were thrown on to him. But the plaintiff also testified that he had told his attorney how the accident happened and that what he told his attorney was to the same effect as the statements made in the specifications. <em>Held, </em>that the plaintiff\u2019s contradictory testimony did not require the finding of a variance between the allegations contained in the specifications and the proof.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b124-5\">In the same case it was stated in the specifications that the negligence relied upon by the plaintiff was negligence of the defendant\u2019s motorman, and the defendant contended that there was no evidence that the accident happened through the negligence of the motorman. One of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses testified, in answer to a request to describe the accident, \u201cWhy it seems to me as if he threw the application of the brakes on like that (indicating by clapping hands together).\u201d <em>Held, </em>that this evidence warranted a finding that the sudden stopping of the ear was caused by the negligence of the motorman.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b124-6\">In the same case it was <em>said </em>that, under the view of the evidence taken by this court, it was not necessary to consider the defendant\u2019s contention that a statement contained in a specification stands in all respects and for all purposes as if it were a part of the declaration.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-7\">Tort for personal injuries sustained on October 16, 1914, when the plaintiff was a passenger on a street railway car of the defendant, by reason of the sudden and violent stopping of the car just before it reached the Dudley Street terminal of the defendant in Boston.

The defendant\u2019s first contention is that the evidence introduced by the plaintiff did not make out a case of negligence in the sudden stopping of the car within the rule of this court established in <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>220 Mass. 28, and the cases there collected. We are of opinion that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">2. The defendant\u2019s next contention is that there was a variance between the allegations and the proof. This contention is founded on testimony of the plaintiff not yet stated. On cross-examination the plaintiff testified more than once that after he was thrown down women who were thrown down were thrown on to him; while in his specifications the plaintiff stated that his hold was broken and he was thrown down by the passengers who were thrown off their feet by the sudden stopping of the car. But on this point the plaintiff\u2019s testimony was contradictory. He testified both ways. In addition to the testimony just stated the plaintiff was asked: \u201cDo you know where your attorney got that information? That the motorman was so operating his car as to cause passengers therein to be thrown off their feet against you, breaking your hold and causing your hand to go through the car window?\u201d In answer to this question he said: \u201cI told him how it happened.\u201d He was then asked \u201cDid you tell him what I have just read?\u201d and the plaintiff answered \u201cWords to that effect.\u201d In other words the plaintiff testified that he told his attorney how the accident happened and that what he told his attorney were words to the same effect as the statement made in the specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">3. The next contention of the defendant is that there was no evidence that the accident happened through the negligence of the motorman and it is alleged in the specifications that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>negligence relied upon was negligence of the motorman. One of the witnesses put on the stand by the plaintiff testified, in answer to a request that he describe the accident, \u201cWhy it seems to me as if he threw the application of the brakes on like that (indicating by clapping hands together).\u201d This justified a finding that the sudden stopping was caused through the negligence of the motorman.</p>\n<p id=\"ASZ\">4. Under the view which we have taken of the case it is not necessary to consider the defendant\u2019s contention that a statement contained in a specification stands in all respects and for all purposes as if it had been a part of the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">5. It is apparent from what has been said that the ruling directing the jury to find a verdict for the defendant was wrong. In accordance with the stipulation contained in the bill of exceptions the entry must be judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $500, and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
