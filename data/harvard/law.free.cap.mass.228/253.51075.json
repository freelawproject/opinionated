A witness for the plaintiff was allowed, without objection from the defendant, to testify that he had seen the defendant\u2019s truck go up this same road at other times. On cross-examination the defendant, subject to the plaintiff\u2019s exception, was allowed to ask the witness \"What kind of a turn\u201d the defendant\u2019s truck \u201ccustomarily\u201d made in going round the corner in question, and the witness answered that the truck turned close to the corner when he had seen it. The defendant contended, that, the plaintiff having asked the witness on his direct examination as to the defendant\u2019s truck having been driven up this road at other times, the presiding judge in his discretion might allow the defendant to introduce further evidence on this immaterial issue, but it was <em>held </em>that the question in regard to the manner of turning the corner was not opened by the plaintiff, so that the rule as to the discretionary power to allow an immaterial issue to be met after being opened did not apply.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b280-5\">In the same case it was <em>held </em>that the plaintiff was harmed by the admission of the incompetent evidence in regard to the defendant\u2019s customary way of turning the corner, because, if the jury had believed the plaintiff\u2019s testimony that the defendant swerved to the left, they could find that the defendant was violating St. 1910, c. 605, \u00a7 5, which requires that a motor vehicle \u201c approaching a crossing of ways\u201d shall \u201ckeep to the right of the intersection of the centres of both ways, when turning to the right.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b280-6\">In the same case it appeared that two of the plaintiff\u2019s own witnesses had testified that after the accident the defendant\u2019s truck was on the right hand side of the road about fifty feet before reaching the corner in question, and the defendant contended that in the light of this evidence the admission of the incompetent evidence as to the defendant\u2019s customary way of turning the corner could not have harmed the plaintiff, but it was <em>held </em>that this testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s two witnesses was in conflict with the testimony of the plaintiff himself and that the jury were at liberty to believe the plaintiff.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b280-7\">At the trial of an action of tort for personal injuries, where the plaintiff and the defendant both have testified as witnesses, it is within the discretionary power of the presiding judge to allow the plaintiff and the defendant each to be asked how many children and how much of a family he has in order to enable the jury to learn in a general way \u201cwhat sort of a man is on the witness stand.\u201d</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-8\">Tort for personal injuries sustained on June 5, 1915, when the plaintiff was riding a bicycle on the road from South Hadley Centre to South Hadley Falls in the town of South Hadley and \u25a0 was struck by a motor truck driven by the defendant.

He testified that, when he reached a point about seventy feet south of Granby Road (which leads out of the Hadley Road on the east) and while he was riding on the right hand side of the road, the defendant swerved out to his left in order to make the turn into Granby Road and ran into him. The defendant\u2019s story was that he was going up Hadley Road on the right not intending to go into Granby Road; that the plaintiff came down the road wobbling from one side to the other side of the road with one hand on the handle-bar, his head turned back to speak to a companion, and ran into the truck. A witness called by the plaintiff was allowed without objection on the part of the defendant to testify that he had seen the defendant\u2019s truck go up Granby Road at other times. On cross-examination the defendant under the plaintiff\u2019s exception was allowed to ask the witness, \u201cWhat kind of a turn did it \u00a1[the defendant\u2019s truck] customarily make from South Hadley up to the Granby road?\u201d and he testified that it turned close to the corner when he had seen it. The witness testified through an interpreter, and some intermediate questions were asked in this connection by the presiding judge seemingly to secure an answer to the question asked. No contention has been made by the defendant based upon this intervention on the part of .the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The evidence was incompetent. The fact that a party did or did not do an act in issue at a trial cannot be proved by evidence that it had been his custom to do or not to do that act at other times. See, for example, <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Fitchburg &amp; Worcester Railroad, </em>7 Gray, 92; <em>Tenney </em>v. <em>Tuttle, </em>1 Allen, 185; <em>Gahagan </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Lowell Railroad, </em>1 Allen, 187; <em>Lizotte </em>v. <em>New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad, </em>196 Mass. 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">To escape from this difficulty the defendant has contended that this line of inquiry had been opened to him by the plaintiff asking as to the fact of the defendant\u2019s truck having been driven up Granby Road at other times, that both inquiries were immaterial and that for these reasons the case comes within the rule that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>presiding judge in his discretion may allow a party to a cause to go into evidence upon an immaterial issue opened by the other party to the cause. But the evidence which the defendant-was allowed to introduce was not confined to the fact upon which the plaintiff introduced evidence, namely, the fact that the defendant\u2019s truck had been seen going into Granby Road before the accident here in question. It was an inquiry going beyond the fact gone into by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The next contention made by the defendant is that from the nature of it the plaintiff was not harmed by the evidence. But that is not so. The truth of the plaintiff\u2019s story that the defendant swerved over to the wrong side of Hadley Road was of vital importance on the issue on trial. If the jury believed it to be the fact, that when the defendant\u2019s truck had turned into Granby Road in the past it had \u201ccustomarily\u201d made the turn \u201cclose to the corner,\u201d the plaintiff was harmed by the introduction of that incompetent evidence. And this is emphasized by the fact that, in case the defendant was making the turn into Granby Road, as the plaintiff testified, he was driving in violation of St. 1910, c. 605, \u00a7 5, which provides that: \u201cThe driver of any motor vehicle on any highway approaching a crossing of ways, shall slow down and keep to the right of the intersection of the centres of both ways, when turning to the right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The defendant\u2019s last contention is that the plaintiff was not harmed by- the evidence because two of the plaintiff\u2019s own witnesses testified that after the accident the defendant\u2019s truck was some fifty feet below Granby Road corner and was on the right side of the road. Without considering this evidence and the inferences necessarily drawn from it, the contention is disposed of by the fact that this evidence was in conflict with the plaintiff\u2019s testimony and the jury were at liberty to believe the plaintiff. This exception must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">There is one question of practice raised at the trial which may come up again and therefore ought to be disposed of. On cross-examination of the plaintiff, th\u00e9 defendant under the plaintiff\u2019s exception was allowed to ask him how many children he had, and he testified that he had six, all of them in Portugal, and that he did not bring them with him when he came to this country because he did not have the passage money. In direct examination the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>defendant\u2019s counsel was allowed under the plaintiff\u2019s exception to ask the defendant how much of a family he had, and he testified that he had a wife and five children. The presiding judge told the jury that this evidence.as to the families of the plaintiff and the defendant was admissible in order to enable the jury to get in a general way \u201cwhat sort of a man is on the witness stand,\u201d that it was competent for that purpose and that purpose only. He told them in terms that \u201cLuiz in this case does n\u2019t get any more or any less compensation because he has a wife and children in Portugal. His right to damages is not affected by that feature of the case\u201d and that \u201cFalvey\u2019s responsibility, if he is responsible in your judgment, is no way affected, one cent either way, by the fact that he has a family of children.\u201d As matter of practice it is usual to allow parties to ask such questions. As matter of law it is within the discretion of the judge to allow such testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
