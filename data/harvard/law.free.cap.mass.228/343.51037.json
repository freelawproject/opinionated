Roper, the testatrix, died at Sterling, in this Commonwealth, on November 3, 1903, leaving a will and leaving no heirs at law other than her sister, Sarah B. Jewell. Her will was allowed on November 24, 1903. After making several bequests in the will, she provided that all the income of her property remaining, after the payment of certain legacies, should be paid to her sister, Sarah B. Jewell, during her life, and at the decease of her sister she directed that her estate should be divided and certain legacies paid, concluding with the following provision: \u201cI direct that the remainder of my property if there be any, be divided in equal shares between Willie Wilder, the children of Ella Roper Phillips and the children of the late George S.

Roper, share and share alike.\u201d The life tenant is dead, and, although not stated in the record, we assume that after payment of the legacies a fund remains for distribution under the residuary clause. It is the contention of the appellant that he is entitled to one third of the residue, while the remainder is to go one third to the children of Ella Roper Phillips and one third to the children of George S. Roper as a class; all of whom were living at the death of the testatrix. But this construction cannot be adopted. The intention of the testatrix is free from doubt. The legatees, who are referred to as \u201cchildren\u201d and not as heirs, are to \u201cshare and share alike;\u201d and the naming of their-respective mother and father was only for the purpose of designating the persons who were to take. <em>Weston </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>7 Met. 297, 300. <em>Daggett </em>v. <em>Slack, </em>8 Met. 450, 454. <em>Balcom </em>v. <em>Haynes, </em>14 Allen, 204, 205. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Bowers, </em>120 Mass. 135. The plaintiff is instructed that the residue is to be divided into ten equal parts, or shares of which the appellant is to receive one share and the nine defendants one share each. The decree of the court of probate should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
