Murray, administrator with the will annexed of the estate of Lucido Capozzoli, late of Medford, for leave to sell for the payment of debts and charges of administration certain real estate standing in the name of one Michael Cangiano, having been conveyed to him fraudulently by the plaintiff\u2019s testator while the testator was insolvent and was known to Cangiano to be insolvent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-8\">The Probate Court made a decree authorizing the petitioner to sell at public auction the whole of the parcel of real estate in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-9\">Nichola Fiorentini of Boston filed an appeal from the decree, alleging that he was a creditor of Lucido Capozzoli, late of Med-ford, and interested in his estate. He filed his objections to the decree, which were identically the same as those filed by Michael Cangiano in the case of <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Cangiano, </em>which are printed, <em>ante, </em>on pages 435, 436.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-10\">The petitioner filed a motion to dismiss the appeal.

There is no report of the evidence, and for the reasons stated in that case the decree must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-15\">It therefore becomes unnecessary to consider whether there was evidence tending to show that the appealing party was a creditor of the deceased, and, if he was, whether such creditor, after the estate has been represented insolvent, is a person aggrieved by a decree of the Probate Court granting a license to sell real estate to pay debts and entitled to appeal therefrom to the Supreme Judicial Court, R. L. c. 162, \u00a7 9, as to which see <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Estey, </em>13 Gray, 336; <em>Leyland </em>v. <em>Leyland, </em>186 Mass. 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-16\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
