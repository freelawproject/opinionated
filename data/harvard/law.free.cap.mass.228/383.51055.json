Lurie in fraud of the creditors of the defendant Levy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-14\">On motion of the plaintiff the bill was allowed to be amended by adding as a defendant Yetta Lurie, the wife of Harry L. Lurie, alleged to be the owner of the stock in trade and fixtures under a foreclosure sale of the mortgage alleged to have been made fraudulently by the defendant Levy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-15\">The case first was heard by <em>Wait, </em>J., who made a decree, which was reversed by this court in a decision reported in 221 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>336, on the ground that Yetta Lurie, although ordered to be made a party defendant, had not been made one either by the service of a subpoena or by a voluntary appearance, and that she and one Guttentag, a constable who held the proceeds of the foreclosure sale, were necessary parties and ought to be joined as defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-5\">After the issuing of the rescript in accordance with that decision the plaintiff was allowed on June 4, 1915, to amend his bill by filing a supplemental bill in which Yetta Lurie and Guttentag were joined as additional defendants, and they appeared and filed answers to which the plaintiff filed a replication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-6\">The case was heard by <em>Lawton, </em>J., who filed a memorandum of decision, which concluded as follows: \u201cI am not satisfied that the defendant Katie Levy made the mortgage with intent and purpose to defraud her creditors; still less am I satisfied that that purpose, if it did exist, was known to, or participated in, by the defendant Harry Lurie or the defendant Yetta Lurie. In each case [the other case referred to being a suit by other plaintiffs against the same defendants], the bill is ordered to be dismissed with costs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-7\">Later, after a hearing upon a motion for a final decree, the judge made the following supplemental memorandum:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-8\">\u201cAfter memorandum and upon hearing on the form of the final decree, the plaintiff objects to the allowance of costs and moves that the bill be dismissed .only as to the defendants other than Kate Levy, and that he be allowed to amend his bill as against her into an action at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-9\">\u201cThe order for costs contained in the memorandum is vacated, the motion for leave to amend is denied, and there is to be a final decree dismissing the bill without costs and without prejudice to the right of the plaintiff to bring an action at common law against the defendant Kate Levy.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-10\">\u25a0 By order of the judge a final decree was entered \u201cthat the bill be dismissed without costs.\u201d The defendants appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b410-11\"><em>M.
