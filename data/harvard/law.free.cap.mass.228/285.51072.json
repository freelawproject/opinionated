Lyford, the executor \u00f3f and trustee under the will of Sherman D. Porter, late of Springfield, for instructions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-10\">On appeal to the Supreme Judicial Court the case was heard by <em>Pierce, </em>J. At the hearing, the allegations of fact contained in the bill were admitted to be true, and in addition the parties filed the following statement of agreed facts: \u201c The parties to the above entitled case agree that for the purposes of this case the court may take it to be a fact that Sherman D. Porter and his wife, Elizabeth T. Porter, perished on the 26th day of August, A. D. 1913, in a common disaster caused by the collision of a railroad train with an automobile in which they were riding, and that they died at the same instant of time. The parties further agree that there are sufficient assets in the estate of Sherman D. Porter to pay interest on the several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>legacies of the respective appellants from the date of the death of Elizabeth T. Porter and to leave in addition thereto a considerable \" residue to the town of East Longmeadow and the Springfield Hospital. Ethan Taylor, Maybelle Taylor Allen, Alfred H. Taylor, and the city of Springfield wish it to be understood that their reason for entering into this agreement is that in the opinion of their counsel it is not material in this matter to determine whether Mrs. Porter survived her said husband, but that to prove such fact, i. e., that Mrs. Porter did survive her husband, would necessitate the expenditure of an amount of time and money, that in their counsels\u2019 opinion would be far larger than the amount at issue in this matter would justify.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-5\">At the close of the hearing four of the defendants, as explained in the opinion, asked the single justice to make the following ruling: \u201cOn all the evidence, these defendants are entitled to interest on their respective legacies contained in the clauses of the residuary bequest numbered \u2018thirteenth,\u2019 \u2018fourteenth\u2019 and \u2018fifteenth,\u2019 each amounting to the sum of $15,000 and \u2018thirty-sixth,\u2019 amounting to the sum of $10,000, at the rate of six per cent per annum from August 26, 1913, the date of the death of Elizabeth T. Porter.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-6\">The justice refused to make this ruling and ruled that those defendants were entitled to interest on their respective legacies from one year after the death of Sherman D. Porter. Those defendants alleged exceptions. The proceedings by which two other defendants, who afterwards became parties to the suit, were permitted to join in the exceptions by an order of consolidation and a stipulation of the parties are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b312-7\"><em>W. H. McClintock, </em>for the defendants Florence O. McFetridge and others.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b312-8\"><em>R. A. Bidwell, </em>for the defendant the city of Springfield.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b312-9\"><em>C. H.

Taylor and the city of Springfield, as the appellants Florence O. McFetridge and Helen M. Olmstead did not become parties to the suit until after the allowance of the exceptions. In the motion for leave \u201cto make a late entry of their appeal\u201d they lisp ask that the appeal may be heard by the full court, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>record shows that leave was granted with an order that the \u201cappeals may be consolidated.\u201d R. L. c. 162, \u00a7 13. It resulted from this order that three of the defendants had been heard and their rights determined by the single justice; while as to the other respondents the case remained undecided. But, the question in issue being common to all the appeals, whatever embarrassment might have arisen from this state of the record has been obviated by the stipulation of Florence 0. McFetridge and Helen M. Olmstead filed at the argument before this court, that they were content, to abide by the decision in the pending exceptions. St. 1913, c. 716, \u00a7 2. As we are of opinion that the exceptions must be overruled, nothing appears as to all the defendants why the case then would not be ripe for the entry of a final decree. <em>Prescott </em>v. <em>Prescott, </em>175 Mass. 64, 68. See <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>196 Mass. 592, 594; <em>McCusker </em>v. <em>Geiger, </em>195 Mass. 46, 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">By his will which has been duly proved and allowed, the testator, after making several legacies, provided in part as follows: \u201cThird: All the rest and residue of my estate, real, personal or of whatever nature and wherever located, I give, devise and bequeath to my said wife in trust for the following purposes, namely:</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\u201c 1st. To pay out of the income thereof the sum of Twenty-five ($25.00) Dollars per month to the said ICittie Porter Spellman, during the lifetime of my said wife, unless the said Kittie Porter Spellman should die before my wife, and in such case during the lifetime of the said Kittie Porter Spellman.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">\u201c2nd. To pay out of the income thereof the sum of Twenty-five ($25.00) Dollars per month to the said Libbie Porter Davis, during the lifetime of my said wife, unless the said Libbie Porter Davis should die before my said wife, and in such case during the lifetime of the said Libbie Porter Davis.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">\u201c3rd. To have and enjoy all the remaining use income and improvement thereof herself, during her life with full power to use and expend the same for such purposes as she may choose. I also authorize and empower her to sell any or all of said trust estate, whether real or personal or of whatever nature (except such as may be herein specifically bequeathed in remainder after her death either at public auction or private sale, and in such manner and at such time or times and as a whole or in such portions as she may think best, for the purpose of reinvestment and to invest and reinvest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>the proceeds at her discretion, and to execute, acknowledge and deliver such instruments as may be proper to transfer the property sold or in connection with such transfer or sale and no purchaser to be obliged to see to the application of the purchase money. My executors are authorized to transfer to her any or all of the personal property which she may be entitled to receive under this trust in the form in which I leave it invested instead of converting it into cash, and it is my will that she be at liberty to retain any of the investments in that form or (except in the case of such property as may be specifically bequeathed in remainder after her death) to invest in a different manner at her discretion, and that she shall not be limited to such investments as are ordinarily required in the case of trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u201cPayment or transfer to her of the property to which she is. entitled under this trust and her receipt therefor shall be a complete discharge of my executors, and I request that she be exempt from furnishing any surety or sureties upon her bond as trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u201cFourth: From and after the death of my said wife, I give, bequeath and devise the remainder of my property, real, personal and of every description to Edwin F. Lyford of said Springfield, his heirs and assigns in trust for the following purposes however, namely:\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\u201cThirteenth: To pay to the said Ethan Taylor, Fifteen Thousand ($15,000.00) Dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">\u201cFourteenth: To pay to the said Maybelle Taylor Allen, Fifteen Thousand ($15,000.00) Dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">\u201cFifteenth: To pay to the said Alfred H. Taylor, Fifteen Thousand ($15,000.00) Dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">\u201cTwenty-ninth: To pay to the Springfield Hospital, Ten Thousand ($10,000.00) Dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">\u201cThirty-sixth: To pay to the City of Springfield, Massachusetts, the sum of Ten Thousand ($10,000.00) Dollars, to be expended by it on public parks. Payment of said sum by my trustee to the Treasurer for the time being of said City, and his receipt therefor, shall be a complete discharge of my trustee so far as this item of his trust is concerned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">The third clause gives his wife, if living at his death, the entire income for life of the residue of his estate, with the exception of the bequests to Kittie Porter Spellman and Libbie Porter Davis, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>at her death the equitable remainders would become operative. <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Choate, </em>100 Mass. 343. <em>McCarty </em>v. <em>Cosgrove, </em>101 Mass. 124,</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">But as agreed by the parties the testator and his wife \u201cdied at the same instant of time \u201d by reason of \u201cthe collision of a railroad train with an automobile in which they were riding.\u201d The will of course speaks from the testator\u2019s death, and, his wife not having survived him and there being no tenant in whom the estate could vest in title and possession, the life estate created for her benefit lapsed and the legatees in remainder, all of whom were living at his death, became entitled to their respective legacies. <em>Prescott </em>v. <em>Prescott, </em>7 Met. 141. <em>Dow </em>v. <em>Boyle, </em>103 Mass. 489. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>197 Mass. 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The interposition of a trustee leaves the defendants in legal effect as if the testator had directed payment to be made by his executor, <em>Claflin </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>202 Mass. 157, 159, <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Cobe, </em>208 Mass. 260, 263, 264, <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>Bachelder, </em>223 Mass. 329, and the usual rule, that an executor is not chargeable with interest on pecuniary legacies until the expiration of one year from the testator\u2019s death, is to be applied. <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>106 Mass. 586. See R. L. c. 141, \u00a7\u00a7 19, 20, as amended by Sts. 1914, c. 699, \u00a7 8; 1915, c. 151, \u00a7\u00a7 1,2. The single justice accordingly rightly refused to rule, that, \u201cOn all the evidence, these defendants are entitled to interest on their respective legacies contained in the clauses of the residuary bequest numbered \u2018thirteenth,\u2019 \u2018fourteenth,\u2019 and \u2018fifteenth,\u2019 (each amounting to the sum of $15,000.00,) and \u2018thirty-sixth\u2019 amounting to the sum of $10,000, at the- rate of six per cent per annum from August 26, 1913, the date of the death of Elizabeth T. Porter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
