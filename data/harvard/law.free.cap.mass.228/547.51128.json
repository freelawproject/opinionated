The evidence for the Commonwealth is described in the opinion. The defendant offered no evidence and asked the judge to order a verdict of not guilty. This the judge refused to do. The defendant then asked the judge to make five rulings, of which the judge made the second and fourth and also the fifth with a certain modification. The others were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-6\">\u201c1.

And, evidence having been introduced from which the jury could find \u2022that the defendant wage earner had in his house a half barrel of sterling ale in which there was a faucet and an empty barrel which had contained ale and thirty-two packages, each of which contained sixteen half pint bottles of whiskey, and that no empty bottles were to be found about the premises, the judge rightly declined to order a verdict for the defendant or to direct an acquittal. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dolan, </em>121 Mass. 374. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Atkins, </em>136 Mass. 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-13\">The instructions, which in substance embodied all the defendant\u2019s requests except the first and third, carefully and sufficiently guarded the defendant\u2019s rights, and the jury must have been satis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>fled that the defendant kept the liquors with the intent of making illegal sales. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>162 Mass. 402. The judge for reasons previously stated could not have given the first request that on all the evidence the defendant was entitled to an acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The third request, that there is no evidence that the defendant illegally exposed any liquors for sale, also was inappropriate. While the R. L. c. 100, \u00a7 1, makes it a criminal offence for any person to sell or expose or keep for sale spirituous or intoxicating liquors unless duly licensed, and the complaint charges that the defendant \u201cdid expose and keep for sale intoxicating liquors,\u201d proof of keeping with intent to sell was sufficient to sustain a conviction. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Atkins, </em>136 Mass. 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
