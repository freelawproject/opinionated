J., Braley, DeCourcy, &amp; Pierce, JJ.</p>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b467-8\"><em>Equity Pleading and Practice, </em>Interlocutory decree, Master\u2019s report: exceptions to, motion to recommit. <em>Equity Jurisdiction, </em>To remove cloud from title. <em>Tax, </em>Sale for non-payment. <em>Deed, </em>Validity. <em>Fraud, </em>As against creditors.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b467-9\">In a suit in equity a master made a report in favor of the plaintiff, to which the defendant filed exceptions based on the refusal of the master to make certain findings of fact requested by him, and the trial judge made an interlocutory decree, which without referring to the exceptions ordered that the report of the master be confirmed. The defendant appealed from this decree. <em>Held </em>that, although the decree should have stated that the defendant\u2019s exceptions were overruled, this informality was not material because no exceptions to a master\u2019s refusal to make findings of fact can be sustained.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b467-10\">In the same case the defendant before the making of the interlocutory decree had filed a motion to recommit the report to the master for amendment.. No formal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>order was made upon the motion to recommit. <em>Held, </em>that no such order was required, as the motion to recommit necessarily was denied by the interlocutory decree confirming the master\u2019s report.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b468-5\">One.who as a devisee is seised of real estate, of which he is in possession and control, can maintain a suit in equity to remove from his title a cloud created by an invalid tax sale and a deed given thereunder.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b468-6\">A conveyance of real estate can be avoided on the ground that it was made in fraud of creditors only by a creditor or by one who has the rights of a creditor.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b468-7\">Where a recital in a tax collector\u2019s deed, given in pursuance of a sale for non-payment of taxes, states that a demand was made on a certain former owner of the land for payment of the tax, and it is shown that at the time of such alleged demand the former owner was dead and was known to be dead by the person who procured the making of the tax sale, and where the tax collector had constructive notice of the death of the delinquent taxpayer by the probate records of the admission of his will to probate and of the appointment of an executrix, it is plain that \u201cthe name of the person on whom the demand for the tax was made\u201d was not inserted in the deed as required by R. L. c. 13, \u00a7 43, and that the deed is absolutely void.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-8\">Bill m equity, filed in the Superior Court on July 2, 1915, by the owner of a parcel of land with the buildings thereon in the part of Quincy called West Quincy, to remove from the plaintiff\u2019s title a cloud created by a certain tax sale, alleged to be invalid, and by a deed given thereunder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-9\">The case was referred to a master, who filed a report, in which he found the facts that are stated in the opinion. He found and ruled that the tax title under which the defendant claimed, and which was a cloud on the plaintiff\u2019s title, was invalid, and that the plaintiff was entitled to a decree relieving his title from the incumbrance. He also found that, if the court should determine that the tax deed was valid, the plaintiff was entitled to redeem the premises from it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-10\">The defendant filed exceptions to the master\u2019s report and also filed a motion that the report be recommitted to the master for amendment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-11\">The case was heard by <em>Raymond, </em>J., who made an interlocutory decree, which, without mentioning the exceptions, ordered that the report of the master be confirmed. The defendant appealed from this interlocutory decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-12\">Later the case was heard further by <em>Raymond, </em>J., upon the master\u2019s report and by order of the judge a final decree was entered in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant appealed from the final decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b469-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number><em>C. E. Fuller, </em>defendant, <em>pro se.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b469-3\"><em>C. E. Haywood, </em>for the plaintiff, was stopped by the court.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b469-4\">Braley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJ\">The interlocutory decree confirming the report should have recited that the exceptions to the report were overruled, but the omission is of no material consequence as exceptions do not lie to a master\u2019s refusal to make findings of fact as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The report having been confirmed, the motion to recommit, although not appearing by the record to have been formally disposed of, was necessarily denied by the interlocutory decree, and the only question for decision is whether the final decree from which the defendant appealed is in accordance with the master\u2019s report and the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The defendant claims title to the land described in the bill, under a sale for non-payment of taxes which the plaintiff alleges is invalid, and, the tax deed having been recorded, it is a cloud upon the plaintiff\u2019s title. The evidence is not reported, and the master\u2019s findings on all questions of fact are conclusive. It appears from the report that at the date of filing the bill the plaintiff was seised of the premises under a conveyance from his mother, who derived title under the will of her husband, duly admitted to probate, and it is found expressly that since June 21,1913, he has been in possession and control of the property. It is plain without further discussion that he can maintain the suit for the purpose of clearing the title. The defendant contends that the plaintiff has been guilty of such unconscionable conduct as to deprive him of any standing in a court of equity. But it is unnecessary to recite the master\u2019s findings which show, not only the plaintiff\u2019s good faith, but such conduct of the defendant as to raise doubts whether he did not deliberately attempt to overreach his mother, brother and sisters in the settlement of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">It further is found on ample facts that the defendant\u2019s next contention, that the plaintiff acquired title through fraud and undue influence practiced upon his mother, is without foundation, and, whether her deed to the plaintiff was in fraud of creditors, is a defence not open to the defendant, to whom neither she nor her husband is shown to have been indebted.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">The validity of the collector\u2019s deed now becomes the decisive inquiry. The tax was assessed for the year 1907. The deed recites that on January 20, 1908, a summons was served on Frederick J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Fuller, and on May 8, 1908, a demand was made on him for payment of the tax. But, as the testator died on November 13, 1907, these recitals are false, and his son the defendant, who is not shown to have been illiterate, and by whom as the master finds the tax sale was procured to be made, must be deemed to have known of their falsity. The collector also was charged with constructive notice of the probate records which show the delinquent taxpayer\u2019s death, the admission of his will to probate and the appointment of the executrix. <em>Conners </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>209 Mass. 111, 119. A demand upon the resident owner was necessary. R. L. c. 13, \u00a7 14, now St. 1909, c. 490, Part II. <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Holston, </em>185 Mass. 137. It was not made on the devisee or served on her \u201cin the manner required by law for the service of subpoenas upon witnesses in civil cases.\u201d R. L. c. 13, \u00a7\u00a7 13, 53. If the collector\u2019s statement that he demanded payment of the decedent need not be further characterized, it is certain that the course taken resulted in delivering a deed wherein \u201cthe name of the person on whom the demand for the tax was made\u201d has never been inserted as required by R. L. c. 13, \u00a7 43. The failure of compliance by the collector with these precedent conditions renders the deed absolutely void. <em>Charland </em>v. <em>Home for Aged Women, </em>204 Mass. 563, 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\">The plaintiff accordingly is entitled to relief in equity, and the decree is affirmed with costs of the appeal. <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>188 Mass. 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
