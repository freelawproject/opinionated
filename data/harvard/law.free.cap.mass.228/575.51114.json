Writ dated March 19, 1917.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-3\">In the first case the respondent the Bay State Street Railway Company demurred to the petition and assigned the following causes for demurrer:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-4\">\"1. That said petition sets forth no ruling or order of the public service commission which is unlawful.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-5\">\u201c2.

That the said commutation rate in Fall River if enforced as the petitioners seek to have it does not secure to the respondent a reasonable return for the service rendered and deprives it of its property without due process of law and denies to it the equal protection of the law in contravention of articles 10 and 12 of the Declaration of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-8\">The first case was heard upon the demurrer of the respondent the Bay State Street Railway Company by <em>Loring, </em>J., who made a final decree sustaining the demurrer and ordering that the petition be dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-9\">The action of contract was heard in the Superior Court by <em>Morton, </em>J., without a jury. An agreed statement of facts was submitted as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-10\">The board of aldermen of the city of Fall River on October 21, 1895, passed the order described in the above statement. At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>time of the order, and at the time of the execution by the respondent corporation of the bond mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, the regular fare\u2018duly established in and for the city of Fall River was five cents. After the order of October 21,1895, the Globe Street Railway Company put in operation its cars over the location therein named, and the cars have continued to be operated over such location by the Globe Street Railway Company and its successor, the Bay State Street Railway Company, up to the present time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-3\">Since St. 1911, c. 552, went into effect, the plaintiff has been obliged to pay $50 to keep in repair the roadway on said bridge and it has not been reimbursed for said sum. Since the enactment of St. 1898, c. 578, and up to the enactment of St. 1911, c. 552, the plaintiff paid all the expense of repairing the roadway of the bridge, and since the enactment of said chapter 552 the defendant has paid all such expense except the $50 above referred to. This location over the Slade\u2019s Ferry Bridge was not the first location in Fail River which was granted to the Globe Street Railway Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-4\">The defendant, Bay State Street Railway Company, has succeeded to the franchises, rights and obligations of the Globe Street Railway Company, which latter road was consolidated with the Brockton Street Railway Company on January 19, 1901, and was consolidated with the defendant on July 1, 1911.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-5\">On March 15, 1917, the defendant discontinued the sale of six tickets for twenty-five cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-6\">The plaintiff offered to prove that the officials and agents of the city of Fall River patronized the defendant street railway company and in the year 1915 the city purchased said four and one sixth cent tickets to the amount of $2,597.85, and in the year 1916 purchased said tickets to the amount of $2,547.25.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-7\">The defendant objected to the admission of this evidence but, if admissible, agreed that the facts were as stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-8\">The judge found the facts to be as stated in the agreed statement of facts and excluded the evidence contained in the plaintiff\u2019s offer of proof. He found for the defendant and, at the request of the parties, reported all questions of law arising upon the facts as found by him and the offer of proof for determination by this court, with a stipulation that, if his decision was right, judgment should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>be entered for the defendant, and that, if his decision was wrong, the case should be remanded to the Superior Court for such further proceedings as this court might direct.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b604-3\"><em>A.

Pub. Sts. c. 113, \u00a7 7. R. L. c. 112, \u00a7 11. <em>Mayor &amp; Aldermen of Worcester </em>v. <em>Worcester Consolidated Street Railway, </em>192 Mass. 106, 113, 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">But, as pointed out in <em>Springfield </em>v. <em>Springfield Street Railway, </em>182 Mass. 41, the Legislature may modify or annul a location of this nature without violation of any constitutional provision. By St. of 1898, c. 578, \u00a7 11, street railways were relieved \u201cfrom all obligation thereafter to keep any portion of the surface material of streets, roads and bridges in repair, unless the obligation so to do had been imposed in a grant of an original location, which the statute defined to mean the first location granted to the company in the city or town as to whose streets, roads or bridges there might be a question.\u201d <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Worcester Consolidated Street Railway, </em>182 Mass. 49, 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The agreed facts show that the location in question was not the first or original location, and neither the company nor its successor was required after the passage of the statute to reimburse the plaintiff city for expenditures in making repairs. The city however contends that the St. of 1911, c. 552, superseded the St. of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>1898, c. 578, \u00a7 11, by expressly requiring the company and its successors to make such repairs as might be needed. The St. of 1911, c. 552, amends St. of 1910, c. 654, \u00a7 6, and when the original and amendatory acts are read in conjunction it is manifest that the St. of 1910, c. 654, \u00a7 1, provides solely for \u201cthe reconstruction of the joint railroad and highway bridge, commonly known as Slade\u2019s Ferry Bridge, . . . the old Colony Railroad Company, its successors or assigns, shall reconstruct said Slade\u2019s Ferry Bridge and locate the same at a point northerly thereof, but not exceeding one hundred feet therefrom, in the manner hereinafter stated. . . . The said reconstructed bridge'shall be of sufficient width to provide two tracks for the railroad part and also two tracks for street railways on the highway part so that two street cars may conveniently meet and pass each other thereon while going in opposite directions; and due provision shall be made for the acommodation of foot passengers.\u201d It is only upon completion of the new bridge authorized by the statute that \u00a7 6 as amended becomes operative, and the old bridge built under St. 1872, c. 295, is to be discontinued for \u201chighway and railroad purposes.\u201d It is not contended that the new bridge has been built, with the approaches and ways, and opened for use as provided in St. 1910, c. 654, -as amended, which contains no repeal of St. 1906, c. 463, Part III, \u00a7 79, recodifying R. L. c. 112, \u00a7 44, which re-enacted St. 1898, c. 578, \u00a7 11. And the St. of 1911, c. 552, is inapplicable, that \"Any street railway company owning the tracks on- the highway part of the old Slade\u2019s Ferry Bridge, shall have the right to lay double tracks on the highway part of said reconstructed bridge and to connect its tracks with the same on both sides of the river . . . .subject, however, to all the conditions as to fares and other matters mentioned in the grant of location to the Globe Street Railway Company by the board of aldermen of the city of Fall River ... on the old Slade\u2019s Ferry Bridge, which are hereby approved and confirmed; and all successors or assigns of said Globe Street Railway Company shall be bound by and subject to the said conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-3\">The grant of location contained the further condition, the performance of which also was secured by the bond, that the railway company will sell six tickets for a sum not exceeding twenty-five cents, \u201ceach of which tickets shall entitle a passenger to one ride <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>\u25a0over said Company\u2019s lines, in this city, on as favorable conditions as their passengers are now carried. The fares for passengers without tickets are not to be affected by the above rate for tickets.\u201d And this provision has not been complied with, by the company since March 15, 1917. But the St. of 1913, c. 784, with certain exceptions not applicable in the present case placed the subject of fares on all street railways under the exclusive control of the public service commission. It provides in \u00a7 29 that \"This act shall be deemed and construed as a remedial act and in enlargement and extension of all previous acts and existing laws conferring upon or vesting in the commission any jurisdiction, powers or discretion with respect to any subject or matter treated in this act,\u201d and \"... all acts and parts of acts which would in any way limit or prevent the exercise to the fullest extent of any of the jurisdiction, powers, authority or discretion delegated herein to the com mis-* sion are hereby repealed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-3\">' The statute being constitutional and the powers of the commission plenary over the regulation and establishment of fares on street railways, independently of whatever conditions may have been imposed in antecedent grants of location by selectmen of towns or municipal boards, <em>Arlington Board of Survey </em>v. <em>Bay State Street Railway, </em>224 Mass. 463, 469, the decision under which the \"four and one sixth cent ticket sold in strips of six tickets for twenty-five cents in the City of Fall River\u201d was withdrawn and the refusals to give the rulings requested by the plaintiff disclose no errors of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">If from the allegations of the petition, admitted by the demurrer, it is to be assumed that an order was entered in conformity with the decision, the inquiry under St. 1913, c. 784, \u00a7\u00a7 20, 21, whether an increase of fare is necessary \u201cin order to obtain a reasonable compensation for the service rendered,\u201d is primarily a question of fact. It is not limited to any particular part of the system which if operated by itself might be found to be more than self sustaining. And the question whether the company should be permitted to withdraw the commutation tickets called for the exercise of the sound discretion and judgment of the commission, based on the evidence of the company\u2019s financial condition, and ability to serve efficiently the public dependent upon the maintenance of its entire system of intercommunication and transportation. We are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>unable to perceive on the record before us any conclusions of fact, in so far as conclusions of fact are involved, which were unlawful. It is only where \u201cany rulings or orders of the commission . . . are unlawful\u201d that this court in equity can \u201cannul, modify or amend\u201d them \u201cto the extent only of such unlawfulness.\u201d St. 1913, c. 784, \u00a7 27. <em>Bulkeley </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>216 Mass. 432, 433. The plaintiff, on whom the burden rests, having failed to show reversible error in either the suit in equity or the action at law, the result is that in the first case the decree of the single justice sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the bill should be affirmed with costs of the appeal, and in the second case judgment is to be entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-3\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
