It appeared further that before the sale the plaintiff had agreed orally that, if the defendant bought the car, he would guarantee it for a year, that is, \u201ckeep it in repair for a year.\u201d The defendant contended that this was a separate collateral agreement made as an inducement to the defendant to buy the car. <em>Held, </em>that the oral agreement purported to be a part of the bargain of sale and was not a mere inducement to enter into the sale, and that therefore the evidence concerning it should have been excluded and, having been admitted, could not be considered, the rights of the parties being defined by their agreement in writing.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-12\">Contract for labor performed and materials furnished in repairing a motor car belonging to the defendant which he previously had bought from the plaintiff as a second-hand car.

The judge submitted the case to the jury with the understanding and agreement of the parties that, if the finding of the jury was not for the full amount of the claim as set out in the declaration, namely, $509.53, the case was to be reported to this court for determination, with the further understanding that, if the evidence to prove the so called guaranty should have been excluded, judgment was to be entered for the plaintiff in the sum of $509.53.

A copy of this agreement is printed above. At the time of the execution of the agreement the defendant paid the plaintiff the agreed price and the motor car was delivered two days afterwards. After the car had been delivered to the defendant and used by him, certain repairs becoming necessary, it was sent to the repair department of the plaintiff and the repairs were made. The defendant admitted that the charges in the items enumerated in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration were fair and reasonable but contended that the greater part thereof were covered by a contemporaneous oral agreement and guaranty of the plaintiff to keep the car in repair for one year from the date of purchase free of charge to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">It is the contention of the defendant that the oral agreement was collateral to the principal agreement and operated as an inducement for entering into it. Subject to the exception of the plaintiff, as evidence to prove the so called guaranty, the defendant was permitted to testify that the substance of the numerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>interviews was as follows: At a conversation at the defendant\u2019s house, \"I said I did n\u2019t want a second hand car because they were always in the repair shop. . . . He said,\u2018This had been thoroughly overhauled . . . and if I bought it they would guarantee it for a year.\u2019\u201d To the question, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d the defendant answered, \u201cKeep it in repair for a year.\u201d At an interview at the defendant\u2019s office, \u201cI told him the car looked good, but I could not make up my mind to have a second hand car. . . . We went over the same conversation as the day before. He said there would not be anything like that in this car, that the car would be just as good as new, all the worn places thoroughly overhauled and they would guarantee it to me for a year.\u201d A third conversation was over the telephone: \u201cHe said, \u2018How do you feel about the car,\u2019 or something like that. I said, \u2018If this car as you say is thoroughly overhauled and you will guarantee it for a year, I will give\" $1,800 for it.\u2019 He said, \u2018All right. . . . We will accept your offer\u2019 and I told him I would be down. I think that was in the forenoon of December 14.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The admitted evidence tends to prove that at the time of the making of the final agreement of sale a further agreement was made that the car would be just as good as new, all the worn places thoroughly overhauled and that the plaintiff would guarantee it for a year. The writing signed by the parties appears on its face to be a complete contract, embracing all the particul\u00e1rs necessary to make a perfect agreement and designed to express the whole arrangement between the parties. The evidence therefore should have been excluded unless the oral agreement relates to a subject independent of, distinct from, and collateral to the sale of the motor car. <em>Dutton </em>v. <em>Gerrish, </em>9 Cush. 89. <em>Fitz </em>v. <em>Comey, </em>118 Mass. 100. <em>Puffer Manuf. Co. </em>v. <em>Krum, </em>210 Mass. 211, 213. <em>Glackin </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>226 Mass. 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">We are of opinion that the oral agreement directly touched and concerned the use and enjoyment of the thing sold, that it was not a mere inducement for entering into the sale, that it was a part of the bargain of sale, and was not independent of or collateral to that sale. The case at bar cannot be distinguished in principle from <em>Brigham </em>v. <em>Rogers, 17 </em>Mass. 571, wherein it was held that where an estate was demised by lease, no action lay on a paroi promise made by the lessor at the time of executing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>lease, that the water on the premises demised would be good, and that there would be enough of it, and if not that he would make it so. This decision was approved in <em>Durkin </em>v. <em>Cobleigh, </em>156 Mass. 108; <em>Spear </em>v. <em>Hardon, </em>215 Mass. 89; <em>Naumberg </em>v. <em>Young, </em>15 Vroom, 331, 344; <em>Thompson Foundry &amp; Machine Co. </em>v. <em>Glass, </em>136 Ala. 648, 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">It follows that the evidence should have been excluded, and that judgment should be entered for the plaintiff in the sum of $509.53 in accordance with the terms of the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
