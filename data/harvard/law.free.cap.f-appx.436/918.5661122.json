After careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-15\">Regarding the first issue, Green argues that the district court erroneously analyzed his ineffective assistance of counsel claim under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), instead of under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). He further argues that had the district court applied the <em>Strickland </em>test, it would have found that his counsel was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-16\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition, but give deference to the state court\u2019s decision on the merits of a claim. <em>Davis v. Jones, </em>506 F.3d 1325, 1331 (11th Cir.2007). Federal courts may not grant habeas relief on claims previously adjudicated on the merits in a state court unless the state court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Davis, </em>506 F.3d at 1331. Furthermore, \u201ca determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct,\u201d and the petitioner \u201cshall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1); <em>Smith v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Com., </em>572 F.3d 1327, 1333 (11th Cir.2009). However, when it is not clear whether deference applies, we may deny a \u00a7 2254 petition by reviewing the claim <em>de novo, </em>as the \u201cpetitioner will not be entitled to a writ of habeas corpus if his or her claim is rejected on <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>Berghuis v. Thompkins, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2250, 2265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1098 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">Here, the record of the state court proceedings does not make it entirely clear on what grounds the state court denied Green\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim. However, we need not decide whether \u00a7 2254(d) deference applies to the state court\u2019s decision because we conclude that Green\u2019s claim fails even under <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See id. </em>Specifically, the record supports affirmance on the ground that Green failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">To show a violation of the right to effective assistance of counsel, a defendant must establish two elements: \u201cFirst, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. The standard for measuring attorney performance is whether counsel acted reasonably \u201cunder prevailing professional norms,\u201d and \u201ca court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688-89, 104 S.Ct. at 2065 (quotation marks omitted). \u201cSecond, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. Generally, to establish prejudice, a defendant must show a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court has explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-11\">[i]n making this determination, a court hearing an ineffectiveness claim must consider the totality of the evidence before the judge or jury.... Some errors will have had a pervasive effect on the inferences to be drawn from the evidence, altering the entire evidentiary picture, and some will have had an isolated, trivial effect. Moreover, a verdict or conclusion only weakly supported by the record is more likely to have been affected by errors than one with overwhelming record support.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b942-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 695-96, 104 S.Ct. at 2069. \u201cBecause a petitioner\u2019s failure to show either deficient performance or prejudice is fatal to a <em>Strickland </em>claim, a court need not address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>both <em>Strickland </em>prongs if the petitioner fails to satisfy either of them.\u201d <em>Kokal v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>623 F.3d 1331, 1344 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Green was convicted of an armed robbery and the carjacking of a white Cadillac DeVille between 11:30 p.m. and 11:40 p.m. on October 30, 2001, and of a second armed robbery shortly after midnight that same night. The state introduced evidence that police officers tracked phone calls placed from a cell phone stolen from a victim during the second robbery. Those calls led police to monitor a residence at which Green was observed driving the stolen Cadillac the following evening. Green and the other occupants of the car were in possession of items stolen during the second robbery, as well as pawn slips for other items matching those stolen during that robbery. An inventory search of the car revealed further items stolen during the second robbery. Green agreed to speak with officers following his arrest. He admitted committing the second robbery and led the police to additional property stolen during that robbery. Later, at the police station, Green again admitted to committing the second robbery, and also confessed, on tape, to the carjacking. A victim of the second robbery identified Green as the robber.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">At trial, Green testified that he found the white Cadillac abandoned at a dump, with the keys in the ignition, at about 2 a.m. on the night of the robberies. He stated that his confessions were coerced by force and threats of force, and that his statements to police were made while he was under the influence of cocaine and ecstacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">While deliberating, the jury asked the following question: \u201cDoes the State have the \u2018times\u2019 the cell phone was used after the alleged second robbery?\u201d The following exchange then took place between the trial court, defense counsel (Mr. Gaer), and the prosecutors (Ms. Uriarte and Ms. Mato):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-9\">MR. GAER: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m wondering if it was testified to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-10\">MS. URIARTE: It wasn\u2019t testified to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-11\">MR. GAER: I don\u2019t think.it was testified to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-12\">THE COURT: I think the answer is no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-13\">MS. MATO: Can you repeat the question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-14\">MS. URIARTE: It\u2019s not that, it\u2019s not no. It was not testified to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-15\">THE COURT: That is no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-16\">MS. MATO: We have the times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-17\">THE COURT: Let me read it again. Does the state have the, quote, times, unquote, the cell phone was used after the alleged second robbery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-18\">The answer plain and simple is no unless my \u2014 my recollection\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-19\">MS. MATO: There is no testimony to the times basically.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-20\">THE COURT: That is what I thought. So I\u2019m going to write no.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b943-21\">Green argues that the undisclosed cell phone records would have been consistent with his trial testimony that he found the vehicle at about 2 a.m. on the night of the robberies, and his counsel was deficient for failing to move for a mistrial so that the state could produce those records. He further argues that he was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s deficiency because the jury inquired about the phone records and was therefore at least considering whether his version of events was accurate. Thus, Green argues, with the phone records cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>roborating his testimony, it is reasonable to conclude that the jury would have acquitted him. We disagree. Even assuming that the state had suppressed or otherwise failed to disclose the times of the phone calls, we conclude that Green cannot establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim because he cannot satisfy <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">We recognize that Green\u2019s trial counsel, if equipped with this evidence, might have attempted to argue to the jury that it was implausible that Green would come into possession of the phone during the second robbery just after midnight, but would then wait two hours before placing any calls from that phone. But we cannot say that there is a \u201creasonable probability that ... the result of the proceeding would have been different\u201d if counsel had been able to present this argument to the jury. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. The evidence against Green was overwhelming. It included a victim\u2019s positive identification of Green as the robber, police testimony about Green being found with the stolen property, and Green\u2019s taped confessions. In light of this evidence, and given the very limited probative value, if any, of the times of the phone calls, we conclude that Green cannot satisfy <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice prong. <em>See id. </em>at 695-96, 104 S.Ct. at 2069 (explaining that some errors will have only \u201can isolated, trivial effect,\u201d and that \u201ca verdict ... only weakly supported by the record is more likely to have been affected by errors than one with overwhelming record support\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">Our conclusion might be different if this evidence would contradict or undermine the state\u2019s evidence. But, here, there was no contention that Green had made the phone calls earlier, or at any particular time, and the prosecution did not attempt to suggest that the times of the phone calls contradicted Green\u2019s story. The fact that a piece of potential evidence \u2014 such as the times the phone calls were made \u2014 is not incriminating, does not necessarily mean that the evidence is exculpatory. In this case, the supposedly suppressed evidence would have at best \u201can isolated, trivial effect,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 695-96, 104 S.Ct. at 2069, and the withholding of it would not be sufficient to undermine our confidence in the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068 (\u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">For these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Green\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b941-12\">. <em>\"Pro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v.

Thus, \"the standards governing the sufficiency of habeas corpus petitions are less stringent when the petition is drafted <em>pro se </em>and without the aid of counsel.\u201d <em>Holsomback v.
