On appeal, Botes argues that: (1) we have jurisdiction to review this decision despite the restrictions in Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), because the only issue on appeal is whether he is an aggravated felon; and (2) the BIA erred in denying his motion to reconsider because his 12-month sentence, which included periods of both confinement and probation, was not a term of imprisonment of at least one year. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"A_OP\">We review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>sua sponte. Hernandez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1336, 1339 (11th Cir.2008). We lack jurisdiction to review a final order of removal against an alien who is removable because he committed an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). <em>Id. </em>(discussing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C)). However, we retain jurisdiction to determine whether a conviction constitutes an aggravated felony. <em>Id. </em>We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>Scheerer v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1244, 1252 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cTo the extent that the BIA\u2019s decisions were based on a legal determination,\u201d we review <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-13\">An alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony after being admitted to the United States is removable. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). An aggravated felony is a crime of violence for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). A term of imprisonment includes \u201cthe period of incarceration or confinement ordered by a court of law regardless of any suspension of the imposition or execution of that imprisonment or sentence in whole or in part.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(B). Thus, a term of imprisonment includes \u201call parts of a sentence of imprisonment from which the sentencing court excuses the defendant, even if the court itself follows state-law usage and describes the excuse with a word other than \u2018suspend.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Ayala-Gomez, </em>255 F.3d 1314, 1319 (11th Cir.2001) (interpreting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(B)). In <em>Ayalcir-Gomez, </em>the alien had been sentenced to five years\u2019 confinement, but upon service of eight months of the sentence, the alien could serve the remainder of the sentence on probation. <em>Id. </em>at 1316-17. We held that the alien\u2019s term of imprisonment was five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>years, not eight months, because the term of imprisonment included the part of the sentence probated under state law. <em>Id. </em>at 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"Akp\">As an initial matter, the only issue Botes raises on appeal is whether he committed an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Therefore, we have jurisdiction to consider whether the BIA erred in denying his motion to reconsider. <em>See Hernandez, </em>513 F.3d at 1339.</p>\n<p id=\"Aj5b\">Nevertheless, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Botes\u2019s motion to reconsider because it correctly determined that Botes had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of at least one year. Like the alien in <em>Ayala-Gomez, </em>Botes was sentenced to at least one year. <em>See </em>255 F.3d at 1316. Additionally, both Botes and the alien in <em>Ayala-Gomez </em>were allowed to serve less than a year in confinement with the remainder of their sentences being served on probation. <em>See id. </em>at 1316 \u2014 17.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, like the alien in <em>Ayala-Gomez, </em>the part of Botes\u2019s sentence that was \u201cprobated under Georgia law\u201d was part of his term of imprisonment even though the sentencing court did not describe its sentence as \u201csuspended.\u201d <em>Ayala-Gomez, </em>255 F.3d at 1319. Finally, Botes\u2019s argument that the Order to Clarify Sentence modified his sentence and caused his term of imprisonment to be less than one year is meritless. According to the Order to Clarify Sentence, Botes\u2019s sentence was 12 months, of which 60 days had to be served in custody and of which 10 months could be served on probation. This sentence does not differ from the sentence imposed in his original sentencing order, which was also a 12-month sentence, of which 60 days was to be served in custody and of which the remaining 10 months _ could be served on probation. Therefore, Botes was convicted of an aggravated felony because he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of at least one year, and we deny his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"A_bg\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Ayd\">. Unlike the alien in <em>United States v. Guzman-Bera, </em>Botes did not receive a sentence of direct probation because he was not sentenced only to 10 months\u2019 probation. <em>See </em>216 F.3d 1019, 1021 (11th Cir.2000). Rather, Botes was sentenced to a 12-month sentence, of which he was permitted to serve 10 months on probation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
