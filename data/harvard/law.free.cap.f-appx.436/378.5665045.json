The district court sentenced Jimenez to a term of life in prison to be followed by ten years of supervised release. He claims that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-17\">Jimenez moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the government\u2019s casein-chief, but he failed to renew the motion at the close of all evidence. Therefore, our review is limited to whether there has been a \u201cmanifest miscarriage of justice,\u201d which occurs only when (1) the record is devoid of evidence of guilt or (2) the evidence on a key element of the offense is so tenuous that a conviction would shock the conscience. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>576 F.3d 528, 529-30 <em>&amp; </em>n. 2 (5th Cir.) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 652, 175 L.Ed.2d 482 (2009); <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Martinez, </em>480 F.3d 303, 307 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-24\">Jimenez contends that the evidence was insufficient for the jury to conclude that he knew about and willfully participated in the conspiracy. At trial, several admitted members of the conspiracy expressly identified Jimenez as a participant and offered corroborating testimony about his involvement. Testifying officials who conducted surveillance on Jimenez interpreted recorded phone conversations and meetings that, suggested his involvement in the conspiracy. Additionally, an officer who participated in an attempt to purchase cocaine from Jimenez testified before the jury about her experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-25\">As the record contains direct and circumstantial evidence of Jimenez\u2019s involvement in the drug conspiracy, he has failed to demonstrate that the record is devoid of evidence of his guilt or that the evidence on a key element of his offense is so tenuous that his conviction would shock the conscience. <em>See Rodriguez-Martinez, </em>480 F.3d at 307; <em>see also United States v. Ramirez-Velasquez, </em>322 F.3d 868, 881 (5th Cir.2003) (affirming conspiracy conviction, under the ordinary sufficiency standard, where the \u201caggregation of circumstances\u201d supported the jury\u2019s verdict). As for Jim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>enez\u2019s contention that the government\u2019s case rested on the testimony of co-conspirators who were cooperating in exchange for reduced sentences, it was within the province of the jury to determine credibility and the weight of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>381 F.3d 506, 508 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b400-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
