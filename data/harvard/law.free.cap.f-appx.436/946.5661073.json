O\u2019Quinn challenges the two-level enhancement of his sentence for distributing child pornography, United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(F) (2009), and the denial of his corresponding request for a two-level reduction of his sentence on the ground that he intended only to solicit and receive the pornographic materials, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2G2.2(b)(l). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-16\">The district court did not err when it enhanced O\u2019Quinn\u2019s sentence for distributing child pornography and denied his corresponding request for a reduction of his sentence. O\u2019Quinn pleaded guilty to Count One of his indictment that charged him with \u201cknowingly receiving] and distributing] and attempting] to receive and distribute child pornography,\u201d and he was subject to a two-level increase of his sentence for distributing that contraband, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(F). The commentary to section 2G2.2 provides that \u201cdistribution includes posting material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor on a website for public viewing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>cmt. n. 1.
