The district court denied his request to proceed IFP on appeal certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. Jacobson\u2019s IFP motion in this court is a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-23\">The dismissal of an IFP complaint as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00a9 is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005). Because Jacobson has not shown that he will present any nonfrivo-lous issue on appeal, his motion for leave to proceed IFP is denied and this appeal is dismissed as frivolous. See <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-24\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Jacobson\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to state a claim and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Jacobson is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-25\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b405-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
