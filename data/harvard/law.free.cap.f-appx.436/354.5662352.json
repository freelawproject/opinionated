Bogard pleaded guilty to controlled substance offenses and he was sentenced as a career offender to concurrent imprisonment terms of 240 and 292 months. He argues that Amendment 709 should apply retroactively, because it is a clarifying amendment that was effective only six days after his initial appeal was decided. He contends that the amendment modified the method for calculating criminal history and, under the amendment, he does not qualify as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">By moving to proceed IFP, Bogard challenges the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). \u201cAn investigation into the [IFP] movant\u2019s objective good faith, while necessitating a brief inquiry into the merits of an appeal, does not require that probable success be shown.\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Rather, this court\u2019s inquiry into an appellant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citation omitted). If we determine that the appeal is frivolous, we may dismiss it sua sponte. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary reduction of a defendant\u2019s sentence where the sentencing range is later lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). The district court\u2019s interpretation or application of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo while its decision whether to reduce a sentence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The date of sentencing and, in some cases, the date of the offense, governs which version of the Guidelines is applicable. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lBl.ll(a), (b)(1) (2010). The effective date of Amendment 709 was November 1, 2007, which was after Bogard\u2019s October 4, 2006, sentencing. <em>See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual, Supp. to Appendix C, </em>Amendment 709, p. 241 (Nov. 1, 2010). Amendment 709 does not apply retroactively. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 (a) &amp; (c) (2010); <em>United States v. Drath, </em>89 F.3d 216, 217-18 (5th Cir.1996) (observing that amendments that are not listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c) are not retroactive and explaining that except on direct appeal, a clarifying amendment is not to be applied retroactively, unless the amendment is listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c)). Because Amendment 709 does not apply retroactively, the district court did not err in determining that Bogard was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Bogard fails to address the district court\u2019s alternative ruling that even if Amendment 709 did apply retroactively, it would deny a sentence reduction due to Bogard\u2019s extensive and violent criminal history. He therefore has abandoned any challenge to this ruling. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993); <em>Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">Bogard has failed to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b376-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
