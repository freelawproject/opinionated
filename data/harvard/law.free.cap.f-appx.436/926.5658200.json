No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-18\">In a petition for review under the Act, we review decisions of the ALJ only to determine whether they are in accordance with the law and are supported by substantial evidence in the light of the entire record. <em>Pittsburg &amp; Midway Coal Mining Co. v. Dir., OWCP, </em>508 F.3d 975, 980 (11th Cir.2007). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b949-19\">The Act provides benefits to the survivors of miners whose deaths were due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>to coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis (\u201cCWP\u201d). 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 901(a). To receive survivor\u2019s benefits under the Act, a claimant must establish that (1) the miner had CWP, (2) his CWP was caused by coal mine employment, and (3) his death was due to the disease. <em>Bradbeiry v. Dir., OWCP, </em>117 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">At issue in this appeal is the third element: whether McCrary\u2019s death was due to CWP. In pertinent part, a miner\u2019s death is due to CWP if evidence establishes that CWP was a substantially contributing cause of death, that is, if CWP \u201chastens the miner\u2019s death.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.205(c)(4), (5); <em>Bradberry, </em>117 F.3d at 1366-67 (deferring to and applying the \u201chastening death\u201d standard). A finding that a miner\u2019s death was immediately caused by something other than CWP is not inconsistent with a finding that CWIP contributed to the miner\u2019s death. <em>Id. </em>at 1367-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">In granting the claim for survivor\u2019s benefits, the ALJ concluded that the medical opinions of Dr. Rosenberg and Dr. Gold-stein, USSM\u2019s experts, on the cause of McCrary\u2019s death were unpersuasive because neither doctor found the presence of CWP. The ALJ also concluded that, based on all the medical evidence from Dr. Crain and Dr. Dosmann, McCrary\u2019s treating doctors, CWP contributed to McCrary\u2019s death because the presence of CWP prevented doctors from treating McCrary\u2019s lung cancer surgically.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">On appeal, USSM argues that the ALJ erred in concluding that CWP hastened McCrary\u2019s death. USSM contends that McCrary\u2019s main cause of death was lung cancer and that nothing supports the conclusion that McCrary would have been a surgical candidate had he not suffered from CWP, especially given his many other medical issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-10\">On whether McCrary\u2019s CWP precluded him from having surgery to treat his cancer, Dr. Crain unequivocally stated, in a 2006 letter, that McCrary was a nonsurgical candidate because of \u201cthe extent of pneumoconiosis\u201d from which he suffered and that pneumoconiosis contributed to his death. The ALJ was entitled to give Dr. Crain\u2019s opinion substantial weight because Dr. Crain was McCrary\u2019s treating doctor, he specialized in pulmonary conditions, he treated McCrary for respiratory and pulmonary conditions, and the treatment consisted of multiple visits. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.104(d)(l)-(4) (listing factors to consider in weighing the opinion of a treating doctor about whether a miner\u2019s death was due to CWP).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-11\">This causation opinion is supported by earlier notations Dr. Crain made in medical records. In February 2003, Dr. Crain noted that McCrary was not a surgical candidate because of his hypoxemia and a lesion with evidence of mediastinal lymph node extension. Dr. Crain identified McCrary\u2019s hypoxemia as being caused by CWT<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. Dr. Dosmann agreed with Dr. Crain that McCrary was not a surgical candidate because of his pulmonary condition and the evidence of mediastinal lymph node extension. That complications from McCrary\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>cancer may also have counted against his being a surgical candidate does not alter that his CWP also contributed to his unsuitability for surgery. Because a reasonable mind could have interpreted and credited Dr. Crain\u2019s unequivocal opinion, in combination with McCrary\u2019s medical records, that CWP was the main reason that McCrary was unable to have surgery to treat his cancer, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that McCrary\u2019s CWP caused his doctors to forego treating his lung cancer with surgery. <em>See Pittsburg, </em>508 F.3d at 980. And the inability to operate on McCrary\u2019s cancer hastened his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">We reject USSM\u2019s argument that Dr. Crain\u2019s 2006 letter was conclusory and lacked explanation. Dr. Crain explained that the reason he believed CWP significantly contributed to McCrary\u2019s death was, at least in part, because the disease prevented him from being able to receive surgery to treat his lung cancer. And Dr. Crain discussed in the letter the medical evidence upon which he reached this conclusion, including a chest x-ray, a CT scan, a lung biopsy, and a pulmonary function test.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">USSM also argues that the ALJ erred in discrediting the opinions of Dr. Rosenberg and Dr. Goldstein based on their conclusion that McCrary did not have CWP. USSM contends that the existence of CWP was independent from death causation. But we conclude that it was reasonable for the ALJ to give little weight to these doctors\u2019 opinions, both of whom concluded that McCrary did not suffer from CWP or any other condition aggravated by or related to coal dust exposure. A doctor who concludes that a miner did not suffer from an impairment related to coal dust exposure necessarily will find that a coal dust impairment did not cause the miner\u2019s death.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The ALJ acted in a reasoned manner in weighing the conflicting evidence and determining that Goldstein\u2019s and Rosenberg\u2019s opinions on whether McCrary\u2019s death was caused by CWP should be given little weight. <em>See Bradberry, </em>117 F.3d at 1367 (explaining that \u201c[t]he ALJ is responsible for making credibility determinations and for weighing conflicting evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b949-12\">. Because this Court applies the same standard of review to the AU decision as the BRB, our review of the BRB decision is <em>de novo. Id. </em>We first analyze the AU\u2019s decision because \"[w]hen the BRB upholds the ALJ's decision, this Court\u2019s limited review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>ALJ effectively cloaks the BRB\u2019s decision with the same deference to which the AU is entitled.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b950-8\">. This decision was the second ALJ decision in this case. The BRB remanded the AU's original decision granting survivor's benefits and instructed the ALJ to consider all of the doctors\u2019 opinions about the cause of death. But the BRB affirmed the ALJ's original finding that McCrary suffered from CWP.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b951-7\">. In addition, USSM does not challenge the AU\u2019s original finding that McCrary did, in fact, suffer from CWP.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
