Dickstein argues that the government\u2019s evidence was insufficient to support the district court\u2019s finding that he willfully violated a court order. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"AY8j\">A. Dickstein Retained by the Hirmers</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">Because Dickstein challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, we review the evidence presented at his bench trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-10\">Defendant Dickstein is an attorney licensed in California and experienced in representing tax protestors. Dickstein began representing Claudia and Mark Hirmer after they and eleven others were charged with conspiracy to defraud the Internal Revenue Service, conspiracy to commit money laundering, tax evasion and wire fraud. The charges arose out of the Hirmers\u2019s involvement in an organization that promoted anti-tax theories and tax-avoidance schemes through lectures, products and presentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-14\">After the Hirmers\u2019s arrest, Dickstein filed a notice of appearance, advising that, although the Hirmers had not retained him, he would represent them at their initial appearance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dickstein\u2019s notice of appearance acknowledged that, because of the indictment\u2019s forfeiture allegation, the Hirmers might not have funds to retain him and that he did not know \u201cwhether alternate financing [was] available.\u201d Dick-stein stated that: (1) pursuant to Local Rule 11.1(G), he would not represent the Hirmers more than seven days after arraignment if alternate financing was not available; and (2) he was filing a \u201ctemporary notice of appearance for the purpose of appearing at the September 2, 2008 detention hearing and arraignment, and to further assist [the Hirmers] until such time as he must withdraw from representation for non-payment of fees.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-15\">Dickstein represented the Hirmers at their September 2, 2008 arraignment, where they pled not guilty. On September 8, Dickstein filed a motion to continue trial based on the complexity of the case and the voluminous discovery. In the motion, Dickstein stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that he had agreed to represent the Hirmers, but, due to the forfeiture allegations, \u201cit [was] unlikely he [would] receive much, if any, compensation until such time as the trial is completed, and only if the Hirmers [were] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>acquitted\u201d on the money laundering conspiracy count.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">B. District Court\u2019s Yerbal Order Not to Withdraw Based on Nonpayment</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">At a September 16, 2008 hearing on the continuance motion, the district court and Dickstein discussed whether the Hirmers would have funds available to prepare the kind of defense Dickstein wanted to prepare. The district court asked Dickstein whether he was representing the Hirmers even though he \u201canticipate[d] not being paid, or perhaps not being paid for this representation.\u201d Dickstein responded, \u201cUnfortunately, yes.\u201d The district court then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-6\">With that understanding, I\u2019m sure you can appreciate, the Court is not going to entertain a motion to withdraw. You have that understanding. You were knowledgeable about their financial circumstances at the time you agreed to represent them. I\u2019m not going to entertain a motion to withdraw based on lack of compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">Dickstein and the district court discussed the possibility of the Hirmers filing a request for appointment of counsel, but Dickstein stated that he did not want to do so because the Hirmers wanted him to represent them and he was not a member of the district court\u2019s Criminal Justice Act (\u201cCJA\u201d) panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">C. District Court\u2019s Standing Order</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-9\">On September 23, 2008, the district court entered a Standing Order and Notice to Retained Criminal Defense Attorneys (\u201cStanding Order\u201d). The Standing Order: (1) required Dickstein \u201cto make financial arrangements that are satisfactory to [him] and sufficient to provide for representation of each defendant until the conclusion of the defendant\u2019s case,\u201d which included \u201cservices to be rendered upon appeal\u201d; (2) advised that Dickstein was expected to represent the Hirmers until the conclusion of the case, unless, within seven days, the court received written notice of his withdrawal; and (8) stated that \u201c[failure of a defendant to pay the attorney\u2019s fees or failure of counsel to collect a sum sufficient to compensate for all the services usually required will not constitute good cause for withdrawal after the seven-day period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-12\">D.Dickstein\u2019s Post-Trial Motion to Withdraw</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-13\">Dickstein did not withdraw within the seven-day period. Instead, after the Hirmers paid Dickstein $100,000 on October 17, 2008, Dickstein filed a Notice of Continued Representation on November 17, 2008, indicating that the Hirmers wanted Dickstein to continue representing them. Dickstein represented the Hirmers over the next eighteen months, up to and through the month-long jury trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On March 31, 2010, the jury found the Hirm-ers guilty on all counts. The Hirmers\u2019s sentencing hearing was set for July 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-14\">On April 26, 2010, Dickstein filed a motion to withdraw \u201cin light of [Dickstein\u2019s] not receiving payment for services rendered to date, and the inability of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>Hirmers to pay for services to be rendered in the future.\u201d Dickstein\u2019s motion stated that: (1) the Hirmers\u2019s initial retainer came from a loan obtained from Claudia Hirmer\u2019s mother because Dickstein refused to accept payment from funds that might be subject to forfeiture; (2) \u201cDick-stein continued to represent the Hirmers despite not being paid a substantial portion of his accrued attorney\u2019s fee, a condition Dickstein accepted when the Court indicated by Order that failure to receive payment of fees would not constitute good cause for withdrawal \u2018until the conclusion of the defendant\u2019s case\u2019 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (8) the Hirm-ers had not made arrangements to pay the remaining portion of his trial fee, which \u201cput [Dickstein] in severe financial straits, rendering him unable to pay current expenses for rent, food, utilities and other bills, as he devoted his full time and efforts solely to representing the Hirmers\u201d; (4) as a result, Dickstein was \u201cvacating his home/office on Friday, April 30, 2010,\u201d would \u201close phone and internet service on Thursday, April 29, 2010,\u201d and did not know where he would move \u201cas there are also no funds to rent another home/office\u201d; (5) Dickstein resided in Wisconsin and did not have the funds to travel to Florida for the sentencing hearing or to pay the fees to file an appeal and order a transcript; (6) the Hirmers had not responded to Dickstein\u2019s April 16, 2010 letter asking whether they wished Dickstein to continue representing them and, if so, how they intended to pay for the representation; and (7) Dickstein believed he had fully discharged his duties on behalf of the Hirmers and that, in light of the Hirmers\u2019s refusal to pay his fees and his need to vacate his residence, he could not \u201ccontinue to faithfully represent the Hirmers and to present their best interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">The district court denied Dickstein\u2019s motion to withdraw, explaining that, per its Standing Order, Dickstein was expected to make financial arrangements sufficient to provide for representation until the conclusion of the case, which contemplated appeal, and the failure of payment was not good cause for withdrawal. The district court noted the complexity of the case and the time it would take another lawyer to become adequately familiar with the facts. In an effort to protect the Hirmers under the circumstances, the district court found that they were financially unable to employ counsel and appointed Dickstein as CJA counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">E. Dickstein\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-11\">Dickstein filed a motion asking the district court to reconsider appointing him as CJA counsel. Dickstein argued that he had not accepted the CJA appointment and that his payment under the CJA would be reduced by amounts he had received as retained counsel. He also cited new conflicts of interest and irreconcilable differences and contended that he was unable to provide the Hirmers with quality representation due to his past dealings with them.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Among other things, Dick-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>stein stated that because he held the Hirmers directly accountable for his dire financial situation, he no longer possessed the detached neutrality necessary to provide adequate representation and was unwilling to continue representing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">At a June 3, 2010 hearing on the motion, Dickstein reiterated his arguments and stated that he understood the Standing Order to require him to remain counsel to the time of perfecting appeal, not through appeal. Claudia Hirmer told the district court that she and her husband felt abandoned by Dickstein and indicated that they did not want Dickstein to continue representing them because he did not \u201chave [them] best interest[s] at heart anymore.\u201d The district court acknowledged that it had not followed the usual procedures for making a CJA appointment. Stating that it was \u201cleft with no choice,\u201d the district court granted Dickstein\u2019s motion for reconsideration and discharged him as counsel of record for the Hirmers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">F. Dickstein\u2019s Criminal Contempt Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">On August 18, 2010, the district court filed a notice and order of criminal contempt proceedings, charging Dickstein with violating the court\u2019s September 23, 2008 Standing Order and its verbal order given at the September 16, 2008 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">At a bench trial for the criminal contempt charge, Dickstein testified, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Hirmers paid him a total of $146,000, but that his billing for his work on the criminal case exceeded that amount by January 2009 and that he used his own money to fund the defense thereafter. By the end of the Hirmers\u2019s trial, Dickstein said, he was \u201c[absolutely broke, plus credit card debt for expenses [he] incurred on behalf of the Hirmers.\u201d Dickstein understood the district court\u2019s Standing Order and verbal order in September 2008 to mean that \u201cthe mere nonpayment would not be grounds to withdraw,\u201d but that the orders did not preclude him from filing a motion to withdraw if \u201cother issues\u201d arose. Dickstein explained that his motion to withdraw included grounds other than the mere fact of nonpayment, namely his inability to pay rent, buy food or maintain a law office with a telephone and access to the Internet. Thus, Dickstein did not think that he was violating the court\u2019s orders when he filed his motion to withdraw. Dickstein said that he filed the motion to withdraw in order to comply with the ethical code of the Florida Bar and the California Rules of Professional Conduct. However, Dickstein admitted that the additional grounds raised in his motion for reconsideration (involving conflicts of interest and irreconcilable differences) were based on \u201cnew stuff\u2019 that transpired after his motion to withdraw was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the district court adjudicated Dickstein guilty of criminal contempt. After reviewing the evidence, the district court stated, \u201cThe timing of some of what I\u2019ve just gone over with you convinces me that the reason for the motion to withdraw ... and Mr. Dick-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>stein\u2019s unwillingness to continue representing the Hirmers was their failure to pay him any money following trial.\u201d The district court found that the other reasons Dickstein gave for withdrawal were \u201csimply a trumped up pretext for the real reason, which is the fact that they didn\u2019t pay him any more money.\u201d The district court noted that Dickstein did not present any evidence supporting his claim to have been a homeless pauper at the time he filed the motion to withdraw. The district court rejected Dickstein\u2019s testimony that he was unable to continue representing the Hirmers, stating, \u201cYou were not unable, and you didn\u2019t even say you were unable in those motions.\u201d The district court sentenced Dickstein to ninety days in custody, but allowed Dickstein to stay at liberty pending appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">The district court subsequently issued a written order and judgment reiterating its reasons and conclusions. Specifically, the district court found beyond a reasonable doubt that: (1) its September 16, 2008 verbal order and its September 28 Standing Order were lawful and reasonably specific; (2) Dickstein violated those orders by moving to withdraw \u201cbased explicitly on [the Hirmers\u2019s] nonpayment of his fees, which was the very act the court\u2019s orders were designed to prevent\u201d; and (3) Dick-stein\u2019s violation was willful.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">As to Dickstein\u2019s willfulness, the district court found \u201cincredulous\u201d Dickstein\u2019s testimony that he would have continued representing the Hirmers if the district court had denied his motion for reconsideration. The district court stated that the \u201cdry transcript\u201d of the hearing on the motion for reconsideration \u201cd[id] not adequately convey the tone taken by Dickstein with the court, but it was clear to the [district court] at the time that Dickstein had effectively and unilaterally ended his representation of the Hirmers based on their failure to pay his fees and had made up his mind not to continue, regardless of what the court ordered.\u201d The district court found Dickstein\u2019s \u201csubsequently offered reasons\u201d for his withdrawal proposed in his motion for reconsideration to be \u201cmere after thought\u201d and \u201cpretextual.\u201d Dick-stein filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-12\">To support a conviction for criminal contempt, \u201cthe government must prove: (1) that the court entered a lawful order of reasonable specificity; (2) the order was violated; and (3) the violation was willful.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>922 F.2d 1531, 1534 (11th Cir.1991). Dickstein argues that there is insufficient evidence only as to the third element, that is, that he willfully violated the court\u2019s orders. A violation of an order is willful if it is \u201c \u2018a deliberate or intended violation, as distinguished from an accidental, inadvertent, or negligent violation of an order.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Straub, </em>508 F.3d 1003, 1012 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Baldwin, </em>770 F.2d 1550, 1558 (11th Cir.1985)). \u201cUnder this standard of intent, behavior amounting to a reckless disregard for the administration of justice is sufficient to support a conviction when violative of a reasonably specific court order.\u201d <em>United States v. Burstyn, </em>878 F.2d 1322, 1324 (11th Cir.1989).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-13\">Here, the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>sufficient to support the district court\u2019s finding that Dickstein willfully violated the district court\u2019s orders. The September 16, 2008 verbal order and September 23, 2008 Standing Order both precluded Dickstein from filing a motion to withdraw based on the Hirmers\u2019s failure to pay his fees. The record reflects that Dickstein clearly understood that. Yet, this is exactly what Dickstein eventually did. Dickstein deliberately and intentionally, not as a result of accident or negligence, filed a motion to withdraw based on the Hirmers\u2019s failure to pay him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">Dickstein argues that his mere filing of the motion to withdraw cannot, as a matter of law, constitute a refusal to obey the district court\u2019s order to continue representing the Hirmers. Dickstein rather artfully contends that he did not refuse to represent the Hirmers, he just submitted the issue of continued representation for the district court\u2019s determination. If the district court had refused his request, he would have continued to represent the Hirmers.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The problem for Dickstein is that the district court\u2019s September 16 verbal order and September 23 Standing Order did not order him to continue representing the Hirmers. Rather, these two orders explicitly and clearly prohibited him from filing a motion to withdraw on the basis of nonpayment of fees. Thus, the deliberate act of filing the motion to withdraw on that precise basis was a willful violation of the district court\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">Dickstein\u2019s argument that his motion to withdraw was based on issues other than lack of payment is unpersuasive. Dick-stein\u2019s motion to withdraw made statements about Dickstein\u2019s severe financial straits, which he claimed were caused by his continued representation of the Hirm-ers. However, the motion to withdraw relied explicitly and solely on the Hirm-ers\u2019s failure to pay him for past services and inability to pay for services to be rendered in the future as the basis for withdrawing. The motion to withdraw did not mention, much less argue, that Dick-stein was complying with any ethical obligations in seeking to withdraw. Dickstein did not raise these other issues until his motion for reconsideration, after his motion to withdraw was denied.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">Additionally, the district court did not believe Dickstein\u2019s testimony that he was in dire financial straits at the time he filed his motion to withdraw. In support of its finding, the district court emphasized that there was no other evidence to support Dickstein\u2019s claim, Dickstein made no effort to bring these other issues to the court\u2019s attention sooner, and Dickstein filed his motion to withdraw ten days after he asked the Hirmers how they were going to pay for his continued representation and they did not respond. The district court found that Dickstein\u2019s other reasons were a pretext for the real reason \u2014 the Hirm-ers\u2019s failure to pay Dickstein\u2019s fees. Cred<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>ibility determinations are generally the province of the fact \u00f1nder, and in the case of a bench trial, the fact finder is the district court. <em>See United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2002). Dickstein has not given us a reason to disturb the district court\u2019s credibility finding. Moreover, Dickstein\u2019s discredited testimony is substantive evidence of his guilt. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>53 F.3d 312, 314 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-4\">Dickstein also willfully violated the district court\u2019s Standing Order by failing to make financial arrangements that were sufficient to last him through appeal of the Hirmers\u2019s case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is clear from Dick-stein\u2019s early statements to the district court that he knew from the beginning that it was unlikely he would be paid from the Hirmers\u2019s assets subject to forfeiture and that he needed to find \u201calternate financing.\u201d He also knew that the case\u2019s complexity and voluminous discovery meant that preparing an adequate defense would be expensive and would require judicious use of funds. Yet, Dickstein had used up the agreed-upon retainer by January 2009, before the trial had even taken place, and had moved to withdraw for failure to pay before his clients were sentenced. At a minimum, Dickstein\u2019s actions amounted to reckless disregard for the administration of justice, which is sufficient to support a criminal contempt conviction. <em>See Burstyn, </em>878 F.2d at 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1003-11\">. Dickstein was already representing the Hirmers in a civil abusive tax shelter case filed in the Northern District of Florida.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1003-12\">. Northern District of Florida Local Rule 11.1(G) states that the court expects retained counsel in criminal cases to represent a defendant to the conclusion of the case unless the court is notified of the retained counsel\u2019s withdrawal within seven calendar days after arraignment and that, after the seven-day period expires, the \u2018'[fjailure of a defendant to pay sums owed for attorney\u2019s fees or failure of counsel to collect a sum sufficient to compensate for all the services usually required of defense counsel will not constitute good cause....\u201d N.D. Fla. L.R. 11.1 (G).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1004-10\">. A portion of Dickstein's pre-trial representation included a Sixteenth Amendment challenge to the indictment. When the district court denied Dickstein's motion to dismiss the indictment on Sixteenth Amendment grounds, Dickstein filed a writ of mandamus with this Court, which was denied, and a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court, which was denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">. In the district court, Dickstein submitted in camera a statement that the Hirmers had paid him a total of $146,219.06 in fees and costs and that an additional $308,210.67 in fees and costs remained unpaid. According to attached itemized statements of time, costs and trust account standing, by December 2009, Dickstein had incurred $259,200 in fees and $14,002.74 in costs and the trust account had a balance of $216.32.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1005-13\">. Specifically, Dickstein\u2019s motion asserted that: (1) a third party had told Dickstein that Claudia Hirmer said Dickstein was not entitled to any more money and had failed to provide adequate representation due to aleo-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>hoi consumption; (2) after the Hirmers\u2019s convictions, the Hirmers's son-in-law, who had power of attorney, had agreed to pay Dick-stein $5,000, but never did and stopped communicating with Dickstein; and (3) a conflict of interest arose that stemmed from a civil case based on the same transactions, in which he represented the Hirmers and others.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1006-13\">. On June 11, 2010, the district court appointed the Hirmers each CJA counsel, and the Hirmers were sentenced on October 27, 2010.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">. In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence in support of an order of criminal contempt, we determine \"whether the evidence, construed in the light most favorable to the government, permits a finding of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Straub, </em>508 F.3d at 1008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">. As the district court found, this claim is rather disingenuous given that, when the district court did deny Dickstein\u2019s request to withdraw, he filed a motion for reconsideration in which he stated he was \"unwilling\u201d to continue representing the Hirmers, and then, during the hearing on the motion for reconsideration, made it clear by his tone that he had no intention of continuing his representation regardless of what the district court ruled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1008-8\">. Dickstein devotes much of his appeal brief to discussing various ethical rules governing when lawyers in California or Florida may or must withdraw from representation. However, Dickstein did not cite any of these rules (or the circumstances underpinning them) as the basis for his motion to withdraw, and the district court found that Dickstein was not motivated by these ethical rules when he filed his motion to withdraw.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">. While Dickstein testified that he thought the Standing Order only required him to represent the Hirmers through perfection of appeal, the financial arrangements Dickstein made with the Hirmers did not even carry him to trial, and Dickstein moved to withdraw before sentencing. Thus, even under Dickstein\u2019s own understanding of the district court\u2019s orders, his violation was willful.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
