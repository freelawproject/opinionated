The disclosure provisions of the FOIA are construed broadly; and the exemptions are interpreted narrowly. <em>Ely v. F.B.I., </em>781 F.2d 1487, 1489 (11th Cir.1986). The agency bears the burden of proving that a particular piece of information is exempt from disclosure. <em>Id. </em>at 1489-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-18\">Edwards sought information about his prior criminal case, specifically, information about statements his codefendant, Shawn Williams, made to the police. In response to Edwards\u2019s request, the EOU-SA provided Edwards with five and a half pages of material; but the EOUSA withheld seven pages, claiming that the information was exempt from disclosure because it reasonably could be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy or could reasonably be ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>pected to disclose a confidential source.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C), (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">On appeal, Edwards makes no challenge to the applicability of these exemptions; instead, he argues that the EOUSA waived the exemptions because it earlier had disclosed the documents that he requested. Edwards bases this argument on a public records request he made under the Florida Public Records Act where he received a redacted investigative supplement report prepared by the St. Petersburg Police Department that described his codefendant\u2019s debriefing.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">If an agency voluntarily discloses information, it may not claim in a later proceeding that the previously released information is exempt from disclosure. <em>Florida House of Representatives v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Commerce, </em>961 F.2d 941, 946 (11th Cir.1992). But Edwards has not established that the EOUSA already had disclosed the information it withheld in his case. Although Edwards suggested (in his response to the EOUSA\u2019s summary judgment motion) that the EOUSA had provided him with a copy of the investigative supplement report, his supporting evidence revealed that the St. Petersburg Police Department actually disclosed the report. That Edwards obtained a copy of the investigative report from another source does not establish that the EOUSA voluntarily waived any FOIA exemption on that information. <em>See L &amp; C Marine Transport, Ltd. v. United States, </em>740 F.2d 919, 922, 925 (11th Cir.1984) (explaining that a person \u201cdoes not lose his privacy interest under [5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C) ] because his identity as a witness may be disclosed through other means\u201d and that the \u201cper se limitation on disclosure under [5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(D)] does not disappear if the identity of the confidential source later becomes known through other means\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">Edwards showed no genuine issue of material fact about whether the EOUSA waived its right to invoke the statutory exemptions in the FOIA; and the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the EOUSA. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b945-13\">. We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo; </em>and we view the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Fla. v.
