The district court dismissed for lack of standing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b329-15\">In April 2010, nonparty Michayl Mellen was arrested in Abilene, Texas (the City), on charges of possessing child pornography. Mellen\u2019s computer allegedly was searched and seized by City police officers pursuant to a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-16\">Crenshaw-Logal at one time was an Indiana lawyer<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and currently is a \u201cvolunteer administrator of multiple grassroots, nonprofit, non-governmental organizations.\u201d Crenshaw-Logal and Mellen \u201ccommunicated and pursued social justice initiatives throughout most of this millennium\u201d in the context of their mutual association with POPULAR, Inc., a \u201cnational legal reform advocate.\u201d Crenshaw-Logal \u201cshared many thoughts and impressions with Mellen by written communications, some of which are reportedly among his electronic and paper files searched and/or seized by\u201d the City. According to Cren-shaw-Logal, her writings \u201creflect sensitive aspects of [her] advocacy, including lawful but controversial reforms [she is] contemplating and otherwise pursuing with fellow citizens and organizations for certain Taylor county, Texas residents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-17\">Crenshaw-Logal, acting pro se, filed this \u00a7 1983 action for damages against the City in June 2010. She claims that the City is \u201cchillfing]\u201d her First (and Fifth) Amendment rights because the City \u201ctheoretically\u201d has \u201cunfettered access\u201d to the \u201cwork product material\u201d on Mellen\u2019s computer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She also alleges that the City did not \u201ctake <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>care to assure\u201d that its search of Mellen\u2019s computer was \u201cconducted in a manner that minimizes unwarranted intrusions upon privacy,\u201d although she offers no factual basis for this allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The district court dismissed Crenshaw-Logal\u2019s complaint with prejudice. The district court held that Crenshaw-Logal lacked constitutional standing because her injury, if any, was \u201cfar too remote.\u201d Alternatively, the district court held that Crenshaw-Logal failed to state a claim under \u00a7 1983 because she did not sufficiently identify an unlawful City custom or policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Crenshaw-Logal filed a Rule 60(b)(6) motion for relief from the district court\u2019s judgment. The motion essentially restated the allegations in the complaint. The district court denied the motion, and Crenshaw-Logal appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">We review de novo a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) or for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). <em>Ramming v. United </em>States, 281 F.3d 158, 161 (5th Cir.2001). We review for abuse of discretion a denial of a Rule 60(b)(6) motion. <em>Callon Petroleum Co. v. Frontier Ins. Co., </em>351 F.3d 204, 210 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">When a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction \u201cis filed in conjunction with other Rule 12 motions, the court should consider the Rule 12(b)(1) jurisdictional attack before addressing any attack on the merits.\u201d <em>Ramming, </em>281 F.3d at 161; <em>In re Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co. LLC, </em>624 F.3d 201, 209 (5th Cir.2010). Moreover, when a complaint could be dismissed for both lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim, \u201cthe court should dismiss only on the jurisdictional ground under [Rule] 12(b)(1), without reaching the question of failure to state a claim under [Rule] 12(b)(6).\u201d <em>Hitt v. City of Pasadena, </em>561 F.2d 606, 608 (5th Cir.1977). This practice prevents courts from issuing advisory opinions. <em>Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, </em>523 U.S. 83, 101, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998). The practice also prevents courts without jurisdiction \u201cfrom prematurely dismissing a case with prejudice.\u201d <em>Ramming, </em>281 F.3d at 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b330-13\">Article III standing is a jurisdictional prerequisite.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Steel, </em>523 U.S. at 101, 118 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>S.Ct. 1003; <em>Xerox Corp. v. Genmoora Corp., </em>888 F.2d 345, 350 (5th Cir.1989). At a minimum, Article III requires a plaintiff to show an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d that is fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s conduct and that is likely to be redressed by the requested relief. <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). An injury in fact means injury that is \u201cconcrete and particularized\u201d and \u201cactual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Crenshaw-Logal has failed to allege an injury in fact. In essence, Crenshaw-Lo-gal alleges that her speech is being chilled because the City might use communications she sent to Mellen to her detriment at some point in the future. The Supreme Court rejected this theory of standing almost forty years ago. In <em>Laird v. Tatum, </em>the Supreme Court held that allegations of \u201csubjective \u2018chill\u2019 are not an adequate substitute for a claim of specific present objective harm or a threat of specific future harm.\u201d 408 U.S. 1, 13-14, 92 S.Ct. 2318, 33 L.Ed.2d 154 (1972).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The \u201cmere existence, without more, of a governmental investigative and data-gathering activity that is alleged to be broader in scope than is reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of a valid governmental purpose\u201d is not sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts. <em>Id. </em>at 10, 92 S.Ct. 2318. In other words, an injury in fact does not arise merely from an individual\u2019s knowledge that the government \u201cwas engaged in certain activities or from the individual\u2019s concomitant fear that, armed with the fruits of those activities, the agency might in the future take some other and additional action detrimental to that individual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11, 92 S.Ct. 2318.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Here, Crenshaw-Logal has alleged nothing more than subjective, self-imposed chill. She alleges that the City \u201creportedly\u201d and \u201ctheoretically\u201d has access to communications stored on Mellen\u2019s computer, but she does not allege that the City actually has done or is likely to do anything injurious to her with those communications. Nor does she even allege that the City has in fact read the communications. Crenshaw-Logal\u2019s unsupported speculation that the City might use the communications to her detriment at some point in the future is a far cry from the imminent threat of particularized harm necessary to establish constitutional standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Although Crenshaw-Logal acknowledges that her injury is merely \u201ctheoretical ],\u201d she suggests that \u201c[djiscovery may confirm and accordingly nudge this case \u2018across the line from conceivable to plausible.\u2019 \u201d This argument puts the cart before the horse. Crenshaw-Logal does not get discovery until she pleads a plausible claim. <em>See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">For the reasons stated, we find that the district court properly dismissed Cren-shaw-Logal\u2019s complaint for lack of standing. We further find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Crenshaw-Logal\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6) motion, which essentially restates the allegations in her complaint. Although a pro se litigant ordinarily is entitled to file an amended complaint before her claims are dismissed, Crenshaw-Logal never moved for leave to amend. Nor has she provided any indication in her complaint, her opposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>tion to the City\u2019s motion to dismiss, or her Rule 60(b)(6) motion that she would be able to establish standing in an amended complaint. A district court does not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend when, as here, amendment would be futile. <em>See Briggs v. Mississippi, </em>381 F.3d 499, 508 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Although we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Crenshaw-Logal\u2019s complaint for lack of jurisdiction, we modify the judgment. When a complaint is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction (including lack of standing), dismissal ordinarily should be without prejudice. <em>See, e.g., In re Great Lakes, </em>624 F.3d at 209; <em>Fleck &amp; Assocs., Inc. v. Phoenix, City of, and Ariz. Mun. Corp., </em>471 F.3d 1100, 1106-07 (9th Cir. 2006); <em>Brereton v. Bountiful City Corp., </em>434 F.3d 1213, 1216 (10th Cir.2006); <em>cf. </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b). We do not see (and the district court did not identify) any special circumstances that warrant deviation from the general rule at this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">For the reasons stated, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b329-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-18\">. Crenshaw-Logal has been suspended from practicing law in the state of Indiana as well as the Seventh Circuit. See <em>Crenshaw </em>v. <em>Antokol, </em>206 Fed.Appx. 560, 565 (7th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b329-19\">. The complaint could be read as asserting claims under the federal Privacy Protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000aa. Crenshaw-Logal has conceded, however, that \"[a]t no point in my pleading do I directly or indirectly assert that the Privacy Protection Act (PPA) provides me a claim for relief.\u201d We also note that the complaint does not assert claims under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b330-9\">. Article III standing is not to be confused with what is often loosely referred to as Fourth Amendment standing. <em>Rakas v. Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 138-39, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978). An individual may not claim the protection of the Fourth Amendment unless she has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the place searched. <em>Id. </em>at 143. An individual is said to have \u201cstanding\u201d under the Fourth Amendment if she has a reasonable expectation of privacy. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>647 F.3d 216, 218-20 (5th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Pack, </em>612 F.3d 341, 347 (5th Cir.2010). Although Article III standing and Fourth Amendment standing may be \u201cintertwined,\" Fourth Amendment standing ultimately is a matter of substantive law and not a jurisdictional prerequisite. <em>Rakas, </em>439 U.S. at 140, 99 S.Ct. 421; <em>see also United States v. Maestas, </em>941 F.2d 273, 276 n. 2 (5th Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Ewing, </em>638 F.3d 1226, 1230 (9th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Dyer, </em>580 F.3d 386, 390 (6th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Nechy, </em>827 F.2d 1161, 1164-65 (7th Cir. 1987). The Supreme Court has recently cautioned courts to \"proceed with care when considering the whole concept of privacy expectations in communications made on electronic equipment.\u201d <em>City of Ontario, Cal. v. Quon, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2619, 2629, 177 L.Ed.2d 216 (2010). Crenshaw-Logal\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>complaint does not invoke the Fourth Amendment, nor does Crenshaw-Logal contend that she has a reasonable expectation of privacy in communications sent to, received by, and stored on Mellen\u2019s computer. Accordingly, our decision need not and does not address Fourth Amendment standing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b331-12\">. <em>See also Morrison v.
