He argues that his claim of an illegally enhanced sentence is not cognizable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, and, thus, an extraordinary common-law writ is his only available avenue for relief. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-16\">Martinez Izquierdo was convicted in 1994 of distribution of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. He was sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and 851. His direct appeal was dismissed in 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-17\">In 2010, Martinez Izquierdo filed <em>pro se, </em>in his criminal case, an \u201comnibus petition for writ of <em>audita querela, </em>prohibition, and/or mandamus,\u201d pursuant to the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a). He alleged that the government had served a copy of the \u00a7 851 information only on an attorney who had ceased representing him by that time, thereby failing to comply with the procedures set forth in \u00a7 851(a). Accordingly, he sought to vacate his sentence on the ground that the district court was without jurisdiction to impose the mandatory life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-18\">He further opined that sentencing issues such as this are not cognizable under \u00a7 2255, and, thus, he was entitled to seek relief through an extraordinary writ. Fi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>nally, he added that a writ of mandamus could be available for the purpose of compelling the United States Attorney or the probation office to \u201cadher[e] to the directives of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994[and] 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851,\u201d and that a writ of prohibition could be used to prevent the probation office from imposing the illegal life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">The district court denied the petition on the ground that Martinez Izquierdo\u2019s claim came within the scope of \u00a7 2255, and, thus, he could not seek relief through a writ of <em>audita querela </em>or any other common-law writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the question of whether a prisoner may challenge his sentence through a petition for a common-law extraordinary writ. <em>See United States v. Holt, </em>417 F.3d 1172, 1174 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">Post-conviction relief is available to a federal prisoner under \u00a7 2255 where \u201cthe sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or ... the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or ... the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a). A \u00a7 851 information setting forth a defendant\u2019s pri- or felony drug convictions is used to increase the statutory mandatory minimum and maximum sentences to which he is subject for a conviction under \u00a7 841. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b), 851(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">Certain common-law writs may be used to \u201cfill the interstices of the federal post-conviction remedial framework.\u201d <em>Holt, </em>417 F.3d at 1174-75 (quotation omitted). Yet \u201c[a] writ of <em>audita querela </em>may not be granted when relief is cognizable under \u00a7 2255,\u201d regardless of whether a \u00a7 2255 motion would have succeeded. <em>Id. </em>at 1175. \u201c[T]he district court has original jurisdiction over a mandamus action to compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Cash v. Barnhart, </em>327 F.3d 1252, 1257 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation omitted). The extraordinary remedy of a writ of mandamus is appropriate only if the petitioner \u201chas exhausted all other avenues of relief and only if the defendant owes him a clear nondiscretionary duty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1258 (quotation omitted). A writ of prohibition, which requires a showing of \u201cexceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of power,\u201d is reserved for extraordinary cases in which \u201cthe right to relief is clear and undisputable\u201d and the regular judicial-review process is inadequate to address the petitioner\u2019s claim. <em>See In re Wainwright, </em>678 F.2d 951, 953 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">Martinez Izquierdo\u2019s collateral attack on his sentence essentially claims that the government\u2019s and district court\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 851 resulted in a \u201csentence [that] was in excess of the maximum authorized by\u201d \u00a7 841 and, thus, \u201cwas imposed in violation of the ... laws of the United States.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255(a). Furthermore, he argues that the failure to comply strictly with \u00a7 851 deprived the district court of jurisdiction to impose the life sentence, which likewise falls within the ambit of \u00a7 2255(a). Accordingly, the district court correctly determined that the \u00a7 2255 framework is the proper avenue for Martinez Izquierdo\u2019s collateral attack and that a common-law writ cannot afford the requested relief. <em>See Holt, </em>417 F.3d at 1175; <em>Cash, </em>327 F.3d at 1258; <em>Wainwright, </em>678 F.2d at 953. Additionally, Martinez Izquierdo has identified no basis on which we could order the prosecutor to comply with \u00a7 851 retroactively or could order the probation office to disregard the existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>sentence absent a grant of \u00a7 2255 relief. <em>See Cash, </em>327 F.3d at 1257-58; <em>Wainwright, </em>678 F.2d at 953.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b954-17\">. Federal courts are obligated to \"look behind the label of a motion filed by a <em>pro se </em>inmate and determine whether the motion is, in effect, cognizable under a different remedial statutory framework.\u201d <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>915 F.2d 622, 624-25 (11th Cir.1990); <em>see abo Holt, </em>417 F.3d at 1175 (noting that the motion for a writ of <em>audita querela </em>could be liberally construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion but that such a motion would have been imper-missibly successive). Martinez Izquierdo filed his motion for a writ of <em>audita querela </em>approximately 15 years after his conviction became final, and the motion does not allege any basis on which the one-year statute of limitations in \u00a7 2255 would have been tolled. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255(f). As Martinez Izquierdo\u2019s claim would have been time-barred pursuant to \u00a7 2255(f), the district court did not err in declining to review the merits of the claim under the \u00a7 2255 framework. <em>See Holt, </em>417 F.3d at 1175.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
