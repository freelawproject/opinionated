He was sentenced, <em>inter alia, </em>to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment. Ruiz contends, under Guideline \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B) (defining \u201crelevant conduct\u201d for jointly undertaken criminal activities): his sentence should have been based solely on cocaine, which was within the scope of the conspiracy and reasonably foreseeable to him; and, accordingly, he should not be held responsible for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>methamphetamine that also was involved because it was not reasonably foreseeable to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Although, <em>post </em>\u2014 Booker, the Guidelines are advisory only, and an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the advisory Guidelines sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005). The court\u2019s determination of the type and quantity of drugs for which defendant is responsible is a factual finding and, therefore, is reviewed only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">In determining defendant\u2019s base-offense level, courts may consider drug quantities not specified in the count of conviction if they are part of defendant\u2019s \u201crelevant conduct\u201d, as defined by Guideline \u00a7 1B1.3. <em>E.g., United States v. Wall, </em>180 F.3d 641, 644-45 (5th Cir.1999). That Guideline provides: defendant\u2019s sentence shall be determined by \u201call acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant\u201d, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A), as well as \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of [a] jointly undertaken criminal activity\u201d, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B). That Guideline\u2019s commentary provides: \u201cdefendant is accountable for all quantities of contraband with which he was directly involved\u201d. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 cmt. n. 2. That commentary also clarifies that the conduct referenced in Guideline \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B), regarding the limitation of reasonable foreseeability, \u201capplies only in respect to the conduct ... of others\u201d and is inapplicable to those instances in which defendant is directly involved. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Carreon, </em>11 F.3d 1225, 1237 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Reasonable foreseeability <em>vel non </em>does not apply in this instance because Ruiz personally participated in the conduct for which he was found accountable at sentencing. Ruiz was present at a stash house \u2014 which was operated by the organization from which he routinely purchased drugs \u2014 with the intention of taking control of a drug shipment containing both cocaine and methamphetamine. He attempted to use his vehicle to remove the narcotics from the stash house and to prevent the law-enforcement agents from discovering the organization\u2019s source of supply. Further, when agents executed a search warrant at the stash house, Ruiz was observed placing into his vehicle packages found to contain both cocaine and methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">The record therefore supports that Ruiz personally participated in the conduct for which he was sentenced. Accordingly, without regard to reasonable foreseeability, Ruiz was accountable for the full quantity of all drugs within the packages. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A). Although Ruiz maintains he believed the packages contained only cocaine, his knowledge of their specific contents is immaterial. In other words, Ruiz was responsible for the narcotics involved in the conduct for which he personally participated, even if he did not know the type drugs contained in the packages. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Valencia-Gonzales, </em>172 F.3d 344, 345-46 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b383-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
