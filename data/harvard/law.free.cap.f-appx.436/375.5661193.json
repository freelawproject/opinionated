Gomez argues that the district court\u2019s upward departure from the advisory guidelines range of 24-30 months of imprisonment based on the inadequacy of his criminal history category was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-18\">We review Gomez\u2019s sentence for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir. 2005). Reasonableness review, in the context of a guidelines departure, requires this court to evaluate both the decision to depart upward and the extent of the departure for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006). An upward departure is not an abuse of discretion if the reasons for the departure advance the objectives of \u00a7 3553(a) and are justified by the particular facts of the case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-23\">Given Gomez\u2019s extensive criminal record and the lack of deterrent effect from prior sentences, as shown by the expediency with which he has returned to this country illegally and committed other offenses, the district court did not abuse its discretion by upwardly departing based on its finding that Gomez\u2019s criminal history category underrepresented the seriousness of his criminal history and the likelihood that he would recidivate. See \u00a7 3553(a); <em>Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 347-48. Gomez\u2019s assertions that the departure was unwarranted in light of the fact that he was already in the highest criminal history category and because the Northern District of Texas has a higher upward departure rate in illegal reentry cases than the national average are unavailing. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, p.s.; <em>United States v. Willingham, </em>497 F.3d 541, 544 (5th Cir. 2007). Additionally, Gomez has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in determining the extent of the departure. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349-50 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 347-48; <em>United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 492-93 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b397-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
