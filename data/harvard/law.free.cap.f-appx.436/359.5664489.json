The district court held that Hendrix\u2019s suit was time barred and dismissed it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted. This court reviews dismissals under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) de novo, using the same standard of review applicable to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) dismissals. <em>Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 156 (5th Cir.1999). We review the district court\u2019s denial of Hendrix\u2019s motion to amend or alter judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Johnson v. Diversicare Afton Oaks, LLC, </em>597 F.3d 673, 677 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Because there is no federal statute of limitations for actions brought pursuant to \u00a7 1983, federal courts borrow the forum state\u2019s general personal injury limitations period. <em>Owens v. Okure, </em>488 U.S. 235, 249-50, 109 S.Ct. 573, 102 L.Ed.2d 594 (1989); <em>Ali v. Higgs, </em>892 F.2d 438, 439 (5th Cir.1990). Contrary to Hendrix\u2019s contentions, Texas, not Florida, is the forum state in the instant case, and the district court correctly applied a two-year statute of limitations. <em>See Ali, </em>892 F.2d at 439; Tex. Civ. PRAC. and Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 16.003(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Although Texas law governs the length of the limitations period and the tolling exceptions, federal law governs when Hendrix\u2019s causes of action accrued. <em>See Burrell v. Newsome, </em>883 F.2d 416, 418 (5th Cir.1989). Hendrix is incorrect that his claims accrued when he became aware of his legal recourse; rather, they accrued when he knew of the facts that support his claims. <em>See Piotrowski v. City of Houston, </em>51 F.3d 512, 516 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Whether Hendrix\u2019s alleged mental incapacitation constitutes a ground for tolling is governed by Texas law. <em>See Burrell, </em>883 F.2d at 418. A person has a legal disability warranting tolling under Texas law if that person is of \u201cunsound mind\u201d at the time that an action accrues. Tex. Civ. Pi\u2019ac. &amp; Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 16.001(a)(2) and (b); <em>Grace v. Colorito, </em>4 S.W.3d 765, 769 (Tex.Ct.App.1999). Even if this court assumes that Hendrix was not mentally competent, and that the statute of limitations for filing his \u00a7 1983 suit was tolled, until he filed his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition on February 19, 2008, the statute of limitations ran out on February 19, 2010, such that his June 22, 2010, suit remains untimely. <em>See </em>Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 16.003(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">The judgment of the district court and its denial of Hendrix\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion to are AFFIRMED. Hendrix\u2019s motion for remand and release pending a retrial is DENIED. We admonish Hendrix that, to the extent that he wishes to seek further habeas relief, he must first seek and receive leave to do so pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b381-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
