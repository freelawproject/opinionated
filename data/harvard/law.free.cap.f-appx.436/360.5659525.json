California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir. 2011). Gomez-Luevano filed a response to counsel\u2019s initial motion and a supplemental pleading withdrawing his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s amended brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Gomez-Luevano\u2019s response and supplemental filing. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b383-4\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
