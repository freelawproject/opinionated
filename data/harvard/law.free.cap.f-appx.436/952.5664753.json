Sutton sought compensatory and punitive damages against GCI and the three men under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. He also sought compensatory damages under Georgia tort law for negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-23\">GCI moved the district court to dismiss Sutton\u2019s complaint on the ground of Eleventh Amendment immunity. The three men moved for dismissal on the ground that the complaint failed to allege a constitutional violation and that, if it did, they were entitled to qualified immunity. The district court, in a comprehensive order dated March 10, 2011, granted all the motions; it dismissed GCI as immune from suit and the three men on the ground that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>the complaint failed to state an Eighth Amendment violation. The court declined to entertain the negligence claim and dismissed it without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Sutton now appeals. We find no merit in the appeal. For the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s March 10 order, GCI was entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, and that the complaint failed to state an Eighth Amendment claim against the men.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b974-16\">. According to the complaint, as Sutton was operating a rubber mill, his glove and then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>his right hand were pulled into the mill's rollers. Sharp, Oliver, and Childs, were summoned to the scene by another inmate and rebooted the mill to dislodge Sutton\u2019s hand from the rollers. Sutton lost three fingers and the feeling in his right hand as a result of the episode.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
