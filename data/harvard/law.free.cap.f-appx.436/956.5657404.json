On appeal, Davis argues that the district court gave a supplemental jury instruction, in the form of an <em>Allen </em>charge,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that was coercive because the jury may have misheard or misunderstood the instructions. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">Ordinarily, our review of \u201ca district court\u2019s decision to give an <em>Allen </em>charge is limited to evaluating the coercive impact of the charge.\u201d <em>United States v. Trujillo, </em>146 F.3d 838, 846 (11th Cir.1998). We will reverse only if we find under the totality of the circumstances that the charge was inherently coercive. <em>United States v. Chigbo, </em>38 F.3d 543, 545 (11th Cir.1994). \u201cHowever, when a party agrees with a court\u2019s proposed instructions, the doctrine of invited error applies, meaning that review is waived even if plain error would result.\u201d <em>United States v. Frank, </em>599 F.3d 1221, 1240 (11th Cir.2010); <em>see also United States v. Silvestri, </em>409 F.3d 1311, 1337 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that the defendant waived the right to review where defense counsel stated that the jury instructions \u201ccovered the bases\u201d); <em>United States v. Fulford, </em>267 F.3d 1241, 1247 (11th Cir.2001) (holding that the defendant invited the error when defense counsel indicated the jury instructions were \u201cacceptable\u201d to him).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-15\">In this case, Davis did more than simply fail to object to the use of the modified <em>Allen </em>charge. After hearing the proposed jury instructions, defense counsel stated, \u201cI certainly don\u2019t have any problem with the instruction itself.\u201d This is analogous to the statements in <em>Fulford </em>that the instructions were \u201cacceptable\u201d to defense counsel. Here, defense counsel only stated that he was unclear on whether the jury note from the previous day indicated that the jury was already deadlocked, and if so, he \u201cwonder[edj\u201d whether \u201can <em>Allen </em>charge would be necessary or would help under the circumstances.\u201d After the court informed defense counsel that it was not under the impression that the jury was already deadlocked since they asked to resume deliberations after their break, defense counsel did not raise any additional concerns. With regard to the additional language proposed by the court, not only did defense counsel state he had no objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>tions to this language, when the court asked if the parties specifically agreed, defense counsel stated, \u2018Tes, Your Honor.\u201d By expressly agreeing to the modified <em>Allen </em>charge, defense counsel invited the error. <em>Frank, </em>599 F.3d at 1240. Therefore, Davis has waived review of any such error on appeal. Accordingly, we affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b979-11\">. \"An <em>'Allen </em>charge' is a trial court\u2019s admonition to a deadlocked jury, instructing it to make further attempts to reach a verdict.\u201d <em>United States v.
