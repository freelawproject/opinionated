After the mortgage went into default, the Borrowers transferred title to the home to Val-Com Acquisitions. In 2010, all three sued Defendants Bank of America, National Association (\u201cBOA\u201d) and BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP (\u201cBAC\u201d) alleging violations of the Truth-In-Lending Act (\u201cTILA\u201d) and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (\u201cRES-PA\u201d) as well as state-law claims for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and declaratory judgment. After the case was removed to a federal district court, they filed an amended complaint, changing the basis of their declaratory relief from the relevant Texas statute to the federal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-23\">BOA and BAC moved to dismiss, and the district court granted the motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The only matter briefed before this court is the propriety of the dismissal of Appellants\u2019 claims for declaratory relief regarding BOA and BAC\u2019s status relative to the property in question. Thus, we conclude that any appeal of the other matters dismissed has been waived. <em>Mullins v. TestAmerica, Inc., </em>564 F.3d 386, 417 (5th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>2009) (\u201c[W]e deem this issue waived due to inadequate briefing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">In their amended complaint, Appellants stated: \u201cDefendant BOA claims to be the holder of the Note, and the person entitled to enforce the Note.... Defendant BOA claims to be the holder of the Deed of Trust, and the person entitled to enforce the Deed of Trust[, and] Defendant BAC claims to be the current mortgage servicer of the Note.\u201d They allege no facts whatsoever casting doubt on BOA\u2019s status as assignee of the relevant documents or BAC\u2019s status as mortgage servicer. They simply asked for \u201ca determination and declaration of whether Defendant BOA is the owner and/or holder of the Note and Deed of Trust\u201d and similar declarations regarding whether BAC is the mortgage servicer and entitled to enforce and bring a foreclosure action on the relevant documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">A federal declaratory judgment action requires an actual case or controversy, not a mere hypothetical issue. <em>Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n v. Wycoff Co., </em>344 U.S. 237, 242, 73 S.Ct. 236, 97 L.Ed. 291 (1952). \u201cOur decisions have required that the dispute be \u2018definite and concrete, touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests\u2019; and that it be \u2018real and substantial\u2019 .... \u201d <em>MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., </em>549 U.S. 118, 127, 127 S.Ct. 764, 166 L.Ed.2d 604 (2007) (internal citations omitted). The district court concluded that Appellants did not allege an actual, current case or controversy on these points, and we agree. While there <em>could </em>be a dispute between the parties here, absent an allegation \u2014 even on information and belief \u2014 that BOA and BAC are not who they say they are, there is nothing for the district court to adjudicate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b324-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b325-7\">. <em>Lozano v. Ocwen Federal Bank, </em>489 F.3d 636, 639 (5th Cir.2007), is inapposite. That case involved a declaratory judgment to set aside a foreclosure deed that the plaintiffs contended was entered improperly because they had previously paid the note. <em>Id. </em>at 638. Here, the portions of the complaint on which the appeal is based do no more than ask whether Appellees are the proper parties to pursue foreclosure, etc.; they fail to allege any facts in controversy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
