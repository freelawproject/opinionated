Flanagan Stevedores (JJF) (collectively Respondents). For the following reasons, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">On May 8, 2007, an ALJ awarded Petitioner temporary total disability benefits for four separate injuries suffered during his employment with LCS and JJF. Petitioner subsequently filed a second claim against both LCS and JJF. In that second claim, Petitioner alleged Respondents had violated 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 931(c), which prohibits a person from \u201cknowingly and willfully mak[ing] a false statement or representation for the purpose of reducing, denying, or terminating benefits to an injured employee,\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by withholding from the ALJ in the 2007 proceeding important wage records, medical documents, and other relevant documents. Petitioner also alleged Respondents had violated 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 948a, which prohibits employers from \u201cdischarging] or in any other manner discriminating] against an employee as to his employment because such employee has claimed or attempted to claim compensation from such employer, or because he has testified or is about to testify in a proceeding under this chapter.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">Both LCS and JJF moved for a summary decision on Petitioner\u2019s claims, and on March 11, 2009, an ALJ entered an order granting those motions in part. Specifically, the ALJ determined that Petitioner had failed to present evidence that either LCS or JJF had violated \u00a7 931(c) of the LHWCA and dismissed those claims. With respect to Petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 948a claims, the ALJ dismissed Petitioner\u2019s claim against LCS as meritless. The ALJ did determine that Petitioner had made out a prima facie case of a \u00a7 948a violation against JJF, however, because Petitioner had shown a termination and subsequent refusal by JJF to hire Petitioner. After conducting formal hearings, receiving exhibits, and hearing from witnesses, the ALJ ultimately denied that claim in a separate order. Petitioner subsequently appealed the ALJ\u2019s decisions to the BRB, the BRB affirmed, and Petitioner now seeks relief in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The scope of our review of a decision of the BRB is limited. Our \u201conly function is to correct errors of law and to determine if the BRB has adhered to its proper scope of <em>review </em>\u2014 ie., has the Board deferred to the ALJ\u2019s fact-finding or has it undertaken de novo review and substituted its views for the ALJ\u2019s.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201c[0]nee the BRB affirms an order of the ALJ, we need only inquire whether the BRB correctly concluded that the ALJ\u2019s order was supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole and is in accordance with the law.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cSubstantial evidence is evidence that provides \u2018a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred ... more than a scintilla ... more than create a suspicion ... such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> With respect to findings of fact, \u201cthe ALJ, as sole factfinder, is 'entitled to consider all credibility inferences and his selection among inferences is conclusive if supported by the evidence and the law.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We review all questions of law de novo.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Petitioner\u2019s briefing in support of his petition for review is not a model of clarity, but we can divine that he raises a number of grievances with the BRB\u2019s order and the ALJ\u2019s decision, and alleges misconduct on the part of the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs (OWCP) and other entities. The gravamen of Petitioner\u2019s argument appears to be that the ALJ conspired with the OWCP and the Respondents to bar Petitioner\u2019s claims by, among other forms of alleged misconduct, damaging key evidence and omitting materials from its consideration of his LHWCA claims. Petitioner also asserts the BRB erred when it failed to review and investigate his claims. He further suggests the BRB, in reviewing the ALJ\u2019s decision, mistakenly relied on the wrong transcript of ALJ proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">None of these grievances provides a basis for relief. First, we believe that Petitioner has waived these challenges due to his failure to adequately brief them. Second, we conclude that, even if Petitioner did properly raise his arguments, the ALJ\u2019s orders are supported by substantial evidence and Petitioner is thus not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">We first consider whether Petitioner adequately raised any issues in his petition for review. With limited exceptions, the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure \u201capply to the review or enforcement of an agency order.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These rules require an appellant\u2019s brief to contain \u201cappellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cFailure adequately to brief an issue on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>appeal constitutes waiver of that argument.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, \u201c[although <em>pro se </em>briefs are to be liberally construed, <em>pro se </em>litigants have no general immunity from the rule that issues and arguments not briefed on appeal are abandoned.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The adequate briefing standard is a low hurdle, but we must conclude Petitioner\u2019s briefing fails to clear it. His briefing lacks record citations, citations to relevant legal authority, or any supporting documentation whatsoever with respect to his arguments. Petitioner\u2019s record excerpts, also, \u2022 provide no indication of the basis of his claims. Petitioner\u2019s handwritten notations on the BRB\u2019s order, for example, claim Petitioner \u201cpresented good evidence and releavant [sic] material to the Office of Administrative Law Judge to not grant summary motion of Employers,\u201d but fail to direct this court to that evidence. We have consistently recognized that when an appellant fails to provide \u201c \u2018the reasons he deserves the requested relief with citation to the authorities, statutes and parts of the record relied on,\u2019 \u201d that failure constitutes waiver.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We therefore hold Petitioner\u2019s inadequate briefing waives his challenges to the BRB\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Moreover, even if Petitioner had preserved a challenge to the BRB\u2019s order, our independent review of the record leaves us convinced the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence and the BRB did not err in affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">With respect to Petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 931(c) claims, the ALJ concluded Petitioner had failed to submit evidence that Respondents made a material misrepresentation for the purpose of reducing, denying, or terminating Petitioner\u2019s benefits. The record reflects Petitioner did submit to the ALJ wage records documenting his earnings during specific time periods, but Petitioner fails to explain the significance of these records or how these records indicate Respondents \u201cknowingly and willfully\u201d made a false statement or representation for the purpose of reducing, denying, or terminating Petitioner\u2019s benefits. Rather, the crux of Petitioner\u2019s complaint appears to be his belief that his evidence demonstrates his entitlement to a higher calculation of his average weekly wage for purposes of the ALJ\u2019s 2007 award of temporary total disability benefits. The ALJ\u2019s 2007 order is not the subject of the BRB decision at issue in this case, however, and we lack jurisdiction to review any claims arising from the proceedings associated with that order.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In short, because Petitioner fails to point to any particular statement by Respondents that he believes violated \u00a7 931(c), we conclude the ALJ properly dismissed Petitioner\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">We next consider the ALJ\u2019s treatment of Petitioner\u2019s claims under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 948a. There are two elements to a claim under \u00a7 948a. First, \u201cthe employer must commit a discriminatory act.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Second, \u201cthe discriminatory act must be motivated by animus against the employee because of the employee\u2019s pursuit of his rights under the [LHWCA].\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">With respect to Petitioner\u2019s claim against LCS, the ALJ dismissed the claim because Petitioner failed to point to a discriminatory act by LCS. Petitioner still has not pointed to a discriminatory act by LCS. Accordingly, we see no error in the ALJ\u2019s dismissal of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">With respect to Petitioner\u2019s claim against JJF, the ALJ identified two potential discriminatory acts \u2014 JJF\u2019s discharge or permanent suspension of Petitioner on March 12, 2005, and JJF\u2019s refusal, despite Petitioner\u2019s seniority, to assign Petitioner to traveling gangs or give him lighter jobs when such gangs were conducting work outside Lake Charles, Louisiana. The ALJ denied Petitioner\u2019s claim, however, after determining JJF demonstrated that discriminatory animus played no role in those decisions. We agree with the BRB that the ALJ\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The ALJ heard testimony and received evidence indicating Petitioner was terminated because he cursed at and threatened a coworker and his supervisor. Further, there is testimony in the record to the effect that seniority played no role in the assignment of work to traveling gangs in ports outside of Lake Charles and that this characteristic of the work assignment process was a source of complaint for other longshoremen. The record thus supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that there was no evidence supporting Petitioner\u2019s claim that his difficulty attaining work in these gangs, despite his seniority, was \u201cmotivated by animus against the employee because of the employee\u2019s pursuit of his rights under the [LHWCA].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">For the above reasons, the petition for review of the decision of the BRB is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
