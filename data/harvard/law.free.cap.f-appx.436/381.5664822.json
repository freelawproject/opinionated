Stern, now Mississippi prisoner # 130001, filed an in forma pauperis (IFP) lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against Hinds County and the Hinds County Sheriff Malcolm McMillin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court dismissed his claim regarding exposure to tuberculosis while caring for another inmate with the disease as frivolous and for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and (ii). The district court also dismissed on summary judgment Stern\u2019s claim regarding exposure to disease during an unsanitary haircut, and the court found that this claim was frivolous under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). Stern contends that he stated claims for injunctive relief, nominal damages, and punitive damages even in the absence of a physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">We review de novo the dismissal of Stern\u2019s claim regarding being forced to care for another inmate as frivolous and for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted. <em>See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005). We also review de novo the district court\u2019s summary judgment dismissal of Stern\u2019s claim regarding the unsanitary haircut. <em>See Carnaby v. City of Houston, </em>636 F.3d 183, 187 (5th Cir.2011); <em>Baker v. Putnal, </em>75 F.3d 190, 197 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Stern\u2019s request for injunctive relief became moot upon his transfer from the Hinds County Detention Center in Jackson, Mississippi, to various facilities of the Mississippi Department of Corrections. <em>See Herman v. Holiday, </em>238 F.3d 660, 665 (5th Cir.2001). He does not dispute the district court\u2019s finding that his allegations regarding exposure to diseases failed to state a nonfrivolous claim for compensatoly damages in light of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e). Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Mapes v. Bishop, </em>541 F.3d 582, 584 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The district court did not err in failing to consider nominal damages regarding Stern\u2019s claim for exposure to tuberculosis while caring for another inmate because he did not seek such relief. <em>See Mayfield v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>529 F.3d 599, 606 (5th Cir.2008). Stern failed to seek nominal damages for his claim regarding the unsanitary haircut until he filed his objections to the MJ\u2019s third report, which was more than three years after filing his complaint and more than two years after the defendants answered. By failing to address the district court\u2019s ruling that his nominal damages argument was untimely, Stern has abandoned this issue. <em>See Mapes, </em>541 F.3d at 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">In addition, Stern cannot recover punitive damages from Hinds County under \u00a7 1983. See <em>City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., </em>453 U.S. 247, 271, 101 S.Ct. 2748, 69 L.Ed.2d 616 (1981). Although punitive damages can be assessed against an individual defendant sued in his individual capacity, Stern only sued Sheriff McMillin in his \u201cofficial and supervisory\u201d capacities. An official-capacity claim \u201cis, in all respects other than name, to be treated as a suit against the [government] entity,\u201d <em>Kentucky v. Graham, </em>473 U.S. 159, 166, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985), and Stern cannot recover punitive damages from Hinds County. <em>See City of Newport, </em>453 U.S. at 271, 101 S.Ct. 2748. Also, \u00a7 1983 \u201cdoes not create supervisory or respondeat superior liability.\u201d <em>Oliver v. Scott, </em>276 F.3d 736, 742 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">Thus, Stern has failed to demonstrate error in the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claim regarding being forced to care for another inmate as frivolous and for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted, or in the summary judgment dismissal of his unsanitary haircut claim. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Stern\u2019s lawsuit under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and (ii) counts as one strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 386-88 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Stern that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be permitted to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b403-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
