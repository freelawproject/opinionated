Baptiste challenges his classification as a career offender based on his prior conviction for resisting an officer with violence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-23\">The district court did not err by classifying Baptiste as a career offender. Baptiste\u2019s prior conviction qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d either as an offense that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\u201d United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l), or that \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>Under Florida law, a defendant is guilty of resisting an officer with violence if he \u201cknowingly and willfully resists, obstructs, or opposes any officer ... by offering or doing violence to the person of such officer.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01. Based on its plain language, Baptiste\u2019s prior conviction constitutes a \u201c \u2018felony that involves the use or threat of physical force or violence against an individual,\u2019 \u201d <em>Harris v. State, </em>5 So.3d 750, 751 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2009) (quoting <em>Walker v. State, </em>965 So.2d 1281, 1283 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2007)), and involves the type of violent physical force sought to be punished under section 4B1.2(a)(l), <em>see Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 1271, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010), and under the residual clause in section 4B1.2(a)(2), <em>see United States v. Nix, </em>628 F.3d 1341, 1342 (11th Cir.2010) (holding that a conviction under section 843.01 constituted a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-8\">We AFFIRM Baptiste\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
