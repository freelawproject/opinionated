Contracts, \u00a7 389<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>- \u2014 what are questions for jury in action by contractor against subcontractor for damages for failure to remove gravel. In an action hy a contractor against a subcontractor to recover damages for injury by water to the premises on which plaintiff was working because of the failure of defendant to remove gravel and for extra expense for labor and deprival of use of the premises, the evidence being conflicting, questions for the jury were presented as to the terms of the contract and whether substantial damages resulted from leaving the gravel on the premises more than three or four days.</headnotes><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b682-3\" pgmap=\"682\">Plaintiff was engaged in repairing a dwelling house and- contracted with defendant to do certain cement work on the premises. It was defendant\u2019s duty under the contract to haul gravel upon the premises to be used in the work, and he did haul several loads there, but plaintiff became offended because it was hauled there \u00e1t the particular time and declared the contract rescinded and ordered defendant to remove the gravel, which he did. The testimony was conflicting as to other provisions of the contract, plaintiff claiming that it was agreed that the cement work should not be commenced until the plasterers were out of the way, and because defendant violated this provision of the contract it was declared off and defendant agreed to- remove the gravel in three or four days. Plaintiff denied this and said that he was to begin work at once, and while it was true that the contract was declared off and he was to remove the gravel, he was to receive pay therefor. Plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that the gravel so left on the premises caused water to run into the basement injuring the building, delaying its completion and putting him to extra expense for labor and depriving him of the use of the premises for some time. A judgment was rendered for $32 in defendant\u2019s favor on the counterclaim, from which judgment plaintiff appeals.</p><attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b682-4\" pgmap=\"682\">Sucher &amp; Moore, for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b682-5\" pgmap=\"682\">Scholes &amp; Pratt, for appellee.</attorneys> <footnote data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b682-9\" pgmap=\"682\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
