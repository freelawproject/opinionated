Plaintiff\u2019s original declaration contained no averment that defendant was not operating under the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of 1913 [Callaghan\u2019s 1916 St. Supp. [[ 5475(1) et seq.]. A demurrer to the declaration was sustained and the declaration was properly amended by adding to each count an allegation that at and prior to receiving the injuries defendant had elected to reject the act. The amendment was made more than two years after the accident, and a plea of the Two-Year Statute of Limitations was interposed. Prom a judgment of nil elicit against plaintiff, upon his electing to abide by his demurrer to the plea, after the overruling of the demurrer, plaintiff brings error.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b680-9\" pgmap=\"680\">Browne &amp; Wiley and Butters &amp; Clark, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b680-10\" pgmap=\"680\">Duncan &amp; O\u2019Connor, for defendant in error.</attorneys> <footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b680-14\" pgmap=\"680\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
