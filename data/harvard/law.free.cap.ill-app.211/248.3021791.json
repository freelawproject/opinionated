A statement of claim alleging that plaintiff\u2019s claim is \u201cfor money due and received by defendant from moneys withdrawn\u201d from a certain bank during a certain period and that defendant had frequently promised to pay plaintiff \u201cthe moneys so due her from withdrawals made by him from said bank,\u201d followed by an averment that \u201cthough often requested defendant has not paid plaintiff said money * * * but has fraudulently and feloniously withdrawn said moneys from said bank and converted same to his own use,\u201d although possibly good as in assumpsit if the verdict were responsive to that theory, will not support a verdict in tort for conversion as it does not set forth the elements of a tort.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b303-5\" pgmap=\"303\">W.
