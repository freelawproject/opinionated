Automobiles and garages, \u00a7 3* \u2014 when instruction on prima facie case of negligence in operation of automobile is correct. In an action to recover damages for the death of a person killed by an automobile as he was walking in the street, it is not error to instruct the jury that \u201cin an action brought to recover damages either to the person or property caused by running an automobile propelled by mechanical power along a public street through a residential portion of an incorporated city at a greater rate of speed than fifteen miles an hour, the plaintiff is deemed to have made out a prima facie case of negligence by showing the fact that the deceased was killed by said automobile and that the person running such automobile was at the time of the injury running the same at a rate of speed greater than the law permits,\u201d even though there was but slight evidence that the district in which the accident occurred was a residential district, where the evidence, in other respects, makes out more than a prima facie case of negligence.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b411-9\" pgmap=\"411(23) 412(169)\">5.
