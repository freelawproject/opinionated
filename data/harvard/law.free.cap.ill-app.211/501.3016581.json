Judgment, \u00a7 448<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2014 when party estopped to bring second action. One who, without fault or fraud of the adverse party, takes judgment for a sum less than is actually claimed, is estopped to bring a second action for any balance due him before the entry of judgment.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b555-17\" pgmap=\"555\">2. Judgment, \u00a7 473* \u2014 when creditor not bound by on note.

Payment, \u00a7 6* \u2014 when acceptance of notes does not prevent recovery of balance of debt due. Acceptance of a debtor\u2019s notes by a creditor in the erroneous belief that they represent the amount due him does not prevent him from compelling the payment of any additional amount actually due him, even though he has negotiated the notes.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b556-6\" pgmap=\"556\">5.
