Equity, \u00a7 480* \u2014 when decree conforms to bill for accounting. There is no variance between a bill for an accounting charging wrongful use of partnership funds from which a partner has derived profits and a decree proceeding on the theory that transactions between the partner and another were transactions of the partnership and were on its behalf and for its benefit, and created a resulting trust, although not designated as such in the decree.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b557-8\" pgmap=\"557\">3. Partnership, \u00a7 388* \u2014 when partner not excused from accounting for profits. The payment of certain sums by a partner to other members of a partnership in settlement of claims out of profits derived from assets of the partnership does not excuse the partner from accounting for profits derived from the use of warehouse receipts, of which use the other partners did not have full knowledge.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b557-9\" pgmap=\"557\">4.
