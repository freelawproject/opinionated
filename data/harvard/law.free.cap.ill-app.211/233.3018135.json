Jensen; complainant, against Christian Peterson and Axel A. Bauer, defendants, to obtain a decree declaring null and void a second trust deed conveying certain premises to secure the payment of a principal note, with interest thereon, for the sum of $2,500. From a judgment dismissing the bill for want of equity, complainant appeals.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b288-8\" pgmap=\"288\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b288-9\" pgmap=\"288\">1. Mortgages, \u00a7 56<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2014 when procurance of trust deed not shown to he fraudulent. There was no fraud in the procurance of a second trust deed from a widow to her interest as sole legatee and distributee in her husband\u2019s estate where before the trust deed was executed the grantee sincerely claimed that the grantor and her husband\u2019s estate were indebted to him, and if the grantee had filed a claim against the estate the wife would have received a smaller sum as her share of the estate.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b288-10\" pgmap=\"288\">2. Contracts, \u00a7 78* \u2014 what is sufficient to support promise. A compromise of a doubtful right is sufficient to support a promise where there is an absence of fraud and both parties act in good faith.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b288-11\" pgmap=\"288\">3. Mortgages, \u00a7 54* \u2014 when execution of trust deed not against best interests of widow. The execution of a trust deed by a widow, who is the sole legatee and distributee of her husband\u2019s estate, to her equity in the estate, for a debt owed by the estate, is not against her best interests where the claim was clearly provable against the estate.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b288-12\" pgmap=\"288\">4. Mortgages, \u00a7 5* \u2014 what constitutes good consideration for trust deed by widow. The failure of the creditor of a husband to file a claim against his estate, after his death, at the request of the wife, affords a good consideration for the execution of a trust deed by the wife on her equity as sole legatee and distributee in the estate.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b288-5\" pgmap=\"288\">D.
