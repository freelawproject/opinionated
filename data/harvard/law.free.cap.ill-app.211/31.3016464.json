Master- and servant, \u00a7 620* \u2014 when admission of evidence showing that safer method of work could have been employed is error. In an action to recover for personal injuries to an employee through failure to provide a safe place to work, the question for the jury is not whether the place could have been made safer by the adoption of a different kind of safeguard from that employed, but if it was reasonably safe with the safeguard which was employed, and the admission of evidence showing that a safer method could have been employed is reversible error.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b85-16\" pgmap=\"85(34) 86(64)\">2. Master and servant, \u00a7 800<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2014 when instruction on safe place to work is erroneous. In an action by an employee to recover for personal injuries, an instruction, given at plaintiff\u2019s request, which, in substance, states that plaintiff may recover if defendant failed to provide a suitable and reasonably safe place to work, is objectionable as omitting to state that such failure must have contributed to the injury and as requiring defendant to provide a suitable and reasonably safe place to work, instead of requiring that he use reasonable care to provide such a place.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-6\" pgmap=\"85\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Marion county; the Hon.
