Criminal law \u2014 when new trial not granted. As a general rule, a new trial will not be granted in a criminal case to afford an opportunity to impeach a witness.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b702-9\" pgmap=\"702\">2. Criminal law \u2014 when new trial properly refused. A new trial was properly refused in a criminal case, although the testimony of a particular witness may not have been true, where there was sufficient evidence outside that of the witness to sustain the conviction and the only effect of the introduction of the evidence of another witness would have been to impeach the testimony of the particular witness.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b702-10\" pgmap=\"702\">3. Intoxicating liquors, \u00a7 144<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2014 what evidence is incompetent in prosecution for illegal sale of to affect credibility of witness. Evidence that a witness in a prosecution for the sale of intoxicating liquor in anti-saloon territory admitted that she was not married to the one that she testified was her husband, and to whom she claimed defendant sold liquor, is not competent even to affect her credibility.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b702-12\" pgmap=\"702\">4. Criminal law, \u00a7 388* \u2014 what is proper method of fixing term of imprisonment on several counts. In a criminal case the court should not fix the term of imprisonment on several counts in gross, but should fix a specified time under each count, and also state in the sentence that the time under one shall begin at the expiration of the time under the previous one.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b702-13\" pgmap=\"702\">5. Criminal law, \u00a7 601* \u2014 when case should be reversed and remanded.
