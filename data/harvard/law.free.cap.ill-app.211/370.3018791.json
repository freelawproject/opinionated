Even though a contract for the purchase of real estate which requires the vendor to furnish a. merchantable abstract or guarantee policy in a reasonable time contains a further provision declaring time to be of the essence of the contract, the vendor cannot set up the latter provision as a defense to an action by the purchaser to recover earnest money paid under the contract, where it appears that 6 weeks elapsed before any attempt was made by him to submit anything to the purchaser as evidence of the condition of the title and the latter tenders a certified check for the full amount 2 weeks after the submission of such evidence.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b425-6\" pgmap=\"425\">2.

Where the conditions of a contract for the purchase of property require the vendor to furnish the purchaser a merchantable abstract of title or title guarantee policy and that the purchaser shall pay the first instalment of the price in 5 days after the title has been examined, found good and accepted by him, he cannot be placed in default until the vendor has complied with the condition as to furnishing the abstract or policy.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b425-9\" pgmap=\"425\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
