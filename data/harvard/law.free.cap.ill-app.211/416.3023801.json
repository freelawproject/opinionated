Costa and A. M. Meyer, trading as Grinocchio, Costa &amp; Company, defendants, to recover damages for breach of a contract to purchase almonds. Plaintiff resided in Sicily and the negotiations were conducted through one Pinder, a local broker. Plaintiff inquired of the latter as to the price of almonds for \u201cfirst half September.\u201d Pinder then cabled plaintiff as follows: \u201cLowest 150 bales Palma new crop first half September direct steamer,\u201d to which plaintiff replied \u201c126 September.\u201d Upon defendants\u2019 informing Pinder that they had a price at 120 \u201cfirst half September,\u201d he cabled that the Hamburg market was lower and received a cabled reply from plaintiff \u201cI accept 120 September.\u201d Believing that this message was a direct reply to their inquiry, defendants agreed to take 150 bales. Pinder then cabled plaintiff \u201cSold Costa 150 Palma new crop September 120\u201d (meaning 150 bales at 120 shillings per cent). Defendants \u2019 negotiations with Pinder contemplated shipment before the first half of September while plaintiff claimed the right to ship any time during the month.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-8\" pgmap=\"470(20) 471(38)\">An amended statement of claim filed during the trial relied upon a modification of the contract so as to call for shipment by the 16th of September, but up to that time plaintiff\u2019s correspondence indicated reliance upon his original contention that the contract called for shipment during September. From a judgment in favor of plaintiff, defendants appeal.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b471-7\" pgmap=\"471\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b471-8\" pgmap=\"471\">Sales, \u00a7 18<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2014 when contract through tyroTcer acting for both parties is not effected.
