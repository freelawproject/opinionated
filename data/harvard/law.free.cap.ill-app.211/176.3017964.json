In an action on a mutual benefit insurance certificate the burden of proof is on defendant to show that deceased came to his death as the result of the intemperate use of intoxicating liquor, so as to render available as a defense a condition of the certificate against the use of such liquor.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b230-14\" pgmap=\"230(45) 231(15)\">2.

In suban ce, \u00a7 895a* \u2014 when evidence as to habits of insured is admissible.

The burden incumbent on defendant, in an action on a mutual death benefit certificate, to show that deceased met his death as the result of the intemperate use of intoxicating liquors is not shifted by the fact that the proofs of death contain the coroner\u2019s verdict that deceased came to his death from \u201cexposure by being under the influence of alcohol.\u201d</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b231-6\" pgmap=\"231\">5.
