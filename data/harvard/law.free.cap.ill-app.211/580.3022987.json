Innkeepers \u2014 what is essential to limitation of liability for guest\u2019s money deposited with clerh by posted notice. To limit an innkeeper\u2019s liability for a guest\u2019s money, intrusted to the innkeeper\u2019s clerk, by posting a notice, it is necessary that the notice shall have been clear and explicit and that the innkeeper show that knowledge of the notice was brought home to the guest, and the mere posting on the hotel wall of r. sign reading, \u201cNot responsible for valuables or money lost or stolen in its premises beyond the value of $5.00,\u201d without any showing that it was brought to the guest\u2019s knowledge, is not sufficient to relieve the innkeeper from liability for a sum of money in excess of that amount intrusted by a guest to the clerk and stolen by him.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
