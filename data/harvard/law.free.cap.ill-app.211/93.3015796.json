It must be deemed that the transfer of corporate stock by a husband to his wife at a time when he owed very little indebtedness was not in anticipation of indebtedness incurred only as surety for a corporation in which he was a stockholder, and two years after such transfer.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
