From a judgment for plaintiff for $5,000, defendant appeals.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b123-8\" pgmap=\"123\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b123-9\" pgmap=\"123\">1. Master and servant, \u00a7 537<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2014 when declaration in action for death of servant is sufficient. In an action to recover damages for the death of an employee, the declaration held to set forth the elements essential to constitute a good cause of action.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b123-10\" pgmap=\"123\">2. Master and servant, \u00a7 198* \u2014 when employer negligent as to warning servant going between cars. If an employer is guilty of negligence in failing to give warning before an employee starts between cars in its yard that the cars are going to be moved, it cannot excuse itself by saying it gave warning at the moment the employee was in peril without showing that he understood the warning and that it was given under such circumstances that he could have escaped from the impending danger.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b123-11\" pgmap=\"123\">3. Master and servant, \u00a7 717* \u2014 when sufficiency of warning to servant going between cars is question for jury. In an action to recover for the death of an employee, alleged to have been caused by the moving of cars in the employer\u2019s yard without proper warning, where the evidence shows that the yard was noisy and is conflicting as to the nature of the warning, and some witnesses testify that they heard the warning and others that they did not hear it, the sufficiency of the warning is a question for the jury.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b123-12\" pgmap=\"123\">4. Master and servant, \u00a7 103* \u2014 when servant is engaged in performance of duties. An employee who is returning to the part of his employer\u2019s plant from his employer\u2019s supply shop where he has been to procure material for use in his work is engaged in the performance of his duties.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b123-13\" pgmap=\"123(23) 124(42)\">5. Master and servant, \u00a7 683* \u2014 when evidence sustains verdict for death of car factory employee hilled by moving cars. In an action to recover for the death of an employee killed by the moving of cars in the yard of his employer\u2019s car factory as he was passing between them, evidence examined and held sufficient to support a verdict for the plaintiff.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b123-4\" pgmap=\"123\">G.

Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, \u00a7 1<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2014 what was effect of repeal of Act of 1911 by Act of 1913 on common-law defenses, and how preserved. The repeal of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of 1911 (J. &amp; A. If 5449 et seq.) by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of 1913 [Callaghan\u2019s 1916 St. Supp. If 5475(1) et seq.) did not have the effect of putting in force the common-law defenses of contributory negligence, assumed risk and negligence of a fellow-servant as to a right of action existing, at the time the Act of 1911 was in force, but section 32 of the Act of 1913 [Callaghan\u2019s 1916 St. Supp. 1f 5475(32)] and section 4 of chapter 131 (J. &amp; A. 1f 11105) preserve rights of action existing at the time the Act of 1913 took effect.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b124-6\" pgmap=\"124\">7. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, \u00a7 12* \u2014 when instructions are properly refused. Instructions which ignore the rights of plaintiff under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of 1911 (J. &amp; A. f 5449 et seq.), which was in effect when plaintiff\u2019s cause of action accrued, are properly refused.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b124-7\" pgmap=\"124\">8. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1650* \u2014 when error in instruction on damages is cured. In an action to recover for the death of an employee, even though one of plaintiff\u2019s series of instructions omits to state that the contributory negligence of deceased is to be considered in reducing the amount of the recovery, such omission is cured by a subsequent instruction which states that if the jury find that the death was proximately caused by the contributory negligence of deceased, \u201cthey must consider such \u25a0 contributory negligence in reducing such amount of damages they will allow in event they do allow damages.\u201d</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b124-8\" pgmap=\"124\">9. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1523* \u2014 when instructions in language of statutes not reversibly erroneous. In an action to recover for the death of an employee, even though it may not be proper, it is not reversible error to give instructions in the language of the statutes.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b124-9\" pgmap=\"124\">10. Appeal and error, \u00a7 812* \u2014 when error on ground of improper argument of counsel not reviewable. Error charged on the ground of improper argument of counsel will not be considered where the objectionable remarks are not preserved in the bill of exceptions but are merely included in the affidavit on the motion for a new trial.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b124-10\" pgmap=\"124\">11. Appeal and error, \u00a7 365* \u2014 when new point may not be made. A new point cannot be made for the first time on a petition for rehearing.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
