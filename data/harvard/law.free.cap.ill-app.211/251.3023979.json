In an action against a carrier for injury to a shipment of hogs, some of which were frozen in transit, evidence held to sustain a finding that no negligence on the part of defendant was shown, the damage being due to the intense cold which prevailed at the time and to delays in transit caused by the inclemency of the weather, and over which defendant had no control, and plaintiff having contributed in part by not furnishing more corn and straw to the stock while in transit, he having accompanied the shipment.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-6\" pgmap=\"305\">Appeal from the Municipal Court of Chicago; the Hon.
