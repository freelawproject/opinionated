Railboads, \u00a7 517<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2014 what duty owed to trespasser.

Negligence, \u00a7 23* \u2014 when person may lawfully enter on premises of another.

Railboads, \u00a7 508* \u2014 what constitutes empress invitation to employee of third person to use way along track. There is an express invitation for the entry upon the premises of a railroad company by the employee of a car line company so as not to constitute such employee a trespasser at the time he is struck by one of the railroad company\u2019s cars, while on his way on a beaten path along the railroad track from the car line company\u2019s plant to an ice house, from which he had gone to the office to cash a check, where the work of icing cars to be carried by the railroad company was necessary and the railroad company had designated to the employer that the beaten path should be used as the route between the car line company\u2019s office and the ice house.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b175-9\" pgmap=\"175\">4. Negligence, \u00a7 250* \u2014 when finding as to due care is conclusive.

Railboads, \u00a7 589* \u2014 when negligence in striking pedestrian walking along track and contributory negligence of pedestrian are questions for jury.

Limitation of actions, \u00a7 72* \u2014 what does not constitute statement of new cause of action against railroad company for negligent injuries. The effect of the amendment, three years after the happening of the injury to an employee of a car line company by a car of a railroad company while walking along defendant\u2019s track, of a declaration for negligence charging that \u201cArmour &amp; Company\u201d owned and operated the ice house at which plaintiff was working and that he was an employee of such company, that the right to use the path was given to employees of Armour &amp; Company and that his right arm was amputated, so as to state that the ice house was owned by the \u201cArmour Car Lines,\u201d that plaintiff was an employee of such latter company, that the right to use the path was given to the employees of such latter company, and that plaintiff\u2019s left arm and the finger of his right arm were amputated, was simply to avoid a variance and it did not constitute the statement of a new cause of action, it being unquestioned that plaintiff was on defendant\u2019s premises by invitation, so as render the questions of the ownership of the ice house and of the name of the employer immaterial.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
