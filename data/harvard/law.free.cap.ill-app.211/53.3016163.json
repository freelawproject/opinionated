In an action by a mine employee to recover for personal injuries, it is reversible error to give an instruction directing the jury to return a verdict for plaintiff if the preponderance of the evidence shows that defendant had violated its statutory duty to prevent plaintiff from entering its mine after it knew such place to be unsafe, without also instructing that plaintiff\u2019s injury must have been the result of defendant\u2019s neglect of its statutory duty.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b108-8\" pgmap=\"108\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
