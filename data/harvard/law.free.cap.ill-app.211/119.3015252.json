Sanitary districts, \u00a7 17a<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2014 When instruction on liability for loss of crops due to flooding because of levee embankment is erroneous. In an action by a landowner against a levee and sanitary district to recover damages for injury to crops by overflow, caused by a levee constructed by defendant and by a railroad embankment, an instruction that even if the jury found from the evidence that the railroad embankment combined with defendant\u2019s levee caused the damage to plaintiff\u2019s crops by holding the water upon the lands of plaintiff, still this would not relieve defendant from liability, and as to such damages, if any, they should find for plaintiff, was erroneous where the respective embankments were constructed by the sanitary district and railroad individually at different times, and neither had anything to do with the construction of the other\u2019s embankment.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-6\" pgmap=\"173\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Madison county; the Hon.
