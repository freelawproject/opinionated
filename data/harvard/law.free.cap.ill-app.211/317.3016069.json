Landlord and tenant \u2014 when affidavit of defense in action for rent is sufficient. An affidavit of defense in an action for rent setting up a constructive eviction by failure to furnish heat is sufficient where it recites the temperature and time of such failure, and it is obvious that if the recitals are true the heat furnished was not sufficient for the use of the premises for the purposes for which they were rented, and it is not necessary that the affidavit negative the provision contained in the lease by which the lessee waives all right to claim an eviction in case the landlord is unavoidably delayed from furnishing heat.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b372-7\" pgmap=\"372\">3. Landlord and tenant, \u00a7 319* \u2014 when burden of proving unavoidable delay in furnishing heat is on landlord. In an action for rent, where defendant sets up a constructive eviction by plaintiff\u2019s failure to furnish heat, it is not necessary that he show that plaintiff was not unavoidably delayed in furnishing heat, but the burden of proving such delay is on the landlord, even though the lease provides that the lessee waives the right to claim an eviction in case the landlord is unavoidably delayed in furnishing heat.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b372-8\" pgmap=\"372\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
