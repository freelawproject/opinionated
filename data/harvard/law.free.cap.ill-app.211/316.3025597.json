An oral contract of employment for a year is sufficiently established by evidence of the employee that the employer\u2019s president stated to the employee that the company would pay him a certain amount a week for one year and the employer\u2019s president testified to the same effect and there is no material evidence to the contrary.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b370-14\" pgmap=\"370\">2.

In an action to recover for a breach of contract of employment, where plaintiff\u2019s evidence as to the time he was out of work and the pay which he received when he secured other employment is not contradicted, a verdict for plaintiff will not be disturbed on the ground that it must have been the result of a compromise, merely because there is a disparity between the amount of the verdict and the amount claimed by plaintiff.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
