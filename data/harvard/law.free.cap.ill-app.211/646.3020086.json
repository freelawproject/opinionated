In an action against a railroad company to recover for the death of a pedestrian who was struck by one of defendant\u2019s trains as it was passing through a village, that part of the coroner\u2019s verdict containing a finding that the signal service was out of repair and that the speed of the train was excessive and in violation of the village ordinance, was inadmissible.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b701-7\" pgmap=\"701\">4.

Where a person is killed accidentally by being run over or struck by a railroad train, the legitimate object of the coroner\u2019s inquest is fulfilled by a finding that the death of deceased was caused by being run over or struck by a railroad train, without adjudicating whether it was due to any one\u2019s negligence.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
