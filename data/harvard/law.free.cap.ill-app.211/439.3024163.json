In an action for injuries caused by an automobile collision, an instruction which informed the jury as to the law of speed applicable as expressed in the words of the statute and then directed that \u201cif you believe from a preponderance of the evidence in this case that the defendant drove his car in violation of the law herein set forth and caused the damage and injury to the plaintiff * * * then you should find the defendant guilty,\u201d is erroneous as directing a verdict and omitting the question of due care on plaintiff\u2019s part.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b494-7\" pgmap=\"494\">3.

The question of whether a minor driving an automobile is under such control of the parent as to render the minor\u2019s negligence imputable to the parent so as to bar his recovery for injuries is a question of fact.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b494-8\" pgmap=\"494\">4. Negligence, \u00a7 157* \u2014 when burden lies upon plaintiff to show exercise of due care. The burden is upon plaintiff, in an action for personal injuries negligently inflicted, to show that at the time of the injury he was in the exercise of due care.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b494-9\" pgmap=\"494\">5. Appeal and ebror, \u00a7 369* \u2014 when theory of case may not be changed on appeal. Where plaintiff tried the case below on the theory that his minor son, who drove the automobile in which he was riding, was his agent and driving in his behalf, he cannot on appeal change his theory so as to claim that the negligence of the son was not imputable to him.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
