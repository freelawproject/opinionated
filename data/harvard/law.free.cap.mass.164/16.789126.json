Trial before Morton, J., who entered a decree that the defendant be restrained \u201c from printing or causing to printed in red upon yellow wrappers, adapted to be used in ffting up molasses candy, substantially in the size, shape, and manner in which said plaintiff, Herbert L. Hildreth, puts up and offers for sale the molasses candy made by him, the name 6 McDonald,\u2019 or any other name, word, mark, or device whereby any candy sold or offered for sale by the defendant shall be caused to resemble in its dress and appearance said candy of the plaintiff, and also from putting up, offering for sale, or selling any molasses candy, or candy similar thereto, put up in yellow wrappers, with the red printing thereon substantially like \u201d the method employed by the plaintiff, as shown by an exhibit annexed to the bill. The judge, at the defendant\u2019s request, reported the case for the determination of the full court. The facts appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-10\">The case was argued at the bar in March, 1895, and afterwards was submitted on the briefs to all the judges.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b36-11\"><em>J.

The only question is, whether the plaintiff is entitled to an injunction on the ground that the defendant company was passing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>off its molasses candy as and for molasses candy made by the plaintiff, and thus injuring the plaintiff by unfair competition. On the report it would seem that others before the plaintiff had made molasses candy of the same size and shape, and wrapped the pieces in the same kind and size of paper, with twisted ends. To this combination, which was not original with the plaintiff, he added the printing of the word \u201c Velvet \u201d in red script letters upon the middle and ends of the wrappers. The defendant company used the same combination of size and shape of the candy, and the same kind and size of paper and manner of wrapping, all of which it had a right to do. But to this it added the printing in Roman letters, instead of script, of another word, viz. \u201c McDonald,\u201d in red ink upon the middle of the wrappers, but not upon the ends. It is found that the public is thereby in fact deceived into believing that the defendant\u2019s goods are the plaintiff\u2019s goods, and that the resemblance was not accidental. It is not expressly stated, but we must assume that the public who are deceived are persons of ordinary caution and prudence. The injunction which was granted was expressly limited to the printing in red letters upon wrappers of the same kind as those used by the plaintiff, to be used for pieces of molasses candy of the same size and shape.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">There are decisions to the effect that color alone cannot become a valid trademark, and that a red label on a yellow wrapper, or a white label on a red box, cannot be registered. <em>Re Landreth, </em>in Browne, Trademarks, \u00a7 89 <em>d. Payson's Indelible </em>Ink, in Browne, \u00a7\u00a7 271, 272. <em>Philadelphia Novelty Manuf. Co. </em>v. <em>Rouss, </em>40 Fed. Rep. 585. <em>Philadelphia Novelty Manuf. Co. </em>v. <em>Blakesley Novelty Co. </em>40 Fed. Rep. 588. <em>Fleischmann </em>v. Starkey, 25 Fed. Rep. 127. <em>Faber </em>v. <em>Faber, </em>49 Barb. 357. <em>In re Hanson's Trademark, </em>37 Ch. D. 112. But where for the purpose of presenting his goods to the public a manufacturer has adopted a particular combination of features, in part old a.nd in part new, he may be entitled to protection against a palpable imitation. The case of the plaintiff is not very strong on the facts, yet he seems to be entitled to the carefully limited injunction which was granted. The case of <em>Lever </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>36 Ch. D. 1, is in point upon the principle involved, though the facts there were stronger for the plaintiff than the facts here. See also <em>Fischer </em>v. Blank, 138 N. Y. 244 ; <em>Pillsbury </em>v. <em>Pillsbury-Washburn Flour Mills Co. </em>64 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Fed.
