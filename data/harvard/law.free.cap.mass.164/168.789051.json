Nor is there any evidence that the hook used in this case was not a proper and usual hook to use, although another kind of hook was put in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">The condition of things was known to the plaintiff. He had been in the employ of the defendant for three years, and was an experienced freight handler. It was a part of his duty to put up and hook the grain door; he did it in this instance, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>looked to see whether it was all right, just as he had previously looked to see whether other grain doors which he had put up were all right. If, then, any defect existed in the door which would cause it to fall when the car vibrated, as all cars must vibrate when a heavy load is dumped into them, this defect was an obvious one, of which the plaintiff took the risk. <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Tillotson, </em>140 Mass. 201. <em>Anderson </em>v.

McNulta, </em>147 U.
