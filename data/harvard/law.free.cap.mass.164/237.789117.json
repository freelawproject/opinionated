She sailed from there on June 24, 1890, and, after using various ports not prohibited, she proceeded to a port or ports in the Gulf of Campeachy, and sailed from Alvarado in the Gulf of Campeachy on May 30, 1891. On or about June 14, 1891, in latitude 24\u00b0 24' N., longitude 86\u00b0 14' W., outside of the Gulf of Campeachy, heavy weather was encountered with squalls, which continued until the 16th, when the vessel was abandoned, and became a total loss by perils of the sea. If the defendant was liable for anything under the policy, it was liable for the total amount thereof; otherwise, judgment was to be entered for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b258-6\"><em>E.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq7\">In the present case we think that the words \u201c excluding Gulf of Campeachy \u201d were written in the policy, not for the purpose of qualifying the printed clause in which the vessel was prohibited from certain rivers, gulfs, straits, and seas, including the Gulf of Campeachy, but for the purpose of calling particular attention to the Gulf of Campeachy, which is near the port where the vessel was when the insurance was effected. If the intention had been materially to modify the effect of the printed clause, we think it would have been shown by the use of words more distinctly expressing that intention. So far as we are aware, there is no technical meaning given to the word \u201c excluding \u201d in marine insurance, and the customary meaning of the word does not differ greatly from that of the words \u201cprohibiting\u201d or \u201cprohibited from.\u201d The plaintiff relies upon the decision in <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Warren Ins. Co. </em>1 Story C. C. 360 ; but Mr. Justice Story reached his conclusion in that case with some hesitation, relying upon the particular words of the policy, and not upon any technical signification of the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>\u201c excluding,\u201d which had become established in marine insurance. We are unable to see any such contradiction between the written and the printed words concerning the Gulf of Campeachy in the present policy as to make it necessary to reject the printed words. It is in effect conceded by the plaintiff that the printed clause, if in force as to the Gulf of Campeachy, is equivalent to a warranty that the vessel should not go there during the time covered by the insurance. <em>Odirne </em>v. <em>New England Ins.
