Reynolds of Boston, Judgment Creditor, <em>v. </em>William E. Manning of Acton, Judgment Debtor,\u201d was called; that the petitioner was present and answered; that John F. Reynolds was not present, neither was any one in his behalf present, and thereupon the petitioner made a motion in writing that he be discharged ; that the justice said that he had received a telephonic communication from counsel of the creditor\u2019, from Boston, asking to have the case continued, and against the protest of the petitioner, and in the absence of the creditor, or any one in his behalf, the justice continued the case until December 8, 1894, at eight o\u2019clock in the forenoon, at said court-room; that upon December 8, the petitioner appeared with counsel in the court-room a long time before nine o\u2019clock in the forenoon, and there remained until 9.07 o\u2019clock, until which time the said court had not convened; that the court then convened, with the special justice sitting; that the counsel for the debtor entered his appearance in writing, and up to that time no appearance had been entered for the creditor, but the special justice then entered the appearance for the creditor of Messrs. Barry and Blanchard of Boston, neither of whom was present on this occasion, nor had up to that time by themselves entered their appearance ; that present in their behalf was a Mr. Bayley; that the debtor, by his counsel, took up the written motion filed by the debtor on November 21, 1894, and the justice overruled it; that the debtor then called for the citation, but the citation was not in court, the officer never having returned it to the court; that the debtor thereupon claimed to be discharged, as the court had no jurisdiction, for the reason that the citation had not been returned by the officer; that the justice overruled the motion, and ordered that the debtor be sworn for examination; that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>debtor did not submit to the jurisdiction of the court, and departed ; that since then the court has issued an order for the arrest of the debtor, and the same is in the hands of Henry C.

The magistrate, in pursuance of a previous request of the creditor\u2019s counsel, postponed the examination of the debtor. This he had a right to do. The discretion given him by Pub. Sts. c. 162, \u00a7 18, is not cut down by \u00a7 68, at least so far as this case is concerned. See <em>May </em>v. <em>Foote, </em>7 Allen, 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">2. We do not perceive the need for the presence of the citation at the hearing. The debtor had been ordered to appear, and was in court, and his counsel entered a general appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">3. After this general appearance the magistrate\u2019s record shows that \u201cthe debtor departs without leave.\u201d No fact appears in the record or outside of it to justify the departure. It is not necessary to go into any further considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
