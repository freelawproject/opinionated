An allegation in an indictment for perjury that the defendant swore that he did not sign a complaint charging a person with keeping intoxicating liquor for sale without any license therefor, and that the name which was subscribed to it as complainant was not in his handwriting, includes an averment that he denied having signed the complaint as complainant.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-9\">Indictment for perjury, the material portions of which are as follows: \u201c That heretofore and at the time of the committing of the offence hereinafter mentioned, to wit, on the twenty-first day of February in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and ninety-five, in the First District Court of Southern Worcester liolden at Webster in said county of Worcester before Andrew J.

Bouvier . . . should give to the court then and there touching the matter then and there in question as to the said complaint, in which said complaint it was charged that the said George H. Dumas without any license or authority therefor did keep intoxicating liquor for sale as aforesaid should be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; . . . that at and upon the hearing and trial of the said complaint as aforesaid, it then and there became and was a material question in said complaint whether he the said . . . Victor A. Bouvier . . . signed said complaint ... as complainant ; . . . that the said . . . Victor A. Bouvier, . . . being so duly sworn as aforesaid, and contriving and intending to prevent the due course of law and justice, and unjustly and unlawfully to cause and procure without right the acquittal and discharge of said George H.

Bouvier . . . did, to wit, before John E. Kimball, a justice of the peace authorized to issue warrants and take bail,' at Oxford in said county of Worcester on the second day of January in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and ninety-five sign said complaint, in which said complaint it was charged that said George H. Dumas without any license or authority therefor did keep intoxicating liquor for sale as aforesaid, and then and there, before said John E. Kimball, justice of the peace as aforesaid, subscribe his name to said complaint as complainant in his own handwriting,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-5\">In the Superior Court, before the jury were impanelled, the defendant filed a motion to quash the indictment, assigning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>among other reasons therefor the following: \u201c Because it does not affirmatively appear in said indictment that the offence, in the trial of which the perjury is alleged to have been committed, was an offence coming within the jurisdiction of the First District Court of Southern Worcester or of the justice thereof,\u201d and \u201c because it is alleged in said indictment that it was a material question in said complaint whether said defendant did sign said complaint as complainant, also whether the signature to said complaint as complainant was in the handwriting of said defendant causing said indictment to be defective, in not clearly, plainly, and formally pointing out which question is material and relied upon by the Commonwealth as a basis for the assignment of perjury to a matter material to the issue in said court before said justice then and there being tried.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-5\"><em>Deivey, </em>J., overruled the motion, and the defendant excepted.
