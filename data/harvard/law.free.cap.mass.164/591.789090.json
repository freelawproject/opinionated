In an action by the city against M. upon the instrument, the plaintiff introduced evidence tending to show that the depression was caused by teaming over the sidewalk during the erection of the building; and the defendant introduced evidence tending to show that it was caused by the laying of sewer and water pipes. <em>Held, </em>that the plaintiff was bound to satisfy the jury that the depression was caused by the teaming, and also that it happened within the time covered by the license.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b611-10\">It is competent for the jury, at the trial of an action, to compare the testimony of different witnesses, and to accept a part and reject a part, and if the verdict was or might have been reached in that manner it must stand, if there was any evidence beyond a scintilla to support it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b611-11\">In an action by a city, upon an agreement to indemnify it for all loss caused by reason of the occupancy by a religious society under a license granted by the city, of a portion of the street in front of the society's lot where it was erecting a church, to recover the sum paid by the city as damages in an action against it by a person injured by falling upon a depression in the sidewalk in front of the building, it appeared that the foundation of the building had been put in before the license was granted, which was in May, 1889, for three hundred days; and there was evidence warranting the conclusion that the sidewalk was in good condition down to the time when the erection of the walls began, in May or June. There was also evidence that substantially all the wall was put up in 1889; that the towers were finished and the remaining stone put up in the following spring; that during the construction of the church the sidewalk was used for the storage of stone and brick; that teams were driven across it with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>brick and stone and \u201cbroke it all up\u201d; and that two or three months after the accident the sidewalk in front of the church was relaid by the parish. <em>Held, </em>that it was competent for the jury to find, on this evidence, that the depression in the sidewalk was caused by the teaming over it during the time covered by the license.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b612-5\">In an action upon a written agreement signed by the defendant, reciting that, in consideration of a license granted to a certain society by the authorities of a city to occupy a portion of the street in front of the society\u2019s lot where it was erecting a building, he agreed that the society should \u201ccomply strictly with the terms of said license,\u201d which was granted on condition that the society should conform to an ordinance of the city, the fact that no written agreement was given to the city by the society, as required by the ordinance, cannot be availed of in defence of the action.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b612-6\">If an agreement is signed by a person, reciting that, in consideration of a license granted to a certain society by the authorities of a city to occupy a portion of the street in front of the society's lot, where it was erecting a building, he agrees \u201cthat they shall comply strictly with the terms of said license, and indemnify the city from all loss, cost, \"or expense that it may suffer by reason of the occupancy described in said license,\u201d and the city pays a sum recovered as damages in an action against it by a person injured by falling upon a depression in the sidewalk in front of the building, the city is not obliged to attempt to collect of the society the sum so paid before bringing an action upon the agreement. An instrument signed by M. recited that, in consideration of a license granted to a certain society by the authorities of a city to occupy a portion of the street in front of the society\u2019s lot where it was erecting a building, he agreed \u201c that they shall comply strictly with the terms of said license, and indemnify the city from all loss, cost, or expense that it may suffer by reason of the occupancy described in said license.\u201d A person was injured, after the expiration of the license, by falling upon a depression in the sidewalk in front of the building, and recovered damages in an action against the city for his injury.

Strong, a witness for the plaintiff, testified as follows: \u201c In 1892 I lived at the corner of Chestnut and Everett Streets, the next corner to where this sidewalk was; I think I had lived there nine or ten years previous to March 20, 1892 ; I remember the time when they began the erection of their new edifice, but I don\u2019t remember the year; the building is of brick and stone ; I could n\u2019t tell you how long they were in building the stone work; before they began work, the sidewalk in front of the church was good ; during the erection of the church teams were driven across the walk with brick and stone, and it broke it all up; they made no other use of it in particular that I know of; they had to drive the teams across to get their brick and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>stone up near the church where they used it; I never saw any material dumped exactly on the sidewalk; this driving of teams occurred along by the church, in front of the church; from that time on nothing was done in repairing or fixing the walk until they got done there.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-5\">Edward P. Blake, a witness for the plaintiff, testified as follows: \u201c In March, 1892, I lived on Carew Street; in going to my work from my house, I would pass the Sacred Heart Church usually four times a day, sometimes six; I recollect about when the church was begun ; the condition of the sidewalk in front of that church, before they began the construction, was good, first class, recently relaid; it was as smooth as any walk I know of in Springfield; they used the walk, during the construction of the church, for the storage of material to a great extent, and I have seen the teams drive across it a great many times; brick and stone were stored on the walk; as near as I can remember, there were two or three places, at least, where they crossed that walk, had planks laid down, and a good portion of the time the walk was so obstructed that materials and teams couldn\u2019t get through except here and there; I should say two years, at least, the walk was in that condition.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-6\">On cross-examination, the witness testified as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-7\">\u201c I think the cellar was built of brick; I don\u2019t remember whether there was any stone in the cellar; there was a good deal of teaming round when they were digging the cellar; I don\u2019t think the most of the teaming was done at that time.\u201d Waitstill H. Allis, a witness for the plaintiff, testified as follows: \u201c I live on Carew Street, beyond this church ; I recollect the fact of their beginning the erection of this church ; at the time they began to use it, it was a good sidewalk; it had been recently relaid and was practically a new walk ; along in the early part of the hauling of material there, they would drive in, two of them, get unloaded, drive out down across the walk, and turn out on the north side where there was a regular open driveway; to my recollection there were two or three places where they drove over the walk; that continued up to quite recently, within a year, I should think.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-8\">The testimony of the witnesses, Strong, Blake, and Allis, was admitted against the plaintiff\u2019s objection and exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AzS\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>John M. Keough, a witness for the defendant, testified as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-4\">\u201c I am the janitor of the Sacred Heart Church, and have been for nine years; during the nine years I have been there, there has been a sidewalk laid on Chestnut Street; during those nine years there has been no other sidewalk laid there; I could n\u2019t exactly tell just when they began to dig the cellar of the church, and I don\u2019t remember when they began to lay the brown stone; during the progress of the work they used to drive in there at the north side of the church, go back and forth; the brown stone was piled up between the curbstone in Chestnut Street and the sidewalk; the biggest part of the stone was taken from there in a hand-barrow, with two men, and some taken with a little truck, with two handles to it; this was a little two-wheeled truck, with wheels about three or three and a half inches wide; the stone was put on these trucks and drawn in there; during the progress of this work from the beginning, nothing was done to the sidewalk; during all the progress of this work, the walk was never obstructed only when the big stone was coming in there for the steps; when these stones were coming in, the teams backed up to the curbing on Chestnut Street and then they put a plank on a level with the team, slanted it in towards the walk and lifted the steps from the top of the wagon to the outside of the walk; none of this material or timber touched the walk; it was bearing on the blocking, and the blocking rested one end upon the wagon and the other end on the ground inside of the sidewalk; this same thing was done for each of the tower doors.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-5\">On cross-examination the witness testified as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-6\">\u201c Up to the time they began to build on top of the foundation, the church people had n\u2019t done anything in going over the walk; whatever was done was done after the foundation was up; I could n\u2019t exactly say whether it was after April, 1889, that they began to lay the ashier; when the ashier began to come for that church, they began to store it all along Chestnut Street, between the sidewalk and the curb; they did n\u2019t pile much in front, most of it went round to the back of the church ; they had two ways of getting the ashier over the sidewalk; one was to carry it on a platform and the other was to drag it over on this truck; I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>never saw them taking more than one at a time; they would wheel it across the walk, then dump it and come back and get some more; in July, 1892, two or three months after the accident, the sidewalk in front of the church was relaid by the parish.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-5\">Peter T. McGuire, a witness for the defendant, testified as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-6\">\u201c I passed by the church and property of the Sacred Heart Society on Chestnut Street four times a day for fourteen years ; I remember the time they were building the Sacred Heart Church on Chestnut Street; the cellar wall was made of granite, no brick in it; during those years that I was passing through, there was no interference or interruption of travel upon the sidewalk in front of the church oil Chestnut Street; the corner stone of the church was laid the 21st day of October, 1888; when the corner stone was laid, nothing more than what I should call the water-table to the building was erected.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-7\">On cross-examination, the witness testified as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-8\">\u201c This church is a large brown stone church; there was a good deal of stone out there at the front sometimes ; some of the stone was pretty large ; it was all brown stone; it was piled on what they called the grass plot, between the sidewalk and the curbing; I suppose the large stones were taken over from the street and got in there some way; after the corner stone was on, they did no more work on the church that winter; they waited until the next summer.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-9\">Thomas F. Bourke, a witness for the defendant, testified as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-10\">\u201c I was employed as a carpenter on the Sacred Heart Church; I began to work late in May or early in June, 1889; I continued to work there until the 30th of December, the same year; the work stopped then for some little time; during the time I was there, at the north side of the church, there was a temporary di\u2019iveway made, and they drove in there with the stone and material for the building ; there was also a driveway at the rear of the church on Linden Street; they also unloaded some of the ashier on the Chestnut Street side, and piled it on the grass plot between the curbing and the bricks ; I think there was no teaming in front of the church on the place where the church stands, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>on the brick sidewalk; the ashier that was on the grass plot between the brick walk and the curbing was taken into the premises in a hand-barrow, some of it, and some of it was carried in by two men on to the scales and derrick ; there was nothing done to the sidewalk during the progress of the work that I know of.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-4\">On cross-examination the witness testified as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-5\">\u201cWe started framing the roof in July or August, 1889 ; they were ready for part of the roof in October, I guess; I doubt if the entire ashier for the roof was finished that winter, when the work was stopped, the 20th of December; they shut everything down the 20th of December, and I think in the spring after-wards they finished the towers and put up the remaining stone; substantially, all the wall was put up in 1889.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-6\">Jeremiah It. Driscoll, a witness for the defendant, testified as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-7\">\u201c I live on Greenwood Street, near the corner of Chestnut Street, a little south of the Sacred Heart property; I am a contractor and excavator ; I did the excavating for the cellar of the Sacred Heart Church and got the foundations ready; that was commenced the latter part of May, 1888; in 1887 and 1888 I had the contract from the city for laying the sewers; in such capacity, I connected the Sacred Heart property with the Chestnut Street sewer in October, 1888; that was done so as to be about four or five feet south of where the pipe actually was, \u2014 four or five feet, I should think, south of the north tower of the church; it was a very deep sewer ; the soil was moist hard-pan over the hard red clay within six or seven feet of the surface, and then a mixture of hard-pan and sand ; I had no shoring for the walls of that trench ; I had to dig down fifteen feet, four and a half feet wide, without any bracing; there was a brick sidewalk at that time; I had to take up the brick; I think the water pipe was put in shortly after; there was no water pipe when I laid the sewer; that was put in the same trench; it was part of the same ditch; the sidewalk settled; it started at the side of the trench; it would naturally commence settling there; this had settled pretty near the width of the trench; in the centre it would naturally settle more; Foy pointed out the place where he said Mrs. Cullinan fell; it was right over this sewer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>and water pipe; I laid the bricks j there is a brick curbing against the brick walk; the water getting between the bricks and the sidewalk would naturally crowd them out; I never saw any teaming done but what they used to draw their sand from Linden Street in front of the church and then turn in on Chestnut Street; they used to bring the brick on Everett Street, back of the church, and pile it up, and the ashier was mostly laid on Linden Street; a team could n\u2019t get in in front of the church edifice on the brick sidewalk; it would be impossible, so that there would be no teaming in front of the church edifice only on the Linden Street walk; they built a platform, the wagon was backed up across Chestnut Street and the horse was taken out, and then they built a platform with cribs from the wagon level with the wagon, and built it right straight to the steps of the church, and the platform was taken upon that, rolled in upon the rollers from the wagon on to the place in the entrance of the church; they were certainly two feet, and in some places three feet above the sidewalk ; there was no pressure on the sidewalk; after they picked out what they wanted of the ashier on the grass plot, between the brick sidewalk and the curbing, they put it on hand-barrows and carried it in; they don\u2019t do any harm to the sidewalk unless they do it with their feet; I never saw a time when the sidewalk was n\u2019t perfectly clear; I never saw any harm come to the sidewalk from the building operations.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-5\">On cross-examination, the witness testified as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-6\">\u201c It would be impossible for teams to drive in in front of the church with a load; there were no big stones in the church with the exceptions of the platform and pilasters, no stone that would weigh over 300 pounds in the whole church outside of the pilaster\u2019s and the steps ; all the stone, big and small, that lay between the sidewalk and that church edifice never got in there by being taken in on a wagon in front; my attention was first called to this matter the Sunday the woman fell; that walk had been there probably ten years ; it was not a new walk just laid ; the new walk was laid about two years ago ; that was the first walk that was laid after this accident; the sidewalk settled there, which it does wherever a sewer is laid in Springfield; it had been settling for two years, a little, more or less; it did n\u2019t look like a place in the walk as would be made by crushing in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>walk by weight; it looked like a settle, and that is what I know it was, as I passed by it every day.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-5\">The defendant testified that he had charge of McDermott\u2019s papers and effects, and did not find any such license as was spoken of among his papers and effects.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-6\">It was agreed that Chestnut Street was a public highway; that McDermott, who signed the instrument in suit, died July 26, 1891; that there was no question that the Sacred Heart Society existed; that Mary Cullinan recovered in her suit against the city of Springfield the sum of $813.60 ; that judgment was rendered for that sum and paid by the city; that the plaintiff in this action, if entitled to recover anything, was entitled to recover that sum with interest; that the date of the defendant\u2019s appointment as executor was December 16, 1891; and that the Sacred Heart Society was solvent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-7\">At the close of the evidence, the defendant asked the judge to give, among other instructions, the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-8\">\u201c 1. Upon all the evidence, the defendant is entitled to a verdict. 2. Upon the whole evidence, the license issued to the Sacred Heart Society was illegal and void, and the defendant\u2019s testator was not bound by his guaranty of acts done or to be done thereunder. 3. Upon all the evidence, the occupancy of the sidewalk on Chestnut Street by the Sacred Heart Society, during the term of the license, did not cause the injury to Mary Cullinan, and the defendant is not liable for the amount which the plaintiff was obliged to pay to Mary Cullinan. 4. There is no evidence that the plaintiff has made any attempt to collect the amount of said damages from the Sacred Heart Society, and the plaintiff therefore cannot recover in this action. 5. There is no evidence that there was any use or occupancy of the sidewalk by the Sacred Heart Society at the point where Mary Cullinan fell and received her injury, and the plaintiff therefore cannot recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-9\">The judge refused to give the instructions requested, and instructed the jury, among other things, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-10\">\u201c The plaintiff must satisfy you that at the point where Mrs. Cullinan met with her injury there was a defect in the sidewalk caused by the Sacred Heart people in using the sidewalk in connection with the construction of the church, under the license, and during the period of the license, and they must satisfy you that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>that defect continued, had not been removed, had not been repaired, but continued down to the time when Mrs. Cullinan fell, and operated to produce her injury. I do not think it is legally necessary, in order that the defendant might be held responsible, if the other conditions of responsibility exist, that the accident should have happened during the period of the license, but it must be made to appear so that you are satisfied of it by the preponderance of the evidence, that during the period of three hundred days the people building the church produced a defect in the sidewalk, caused a state of things which appeared and was found in Mrs. Cullman\u2019s case to be a defect, and that that condition continued unremedied down to the time when she met with her injury, and was the cause of that injury. If the plaintiff satisfies you of these facts, then the plaintiff would be entitled to recover. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-5\">\u201c Now, it may occur to you that nobody comes to testify directly to any specific act or acts of the Sacred Heart Society producing the defects. The evidence has been laid before you, the course of events, course of conduct, and you are asked to infer from the nature of the occupancy, which the plaintiff claims to have shown by the evidence, that this defect was produced in this way. And, on the other hand, you have the evidence and the suggestion that, if there was a defect there, it was caused by the laying of the sewer pipe and by the depression of the ground after it. Now, in any matter like this, where you have to find a fact, it is not necessary that there should be some witness called to testify to the precise fact which you are asked to find. It often becomes the duty of the jury, in dealing with a case, to find that a certain thing took place and that a certain thing occurred, a certain thing was done, from evidence of circumstances going before that thing, following after and surrounding it, which naturally and reasonably point to the conclusion that the thing in question or the act in question took place. That is, they may reach the conclusion, as an inference from other facts proved to their satisfaction, which seem in their minds to justify it. . . . So that, as the result of the whole matter, bearing in mind that the burden of proof is upon the plaintiff, it is for you to say whether the evidence satisfies you that this license was issued, and that there was this defect in the street, and that that defect was caused by the use which the Sacred Heart people made of the sidewalk under this license. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>so, the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict. If you are not so satisfied, then the defendant is entitled to your verdict.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b623-6\"><em>W. S. MeClintock, </em>(J. B. <em>Carroll </em>with him,) for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b623-7\"><em>G. D.

It plainly was a question of fact for the jury whether the depression in the sidewalk where Mrs. Cullinan fell was caused by the laying of the sewer and water pipe, or by teaming over the sidewalk. The plaintiff was bound to satisfy them that it was caused by the teaming, and also that it happened within the time covered by the license, and the court so instructed the jury. The plaintiff was not required to show just when or how the teaming produced the hole in the sidewalk. It was sufficient if it offered evidence of facts and circumstances from which it fairly might be inferred that that caused it at some time during the continuance of the license. The jury was not bound to believe all that every witness said. It was competent for the jury to compare the testimony of different witnesses, and to accept a part and reject a part, and if the verdict was or might have been reached in that manner, it must stand, if there was any evidence beyond a scintilla to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">We think that there clearly was such evidence. The foundation of the church had been put in before the license was granted; but there was testimony warranting the conclusion that the sidewalk was in good condition down to the time when the erection of the walls began. One ICeough, a witness for the defendant, so testified. It did not appear very clearly when that was, but the jury, we think, reasonably might have found it to have been in the latter part of May or in the first part of June, 1889. There was also testimony that substantially all the wall was put up in 1889, and that the towers were finished and the remaining stone put. up in the following spring; that during the construction of the church the sidewalk was used for the storage of stone and brick; and that teams were driven across it with brick and stone, and, as one witness said, \u201c broke it all up.\u201d There was also the fact, which one of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>ant\u2019s witnesses testified to on cross-examination without objection, that two or three months after the accident the sidewalk in front of the church was relaid by the parish.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">It was competent for the jury to find on this testimony that the depression in the sidewalk was caused by the teaming over it during the time covered by the license; though they might also have found, if they had seen fit, that it was due to the laying of the sewer and water pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The fact that no written agreement was given to the city by the Sacred Heart Society, as required by the ordinance, cannot avoid the agreement entered into by the defendant\u2019s testator, unless it was a condition precedent or subsequent that he should not be liable if such an agreement was not furnished by the Soci.ety to the city. No such condition is expressed or implied in the agreement, which is an absolute undertaking on his part that the society shall do certain things; amongst others, \u201c indemnify the city from all loss, cost, or expense that it may suffer by reason of the occupancy described in said license.\u201d The society has not done that, and consequently the defendant is liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The plaintiff plainly was under no obligation to attempt to collect of the society the amount which it had been forced to pay in consequence of the defect in the sidewalk. The agreement was an original undertaking, and was not affected or impaired by the fact that the defendant\u2019s testator might have no remedy over against the society. If he had wished to provide for that contingency, something covering it should have been inserted in the agreement. <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Eaton, </em>161 Mass. 496, 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">The jury properly may have understood the testimony of Strong, Blake, and Allis as referring to the time when the erection of the walls began, and to the subsequent use of the sidewalk. Its tendency was to show that the sidewalk was broken up and made defective by the society, and on that ground it was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
