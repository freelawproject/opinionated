There was also evidence by another witness that the track along there was in the usual position in the centre of the street; that it was twelve or fifteen feet from the railroad track to the sidewalk on the side of the street toward the stable; that the sidewalk was the ordinary one, though not paved; that the switch was where cars were turned to go into the stable; that from that point down to the stable door where the accident happened was about thirty feet, or a little more; and that there were signs on the buildings, \u201c Positively no admittance. Apply at the office.\u201d It also appeared that the street cars stopped for passengers to get on or off cars at a point in the street in front of the stable, and that it was the custom for passengers to collect there to take the cars; it was also the starting point for some of the cars.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b143-3\"><em>L. M. </em>Child, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b143-4\"><em>W. B. </em>Sprout, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b143-5\">Barker, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASr\">If we assume in favor of the plaintiff that upon the evidence the jury might find that he had paid his fare through to Prospect Street, and that, in addition to his right to remain unmolested upon the public street, he had the right, upon leaving the car which had been switched into the stable, to inquire of the conductor why the contract to carry him to Prospect Street was not carried out, and to enter the stable to ascertain when and how he could be carried to his destination, yet the verdict for the defendant was rightly ordered. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the whole evidence is, that, while waiting in the public street to take one of the defendant\u2019s cars, he saw fit to engage in an altercation with a person who was in fact one of the defendant\u2019s servants, and received from him an assault which was not made for any purpose which the jury could find to be part of the defendant\u2019s business. The defendant had no control over the place where the plaintiff was, and no duty to protect the plaintiff there from any assaults, although it would be responsible to him for assaults committed upon him there as elsewhere by its servants in the scope of their employment. The suggestion that it could be found within the scope of that employment for a servant to punish him for asserting his rights against the defendant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>of course untenable; nor is there in the suggestion that the assault was for the purpose of putting him out of the defendant\u2019s premises sufficient ground to warrant submitting the case to a jury. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
