And it is further agreed, that the holder or \"holders hereof may purchase at said sale.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-8\">The following paper signed by the plaintiff was introduced in evidence:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-9\">\u201cBoston, Oct. 24, 1892. Received of Harold W. Windram his two notes, this day, payable in thirty days, one for $350.00 and one for $550.00, and, as collateral security for payment of same, his note for $900.00, on thirty days, with five hundred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>shares of the capital stock of the Boston Woven Cordage Company, and 1 agree, upon payment of the first two mentioned notes, to deliver to him the last described note and the shares of the Boston Woven Cordage Company.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-5\">The plaintiff testified that on the day of their date the notes were delivered to him, with the certificate for five hundred shares of stock of the Boston Woven Cordage Company, and in return therefor, at the same time, he gave to the defendant three hundred and fifty dollars in money, surrendered a note for five hundred and fifty dollars, then overdue, (which note was made by the defendant, and indorsed by one Nutter,) and signed and delivered the paper above mentioned. The plaintiff also testified that nothing had been paid on the note, that he had not been able to sell the stock or any part thereof, although he had offered the same for sale at public auction under the terms of the note upon which the second action was brought, and that he still held the original certificate delivered to him as aforesaid, and that the stock was now worthless.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-6\">The defendant requested the judge to rule:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-7\">\u201c 1. That the notes and the paper should be construed together, and, being so construed, showed that the defendant owed the plaintiff only the amount of the two first notes, with interest from the date of maturity thereof; on payment of which the plaintiff was bound to return the third note, and the shares of stock of the Boston Woven Cordage Company. 2. That upon the foregoing evidence the defendant owed the plaintiff only nine hundred dollars, the amount of the two first notes, with interest from the date of maturity thereof. 3. That, upon the evidence, the jury should find for the plaintiff in the first action for the amount of the two first notes, and interest as aforesaid, and should find a verdict for the defendant in the second action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-8\">The judge declined so to rule, and ruled that the plaintiff, on the evidence, was entitled to a verdict in both actions, and instructed the jury to find a verdict in each action for the amount of the notes declared on therein, and interest, not to exceed the <em>ad damnum </em>of the writ in either case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-9\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the first action for one thousand dollars, which was the amount of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number><em>ad damnum </em>of the writ therein, and a verdict in the second action for one thousand dollars, which was also the amount of the <em>ad damnum </em>of the writ therein; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b336-5\"><em>W. O. Kyle, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b336-6\"><em>C. R. Elder, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b336-7\">Morton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ag1\">Upon their face, the three notes constitute separate and distinct causes of action. The plaintiff is the <em>bona fide </em>holder for value of all of them. There can be no question of his right to recover upon the two notes in the first suit. Neither could there be as to the one in the second suit if it were not for the agreement. The condition in the agreement which would have entitled the defendant to a return of the notes and of the stock has not been performed, and the agreement does not, therefore, constitute a defence. The fact that the note in the last suit is described in the agreement as collateral to the other two notes is immaterial. <em>Vanuxem </em>v. <em>Burr, </em>151 Mass. 386, 389, and cases cited. <em>Costelo </em>v. <em>Crowell, </em>134 Mass. 280. <em>Miller's River National Bank </em>v. <em>Jefferson, </em>138 Mass. 111. <em>Royal Bank of Liverpool </em>v. <em>Grand Junction Railroad, </em>100 Mass. 444. Of course the plaintiff can have but one satisfaction of the debt due him, but we see no valid objection to his taking judgment in both actions. <em>Savage </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>128 Mass. 254. We discover no error in the rulings or refusals to rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">\n<em>JExceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
