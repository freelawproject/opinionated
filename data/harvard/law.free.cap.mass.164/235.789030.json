It appears from the answers of the defendants, which it is agreed are to be taken as true, that there are other claims pending against the defendant corporation by persons who contend that they are entitled to share in the fund, which, if allowed, will more than exhaust the fund; and the defendant corporation contends that, before the claim of the plaintiffs is ordered to be paid, an inquiry should be had to give all persons interested or claiming to be interested in the fund an opportunity to appear and present their claims, in order that the fund, if not sufficient to pay all claims that may be allowed, may be equitably distributed.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">On the facts stated, we have no doubt that the contention of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>the defendants should prevail. The fund in question is for the benefit of all persons having claims, within the terms of the statute. If it is insufficient to pay all in full, it should be divided ratably among them.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b257-8\"><em>H. P.

See also <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Irons, </em>121 U. S. 27, 44. If this is not done, the bill may be treated as brought in behalf of all parties in interest, and an opportunity given them to come in and present their claims. <em>Hallett </em>v. <em>Hallett, </em>2 Paige, 15, 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The case must therefore be remanded to the county court, that an order of notice may issue to all persons interested to present their claims by a certain time.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
