J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-6\">The evidence of witnesses for the government tended to show that the defendant, in person, presented the several orders set out in the indictment, and obtained the articles named in the orders. Several of the witnesses for the government testified that, at the time of the presentation of the orders by the defendant, they examined the signature, and believed it then to be the signature of D. E. Graves, whose name was signed thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-7\">The government then called Graves as a witness, who testified that he had known the defendant since 1890, and that he was employed in a drug store in Warren; that the store was occupied on one side by one Dr. Hastings, whose clerk the defendant was from 1890 to 1892, the other half being occupied by the witness as a jewelry store; and that the defendant, during witness\u2019s absence, generally had charge of both sides of the store.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-8\">Thereupon, the several original orders set out in the indictment were shown to the witness, and he testified that he knew the handwriting in which the orders were written, and that he had frequently seen the defendant write. He was then asked, \u201c In whose handwriting are these orders, if you know ? \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-9\">The defendant thereupon objected to the admission of evidence by this witness as to the handwriting, and asked that he be permitted to examine the witness at this point as to the extent of his acquaintance with the defendant\u2019s handwriting, before his testimony on the same should be admitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-10\">The Chief Justice overruled tire objection, and refused to then allow the defendant\u2019s counsel to interrogate the witness wfith reference thereto, to which rulings the defendant excepted, and the Chief Justice allowed the witness to answer the question, and the witness answered that he believed the orders to be in the handwriting of the defendant. At the same time the Chief Justice stated that the defendant\u2019s counsel could cross-examine the witness on this point when the whole direct ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>amination of the witness was ended. The witness further testified that no part of the orders was written by himself or by his authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-5\">This was all the evidence introduced on behalf of the govern- \u2022 ment to prove the handwriting, and the defendant in his cross-examination of Graves, made no inquiries in reference thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-6\">The Chief Justice instructed the jury that they had a right to consider the evidence of Graves as to the handwriting, for the purpose of determining whether the defendant was guilty of the charges of forgery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-7\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b174-8\"><em>J.

He testified that he had seen him write frequently, and there was nothing to control this testimony. It is well settled that one acquainted with the handwriting of another may testify concerning it. <em>Keith </em>v. Lothrop, 10 Cush. 453. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nefus, </em>135 Mass. 533, 534. <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Megquire, </em>35 Maine, 78. <em>Hammond </em>v. <em>Varian, </em>54 N. Y. 398. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Sapio, </em>Mood. &amp; Malk. 39. <em>Garrells </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>4 Esp. 37. <em>Tharpe </em>v. <em>Gisburne, 2 </em>C. &amp; P. 21. Best, Ev. (1st Am. ed.) \u00a7 232, n. 1. The defendant objects that he had a right to cross-examine the witness as to his qualifications before he was admitted to testify to the merits. Without undertaking to say that in no case would a refusal to permit it to be done operate to the prejudice of the party claiming the right, the defendant fails to show that it resulted in any harm to him in the present instance. He had an opportunity to cross-examine later, and did not see fit to avail himself of it. As the testimony was left, there was nothing to impeach the competency of the witness. The determination of the question whether a witness is qualified as an expert is for the trial court. <em>Nunes </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>113 Mass. 274. <em>Commonwealth v. Sturtivant, </em>117 Mass. 122. The presiding judge may conduct the examination . himself, or may permit it to be made by counsel; ordinarily no harm can result if the adverse party is given an opportunity at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>some stage of the case to test the qualifications of the witness, though perhaps the more general and better practice is to permit it to be done as a part of the preliminary examination. Without meaning to say that the court would have the right to refuse any cross-examination on the question of qualifications, we think that in the present case the course pursued was within the discretion of the court as to the order of the trial. See <em>Sarle </em>v. <em>Arnold, </em>7 R. I. 582; <em>Fort Wayne </em>v. <em>Coombs, </em>107 Ind. 75. 1 Greenl.
