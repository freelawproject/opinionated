We think that the latter is the construction that must be adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The word \u201c loss \u201d or \u201c losses \u201d occurs frequently in the bond, and it is evident that it is used as meaning the loss which the plaintiffs l^ave sustained in their dealings with their customers, and not the amount for which the defendant may be liable under the bond. The term by which the latter is spoken of is \u201cindemnity.\" The sixth condition is directed to ascertaining the amount of the loss, and the eighth to the computation of the indemnity after the loss has been fixed. There are two methods provided for ascertaining the loss. First, it shall not be more than thirty-three and one third per cent of a certain rating, and secondly, it shall in no event exceed the sum of seventy-five hundred dollars. When the loss is ascertained in either one of these modes, it constitutes the gross loss referred to in condition eighth, and from it are to be deducted the twelve per cent and the one fourth of one per cent, and the balance constitutes the indem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>nity which the company is to pay. The agreement to indemnify does not apply to the whole of the excess loss with a limit of liability on the part of the defendant, in which case the method proposed by the plaintiffs would be correct, but only to a c\u00e9rtain amount of the excess, and it is from that that the deductions are to be made. <em>Judgment on the finding.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
