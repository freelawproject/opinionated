Church and Fred D. Goode, copartners under the name of Herbert B. Church and Com-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>pony, upon a written agreement signed by Church in the firm name. After the former decision, reported 162 Mass. 527, overruling the exceptions of the defendant Church, and sustaining the exceptions of the defendant Goode, the defendants filed in the Superior Court motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment. These motions came on to be heard before <em>Bishop, </em>J., who overruled them. The plaintiff thereupon, by leave of court, discontinued as to the defendant Goode; and the judge, without further hearing or -finding, ordered judgment to be entered against the defendant Church. The defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b525-5\"><em>W. O.

In this case, as reported 162 Mass. 527, 533, it is said in the opinion: \u201c Although the action is against two persons as partners, and one only is held liable, judgment may be entered against him alone, under the Pub. Sts. c. 171, \u00a7 5, and no amendment of the declaration is necessary.\u201d See <em>Wiggin </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>12 Cush. 486; <em>Downing </em>v. <em>Coyne, </em>121 Mass. 347; <em>Merchants\u2019 Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>131 Mass. 397, 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">We see no necessity of amending the finding. On the whole record, it sufficiently appears that the finding stands against Church alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
