It is immaterial whether the beneficiary in a life insurance policy becomes such by being the beneficiary named in the policy or by becoming the assignee of such policy. All that is necessary is that the beneficiary have an insurable interest in the life of the insured, and that it was the intention of all the parties that he should receive the benefits of the policy.

All of the assignments of error are to the action of the court in rendering judgment for the amount of $1958.41, except one, which is as to the refusal of the court to submit a special issue requested by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-19\">In the case of Scott v. Bank, 66 S. W., 485, this court, speaking through its present Chief Justice, said: \u201cIt seems quite clear that when a special verdict has been returned which entitles one of the litigants to a judgment, there are but two alternatives for the trial court. One is to set aside the verdict and grant a new trial, and the other is to .render judgment upon and in conformity with the verdict. If the verdict is not supported by the testimony, what is the remedy of the party dissatisfied with it? . . . Can such dissatisfied party remain inactive, and, on appeal, complain of the verdict or the failure of the \u25a0court to set it aside of its own motion ? Clearly not, because it is not. the duty of any court to set aside a verdict unless requested so to do. .. . . The law charges the party against whom the jury finds the facts with the knowledge of the fact that the verdict is contrary to his success, and that unless he secures its removal, it will be followed by a judgment against him, regardless of what the evidence may be. This being the case, he must not only ask the trial court to set the verdict aside, but, if on appeal he seeks to complain on account of the verdict, he must do so under an assignment of error addressed to the action of .the court in refusing to set it aside and grant a new trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-22\">.As above stated, there is no such assignment in this case. The only \u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>matters which we are required to consider under appellant\u2019s assignments in reference to alleged errors of' the court in entering judgment on said special findings of the jury are as to whether or not the court has entered judgment in conformity with said findings, or, as we think, has the court failed so to do to the injury of appellant ?</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Taking the special findings of the jury as we construe them the calculation of the court in arriving at the amount of the verdict in favor of the appellee is correct, except the court has allowed five per cent for collecting all of the book accounts, which amounts to $199.39. The special finding is that only sixty per cent of said accounts are collectible, and they are charged to appellant on that basis, whereas the calculation used by the court shows that he allowed appellant a discount of five per cent for collecting the entire face value of said accounts. This would make a difference of $79.76 <em>in favor of </em>appellant, of which no complaint is made in the assignments of error. However, appellant construes the findings of the jury as fixing the inventory value of loans at $5068.69, and their market value at 25 per cent above this amount. If this be true the court has erred in its judgment on said item to the amount of $1267.17 <em>in favor of appellant. </em>Appellee does not complain of this action of the court; can appellant be heard to do so ? We think not. In order for an appellant in any case to require of this court a reversal of a judgment, he must show that an error has been committed which, at least probably, resulted in his injury. If any error was committed by the court in this matter, it not only did not probably result in an injury to him, but assuredly resulted to his benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">notwithstanding the' fact that the verdict of the jury is not complained of by any assignment of error which would require us to examine as to the correctness of the same, we have carefully examined the statement of facts in connection with the special findings of the jury; and while there is evidence on the part of the appellant from which the jury might well have found differently, still, there is evidence sufficient to support the findings of the jury. Such being the case, this court will not set such verdict aside, nor will we disturb the judgment on the ground assigned, viz: that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Appellant assigns error upon the refusal of the court to submit to the jury the following special issue: \u201cState whether or not the said Hessey and said Smith intended the policy of insurance taken out in the Southwestern Life Insurance Company, and assigned by each to the other, upon their respective deaths to be 'paid to the survivor, without regard to whether the one that died was indebted to him or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">We think the court did not err in refusing to submit this issue, for the reason it was not raised by any legal evidence in the case. The evidence shows that the policy on the life of Hessey, which was collected by Smith, was applied for as a co-partnership life insurance policy; that is, that Hessey applied for said policy to be paid to appellant, stating the insurable interest of appellant in the life of Hessey to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>that of a partner. We are not called upon in this case to decide whether or not the fact of co-partnership gives an insurable interest in the life of another, for the reason that the Southwestern Life Insurance Company notified the parties (the appellant having applied for a like policy in favor of Hessey) that it did not issue policies of that character. The Hessey policy was issued payable to his estate, and a written assignment thereof was made to appellant \u201cto the extent of such interest as said assignee may have when said policy becomes a claim.\u201d The only interest that appellant had in said policy when the same \u201cbecame a claim,\u201d that is, upon the death of Hessey, was the amount, if any, Hessey then owed appellant, which, as adjudged by the court in accordance with findings of the jury, was $541.45. This amount the court allowed appellant to retain, and rendered judgment for appellee for the difference between the face of the policy ($2500) and this indebtedness, $541.45, which amounts to $1958.41. This was all that appellant was entitled to under said assignment of said policy. Lewy v. Gilliard, 76 Texas, 400; Goldbaum v. Leon &amp; H. Blum, 79 Texas, 638; Anderson v. Insurance Co., 92 Texas, 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment herein is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Writ of error refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
