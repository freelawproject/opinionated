After sentencing, Her-nandes filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 claiming <em>inter alia </em>that his trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>counsel represented him while under a conflict of interest, because according to Hernandes, counsel was referred to him by a co-defendant and the co-defendant paid a portion of the cost of retaining counsel. The district court found that Hernandes had failed to show a conflict of interest and thus denied the \u00a7 2255 motion. After the district court denied Hernandes a certificate of appealability, he filed a motion for relief from judgment under Rule 60(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The motion consisted entirely of his recapitulated third-party beneficiary conflict of interest argument. The district court denied the motion, finding <em>inter alia </em>that Hernandes\u2019s allegations were insufficient to raise a fact issue warranting a hearing. Hernandes filed a notice of appeal, and the district court again denied him a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">This Court granted a COA, in relevant part on the issue of whether Hernandes\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion presents a successive habeas petition within the meaning of <em>Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005). We conclude that it does, and thus the district court was not permitted to consider the motion. Accordingly, we DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Rule 60(b) provides that the district court \u201cmay relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for\u201d any one of certain enumerated grounds, including \u201cany other reason that justifies relief.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6). However, where a Rule 60(b) motion advances one or more substantive claims, as opposed to a merely procedural claim, the motion should be construed as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Gonzalez, </em>545 U.S. at 532 &amp; n. 4, 125 S.Ct. 2641 (involving \u00a7 2254 petition); <em>see United States v. Williams, </em>274 Fed.Appx. 346, 347 (5th Cir.2008) (applying <em>Gonzalez </em>to \u00a7 2255 motions). A defendant is generally permitted only one motion under \u00a7 2255 and may not file successive motions without first obtaining this Court\u2019s authorization. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h); <em>see United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir.2000). Therefore, if Hernandes\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6) motion is to be construed as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court would have no jurisdiction to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">In <em>Gonzalez, </em>the Supreme Court distinguished between those Rule 60(b) motions that \u201cadvance[ ] one or more \u2018claims\u2019 \u201d from Rule 60(b) motions that \u201cattack[ ], not the substance of the federal court\u2019s resolution of a claim on th\u00e9 merits, but some defect in the integrity of the federal habeas proceedings.\u201d 545 U.S. at 532, 125 S.Ct. at 2648. The former should be construed as successive habeas petitions, whereas the latter are bona fide Rule 60(b) motions. <em>Id. </em>Among the express types of motions that fit into the former category, the Supreme Court included motions that \u201cattack[ ] the federal court\u2019s previous resolution of a claim <em>on the merits.\u201d Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-12\">Here, Hernandes\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion clearly went to the merits of his habeas claim and thus should be construed as a successive habeas petition. Hernandes\u2019s motion consisted entirely of the third-party beneficiary conflict of interest argument that he resurrected from his original \u00a7 2255 motion, which is not a procedural argument but rather a substantive argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>ment. Relatedly, the district court\u2019s finding that there was no conflict of interest, which precipitated the Rule 60(b) motion, was the result of a merits determination; it was not the result, for instance, of a procedural technicality that precluded a merits determination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See In re Lindsey, </em>582 F.3d 1173, 1175 (10th Cir.2009) (holding that Rule 60(b) motion was a successive habeas petition because the motion \u201cdid not preclude a merits determination on [the defendant\u2019s] \u00a7 2255 motion; it was the <em>result </em>of a merits determination\u201d). Hernandes\u2019s \u201cRule 60(b) motion is, in fact, a \u00a7 2255 motion in disguise,\u201d <em>Washington, </em>653 F.3d at 1065, because it is precisely the sort of prohibited motion that \u201cattacks the federal court\u2019s previous resolution of a claim <em>on the merits.\u201d Gonzalez, </em>545 U.S. at 532, 125 S.Ct. at 2648. Accordingly, Hernandes\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion should be construed as an unauthorized habeas petition within the meaning of <em>Gonzalez, </em>and the district court is therefore prohibited from considering the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b707-7\">. Notably, <em>Gonzalez </em>does not posit a bright-line principle that a Rule 60(b)(6) motion is always, or never, a successive habeas petition. <em>See </em>545 U.S. at 530-32, 125 S.Ct. at 2646-48; <em>see also United States </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>653 F.3d 1057, 1060 (9th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1609, 182 L.Ed.2d 214 (2012) (\"[T]he Supreme Court has not adopted a bright-line rule for distinguishing between a bona fide Rule 60(b) motion and a disguised second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion!.]\u201d). Therefore, we do not establish such a bright-line principle, but instead only analyze this particular Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A24n\">. In particular, the district court found that \"Hemandes'[s] \u00a7 2255 claims are without legal merit, are refuted by the record, or are conclusory; therefore he is not entitled to \u00a7 2255 relief or a hearing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
