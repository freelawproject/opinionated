No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372 (2010). Specifically, he notes that, under the FSA, the quantity of crack cocaine necessary to support a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence for a defendant with a prior conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii) is 28 grams. He asserts that this quantity was neither found by the district court nor admitted by him. The government acknowledges that the FSA applies to Jones, but points out that Jones conceded the drug quantity in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-20\">The government is correct on this issue. It is true that, at the change-of-plea hearing, Jones did not accept the government\u2019s allegation that he possessed 33.6 grams of crack cocaine. Instead, Jones stated that he would \u201clook at the evidence prior to sentencing\u201d in order to confirm the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) lab report on which the government had relied. At the sentencing hearing, however, Jones told the district court that he accepted the figure of 33.6 grams of crack cocaine. He also indicated that, as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>result, the mandatory minimum sentence he faced was ten years imprisonment, and he asked the district court to impose that sentence. In light of this record, we cannot say that the district court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Jones also argues that the district court improperly enhanced his sentence pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii). He emphasizes that two of the prior convictions identified in the 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 notice filed by the government were described incorrectly. We are not persuaded by this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Under our precedent, \u201cthe \u00a7 851 notice requirement is jurisdictional: unless the government strictly complies, the district court lacks jurisdiction to impose the enhanced sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>544 F.3d 1176, 1184 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation marks omitted). Thus, \u201c[w]e review the adequacy of a section 851 notice <em>de novo,\u201d United States v. Ramirez, </em>501 F.3d 1237, 1239 (11th Cir.2007), and harmless error review does not apply, <em>United States v. James, </em>642 F.3d 1333, 1339 (11th Cir.2011). Also, because the sufficiency of the notice is jurisdictional, it can be raised at any time. <em>See United States v. Giraldo-Prado, </em>150 F.3d 1328, 1329 (11th Cir.1998) (noting that \u201ca party may raise jurisdiction at any time during the pendency of the proceedings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">\u201c[Tjhis Court has ... emphasized the importance of the contents of the [\u00a7 851] information.\u201d <em>Perez v. United States, </em>249 F.3d 1261, 1265 (11th Cir.2001). This Court has also held, however, that an incorrect description of a prior conviction does not render a notice deficient if the notice \u201cunambiguously signal[s] the government\u2019s intent to rely upon a specific prior [drug] conviction\u201d to enhance the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1266. A notice is sufficiently clear, we have indicated, if the defendant \u201cdoes not allege any confusion as to which conviction the government referred in the [information].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1267; <em>see also id. </em>at 1266-67 (holding that notice was not deficient despite an error in identifying the year of a prior conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">Here, Jones points out that the \u00a7 851 notice incorrectly identified the date of a conviction as November 7, 2002, instead of January 7, 2002. He also states that the notice erroneously described another conviction as one concerning distribution of cocaine, rather than possession of cocaine. However, these are not the types of errors that automatically render a notice deficient, <em>see id. </em>at 1266-67 (discussing with approval cases where similar errors did not render the notice inadequate), and more importantly, Jones \u201cdoes not allege any confusion as to which conviction[s]\u201d were at issue, <em>id. </em>at 1267. Under these circumstances, we think the notice was sufficiently clear about \u201cthe government\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1266.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">Finally, Jones argues that one of the convictions identified in the \u00a7 851 notice is invalid, in light of <em>Shelton v. Secretary, Department of Corrections, </em>802 F.Supp.2d 1289 (M.D.Fla.2011), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>691 F.3d 1348 (11th Cir.2012). We need not address this issue because the enhancement provision applied to Jones, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii), requires only one prior conviction in order to support a mandatory minimum sentence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>ten years, and Jones has not challenged the validity of any other conviction identified in the government\u2019s \u00a7 851 notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">For these reasons, we affirm Jones\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-8\">. Jones relies on the unpublished decision in <em>United States v. Bowden, </em>No. 08-11935, 2009 WL 32755 (11th Cir. Jan.7, 2009), to suggest that the notice was deficient here. <em>Bowden </em>is not binding precedent, however, and other panels of this Court have declined to follow its reasoning. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Mells, </em>383 Fed.Appx. 832, 835 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
