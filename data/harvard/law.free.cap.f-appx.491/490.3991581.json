The Government also notes that the written judgment does not reflect that Count 2 of the indictment was dismissed upon its motion. We have noted sua sponte that this court must remand for the purpose of correcting irregularities contained in the judgment. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>588 F.2d 961, 964 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-21\">The case is REMANDED for the limited purpose of the entry of a corrected judgment reflecting that Santana was convicted of a conspiracy offense and that Count 2 was dismissed on the Government\u2019s motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b516-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
