Baer, counsel for Gilberto Sierra-Borbolla in this direct criminal appeal, has moved to withdraw from further representation of the appellant and filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Sierra-Bor-bolla\u2019s convictions and sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-18\">Sierra-Borbolla\u2019s motion for court appointed counsel is DENIED as moot. Further, his motion to appeal his sentence based upon alleged ineffective assistance of counsel is DENIED. Such a claim, if available, should be brought in a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, rather than on direct appeal. We express no view on what effect, if any, the plea agreement\u2019s collateral attack waiver will have in a future \u00a7 2255 proceeding. <em>See Williams v. United States, </em>396 F.3d 1340, 1342 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (declining to address whether collateral attack waiver would extend to a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel \u201cin entering or negotiating the plea\u201d); <em>Patel v. United States, </em>252 Fed.Appx. 970, 975 (11th Cir.2007) (unpublished) (collateral attack waiver did not bar \u00a7 2255 challenge to \u201cvalidity of ... guilty plea\u201d).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
