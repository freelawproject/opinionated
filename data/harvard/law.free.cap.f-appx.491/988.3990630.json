Code. Ann. \u00a7 7-1-1000 <em>et seq.; </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 657; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1010; 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5301; and the mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. Liberally construed, Tray-lor asserts that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint because defendant Partnership Title Company, LLC, through its attorney, refused to participate in a Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(f) settlement conference. He additionally argues that he provided notice below that the district court judge should disqualify himself, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a), because his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-14\">As a preliminary matter, Traylor has abandoned two of the stated issues in his appellate brief, which concern the appropriate standard of review and whether the district court sanctioned a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 657, by failing to brief these issues. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-15\">We review <em>de novo </em>the grant of a motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Speaker v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>623 F.3d 1371, 1379 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-16\">We review for an abuse of discretion a district court judge\u2019s refusal to recuse pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). <em>Diversified, Numismatics, Inc. v. City of Orlando, </em>949 F.2d 382, 384-85 (11th Cir.1991). The relevant inquiry is \u201cwhether an objective, disinterested, lay observer fully informed of the facts underlying the grounds on which recusal was sought would entertain a significant doubt about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 385. Generally, absent a showing of pervasive bias and prejudice, a judge\u2019s rulings in the same or a related case may not serve as the basis for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>recusal motion. <em>McWhorter v. City of Birmingham, </em>906 F.2d 674, 678-79 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">Under the federal rules of civil procedure, a complaint must contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). In order to avoid dismissal, a complaint must allege enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face and that rises above the speculative level. <em>Speaker, </em>623 F.3d at 1380 (citing <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964-65, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). A claim is facially plausible \u201cwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quotations omitted)). The plausibility standard requires that a plaintiff allege sufficient facts to nudge his \u201cclaims across the line from conceivable to plausible.\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. at 1974. Finally, <em>pro se </em>pleadings receive a liberal construction, but a fraud complaint must allege the details, timing, and participants in the allegedly fraudulent acts. <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir.2008); <em>Am. United Life Ins. Co. v. Martinez, </em>480 F.3d 1043, 1064 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">Here, we conclude that the district court did not err in dismissing Traylor\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim. In his complaint, Traylor asserted that he was defrauded by the defendants in violation of various civil and criminal laws, but he did not allege sufficient facts regarding this fraud to render his claims coherent, let alone plausible. <em>Cf. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. at 1974. Traylor\u2019s complaint did not allege facts sufficient to determine even how he was harmed or what misconduct occurred, and it certainly did not allege facts that would enable a court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendants were hable for any alleged misconduct. <em>See Speaker, </em>623 F.3d at 1380. Additionally, Traylor has not demonstrated how Partnership Title\u2019s alleged refusal to participate in a settlement conference establishes error on the part of the district court in dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim. Finally, to the extent Traylor is asserting that the district court\u2019s order should be reversed because of the district court judge\u2019s refusal to re-cuse under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a), Traylor has not shown that a lay observer would have any doubt regarding the judge\u2019s impartiality. <em>See Diversified Numismatics, Inc., </em>949 F.2d at 384-85; <em>McWhorter, </em>906 F.2d at 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
