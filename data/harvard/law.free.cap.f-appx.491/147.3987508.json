The district court ruled that Carter was ineligible for relief because he was sentenced as a career offender. Carter argues that the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), abrogated our decision in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), that a career offender is categorically ineligible for a reduced sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">Carter\u2019s argument is foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317 (11th Cir.2012). In <em>Lawson, </em>this Court held that <em>Freeman, </em>which did not address how retroactive amendments affect career offenders, did not abrogate <em>Moore. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1320-21. Like Lawson, Carter was sentenced as a career offender, United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4B1.1 (Nov. 2000), and was ineligible for a reduced sentence under Amendment 750. The district court did not err by denying Carter\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-14\">The denial of Carter\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
