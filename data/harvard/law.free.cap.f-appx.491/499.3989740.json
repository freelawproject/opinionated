He first claims that the 37-month sentence was \u201cprocedurally unreasonable\u201d because the district court misconstrued the legal meaning of cultural assimilation in rejecting his request for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-23\">In general, we lack jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s refusal to grant a downward departure. <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 424 (5th Cir.2006). Although an exception to the jurisdictional bar exists when the district court\u2019s refusal to depart violates the law, \u201c[a] refusal to depart downward is in violation of law only if the district court\u2019s refusal is based on the mistaken belief that the court lacked the discretion to depart.\u201d <em>United States v. Garay, </em>235 F.3d 230, 232 (5th Cir.2000). The district court\u2019s comments at the instant sentencing hearing clearly indicate that the court was aware that it had the authority to depart, but that it chose not to do so. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review Rodriguez\u2019s challenge to the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>trict court\u2019s denial of the downward departure. See <em>Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d at 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Rodriguez also contends that the district court substantively erred when it rejected his arguments in support of a lower sentence, and that the court misinterpreted the circumstances of his cultural assimilation because it imposed the element of lawfulness to his failure to assimilate. When, as here, the defendant fails to object to an error at sentencing, we review the district court\u2019s actions for plain error only. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 134-35, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007) (requiring an objection to substantive unreasonableness of sentence in order to preserve error). To show plain error, the appellant must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. If the appellant makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The district court obviously considered the arguments in favor of mitigation that were made by Rodriguez\u2019s counsel. The court\u2019s comments at the sentencing hearing indicate that it balanced the circumstances in favor of cultural assimilation against Rodriguez\u2019s criminal history. The court also noted that it had selected a sentence at the low end of the guidelines range based on counsel\u2019s arguments. As for the court\u2019s viewing Rodriguez\u2019s criminal history as evidence of his failure to culturally assimilate, Rodriguez has not shown that doing so constitutes clear or obvious error.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b525-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
