The district court dismissed because Reagan had failed to file an appellate brief in that court after having been granted several extensions of time and after being warned that no further extensions would be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-19\">In its appellee\u2019s brief in Reagan\u2019s appeal to this court, NPOT properly points out that the district court was unable to consider Reagan\u2019s appeal to it, because he filed no brief. Likewise, NPOT correctly suggests that we therefore cannot consider the first of Reagan\u2019s two issues in this appeal, which he describes as \u201cWhether NPOT Partners illegally seized Reagan\u2019s home after he filed a complaint against it and it filed for bankruptcy protection?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-24\">Reagan\u2019s second and last issue on appeal is \u201cWhether the district court erred in dismissing Reagan\u2019s appeal of the bankruptcy court\u2019s dismissal of the adversary proceeding against NPOT Partners?\u201d The district court did not err and surely did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the appeal to it from the bankruptcy court in light of the numerous extensions and warnings given to Reagan by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-25\">The judgment of the district court, dismissing the appeal of the judgment of the bankruptcy court, is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b503-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
