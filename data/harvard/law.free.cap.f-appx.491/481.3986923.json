Specifically, he challenges the district court\u2019s application of the 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), based upon his prior conviction for a crime of violence, namely, the Georgia offense of aggravated assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Soto-Romero contends that the Georgia statute of conviction is not an enumerated offense and does not implicate the residual \u201cuse of force\u201d prong of \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s definition. Because he did not object on this basis below, this court\u2019s review is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 351 (5th Cir.2008). To establish reversible plain error, Soto-Romero must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Using a \u201ccommon sense approach,\u201d we hold that the district court did not plainly err in its determination that the generic, contemporary meaning of the offense of aggravated assault includes the intentionally-caused apprehension of injury, 2 Wayne R. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law, \u00a7 16.3 (2d ed.2003), and that Soto-Romero\u2019s Georgia offense falls within that generic, contemporary meaning. <em>United States v. Santiesteban-Hernandez, </em>469 F.3d 376, 378-79 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Sanchez-Ruedas, </em>452 F.3d 409, 411, 414 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b508-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
