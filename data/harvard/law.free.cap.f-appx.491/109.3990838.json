First, he argues that the government failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he violated Florida law, and, thus, the terms of his supervised release. Second, he contends that the district court improperly admitted hearsay evidence at his revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">We review the court\u2019s determination that a defendant violated the terms of his supervised release for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Copeland, </em>20 F.3d 412, 413 (11th Cir.1994). We review a district court\u2019s fact findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Almand, </em>992 F.2d 316, 318 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-15\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), a district court may revoke a term of supervised release and impose a term of imprisonment upon a defendant who violates the terms of his supervised release if the government proves such a violation by a preponderance of the evidence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3); <em>see also United States v. Cunningham, </em>607 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-16\">Under the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, the government must convince the court that \u201cthe existence of a fact is more probable than its nonexistence.\u201d <em>United States v. Almedina, </em>686 F.3d 1312, 1315 (11th Cir.2012) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-17\">In May 2011, a police officer in North Miami Beach pulled over a Range Rover being driven by Lance Hall. Andre, who was driving an Audi in front of the Range Rover, also pulled over and approached the Range Rover. He left the scene after the officer told him to return to his car. Pursuant to a canine unit\u2019s alert for the presence of drugs, the officer searched the Range Rover.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-18\">The officer did not find any drugs but did find a zippered Louis Vuitton wallet in the car. The wallet contained Andre\u2019s drivers license, social security card, high school diploma, his doctor\u2019s business card, his probation officer\u2019s business card, and his girlfriend\u2019s business card. The wallet also contained two temporary Wal-Mart money cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-19\">The police traced the two Wal-Mart cards. The IRS had deposited tax refunds onto the cards, in accordance with tax returns purportedly filed in New York by \u201cJosette B.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and \u201cKathleen W.\u201d The police found that Josette B. had moved out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>the area with no forwarding address. However, Kathleen W. was interviewed and stated that she had not filed a tax return in over ten years, nor had she ever been to New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The cards\u2019 history also showed that they had been used at a local Louis Vuitton store to purchase, <em>inter alia, </em>a zippered wallet similar to the one found during the traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The district court concluded that Andre had filed fraudulent tax returns in others\u2019 names and then directed the IRS to deposit the refunds onto the Wal-Mart cards, which he used to buy Louis Vuitton items.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These acts violated Florida statutes forbidding the fraudulent use of a credit card,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> theft,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the fraudulent use of personal information.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because of these violations of state law, Andre had necessarily violated the terms of his supervised release. He was sentenced to eighteen months.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion. There is more than enough evidence to conclude that Andre was the person who filled out the tax returns and fraudulently used the Wal-Mart cards. The cards were found inside a wallet that (a) had likely been purchased using one the Wal-Mart cards and (b) contained all of Andre\u2019s important personal documents. The wallet was in a car that was later determined to be registered to Andre\u2019s girlfriend, and the car had been following Andre when the police pulled it over. Andre had approached the Range Rover before the officer told him to go back to the Audi. This shows that Andre likely had possession and knowledge of the cards prior to the traffic stop. As for the source of the funds, Kathleen W. stated that she had not filed any tax returns in ten years and that she had never been to New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>By using the Wal-Mart cards to make purchases and defraud Louis Vuitton, Andre fraudulently used the credit cards in violation of Florida law. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 817.61. As for the theft charge, Florida courts have held that the fraudulent use of a credit card will necessarily entail committing theft. <em>Wolf v. State, </em>679 So.2d 351, 353 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1996) (\u201c[I]t is not possible to commit an offense under section 817.61 [forbidding the fraudulent use of a credit card] and not commit a theft\u201d). And by using Kathleen W.\u2019s information to obtain the IRS refunds, Andre fraudulently used another person\u2019s identification without permission. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 817.568(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">The government did not need to produce evidence showing beyond a reasonable doubt that Andre committed these violations; there only needed to be a preponderance of evidence. We find no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that the government produced sufficient evidence of these violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Andre next contends that the district court erred by considering hearsay at the revocation hearing. The Supreme Court has held that the \u201cfull panoply of rights due a defendant\u201d at trial do not apply in a supervised release revocation hearing. <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 480, 92 5.Ct. 2593, 2600, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972) (discussing a revocation of parole); <em>see United States v. Frazier, </em>26 F.3d 110, 113-14 (11th Cir.1994) (noting that \u201ccourts treat revocations the same whether they involve probation, parole, or supervised release\u201d). The revocation procedure should be flexible enough for the court \u201cto consider evidence including letters, affidavits, and other material that would not be admissible in an adversary criminal trial.\u201d <em>Morrissey, </em>408 U.S. at 489, 92 S.Ct. at 2604.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">Hearsay testimony may be admitted in a supervised release revocation hearing where the court concludes that the testimony is reliable and balances \u201cthe defendant\u2019s right to confront adverse witnesses against the grounds asserted by the government for denying confrontation.\u201d <em>Frazier, </em>26 F.3d at 114. The district court\u2019s failure to make these findings will constitute harmful error where the defendant shows both \u201c(1) that the challenged evidence is materially false or unreliable, and (2) that it actually served as the basis for the sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>931 F.2d 842, 847 (11th Cir.1991) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">There is no error with respect to the comments made by Lance Hall because they did not serve as the basis for Andre\u2019s sentence, nor has Andre shown that they are materially false or unreliable. <em>See id. </em>As for the comments made by Kathleen W., Andre similarly has not shown that the statements are materially false or unreliable. <em>See id.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b136-13\">. For privacy, we include only the first letter of their last names.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b137-7\">. When Andre was arrested in August 2011, he was found with another Louis Vuitton wallet that contained another temporary Wal-Mart card. Like the others, this card had received funds from the IRS in accordance with a tax return, this time in the name of \u201cMary B.\" Mary B. submitted a signed affidavit to the police saying that she did not know Andre, did not give him permission to possess her information nor to receive money from the IRS on her behalf, and that she had not filed a tax return in over ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Because the government\u2019s petition for revocation included only the May 2011 offenses, the district court considered the facts from August 2011 only as background surrounding the circumstances of Andre\u2019s arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b137-9\">.

The district court did not rely on the affidavit signed by Mary B, which addressed the circumstances surrounding the Wal-Mart card found incident to Andre's arrest in August 2011. Those events were not the subject of the revocation hearing, and in any event, Andre failed to show that the affidavit would be materially false or unreliable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
