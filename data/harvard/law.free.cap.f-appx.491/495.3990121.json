Because the BIA approved of and relied upon the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decisions of both the BIA and the IJ. <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-22\">Chen argues that the BIA erred in denying his application for withholding of removal. We review that denial for substantial evidence, reversing only if the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Id. </em>We find that the BIA\u2019s determination that Chen did not suffer past persecution and does not harbor a well-founded fear of future persecution based on an enumerated ground is supported by substantial evidence. Taking all of his statements as true, the BIA concluded that the enumerated incidents, which occurred during Chen\u2019s schooling, did not rise to the level of persecution. We agree that Chen has not shown that the evidence compels a contrary determination. <em>See Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-23\">Turning to relief under the CAT, Chen argues that the BIA erred in denying his application. \u201cTorture is defined as any act by which severe pain or suffering ... is intentionally inflicted on a person ... when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1). To obtain relief under the CAT, an applicant must show that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>be tortured if returned to his home country. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2); <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344-45 (5th Cir.2005). Chen\u2019s testimony did not show that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government and its officials, acting in their official capacity, would torture him or acquiesce in his torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Chen does not argue any error with respect to the BIA\u2019s denial of his application for asylum. Accordingly, he has waived review of any issue related to the denial of his asylum application. <em>See Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 793 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The petition for review of the denial of withholding of removal and protection under the CAT is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b521-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
