On appeal, Saucedo-Garcia argues that the district court plainly erred in applying a 12-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 21, 1.2(b)(1)(B) because his prior state conviction for cannabis possession is not a \u201cdrug-trafficking offense.\u201d The government concedes plain error and requests a limited remand so that the district court can re-sentence Saucedo-Garcia using the 4-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 21, 1.2(b)(1)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-13\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 21, 1.2(b)(1)(B), the sentencing court imposes a 12-level increase in the base offense level if the defendant was deported following \u201ca conviction for a felony drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed was 13 months or less.... \u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 21, 1.2(b)(1)(B). If the defendant was deported following \u201cany other felony,\u201d the sentencing court applies a 4-level enhancement. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 21,1.2(b)(1)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-14\">A \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d is \u201can offense under federal, state, or local law that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of, or offer to sell a controlled substance (or counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. l(B)(iv). This Court has concluded that simple \u201c[possession, both actual and attempted, fails to qualify as a drug trafficking offense under the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Aguilar-Ortiz, </em>450 F.3d 1271, 1275 (11th Cir.2006) (concluding that solicitation of a personal quantity of a drug, which is essentially attempted possession without the intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>distribute, is not a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Because Saucedo-Garcia did not object to the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B) 12-level enhancement at sentencing, our review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Bonilla, </em>579 F.3d 1288, 1238 (11th Cir.2009). Plain error occurs when there is error, that is plain, that affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and that seriously affects the fairness, integrity and public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>661 F.3d 568, 583 (11th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 1943, 182 L.Ed.2d 799 (2012). For error to be plain, it must be \u201cplain under controlling precedent or in view of the unequivocally clear words of a statute or rule.\u201d <em>United States v. Lett, </em>483 F.3d 782, 790 (11th Cir.2007); <em>see also United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Here, the 12-level enhancement was based on Saucedo-Garcia\u2019s having a Florida felony conviction for cannabis possession. However, Saucedo-Garcia was convicted under Florida Statutes \u00a7 893.13(6)(a), Florida\u2019s simple possession statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under the explicit language of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) and the commentary thereto defining a \u201cdrug trafficking offense,\u201d as well as this Court\u2019s precedent in <em>Aguilar-Ortiz, </em>Saucedo-Garcia\u2019s simple possession conviction does not qualify as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d Thus, the district court committed error that is plain when it applied the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) 12-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">Moreover, Saucedo-Garcia has shown that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 831-32 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cA substantial right is affected if the appealing party can show that there is a reasonable probability that there would have been a different result had there been no error.\u201d). The parties requested a sentence within the guidelines range. The district court complied and imposed a 30-month sentence. While the 30-month sentence is at the low end of the incorrectly calculated guidelines range of 30 to 37 months, it is significantly outside the correctly calculated guidelines range of 10 to 16 months (calculated using the 4-level increase for \u201cany other felony\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(D)). Although the district court has the discretion to impose a reasonable upward variance, a review of the record as a whole indicates that the district court here intended to impose a sentence within the applicable guidelines range. Under the particular facts of this case, there is a reasonable probability that the district court would have sentenced Saucedo-Garcia differently had the offense level been calculated correctly under \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See United States v. Frazier, </em>605 F.3d 1271, 1282-83 (11th Cir.2010) (concluding that the third prong of the plain error test was satisfied where the sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>was at the high end of the miscalculated guidelines range, but outside the correctly-calculated guidelines range).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Accordingly, we vacate Saucedo-Gareia\u2019s sentence and remand for the limited purpose of resentencing in light of the correctly calculated advisory guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-8\">. Florida employs a three-tiered scheme for cannabis possession offenses, consisting of: (1) possession of cannabis, under Florida Statutes \u00a7 893.13(6), with less than 20 grams being a misdemeanor and 20 or more grams being a third-degree felony; (2) possession of cannabis with intent to sell, manufacture or deliver, under Florida Statutes \u00a7 893.13(l)(a)(2), which is also a third degree felony; and (3) cannabis trafficking possession, under Florida Statutes \u00a7 893.135, which requires the defendant to knowingly possess \u201cin excess of 25 pounds\u201d of cannabis or \u201c300 or more cannabis plants.\u201d Saucedo-Garcia was convicted of simple possession under Florida Statutes \u00a7 893.13(6)(a), the first tier of the scheme. <em>Cf. United States v. Madera-Madera, </em>333 F.3d 1228, 1231-32 (11th Cir.2003) (concluding that defendant\u2019s Georgia conviction for methamphetamine possession under the highest tier of a similar \u201cthree-tiered scheme,\u201d that is, trafficking by possessing designated amount of drugs, was a \"drug trafficking offense\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b146-16\">. We note that this case is distinguishable from <em>United States v. Pantle, </em>637 F.3d 1172 (11th Cir.2011), in which the district court miscalculated the guidelines range, but imposed the statutory maximum sentence and indicated a desire to impose an even higher sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
