He asserts that the district court plainly erred by assigning a criminal history point under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(f) (2009) under the theo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>ry that the sentence for one of his North Carolina crimes of violence did not receive any points because it was counted together with the sentence imposed for the other North Carolina offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2). He asserts that the two offenses were consolidated in a single judgment that produced a single sentence under North Carolina General Statutes \u00a7 15A-1340.15(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The North Carolina procedure does not affect the Guideline \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2) direction that \u201cany prior sentence covered by (A) or (B)\u201d is counted as a single sentence. It follows that, whether the district judge added one history point because of \u00a7 4Al.l(f) or three more for the second crime of violence, there was no error for defendant\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b540-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
