No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-19\">Duong first argues that the evidence at trial was insufficient for the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that he conspired to distribute crack cocaine. He maintains that the government failed to show the existence of an illegal agreement to distribute drugs, and he says that the evidence at most proved a conspiracy to possess jointly and to use crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-20\">We review challenges to sufficiency of the evidence <em>de novo. United States v. Klopf, </em>423 F.3d 1228, 1236 (11th Cir.2005). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and draw all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Id. </em>A defendant\u2019s own testimony, if disbelieved by the jury, can be considered as substantive evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>564 F.3d 1280, 1285 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-21\">To convict a defendant of conspiracy under section 846, the government must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>prove beyond a reasonable doubt (1) an agreement between the defendant and at least one other person, (2) the object of which was to violate the narcotics laws. <em>United States v. Toler, </em>144 F.3d 1423, 1426 (11th Cir.1998). The government can prove these elements by circumstantial evidence and need not demonstrate the existence of a formal agreement. <em>Id. </em>But a conspiracy conviction cannot be based on \u201cconjecture and innuendo;\u201d and the government does not meet its burden by merely proving that a defendant\u2019s participation in a conspiracy is possible or even plausible. <em>United States v. Hardy, </em>895 F.2d 1331, 1335 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">Based on the whole evidence \u2014 Duong\u2019s use of a drug courier, his pooling of funds with others to buy crack cocaine in bulk, and his implicit agreement with Diem Nguyen for her to bring customers to him to buy crack cocaine \u2014 was more than sufficient to convict Duong of a distribution conspiracy. Diem \u2014 who agreed to cooperate with the government in return for more lenient treatment on her own drug distribution charges \u2014 testified that she brought customers to Duong\u2019s home to purchase crack cocaine on at least ten separate occasions and that she occasionally received compensation from the customers for this service. As a result, Diem helped further Duong\u2019s drug distribution business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">Duong himself testified that he purchased crack cocaine through a \u201crunner\u201d named Dang Nguyen, who would purchase the drugs for him up to three times a week. Although no testimony stated that Dang was involved in distributing the crack cocaine, the jury could have reasonably inferred from his frequent trips to and his presence at Duong\u2019s house that Dang knew that Duong sold some of the crack cocaine purchased from him. See <em>United States v. McDowell, </em>250 F.3d 1354, 1365 (11th Cir.2001) (noting that, the jury is free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">While Duong\u2019s drug-distribution business mainly consisted of a one-man operation, sufficient evidence allowed the jury to infer reasonably the existence of an agreement with a joint criminal objective between Duong and at least one other person. <em>See United States v. Mercer, </em>165 F.3d 1331, 1335 (11th Cir.1999) (noting that, an \u201cagreement may be inferred when the evidence shows a continuing relationship that results in the repeated transfer of illegal drugs to the purchaser\u201d). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict and resolving all credibility determinations in support of that verdict, sufficient evidence supports Duong\u2019s conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-8\">Duong next argues that the district court erred in applying a role enhancement at sentencing, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). He says the court placed undue emphasis on Duong\u2019s use of the term \u201crunner\u201d to describe the person through whom he purchased crack cocaine, as opposed to considering evidence about the person\u2019s actual role. The district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in an offense is a factual finding that we review for clear error. <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d 1344, 1355 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-9\">Section 3B 1.1(c) provides for a two-level increase in a defendant\u2019s offense level if he was \u201can organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in any criminal activity....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). \u201c[T]he assertion of control or influence over only one individual is enough to support a \u00a7 3B 1.1(c) en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>hancement.\u201d <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d 1243, 1251 (11th Cir.2000). Factors to consider in determining whether the defendant qualifies for the section 3B 1.1(c) role enhancement include (1) the exercise of decision-making authority; (2) the nature of participation; (3) the recruitment of accomplices; (4) the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime; (5) the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense; (6) the nature and scope of the illegal activity; and (7) the degree of control and authority exercised over others. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment. (n.4). A \u201cparticipant\u201d cannot be an undercover officer; he must be someone \u201cwho is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense, but need not have been convicted.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.l). The government has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the existence of an aggravating role. <em>United States v. Glinton, </em>154 F.3d 1245, 1260 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">Here, the record shows that the district court did not clearly err in applying an aggravating-role enhancement at sentencing, under section 3B 1.1(c). Duong testified that Dang would procure crack cocaine for him whenever he needed more, sometimes up to three times per week. Dang was a \u201cparticipant\u201d because he was criminally responsible for the conspiracy offense, even though he was not charged or convicted. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment. (n.l). Although Duong testified that he did not know from whom or where Dang purchased the crack cocaine, the underlying facts indicated that Duong exercised some level of control or influence over Dang because Dang purchased crack cocaine for Duong at Duong\u2019s request and direction. <em>See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., </em>470 U.S. 564, 573-74, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (explaining that under the clear error standard, \u201c[i]f the district court\u2019s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">For these reasons, we affirm Duong\u2019s conspiracy conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
