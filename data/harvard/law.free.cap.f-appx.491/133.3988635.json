On appeal, Mr. Blue challenges his sentence, arguing that the district court incorrectly characterized his violations as Grade B violations under the Sentencing Guidelines, and that the sentence was substantively unreasonable. After review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">First, the district court correctly concluded that one of the violations was a Grade B violation and that Mr. Blue had an advisory range of 21-27 months\u2019 imprisonment under Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See </em>D.E. 210 at 115. One of Mr. Blue\u2019s violations was the filing of a false monthly report with the probation office, and because such a violation \u201cfit[s] within the conduct covered by [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1001, and that statute provides a term of imprisonment of up to five years, the district court did not err in concluding that the false statements [in the monthly report] constituted [a] Grade B violation under the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Grimes, </em>54 F.3d 489, 492 (8th Cir.1995). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(2) (\u201cconduct constituting any other federal, state, or local offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year\u201d is a Grade B violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">Second, reviewing under the deferential abuse of discretion standard, <em>see Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), we cannot say that the 36-month sentence was substantively unreasonable. The Sentencing guidelines provide that an upward departure from the Chapter 7 advisory range may be appropriate where \u201cthe original sentence was the result of a downward departure (e.g., as a reward for substantial assistance) ... that resulted in a sentence below the guideline range applicable to the defendant\u2019s conduct [.].\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4, comment, n. 4. The district court, while discussing the relevant sentencing factors, specifically relied on this rationale, noting that Mr. Blue had received a downward departure from 360 months to 120 months at his original sentencing due to his cooperation. <em>See </em>D.E. 210 at 123 <em>{\u201cI find that this variance upward is warranted because of the substantial departure that you received for your original sentence. </em>I also find that the sentence is a reasonable one based upon the seriousness of the offense, the need to promote respect for the law and provide just punishment for the offense, to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; to protect from any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>further crimes of you, Mr. Blue, and to provide you with the need[ed] ... care or ... treatment [.].\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Mr. Blue\u2019s 36-month sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
