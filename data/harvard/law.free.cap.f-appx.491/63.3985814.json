Fairchild, </em>803 F.2d 1121, 1124 (11th Cir.1986) (\u201cA guilty plea, since it admits all the elements of a formal criminal charge, waives all nonjurisdictional defects in the proceedings against a defendant.\u201d) (quotations omitted). He contends that the district court did not have jurisdiction because Congress did not intend for \u00a7 1324(a)(2)(B)(ii) to apply extraterri-torially.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Generally, we review challenges to the district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. See Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">United States district courts \u201chave original jurisdiction ... of all offenses against the laws of the United States.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. \u201cWhere the Government charges a defendant with an offense against the laws of the United States, the district court has authority to adjudicate whether the defendant violated that law, unless there is a separate limit on subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>United States v. Pena, </em>684 F.3d 1137, 1145 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-12\">In <em>Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2869, 177 L.Ed.2d 535 (2010), the Supreme Court noted that the extraterritorial reach of a securities statute is not a question of subject matter jurisdiction. \u201c[T]o ask what conduct [a statute] reaches is to ask what conduct [the statute] prohibits, which is a merits question. Subject-matter jurisdiction, by contrast, refers to a tribunal\u2019s power to hear a case. It presents an issue quite separate from the question whether the allegations the plaintiff makes entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2877 (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-15\">Rolle\u2019s argument that \u00a7 1324 does not apply extraterritorially addresses only the \u201cmerits question\u201d of whether the statute prohibits his conduct. Under <em>Morrison, </em>this challenge does not affect the district court\u2019s power to hear Rolle\u2019s case. <em>See id. </em>Because the extraterritorial reach of the statute is not a question of jurisdiction, Rolle waived any argument on this issue by pleading guilty. See <em>Fairchild, </em>803 F.2d at 1124. Accordingly, we affirm and do not address whether \u00a7 1324(a)(2)(B)(ii) applies extraterritorially. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 197-99 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>(5th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ARB\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b90-9\">. Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-10\">Any person who, knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien has not received prior official authorization to come to ... the United States, ... attempts to bring to the United States in any manner whatsoever, such alien ... shall ... in the case of an offense done for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain, ... be fined under Title 18 and shall be imprisoned....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-17\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b90-18\">. For purposes of this appeal, we assume without deciding that Rolle\u2019s conduct occurred outside the territory of the United States. <em>See </em>33 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.22(a)(1), (a)(2) (establishing a three-mile boundary for some statutes and a twelve-mile boundary for oth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>ers); <em>see also </em>33 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.28(b) (establishing a twenty-four-mile \"contiguous zone\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b91-17\">. We also reject Rolle\u2019s arguments on the following issues, both of which are non-jurisdictional and were thus waived by his guilty plea: (1) whether the district erred by not suppressing evidence due to a lack of probable cause to stop Rolle\u2019s ship, <em>see United States v. McCoy, 477 </em>F.2d 550, 551 (5th Cir.1973) (suppression is not a jurisdictional issue); and (2) whether the evidence was sufficient to show a violation of \u00a7 1324(a)(2)(B)(ii), <em>see United States v. Ternus, </em>598 F.3d 1251, 1254 (11th Cir.2010) (sufficiency of the evidence is not a jurisdictional issue).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
