He contends that, even though he was sentenced as a career offender, \u00a7 3582(c) allows the district court to reevaluate whether, given his post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts, his sentence should be reduced. Martin appears to assert alternatively that he was not sentenced as a career offender. He also complains, for the first time in his reply brief, that the government failed to carry its burden of proof at sentencing to show that he was a career offender. We do not consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>602 F.3d 346, 360 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Martin was sentenced pursuant to the career offender guidelines provision, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Contrary to Martin\u2019s claim, our precedent forecloses his assertion that the career offender Guideline does not preclude a reduction of his sentence. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 790-91 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">As the district court determined that Martin was ineligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), it was not required to determine whether the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors warranted a reduction. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-92, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Moreover, the principles of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and its progeny do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>Dillon, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2692; <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237-39 (5th Cir.2009). Martin\u2019s arguments based on the inapposite Supreme Court opinions in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011) and <em>Pepper v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1229, 179 L.Ed.2d 196 (2011), and on inapposite extra-circuit opinions, are also unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-15\">Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Martin\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 237. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b526-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
