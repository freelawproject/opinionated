He contends that the sentence is plainly unreasonable, because the district court considered the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) and also considered his need for substance-abuse treatment, contrary to <em>Tapia v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2382, 180 L.Ed.2d 357 (2011). Because Olvera did not object, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-24\">Although in <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 496, 181 L.Ed.2d 345 (2011), we held that it was \u201cimproper for a district court to rely on \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) for the modification or revocation of a supervised release term,\u201d the revocation in <em>Miller </em>arose under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). <em>Miller, </em>634 F.3d at 844. The revocation of Olvera\u2019s SR was mandated by \u00a7 3583(g), because he admitted that he had possessed controlled substances. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3583(d), (g)(1). Because \u00a7 3583(g) \u201cdoes not expressly invoke the sentencing factors of \u00a7 3553(a) or the limits imposed by the first clause of \u00a7 3583(e),\u201d the consideration of \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) when revoking a SR term pursuant to \u00a7 3583(g) was not clear or obvious error. <em>See United States v. Holmes, </em>473 Fed.Appx. 400, 401 (5th Cir.2012); <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>460 Fed.Appx. 351, 352 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2759, 183 L.Ed.2d 628 (2012); <em>United States v. Ibanez, </em>454 Fed.Appx. 328, 329-30 (5th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>132 S.Ct. 2759 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Relying on <em>Tapia, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2391, Olvera argues that the court erred in imposing a sentence in response to his need for rehabilitation, urging that a court cannot impose or lengthen a sentence to promote an offender\u2019s rehabilitation. Olvera points out that the district court\u2019s comments about the need for treatment made it clear that it imposed the term of SR based on rehabilitation considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">In <em>Tapia, id. </em>at 2388, the Court noted that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a) instructs the district courts, in determining whether to impose a term of imprisonment, to recognize \u201cthat imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation.\u201d The district court stated that Olvera\u2019s three-month term of imprisonment was based on the nature of the alleged violations of SR and the fact that Olvera had not committed another crime. There was no indication that the court considered Olvera\u2019s rehabilitation needs in determining the term of imprisonment. The order that Olvera participate in a substance-abuse treatment program was a special condition of his term of SR. Thus, the court did not act contrary to <em>Tapia </em>in imposing imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">In <em>Tapia </em>the Court also recognized that Congress had chosen to pass statutes that affirmatively instructed the district courts, when imposing probation or SR, that they could consider ordering a defendant to participate in a training or treatment program. <em>Tapia, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2390; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3562(a), 3563(a)(4), 3583(c), 3553(a)(2)(D), (b)(9). Pursuant to those statutes, the district court was authorized to consider Olvera\u2019s need for substance-abuse treatment in determining the term of SR on revocation of his SR. The district court did not plainly err in ordering treatment as a condition of Olvera\u2019s SR. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">The revocation sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b514-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
