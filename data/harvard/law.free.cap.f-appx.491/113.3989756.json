Hobbs was convicted in 1994 of conspiring to possess cocaine and cocaine base with intent to distribute, and was ultimately held responsible for 595.5 grams of cocaine base. Applying the 1993 Sentencing Guidelines manual, the sentencing court assigned Hobbs a base offense level of 36 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(4), and added a 2-offense-level enhancement for Hobbs\u2019s possession of firearms. After applying a 3-offense-level reduction for accepting responsibility, the sentencing court calculated a total offense level of 35, a criminal history category of VI, and a Guidelines range of 292 to 365 months\u2019 imprisonment. Hobbs was a career offender, but the sentencing court sentenced him under \u00a7 2D1.1 because, even given Hobbs\u2019s statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment, \u00a7 2D1.1 resulted in a higher offense level than the career offender Guideline. The sentencing court imposed a 292-month sentence of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-25\">In 2008, the district court granted Hobbs\u2019s first \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to Anendment 706 to the Guidelines. It calculated a new total offense level of 34 (pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>to the now higher career offense level), and a new Guidelines range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. Based on these calculations, the district court reduced Hobbs\u2019s sentence to 274 months\u2019 imprisonment. Hobbs subsequently filed the instant \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, which he premised upon Amendment 750. He now argues that the district court erred by denying his motion after it concluded that Amendment 750 did not alter his Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). Part A of Amendment 750 amended \u00a7 2D1.1 by revising the Drug Quantity Table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) and reducing the offense levels associated with various amounts of crack cocaine. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750, Pt. A, <em>cross-referencing </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 748. Amendment 750 became effective on November 1, 2011. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">A district court may not reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment that has been imposed unless: (1) the defendant\u2019s sentence was based upon a Guidelines range that the Sentencing Commission subsequently lowered; (2) the district court considers the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors; and (3) a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). It may reduce a defendant\u2019s previously imposed sentence of imprisonment pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if the relevant amendment is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c) and the reduction is consistent with the Guidelines\u2019 policy statement. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). Parts A and C of Amendment 750 may serve as the basis for a sentence reduction. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">When determining whether a reduction is warranted, a court should determine the Guidelines range that would have applied had the relevant amendment been in effect at the time of the defendant\u2019s sentencing. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l). A court must only substitute the relevant amendment into the district court\u2019s original Guidelines calculations, and leave all other sentencing decisions unaffected. <em>Id.; United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">A reduction is not consistent with the Guidelines\u2019 policy statement if the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable Guidelines range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Where a retroactively applicable Guidelines amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, the district court is unauthorized to grant a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. This includes situations in which the defendant\u2019s applicable Guidelines range is calculated through the application of the career offender Guideline. <em>See id. </em>at 1326-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">In 1994, a defendant\u2019s responsibility for 595.5 grams of cocaine base resulted in a base offense level of 36, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(4) (1993), but Amendment 750 operated to lower the base offense level to 32, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(4) (2011). A career offender facing a statutory maximum of life imprisonment received an offense level of 37, which applied if it was greater than the offense level that was otherwise applicable. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.1(A) (1993). A defendant with a base offense level of 34 (37 reduced by 3 for acceptance of responsibility) and a criminal history category of VI was subject to a Guidelines range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A (1993) (sentencing table), the same offense level and Guideline level for Hobbs that resulted from the 2008 sentencing pursuant to Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>The district court did not have authority to reduce Hobbs\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because, in light of his designation as a career offender, Amendment 750 did not operate to lower his applicable Guidelines range. After a careful and thorough consideration of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Hobbs\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
