Rice, Jr.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the appellant, has had neovascular age-related macular degeneration for over fifty years. On June 25, 2007, at age 86, on Rice\u2019s first visit with his current opthamologist, the doctor diagnosed Rice with \u201cend-stage macular degeneration.\u201d In July and, again, August 2008, he injected Rice\u2019s right eye with Lucentis, a medication manufactured by Genentech, Inc., the appellee. In June 2009, he determined that Rice had lost all visual acuity in his right eye, attributing the loss to intraocular pressure. In August 2010, Rice, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>sued Genentech in Georgia Superior Court, claiming that Lucentis caused his loss of vision and seeking damages on theories of negligence <em>per se, </em>misrepresentation and breach of express and implied warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-11\">Genentech removed the case to the District Court because the parties are of diverse citizenship and the amount in controversy exceeded the jurisdictional amount. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the conclusion of discovery, the court, in an order entered on January 23, 2012, granted Genentech\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that Rice \u201cpresented no expert opinion showing that Lucentis caused his harm,\u201d and entered judgment accordingly. Rice now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-14\">Rice argues that the summary judgment should be vacated because the District Court abused its discretion in denying his discovery motions and that the record contained expert opinion evidence showing that Lucentis caused his vision loss and that the Lucentis labeling information was inadequate. We have carefully considered Rice\u2019s arguments for reversal and conclude for the reasons the District Court gave in its January 23, 2012 order that Genentech was entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b967-12\">. Rice\u2019s daughter, Jane Rice (\"Jane\u201d), joined her father as a plaintiff in filing his complaint, but was subsequently dismissed from the lawsuit. Accordingly, we refer only to Rice as the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b967-25\">. Although Rice\u2019s complaint did not allege that the amount in controversy exceeded the sum of $75,000, that it exceeded such amount is obvious given the nature of Rice's alleged injuries.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
