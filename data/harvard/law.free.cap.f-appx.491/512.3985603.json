The district court gave Davis 80 days to file a list of any documents he contends were valid and filed properly. The district court also enjoined Davis from any future such filings against federal employees. Davis filed a notice of appeal but did not file any lists of documents in accordance with the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">The district court denied Davis leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(3). Davis now moves this court for leave to proceed IFP. His motion constitutes a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into a litigant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on them merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-14\">Davis does not address the district court\u2019s certification decision in any meaningful way. Because Davis has failed to challenge the specific reasons for the district court\u2019s decision or show that the appeal raises a nonfrivolous issue, the IFP motion is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b539-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
