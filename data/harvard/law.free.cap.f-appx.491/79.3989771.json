He contends that the district court miscalculated his amended guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Baker pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 500 or more grams of cocaine and 5 or more grams of crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(B)(ii)-(iii), 846. Baker had at least two prior felony drug convictions, so he was subject to a 10-year mandatory minimum and a maximum sentence of life. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). The presentence investigation report held him responsible for 1,785 grams of crack cocaine, which made his base offense level 36. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(2) (Nov.2007). The PSR added 2 levels under \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) because Baker possessed a firearm and subtracted 3 levels for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3E1.1. Baker\u2019s total offense level was 35. The PSR also concluded that Baker was a career offender under \u00a7 4Bl.l(a), but because Baker\u2019s otherwise-applicable total offense level of 35 was higher than the total offense level of 34 that he was subject to as a career offender, Baker\u2019s career offender status did not change his otherwise-applicable total offense level. \u25a0 <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) (\u201c[I]f the offense level for a career offender ... is greater than the offense level otherwise applicable, the [career offender] offense level ... shall apply.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Baker\u2019s criminal history category was VI, and his guidelines range was 292 to 365 months in prison. The district court adopted the PSR and sentenced Baker to 328 months in prison, which was roughly the middle of his guidelines range. Later, because Baker had provided the government with substantial assistance, the court reduced Baker\u2019s sentence by 50% to 164 months under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">Baker filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), contending that Amendment 750 to the guidelines had reduced his guidelines range. The district court granted Baker\u2019s motion. The court recalculated Baker\u2019s guidelines range under the career offender guideline, which led to a guidelines range of 262 to 327 months. It then reduced his sentence to 147 months, which represented a roughly 50% reduction from the middle of his amended guidelines range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B) (Nov.2011) (\u201cIf the term of imprisonment imposed was less than the term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing pursuant to a government motion to reflect the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to authorities, a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range ... may be appropriate.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">Baker contends that the district court miscalculated his amended guidelines range, arguing that the court should not have used the career offender guideline. Instead, he argues, after Amendment 750, his total offense level is 33 and his amended guidelines range is 235 to 293 months. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s calculation of a defendant\u2019s guidelines range. <em>United States v. DeVegter, </em>439 F.3d 1299, 1303 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-13\">The district court did not miscalculate Baker\u2019s amended guidelines range. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>calculating a defendant\u2019s amended guidelines range under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) in light of a retroactive amendment to the guidelines, a district court must \u201cdetermine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the [retroactive] amendment ] to the guidelines ... had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lBl.l(b)(l). Amendment 750 lowered Baker\u2019s base offense level to 84, see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(3), and he is still subject to a 2-level increase under \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) and entitled to a 3-level decrease under \u00a7 3E1.1. So, if Baker were not a career offender, his total offense level after Amendment 750 would be 33. Baker is a career offender, however, and because he is subject to a maximum life sentence, his career offender base offense level is 37. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(A). After a 3-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility, his total career offender offense level is 34. Because that total offense level is greater than the total offense level that would apply if he were not a career offender, the career offender total offense level applies. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). So, if Amendment 750 had been in effect at the time Baker was originally sentenced, Baker\u2019s total offense level would have been 34 under the career offender guideline. With an amended total offense level of 34 and a criminal history category of VI, Baker\u2019s amended guidelines range is 262 to 327 months in prison, which is the amended guidelines range calculated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
