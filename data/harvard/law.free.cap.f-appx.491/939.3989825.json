On appeal, Wright argues that the district court improperly calculated his base offense level and sentencing range under the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court relied on laboratory measurements in deciding how much cocaine should be attributed to Wright.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-17\">We review the district court\u2019s determination of the drug quantity used to establish a base offense level for clear error. <em>United States v. Singleton, </em>545 F.3d 932, 934 &amp; n. 2 (11th Cir.2008). We may only reverse for clear error if the district court\u2019s account of the evidence is not plausible in the light of the record viewed in its entirety. <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., </em>470 U.S. 564, 573-74, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-19\">Absent special circumstances, the base offense level for possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute is determined based on the amount of drugs possessed by the defendant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5). The base offense level for possession of at least 2, but less than 3.5 kilograms of cocaine is 28. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(6). The base offense level for possession of at least 500 grams, but less than 2 kilograms of cocaine is 26. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-20\">In finding that Wright possessed two kilograms of cocaine, the district court relied on a laboratory report which reflected the weight of the drugs recovered from Wright. The district court was not required to apply the statistical margin of error inherent in laboratory testing in Wright\u2019s favor. The finding that Wright possessed two kilograms of cocaine was therefore plausible in the light of the record as a whole, and the court did not commit clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
