Agu now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence. The Government moves for summary affirmance or, in the alternative, for an extension of time to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-24\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings on a motion to suppress for clear error and its conclusions about whether the Fourth Amendment was violated de novo. <em>United States v. Pack, </em>612 F.3d 341, 347 (5th Cir.), <em>modified, </em>622 F.3d 383 (5th Cir.2010). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party that prevailed in the district court-in this case, the Government. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-25\">Agu argues that the incriminating evidence in this case should have been suppressed because it was discovered pursuant to a traffic stop that was pretextual. As Agu concedes, under the facts of his case, the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996), precludes him from obtaining relief on appeal. <em>See Whren, </em>517 U.S. at 817-19, 116 S.Ct. 1769. Although Agu\u2019s argument lacks merit, it is not so frivolous as to warrant summary disposition. <em>See United States v. Holy Land Found. For Relief &amp; Dev., </em>445 F.3d 771, 781-82 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-26\">Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is DENIED, and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b492-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
