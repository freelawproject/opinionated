Cross (now \u201cSchneeberger\u201d) appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of her motion for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1), the attorneys\u2019 fees provision of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002 <em>et seq. </em>Appellees The Quality Management Group, LLC (\u201cQMG\u201d) and the QMG Defined Benefit Pension Plan (\u201cthe Plan\u201d) (collectively, \u201cthe Defendants\u201d) cross-appeal the district court\u2019s denial of their motion for attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 1132(g)(1). In the underlying ERISA action, Schneeberger claimed that she was 100% vested in her pension benefits under the Defendants\u2019 Plan, while the Plan calculated Schneeberger\u2019s vesting at 60%. The parties settled the action based on a 75% vesting calculation, and then both parties moved the district court for awards of attorneys\u2019 fees. Exercising its discretion, the district court denied both motions for fees.</p>\n<p id=\"ANj\">On appeal, Schneeberger argues that: (1) the district court applied an improper legal standard in denying her fees by using a five-factor test in contravention of <em>Hardt v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2149, 176 L.Ed.2d 998 (2010); and (2) the district court clearly erred in finding that the Defendants did not litigate in bad faith and in assessing Schneeberger\u2019s claims. The Defendants argue that the district court abused its discretion in how it assessed the five-factor test to deny them fees. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"Abs\">We review orders on attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion, \u201cwhich occurs if the court fails to apply the proper legal standard or to follow proper procedures in making the determination, or bases an award upon findings of fact that are clearly erroneous,\u201d or \u201ccommits a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>Gray ex rel. Alexander v. Bostic, </em>613 F.3d 1035, 1039 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation omitted). Clear error in factual findings occurs when, \u201calthough there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>evidence to support [them], the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Johnson &amp; Johnson Vision Care, Inc. v. 1-800 Contacts, Inc., </em>299 F.3d 1242, 1246 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation omitted). \u201cIf the district court\u2019s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it [for clear error] even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.\u201d <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., </em>470 U.S. 564, 573-74, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985). We review the district court\u2019s application of law <em>de novo. Johnson, </em>299 F.3d at 1246.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">Section 1132(g)(1) of ERISA provides that \u201c[i]n any action under this subchapter ... by a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary, the court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and costs of action to either party.\u201d 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1132(g)(1). In interpreting this provision, the Supreme Court in <em>Hardt </em>directed, first, that \u201ca fees claimant must show \u2018some degree of success on the merits\u2019 before a court may award attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1132(g)(1).\u201d 130 S.Ct. at 2158. It then said: \u201cWe do not foreclose the possibility that once a claimant has satisfied this requirement, and thus becomes eligible for a fees award under \u00a7 1132(g)(1), a court may consider ... five factors ... in deciding whether to award attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2158 n. 8. These five factors are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">(1) the degree of opposing parties\u2019 culpability or bad faith; (2) ability of opposing parties to satisfy an award of attorneys\u2019 fees; (3) whether an award of attorneys\u2019 fees against the opposing parties would deter other persons acting under similar circumstances; (4) whether the parties requesting attorneys\u2019 fees sought to benefit all participants and beneficiaries of an ERISA plan or to resolve a significant legal question regarding ERISA itself; and (5) the relative merits of the parties\u2019 positions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 2154 n. 1 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">First, we are unpersuaded by Schneeberger\u2019s argument that the district court applied an incorrect legal standard in assessing the motions for attorneys\u2019 fees. As the record shows, the approach sanctioned by the Supreme Court in <em>Hardt </em>is exactly the one taken by the district court in this case. The district court began by quoting from <em>Hardt, </em>and recognizing that \u201cthe Court has broad discretion to award fees and costs \u2018as long as the fee claimant has achieved \u201csome degree of success on the merits.\u201d \u2019 \u201d D. Ct. Order at 3 (quoting <em>Hardt, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2152). It continued: \u201cOnce that requirement is satisfied, the Court may consider a five-factor test developed prior to <em>Hardt </em>in determining whether an award of fees and costs is appropriate,\u201d and cited the five factors. D. Ct. Order at 3^4. Applying this two-part approach, the district court first laid out the parties\u2019 arguments as to whether they had achieved \u201csome success on the merits,\u201d specifically noting that \u201cthe parties entered into a settlement agreement which provided Plaintiff a distribution based upon a 75% vesting in the plan,\u201d and that \u201cPlaintiff ... claims some success on the merits and notes that prior to the instant lawsuit being filed Defendants!] claimed she was only entitled to a determination of 60% vesting.\u201d D. Ct. Order at 3. It then found: \u201c[I]n the end, Plaintiff received 15% more than that to which Defendants initially claimed she was entitled.\u201d D. Ct. Order at 4. The district court proceeded by applying the five-factor test to each of the parties, and ultimately concluded that neither were entitled to fees. In so doing, the district court properly applied <em>Hardt\u2019s </em>steps \u2014 that is, it first deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>mined that Schneeberger had obtained \u201csome degree of success on the merits,\u201d and then applied the five-factor test that <em>Hardt </em>expressly did not foreclose. <em>Hardt, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2158 &amp; n. 8. There was thus no error in the district court\u2019s recitation, or application, of the <em>Hardt </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Schneeberger appears to suggest that the district court should simply have determined whether she obtained \u201csome degree of success on the merits,\u201d and stopped there. But <em>Hardt </em>did not say this \u2014 rather, it allowed for the application of the five factors before a district court ultimately determined a party\u2019s entitlement to fees. Indeed, in <em>Hardt </em>itself, the district court had first determined whether the fees claimant was a prevailing party, and then had applied the five-factor test. <em>Id. </em>at 2155. After agreeing with the district court\u2019s interpretation of \u201cprevailing party,\u201d the Supreme Court concluded that the \u201cDistrict Court properly exercised its discretion to award Hardt attorney\u2019s fees in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2159. The Supreme Court thereby sanctioned the district court\u2019s secondary use of the five-factor test, which was the same approach taken by the district court did in the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Nor are we persuaded by either parties\u2019 claims that the district court clearly erred in making findings under the five-factor test, or abused its discretion in ultimately denying either party fees. As for the first prong \u2014 whether either party acted in bad faith \u2014 neither appellate brief has made a compelling showing. Both seem to suggest that the other exhibited bad faith by taking litigating positions that were in dispute, or by causing some amount of delay in the litigation process. However, we have said in various contexts that bad faith is more than mere negligence; it is \u201cthe conscious doing of a wrong,\u201d <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>198 F.3d 1293, 1299 (11th Cir.1999), \u201cwhere an attorney knowingly or recklessly pursues a frivolous claim or engages in litigation tactics that needlessly obstruct the litigation of non-frivolous claims,\u201d <em>Schwartz v. Mill\u00f3n Air, Inc., </em>341 F.3d 1220, 1225-26 (11th Cir.2003), or \u201cdeliberate deception, gross negligence or recklessness,\u201d <em>Am. Bankers Ins. Co. of Fla. v. Northwestern Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>198 F.3d 1332, 1336 (11th Cir.1999). Even assuming that these parties may have taken unreasonable positions in the course of the litigation, they have not submitted sufficient proof of deliberate wrongdoing in order to show that the district court clearly erred in making these findings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">The parties also fail to explain how the district court clearly erred in making its remaining findings. The parties do not mention prong 2 of the test, and offer nothing more than conclusory assertions as to why the district court clearly erred in deciding prongs 3 and 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">As for the last one \u2014 the relative merits of the parties\u2019 positions \u2014 Schneeberger claims that the district court should not have relied on the Defendants\u2019 description of the Plan, and should not have found that her reliance on her marital settlement agreement, rather than the Plan, was \u201cuntenable.\u201d But not only did the district court expressly say that it \u201cconsidered] the record in its entirety,\u201d Schneeberger did not contest the Defendants\u2019 description of the Plan, so we do not see how this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>could have amounted to clear error. Moreover, it is clear that \u201c[t]he award of benefits under any ERISA plan is governed in the first instance by the language of the plan itself.\u201d <em>Liberty Life Assur. Co. of Boston v. Kennedy, </em>358 F.3d 1295, 1302 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). Thus, it is unclear how her reliance on non-Plan documents, when such documents existed, was tenable. <em>See, e.g., Mack v. Kuckenmeister, </em>619 F.3d 1010, 1018 (9th Cir.2010) (\u201c[A] [qualified domestic relations order] only renders enforceable an already-existing interest. [It] does not somehow create a right to plan benefits or create a right to enforce a state law order.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">In short, as the district court observed, the Defendants sought to defend against Schneeberger\u2019s claim for 100% of vesting that was not legitimate, and Schneeberger legitimately sought more than 60% of vesting based on her employment records. Both parties\u2019 positions had some merit, but neither had relatively more merit than the other. As a result, the district court did not clearly err in making this finding, nor did it abuse its discretion in how it weighed the factors to deny attorneys\u2019 fees to both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b82-6\">. At most, Schneeberger points to a \"threatening\u201d letter and text message from her former husband, Karl Cross, a manager of QMG and Trustee of the Plan. While we agree that a coercive letter could result in bad faith, we do not believe it rose to this level here, especially considering the substance of the settlement offer made in the communications. Indeed, they proposed a 75% vesting calculation and $5000 in attorneys' fees, which actually offered more than Schneeberger ultimately received.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
