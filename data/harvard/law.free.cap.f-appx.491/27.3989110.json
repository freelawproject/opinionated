On appeal, Santana argues that the district court improperly calculated his criminal history and imposed an unreasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">We turn first to Santana\u2019s argument that the district court miscalculated his criminal history. Santana\u2019s Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) assigned him a criminal history category of V based on a total of eleven criminal history points. Two of those eleven points stemmed from a 2009 Florida conviction for trespassing for which Santana spent 103 days in jail. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(b). Santana filed an objection to the PSR arguing that his 2009 conviction did not support the two-point enhancement. He noted that his sentence for the 2009 conviction was only for \u201ctime served,\u201d and that he received credit for the 103 days he had spent in jail prior to the imposition of the sentence. He argued that a \u201ctime served\u201d sentence could not be counted under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l), and that the sentence did not exceed sixty days under \u00a7 4Al.l(b). The district court rejected this argument at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">On appeal, Santana argues for the first time that his sentence of 103 days was illegal under Florida law, because his 2009 trespass conviction was a second-degree misdemeanor subject to a maximum punishment of sixty days imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He claims that, because his sentence would be illegal under Florida law, his sentence cannot be equivalent to a 103-day sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of the sentencing guidelines to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. McGuinness, </em>451 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir.2006). However, we review objections to sentencing calculations raised for the first time on appeal for plain error. <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 831 (11th Cir.2006). This standard requires 1) an error; 2) that is plain; 3) that affects a substantial right of the defendant; and 4) that undermines the public integrity of judicial proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at 831-32. Section 4Al.l(b) adds two criminal history points for \u201ceach prior sentence of imprisonment of at least sixty days.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(b). Section 4Al.l(c) adds one point for any prior sentence that falls below the threshold of \u00a7 4Al.l(b). <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4Al.l(c). However, \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l) excludes from an offender\u2019s criminal history certain misdemeanors and petty offenses, including trespassing, if the term of probation was less than one year or if the prison sentence was for less than thirty days. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l). Thus, a trespassing misdemeanor conviction only earns points under \u00a7 4Al.l(b) if it carries a sentence of at least thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">Santana did not address the alleged illegality of his 103-day sentence under Florida law in front of the district court. Therefore, we review his argument for plain error. <em>Bennett, </em>472 F.3d at 831-32. The government concedes that Santana\u2019s 2009 trespass conviction carried a maximum sentence of sixty-days imprisonment under Florida law. Nevertheless, the government contends that even if Santana\u2019s 2009 trespass conviction did not warrant a two-point enhancement under \u00a7 4Al.l(b), it would still merit a one-point enhancement under \u00a7\u00a7 4Al.l(c) and 4A1.2(c)(l). Even with this adjustment in place, Santana would have a criminal history of ten instead of eleven points, which would still place him in a criminal history category of V. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 5 Pt. A. Therefore, even assuming the district court erred in assigning Santana two criminal history points under \u00a7 4Al.l(b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> any such error did not affect Santana\u2019s substantial rights, so it did not constitute plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">In response, Santana seems to argue that we should deem his 2009 sentence as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>being less than thirty days because the 103-day time-served sentence exceeded the statutory maximum under Florida law. However, he cites no authority to support this proposition, and we do not find this argument compelling. <em>See United States v. Phillips, </em>120 F.3d 227, 231 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201c[I]n sentencing a defendant a district court cannot ignore ... a prior conviction that has not been invalidated in a prior proceeding, unless there was an un-waived absence of counsel in the proceedings resulting in that conviction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">We turn next to Santana\u2019s argument that his sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable. In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we first determine whether the district court committed procedural error. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We then evaluate the substantive reasonableness of the sentence under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Santana argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to correctly calculate his criminal history, and because it failed to consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). As we explained above, we reject that the alleged error regarding Santana\u2019s criminal history category constitutes reversible error. As to \u00a7 3553(a)(1), Santana argues that the district court erred by refusing to consider the relative responsibility of his co-defendant, thereby resulting in an unfair sentencing disparity. In fact, the district court did consider the relative roles of Santana and his co-defendant, but concluded that the co-defendant\u2019s relative responsibility was ultimately immaterial to Santana\u2019s sentence. The court explained that Santana deserved a higher sentence than his co-defendant in light of his violation of parole and criminal history. Therefore, we find Santana\u2019s allegation of procedural error to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">For the same reason, we reject Santana\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s sentence was substantively unreasonable because the court failed to give sufficient weight to the relative role of the defendants under \u00a7 3553(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-12\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b54-7\">. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.08(2)(a); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 775.082(4)(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b54-12\">. We pause to express doubt that the district court erred in assigning two points under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>\u00a7 4A 1.1(b). Florida law permits a \"term of imprisonment <em>not exceeding 60 </em>days\" for second-degree misdemeanors, including trespassing. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 775.082(4)(b) (emphasis added). The sentencing guidelines impose two criminal history points for each prior sentence \"of <em>at least </em>sixty days.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(b) (emphasis added). Therefore, even if we were to read Santana\u2019s prior sentence of 103 days as imposing the sixty-day statutory maximum under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 775.082(4)(b), the conviction would still result in a two-point enhancement under \u00a7 4A 1.1(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
