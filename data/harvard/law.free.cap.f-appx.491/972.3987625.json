(Citigroup). The district court dismissed the complaint as untimely and therefore frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). At issue on appeal is whether Abram-Adams\u2019s complaint was timely. After reviewing the record and briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-18\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b999-19\">This appeal is best understood within the context of its winding procedural history. Abram-Adams\u2019s claims arise from: (1) her employment with Citigroup in 2003-04; and (2) an arbitrator\u2019s dismissal of her discrimination complaints against Citigroup in March 2007. Citigroup terminated Abram-Adams\u2019s employment in March 2004, and Abram-Adams in turn filed a discrimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The EEOC dismissed Abram-Adams\u2019s charge and issued her a \u201cright-to-sue\u201d letter on September 30, 2004. Following the dismissal, Abram-Adams brought a state-court civil action against Citigroup that resulted in arbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>tion, pursuant to the arbitration clause in her Citigroup employment contract. The arbitrator dismissed Abram-Adams\u2019s claims with prejudice on March 31, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">Two years later, Abram-Adams filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. On March 19, 2010, the district court dismissed Abram-Adams\u2019s 343-page complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8. In the dismissal, the district court gave Abram-Adams until April 9, 2010, to file an amended complaint. Having received no amended complaint by that date, the court entered an order dismissing the complaint without prejudice on April 13, 2010. Abram Adams filed her amended complaint one year later, which the district court promptly dismissed <em>sua sponte. </em>The court advised Abram-Adams that if she wished to pursue her claims against Citigroup, she would have to initiate a new civil action since the time to amend her complaint had expired. And so, on May 9, 2011, Abram-Adams filed the second civil action that forms the basis for this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">Abram-Adams\u2019s original complaint alleged: (1) discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e; (2) discrimination under the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983, and 1985; (3) discrimination under the Florida Civil Rights Act, Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 760.01 and 760.07; and (4) assault and negligence under Florida common law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court dismissed with prejudice Abram-Adams\u2019s new complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. Specifically, the court ruled that all of Abram-Adams\u2019s claims stemming from her employment or the arbitration were time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-11\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>a dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), taking the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1159-60 (11th Cir.2003)). \u201cThe standards governing dismissals under [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 12(b)(6) apply to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Mitchell v. Farcass, </em>112 F.3d 1483, 1490 (11th Cir.1997)). Further, <em>pro se </em>pleadings are held to a more lenient standard than pleadings filed by lawyers, and they are to be construed liberally. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-13\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-14\">We agree with the district court that Abram-Adams\u2019s claims were time-barred. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>Generally, \u201ca court looks to state law to define the time limitation applicable to a federal claim only when Congress has failed to provide a statute of limitations for a federal cause of action.\u201d <em>Phillips v. United States, </em>260 F.3d 1316, 1318 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing <em>Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis &amp; Petigrow v. Gilbertson, </em>501 U.S. 350, 355, 111 S.Ct. 2773, 2778, 115 L.Ed.2d 321 (1991) (\u201cIt is the usual rule that when Congress has failed to provide a statute of limitations for a federal cause of action, a court borrows or absorbs the local time limitation most analogous to the case at hand.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted))).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">In Abram-Adams\u2019s case, all of her tort and employment discrimination claims accrued on March 25, 2004, the date of her termination. Her other claims accrued on March 31, 2007, the day the arbitrator dismissed her case. In both cases, more than four years had passed when she filed her second complaint on May 9, 2011. None of Abram-Adams\u2019s claims survive their respective statutes of limitations: (1) Title VII claims \u2014 within 90 days after receipt of the EEOC \u201cright-to-sue\u201d letter, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l); (2) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983, and 1985 claims \u2014 four-year statute of limitations in Florida, <em>see Chappell v. Rich, </em>340 F.3d 1279, 1283 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam) (statute of limitations for \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985 claims); <em>Baker v. Gulf &amp; W. Indus., Inc., </em>850 F.2d 1480, 1481 (11th Cir.1988) (statute of limitations for \u00a7 1981 claims); (3) Florida Civil Rights Act claims-four-year statute of limitations, <em>see Seale v. EMSA Corr. Care, Inc., </em>767 So.2d 1188, 1189 (Fla. 2000); and (4) assault and negligence claims-four-year statute of limitations, <em>see </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 95.11(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-9\">On appeal, Abram-Adams argues that the doctrines of relation-back and \u201cflexibility\u201d should have saved her complaint from being dismissed as untimely. She also argues that the district court erred by failing to review her application to proceed <em>in forma pauperis. </em>Lastly, Abram-Adams argues that she was entitled to move through the \u201cfour stages\u201d of a lawsuit and collect damages. We find these arguments unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-10\">First, the relation-back doctrine does not rescue her untimely complaint. In limited circumstances, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c) permits amendments to pleadings that \u201crelate back\u201d to the date of the original pleading. But none of Rule 15(c)\u2019s circumstances apply here, because the complaint in question did not \u201crelate back\u201d to an original pleading; it is itself the original. To illustrate, in <em>Dade County v. Rohr Industries, Inc., </em>826 F.2d 983, 989 (11th Cir.1987), this court held that a refiled complaint could not \u201crelate back\u201d and revive a dismissed complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 989. The second complaint in <em>Dade </em>was filed after the statute of limitations had expired, and the earlier dismissal had \u201cthe effect of placing the parties in a position as if the suit had never been filed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the claims had become time-barred. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cEven if we applied the five year statute of limitations, Dade County\u2019s suit would still be time-barred.\u201d). Likewise, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Abram-Adams\u2019s complaint on April 13, 2010, for failure to timely amend placed both parties in a position as if the suit had never been filed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>Thus, Abram-Adams\u2019s complaints have also become time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Even construing this argument liberally, Abram-Adams\u2019s appeal fails. If the \u201cflexibility\u201d that Abram-Adams seeks is an equitable tolling of her claims\u2019 limitation periods, her search is a futile one. \u201cEquitable tolling is an extraordinary remedy which should be extended only sparingly.\u201d <em>Bost v. Fed. Express Corp., </em>372 F.3d 1233, 1242 (11th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Justice v. United States, </em>6 F.3d 1474, 1479 (11th Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks omitted)). The plaintiff must establish that tolling is warranted. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Justice, </em>6 F.3d at 1479). Equitable tolling is not appropriate when a plaintiff fails to act with due diligence or is negligent. <em>See id.; see also Arce v. Garcia, </em>434 F.3d 1254, 1261 (11th Cir.2006) (noting that equitable tolling is only appropriate when an untimely filing is due to <em>\u201cextraordinary circumstances </em>that are both beyond his control and unavoidable even with diligence\u201d (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Sandvik v. United States, </em>177 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.1999) (per curiam))).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">Abram-Adams\u2019s claims are not entitled to equitable tolling because she offers this court no extraordinary circumstance to justify the commensurably extraordinary remedy. Nor did her initial 343-page complaint toll the limitations period. We have previously held that an imperfect complaint will not toll the period of limitations for a new complaint. In <em>Stein v. Reynolds Securities, Inc., </em>667 F.2d 33 (11th Cir.1982), the appellant contended that his initial suit tolled the period of limitations, despite the fact that the district court dismissed the action without prejudice for failure to prosecute. <em>Id. </em>at 33. We disagreed, holding that a dismissal without prejudice for failure to prosecute did not toll the period of limitations. <em>Id. </em>at 34; <em>see also Williams v. Ga. Dep\u2019t of Def. Nat\u2019l Guard Headquarters, </em>147 Fed.Appx. 134, 136 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam); <em>Justice, </em>6 F.3d at 1483.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">In the same way, we see no reason \u2014 and Abram-Adams offers none \u2014 to rule differently in this case. The initial complaint was dismissed after Abram-Adams attempted to amend her complaint nearly one year after the district court\u2019s explicit deadline. We are unaware of any extraordinary circumstance for Abram-Adams\u2019s failure to file her complaint within the limitation periods. Put simply, Abram-Adams did not give herself the diligence she was due; she was negligent, and has no place to point the finger of blame other than toward herself. <em>See, e.g., Bost, </em>372 F.3d at 1242 (holding that \u201c[ejquitable tolling is inappropriate when a plaintiff did not file an action promptly or failed to act with due diligence\u201d (citing <em>Justice, </em>6 F.3d at 1479 (11th Cir.1993))).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">Finally, because the district court correctly dismissed Abram-Adams\u2019s complaint as time-barred, her motion for <em>in forma pauperis </em>status was moot, and the district court did not err by denying it. Nor did the district court err when it refused to award her damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">. Abram-Adams also alleged that Citigroup violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 245, but that law is a criminal statute, which prohibits violent assaults motivated by racial animus and interference with federally protected rights. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 245. Section 245(a)(1) explicitly reserves the right of prosecution to government officials:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-9\">No prosecution of any offense described in this section shall be undertaken by the United States except upon the certification in writing of the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, the Associate Attorney General, or any Assistant Attorney General specially designated by the Attorney General that in his judgment a prosecution by the United States is in the public interest and necessary to secure substantial justice, which function of certification may not be delegated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-16\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 245(a)(1); <em>see also Kelly v.
