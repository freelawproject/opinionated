Ranjha sought habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, maintaining he was convicted of a nonexistent offense in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Regalado Cuellar v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 550, 128 S.Ct. 1994, 170 L.Ed.2d 942 (2008), and <em>Flores-Figueroa v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 646, 129 S.Ct. 1886, 173 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009). The district court ruled Ranjha could not proceed under \u00a7 2241 because his claims did not satisfy the requirements of the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) and dismissed his \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Section 2255 relief is the remedy for \u201cerrors that occurred at or prior to sentencing.\u201d <em>Cox v. Warden, Fed. Detention Ctr., </em>911 F.2d 1111, 1113 (5th Cir.1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). A \u00a7 2241 petition raising errors \u201cthat occurr[ed] at trial or sentencing is properly construed [as arising] under \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877-78 (5th Cir.2000). Because Ranjha challenges the legality of his conviction and sentence, his claims must be presented under \u00a7 2255. <em>Cox, </em>911 F.2d at 1113.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">If a prisoner can demonstrate that the \u00a7 2255 remedy would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [the prisoner\u2019s] detention,\u201d he may be permitted to pursue a claim pursuant to \u00a7 2241 under \u00a7 2255\u2019s \u201csavings clause.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001). The savings clause applies to any claim \u201cthat is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and \u201cthat was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">Ranjha has not made the requisite showing because his claims based on <em>Regalado Cuellar </em>and <em>Flores-Figueroa </em>could have been raised in his initial \u00a7 2255 motion filed on May 22, 2009. Further, his claim that he cannot obtain relief through \u00a7 2255 because his motions to supplement and amend his initial \u00a7 2255 motion were denied as untimely, does not render relief under \u00a7 2255 \u201cinadequate or ineffective.\u201d <em>See Tolliver, </em>211 F.3d at 878. Therefore, Ranjha has not shown that he is entitled to proceed under \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court dismissing his \u00a7 2241 petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b517-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
