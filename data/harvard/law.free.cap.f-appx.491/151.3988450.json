Rhonda Fee was convicted of eight counts of producing child pornography, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 2, 2251(a), and one count of possessing child pornography, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B), based on photographs that she and her husband took of Fee\u2019s 12-year-old daughter, K.S. Fee argues that the eight counts of producing child pornography in her indictment were multiplicitous. Fee also challenges the denial of her motion to sever her trial from the trial of her husband, Robert Fee; the decision to allow K.S. to testify by closed-circuit television; and the denial of her motion for a new trial. We conclude that the plain text of the statute that proscribes using a \u201cminor to engage in ... any sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2251(a), makes each use of the minor to produce each obscene photograph a criminal offense. We also conclude that Rhonda Fee waived any objection to the refusal to sever her trial; no error occurred in allowing K.S. to testify by closed-circuit television; and the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a new trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b178-14\">We divide in three parts our discussion of the background. First, we discuss the investigation of the Fees and their su-perceding indictment. Second, we discuss Rhonda Fee\u2019s pre-trial proceedings. Third, we discuss the evidence presented at trial, the verdict, and Rhonda Fee\u2019s post-trial motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-15\">\n<em>A. The Investigation and Superceding Indictment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b178-16\">KS.\u2019s brother reported to the Sheriffs Office in Tuscaloosa County that his stepfather, Robert Fee, had been recording video footage of K.S. Pam Kirsch, an investigator in the child abuse and sex crimes division of the Sheriffs Office, then interviewed K.S. at school. Kirsch used the information elicited from K.S. to obtain a warrant to search the Fees\u2019 home.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-17\">Officers searched the Fees\u2019 home on October 15, 2008, and discovered evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>the Fees\u2019 purient interest in K.S. Investigator Kirsch observed that the Fees had installed two surveillance cameras in KS.\u2019s bedroom and bathroom that were focused on KS.\u2019s bed, toilet, and bathtub. Both cameras downloaded images to a television in the Fees\u2019 bedroom, and the television was connected to a videocassette recorder. Another officer discovered in the Fees\u2019 bedroom a filing cabinet containing a stack of nine Polaroid photographs bound together with a rubber band. Eight of the photographs depicted different aspects of K.S.\u2019s genitalia, and the ninth photograph depicted Robert Fee in the nude.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">A grand jury returned a superceding indictment that charged the Fees with eight counts of producing child pornography and one count of possessing child pornography. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 2251(a), 2252A(a)(5)(B). The indictment charged that, on eight occasions between January 2003 and October 2008, the Fees used a minor to \u201cengage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction of such conduct\u201d and that, on October 15, 2008, the Fees possessed those photographs. Each count of producing child pornography charged the Fees with producing a Polaroid photograph \u201cknown to the grand jury\u201d as a numbered exhibit. The visual depictions in the exhibits differed. Exhibits 1 and 7 depicted the child\u2019s genitalia while she was wearing a partial body cast; Exhibits 2 and 6 depicted the child with her legs raised over her head and using her hands to expose her genitalia; Exhibit 3 depicted Rhonda Fee using her hands to expose the child\u2019s genitalia; Exhibit 4 showed the child lying naked on her back but focused primarily on her genitalia; Exhibit 5 depicted the child lying naked on her stomach as she \u201clook[ed] back at the camera\u201d; and Exhibit 8 showed another view of the child\u2019s genital area.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">\n<em>B. Rhonda Fee\u2019s Motions for Dismissal and Severance and Her Opposition to K.S. Testifying by Closedr-Circuit Television</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">Rhonda Fee moved to join, or alternatively to dismiss some of, the eight counts of producing child pornography on the ground that the charges were multiplici-tous. She argued that \u201ca review of the content of the photographs ... [made] certainly possible that some or all of the photographs were taken at the same time and place, but in any event on less than the eight separate occasions as alleged by the superseding indictment.\u201d She requested that the district court \u201ceither dismiss the first Eight Counts of the indictment or in the alternative consolidate the eight counts into one or more, but fewer than eight to reflect the number of separate instances of conduct proven by the Government.\u201d The district court denied Rhonda Fee\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">When the United States moved to allow K.S. to testify by two-way closed-circuit television, Rhonda Fee moved to sever her trial from that of her husband or, alternatively, to require K.S. to testify in open court, but outside the presence of Robert Fee. Rhonda Fee argued that she was entitled to examine K.S. under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. The magistrate judge denied Rhonda Fee\u2019s motion to sever, and she did not object to that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">The district court held a hearing regarding the admission of KS.\u2019s testimony by closed circuit television. The United States presented testimony from Jane Plaxco, a mental health counselor, that K.S. could not testify in the presence of the Fees. Plaxco testified that she treated K.S., who suffers from cerebral palsy and walks with braces, using forensic sensitive counseling. Plaxco testified that K.S. was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>\u201cvery scared\u201d of Robert Fee and feared being in the same room with him because \u201che made her do things that she didn\u2019t want to do.\u201d Plaxco testified that K.S. was angry with Rhonda Fee, but hesitated \u201cdoing something that might hurt her mother because she loves her.\u201d Plaxco also testified that, during a meeting in May 2009, she observed on K.S. \u201cvery deep, numerous sores on [one] forearm that had not been there ... before\u201d which \u201clooked like they were infected\u201d and also a \u201cvery huge hangnail or raw cuticles that she was playing with and pushing back and picking at.\u201d Plaxco questioned K.S. about the \u201cgouges in her skin,\u201d and K.S. \u201csaid that she was scared to go to court\u201d and was \u201cscratching herself.\u201d Ten days later, Plaxco observed sores on both of KS.\u2019s arms. Plaxco opined that K.S. had repressed or had been unable to communicate her anxiety about the trial and had engaged in self-mutilation to express her feelings. Plaxco stated she \u201c[had] worked with children who were self-mutilators,\u201d but she \u201c[did not] think [she had] ever worked with anybody that was as anxious about court as [K.S.] ... or had the physical signs of being as anxious about court and testifying.\u201d Although a tour of the courtroom addressed some of K.S.\u2019s anxieties, merely \u201ccoming to the courtroom was very difficult for her,\u201d and she \u201ckept wanting to know where [the Fees] would be sitting and if they would say anything to her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Plaxco described KS.\u2019s anxiety as \u201csevere\u201d and \u201cescalating.\u201d A few days before the hearing, K.S. heard Rhonda Fee\u2019s voice on the answering machine, and became angry, screamed, and \u201chit her grandmother.\u201d The next day, K.S. told Plaxco that she was \u201cjust really upset.\u201d Plaxco noticed that K.S. was \u201cself-mutilating more,\u201d \u201c[h]er verbal aggression was escalating,\u201d and she was \u201closing weight\u201d and \u201cnot sleeping.\u201d Plaxco opined that requiring K.S. to testify in the presence of the Fees would \u201c[a]bsolutely\u201d inflict emotional trauma, and despite KS.\u2019s fear of video cameras, she would be less traumatized if permitted to testify by closed-circuit television.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">In support of her request that K.S. testify in open court, Rhonda Fee presented testimony from Leah Belser, a forensic interviewer and therapist who had reviewed a videotaped interview with K.S. Belser testified that forensic sensitive training was \u201ca type of therapy utilized by a lot of children\u2019s advocacy centers ... in an attempt to preserve evidence.\u201d Belser also testified that there were several possible explanations for self-mutilation, including \u201c[s]tress, anxiety ... [and] displacement\u201d from the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The district court granted the motion of the United States to allow K.S. to testify by closed-circuit television. The district court found that K.S. was \u201cafraid\u201d of Robert Fee and would suffer emotional trauma if required to testify in his presence. The district court also found that K.S. experienced a \u201cdifferent kind of fear\u201d with Rhonda Fee that was \u201cso substantial that [it] outweigh[ed] the traditional requirement ... [to] testify actually in front of the defendant.\u201d Based on the evidence of K.S.\u2019s self-mutilation and explanation for the mutilation, the district court was \u201cconvinced\u201d that, if K.S. were forced to testify in the courtroom, she \u201c[would] close up and [would] not say a word other than muttering\u201d based on \u201cfear for herself and emotional trauma that [she would] be experiencing from being in front of her mother and stepfather.\u201d The district court stated that it would \u201cmake sure that every other mechanism of confrontation\u201d was satisfied and would ensure that the jury viewed KS.\u2019s \u201centire demeanor ... from the waist up\u201d; saw K.S. \u201cbe placed under oath\u201d; and observed \u201c[a]nybody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>that\u2019s in [the room with K.S.] that might have an influence on [her] ... [and] make sure no coaching or anything is done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Rhonda Fee filed an untimely notice of intent to present expert testimony from Dr. Kimberly Ackerson, a clinical psychologist. Rhonda Fee proffered that Acker-son would testify that Fee\u2019s \u201cintellectual functioning fell within the \u2018borderline\u2019 to \u2018low average range\u2019 \u201d and explain why she helped her husband photograph K.S. Before opening statements, Rhonda Fee removed Ackerson from her witness list.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\n<em>C. Rhonda Fee\u2019s Trial and Posh-Trial Motions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">At trial, the United States presented evidence that K.S. was used to produce child pornography. K.S. testified by a closed-circuit television located in the chambers of the district court while the Fees communicated remotely with counsel in the chambers. K.S. testified that she was 13 years old and identified Rhonda Fee as her mother and Robert Fee as her stepfather. K.S. identified herself in the eight photographs and testified that her legs were spread open against her will by Rhonda Fee while Robert Fee took the photographs. K.S. testified about Robert Fee viewing regularly the live camera feeds of K.S. in her bedroom and bathroom. K.S. also testified that she had been touched \u201ca lot\u201d in her bedroom by Robert Fee and that \u201c[i]t felt like a knife sometimes.\u201d Investigator Kirsch testified about the views of K.S. depicted in the eight photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">In defense, the Fees testified that they photographed and videotaped K.S. to aid her in personal hygiene practices. Robert Fee testified that he took eight photographs of K.S. during one photographic session; K.S. requested two photographs to see how she looked in a body cast applied after a surgery for her cerebral palsy; and he took six other photographs to show K.S. where to clean herself. Rhonda Fee provided identical explanations for the photographs and testified that the Fees installed a video camera in the bathroom directed at the toilet and bathtub to \u201cwatch [K.S.] so she wouldn\u2019t fall and to make sure she was bathing and getting herself clean\u201d because she suffered from vaginal infections. On cross-examination, Rhonda Fee testified that K.S. was photographed in 2006 when she was ten years old. Rhonda Fee stated that she kept the photographs \u201cin case K.S. had to be shown again\u201d and she \u201cdidn\u2019t think about\u201d asking Dr. Burgess for a diagram to use instead of the photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">The Fees also presented testimony from Dr. Karen Burgess, who had treated K.S. twice for vaginal infections. On the first occasion, Burgess observed that K.S. \u201chad an appearance of nonspecific redness\u201d and recommended careful vaginal cleaning. On the second occasion, K.S. complained of vomiting, diarrhea, and pain with urination. A nurse practitioner observed that K.S. had vaginal redness, recommended that K.S. continue using \u201cproper cleaning techniques\u201d with the assistance of a caretaker, and prescribed an anti-fungal medication. On cross-examination, Burgess testified that Robert Fee had reported that K.S. experienced genital pain when bathing and failed to cleanse thoroughly, but Burgess observed that K.S.\u2019s genitalia were clean. Burgess also testified that she could have provided an anatomical drawing to review hygiene, and she had not recommended that the Fees photograph K.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">During closing arguments, defense counsel urged the jury to find that the Fees \u201cwere trying to help their disabled daughter be healthy and independent\u201d and to consider Rhonda Fee\u2019s \u201climitations.\u201d Defense counsel argued that the Fees photo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>graphed K.S. to aid in hygiene practices and failed to contemplate using a different visual aid. Counsel also challenged KS.\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The jury found the Fees guilty of all nine charges, and Rhonda Fee moved for a judgment of acquittal on grounds that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdicts, KS.\u2019s testimony violated the Confrontation Clause, and the indictment was multiplicitous. Rhonda Fee also moved for a new trial on the same grounds. The district court denied Rhonda Fee\u2019s post-trial motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Rhonda Fee later moved to reconsider her motion for a new trial based on what she described as newly-discovered evidence that supported her theory of defense. Before sentencing, the district court ordered that Rhonda Fee undergo a psychological examination, and she argued that findings of the psychologist, had they been available at trial, would have caused the district court to change its rulings about severance and K.S.\u2019s testimony by closed circuit television and affected the finding of the jury about Rhonda Fee\u2019s intent to exploit K.S. Rhonda Fee cited in her motion findings of the psychologist, Christine Agee, that Rhonda Fee had an intelligence quotient of borderline to low average; tended to be \u201coverly passive, submissive and compliant in interpersonal relationships and ... overly accepting of authority\u201d; and acted \u201csomewhat naive and gullible.\u201d Rhonda Fee also cited Agee\u2019s opinion that Rhonda Fee \u201cwould not have committed [the] offense on her own\u201d and that her \u201cdependent and introverted personality, combined with her limited cognitive functioning contributed to her decision to submit to her husband\u2019s judgment in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The district court denied Rhonda Fee\u2019s motion to reconsider. The district court ruled that \u201cnothing about the theory of defense [was] newly discovered and, because [Rhonda Fee] [was] arguing what she already argued at trial, [the evidence] [was] cumulative.\u201d The district court also ruled that Agee\u2019s testimony about Rhonda Fee\u2019s mental state would have been inadmissible at trial and would not have affected the ruling on her motion to sever.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">The district court sentenced Rhonda Fee to the mandatory minimum sentence for her production crimes. The district court ordered that Rhonda Fee serve eight concurrent terms of 180 months of imprisonment for producing child pornography to run concurrently with one term of 120 months for possessing child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether charges in an indictment are multiplicitous. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>601 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir.2010). Although the denial of a motion to sever is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Tobin, </em>676 F.3d 1264, 1273 (11th Cir.2012), a party must object to an order of a magistrate judge denying the motion to preserve the issue for appellate review, <em>United States v. Schultz, </em>565 F.3d 1353, 1359 (11th Cir.2009). We review <em>de novo </em>whether the admission of testimony by closed-circuit television violates the right of confrontation guaranteed under the Sixth Amendment. <em>United States v. Yates, </em>438 F.3d 1307, 1311 (11th Cir.2006) (en banc). \u201cA motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be overturned absent abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>13 F.3d 1464, 1472 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">Rhonda Fee raises four issues for our consideration, none of which merit relief. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>First, we address Fee\u2019s argument that the charges in her indictment were multiplici-tous. Second, we address briefly Fee\u2019s argument about her motion to sever. Third, we address Fee\u2019s challenge to the decision to allow K.S. to testify by closed-circuit television. Fourth, we address Fee\u2019s argument that she was entitled to a new trial based on newly-discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\n<em>A. Rhonda Fee\u2019s Indictment Was Not Multiplicitous.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Rhonda Fee argues that her indictment was multiplicitous because her superseding indictment involved a single crime of producing child pornography. Fee argues that section 2251(a) is aimed at proscribing the act of producing child pornography instead of proscribing the number of images produced. Fee\u2019s argument fails in the light of the plain text of section 2251(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">To be multiplicitous, an indictment must charge a defendant with a single offense in multiple counts. <em>Jones, </em>601 F.3d at 1258. A multiplicitous indictment violates the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment because it gives a jury \u201cmore than one opportunity to convict the defendant for the same offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When an indictment contains more than one count charging a violation of the same statute, our inquiry concerns whether Congress intended the different acts underlying each count to constitute a separate offense. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>231 F.3d 800, 815 (11th Cir.2000). \u201c \u2018[WJhether a continuous transaction results in the commission of but a single offense or separate offenses ... is determined by whether separate and distinct prohibited acts, made punishable by law, have been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>730 F.2d 669, 672 (11th Cir.1984) (quoting <em>Bins v. United States, </em>331 F.2d 390, 393 (5th Cir.1964)). The unit of prosecution is defined by the \u201cessence,\u201d or key element, of the statute. <em>Bins, </em>331 F.2d at 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Rhonda Fee\u2019s indictment is not multi-plicitous. Fee was charged with using a \u201cminor to engage in ... any sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a). The statute defines the offense of using a minor in broad terms involving \u201cany sexually explicit conduct\u201d and \u201cany visual depiction of such conduct.\u201d <em>See United States v. Gonzales, </em>520 U.S. 1, 5, 117 S.Ct. 1032, 1035, 137 L.Ed.2d 132 (1997) (\u201cRead naturally, the word \u2018an/ has an expansive meaning, that is, one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Laperriere v. Vesta Ins. Group, Inc., </em>526 F.3d 715, 726 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201c[T]he term \u201cany\u201d in a statute has a \u201cbroad,\u201d \u201cpowerful,\u201d and \u201cexpansive\u201d meaning; \u201cit does not mean \u2018some\u2019 or \u2018all but a few,\u2019 but instead means \u2018all.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Price v. Time, Inc., </em>416 F.3d 1327, 1336 (11th Cir.2005) (same as <em>Laperriere). </em>The text of section 2251(a) makes clear that Congress proscribed each discreet visual depiction of a minor as a separate offense. We agree with the Tenth Circuit that \u201c[t]he fact that multiple photographs [of K.S.] may have been sequentially produced during a single photography session is irrelevant\u201d because \u201c[e]ach photograph depended upon a separate and distinct use of [K.S.]\u201d <em>United States v. Esch, </em>832 F.2d 531, 542 (10th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">The indictment charged Rhonda Fee with eight separate acts of production of child pornography. Fee forced K.S. to engage in eight acts of sexually explicit conduct to produce separate visual depictions of that conduct. Fee manipulated KS.\u2019s body and directed K.S. to manipulate her body to produce separate images of specific aspects of KS.\u2019s genitalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Rhonda Fee argues that her interpretation of section 2251(a) is consistent with the reasoning of the Supreme Court in <em>Bell v. United States, </em>349 U.S. 81, 75 S.Ct. 620, 99 L.Ed. 905 (1955), but we disagree. The Court in <em>Bell </em>applied the rule of lenity and held that the Mann Act, which proscribed the transportation in interstate commerce of a woman for prostitution, failed to evidence a congressional intent to treat simultaneous transportation of several women as separate offenses. 349 U.S. at 82-83, 75 S.Ct. at 622. We may invoke the rule of lenity only where a \u201creasonable doubt persists about a statute\u2019s intended scope even <em>after </em>resort to the language and structure, legislative history, and motivating policies of the statute.\u201d <em>Moskal v. United States, </em>498 U.S. 103, 108, 111 S.Ct. 461, 112 L.Ed.2d 449 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted); see <em>United States v. Zuniga-Arteaga, </em>681 F.3d 1220, 1223 (11th Cir.2012). But section 2251(a) is not ambiguous. Its plain text establishes that Congress intended to punish an offender for each use of a minor to produce an image depicting sexually explicit conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\n<em>B. We Lack Jurisdiction to Consider Rhonda Fee\u2019s Argument about Severance.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Rhonda Fee argues that the magistrate judge erred by denying her motion to sever her trial from that of her husband, but we lack jurisdiction to review that argument. Rhonda Fee failed to object within 10 days to the ruling of the magistrate judge. She waived any objection to that ruling. Fed.R.Crim.P. 59(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\n<em>C. The District Court Did Not Violate Rhonda Fee\u2019s Right of Confrontation by Permitting KS. to Testify By Closedr-Circuit Television.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Rhonda Fee argues that the district court violated her right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment by allowing K.S. to testify by closed-circuit television. Fee argues that Plaxco\u2019s testimony did not support the finding by the district court that K.S. would suffer severe emotional trauma if forced to testify in the courtroom. Fee\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">Although the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the right to confront in open court a witness against her, that right is not absolute. <em>Maryland v. Craig, </em>497 U.S. 836, 849-50, 110 S.Ct. 3157, 3165-66, 111 L.Ed.2d 666 (1990); <em>Yates, </em>438 F.3d at 1312. A face-to-face confrontation is not required where the \u201cdenial of such confrontation is necessary to further an important public policy\u201d and \u201cthe reliability of the testimony is otherwise assured.\u201d <em>Craig, </em>497 U.S. at 850, 110 S.Ct. at 3166. And the Supreme Court held in <em>Craig </em>that the \u201cphysical and psychological well-being of child abuse victims ... [was] sufficiently important to outweigh ... a defendant\u2019s right to face ... her accusers in court\u201d if eliciting testimony through a remote device would \u201cprotect [the] child witness from trauma ... [that] would impair the child\u2019s ability to communicate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 853, 857, 110 S.Ct. at 3167, 3170.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">The Child Victims\u2019 and Child Witness\u2019 Rights Act permits a minor to testify outside the courtroom by two-way closed-circuit television when the district court \u201cfinds that the child is unable to testify in open court in the presence of the defendant.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3509(b)(1)(B). A child witness may testify using the remote procedure under four circumstances, including if the child \u201cis unable to testify because of fear\u201d or there exists \u201ca substantial likelihood, established by expert testimony, that the child would suffer emotional trauma from testifying.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The findings of the district court under section 3509 must satisfy the test established in <em>Craig. Yates, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>438 F.3d at 1313. The district court must find that testifying by remote means is \u201cnecessary to protect the welfare of the particular child witness,\u201d <em>Craig, </em>497 U.S. at 855, 110 S.Ct. at 3169; the \u201cchild witness would be traumatized, not by the courtroom generally, but by the presence of the defendant,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 856, 110 S.Ct. at 3169; and the \u201cemotional distress suffered by the child witness in the presence of the defendant is more than <em>de minimis, </em>i.e., more than mere nervousness or excitement or some reluctance to testify,\u201d <em>id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">The district court did not err by allowing K.S. to testify against Rhonda Fee by closed-circuit television. The district court complied with the procedures outlined in and made the findings required under the Child Rights\u2019 Act. And the United States established that K.S. would suffer trauma if forced to testify in Rhonda Fee\u2019s presence. Plaxco, who counseled K.S., testified that K.S. \u201csaid that she was scared to go to court,\u201d which she exhibited through engaging in self-mutilation; panicking at the sound of Rhonda Fee\u2019s voice; and obsessing about her proximity to Fee in the courtroom. Plaxco also testified that KS.\u2019s distress and anxiety exceeded that of any other child that Plaxco had counseled. Fee failed to present any evidence to cast doubt on Plaxco\u2019s qualifications or her counseling methodology; contradict Plaxco\u2019s recollections or observations; or undermine Plaxco\u2019s opinion that requiring K.S. to testify in Rhonda Fee\u2019s presence would \u201c[a]bsolutely\u201d inflict emotional trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\n<em>D. The District Court Did Not Abuse its Discretion When It Denied Rhonda Fee\u2019s Motion for a New Trial.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Rhonda Fee was not entitled to a new trial based on Agee\u2019s psychological report. A new trial predicated on newly-discovered evidence is warranted only if the defendant discovers new evidence after trial that could not have been discovered earlier by exercising due diligence and the evidence is material, not cumulative of other evidence introduced, and would probably have produced a different result at trial. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>422 F.3d 1285, 1294 (11th Cir.2005). Agee\u2019s findings about Rhonda Fee\u2019s acuity did not constitute new evidence because Dr. Ack-erson had communicated to Fee before trial that she had an intelligence quotient of \u201cborderline to low average.\u201d Agee\u2019s findings also were cumulative to evidence and arguments presented by Rhonda Fee to the jury. Fee\u2019s defense focused on her lack of intent to produce child pornography, and defense counsel invited the jury to consider \u201climitations\u201d that Fee exhibited during her testimony. Fee could not have introduced testimony from Agee that Fee lacked the intent to produce child pornography and would not have committed the offense independently. Fed.R.Evid. 704(b). And we cannot conclude that the remainder of Agee\u2019s report would probably have changed the outcome of Fee\u2019s trial. Information in Agee\u2019s report that Fee had attended a junior college and obtained a professional degree in accounting would have contradicted Fee\u2019s argument that she lacked the intelligence to use means other than the photographs to educate K.S. about personal hygiene. In addition, the United States introduced eight photographs that Fee produced depicting K.S. in a sexually explicit manner, and the jury apparently discredited Fee\u2019s testimony that she did not produce or retain the photographs for their sexual content.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">We AFFIRM Rhonda Fee\u2019s convictions for producing and possessing child pornography.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
