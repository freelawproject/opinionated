In a prior case, a district court in the Western District of Texas dismissed Arizpe\u2019s claims with prejudice and enjoined Arizpe from filing any suit related to his employment with the Department of Transportation without first obtaining leave of court \u201cafter demonstrating that his claim is timely, was exhausted (if applicable), and is not barred by res judicata, collateral estoppel or other legal doctrine.\u201d <em>Arizpe v. Cino, </em>No. SA-06-CA-563-FB (W.D.Tex. Apr. 20, 2007). We affirmed. <em>Arizpe v. Peters, </em>260 Fed.Appx. 663 (5th Cir. Dec.21, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-15\">In May 2012, Arizpe sought leave to file a civil complaint under a host of federal statutes, alleging employment discrimination by the Department of Transportation and, relatedly, the Federal Aviation Administration. Noting that the proposed complaint asserted claims \u201cagain relating to [Arizpe\u2019s] past employment by the Department of Transportation,\u201d the district court concluded that Arizpe failed to show that his claims were not barred by res judicata, collateral estoppel, or another legal doctrine and denied Arizpe\u2019s request for leave. Arizpe appeals that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-20\">We generally review denials of leave under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See In re Raz, </em>252 Fed.Appx. 609 (5th Cir.2007) (reviewing a district court\u2019s refusal to grant a \u201cprolific filer\u201d leave to file a new complaint for abuse of discretion). However, the application of res judicata and collateral estoppel are conclusions of law that we review <em>de novo. Davis v. Dallas Area Rapid Transit, </em>383 F.3d 309, 313 (5th Cir.2004) (\u201cThe res judicata effect of a prior judgment is a question of law that we review <em>de novo.\u201d); Stripling v. Jordan Prod. Co., LLC, </em>234 F.3d 863, 868 (5th Cir.2000) (\u201cThe application of collateral estoppel is a question of law that we review de novo\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-21\">As he did before the district court, Ar-izpe argues on appeal that res judicata and collateral estoppel do not apply because a jury never heard his cases. But a jury trial is not a prerequisite to the application of claim and issue preclusion principles. <em>See, e.g., Duffie v. United States, </em>600 F.3d 362, 372 (5th Cir.2010) (holding that an agreed decision in Tax Court had preclu-sive effect); <em>Duffy &amp; McGovern Accommodation Servs. v. QCI Marine Offshore, Inc., </em>448 F.3d 825 (5th Cir.2006) (holding that a federal court\u2019s order dismissing a case because a forum selection clause mandated venue in England met the requirements for collateral estoppel). Moreover, a review of the record and Arizpe\u2019s previous filings in the Western District of Texas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>demonstrates that Arizpe\u2019s proposed claims against the Secretary of the Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration arise out of the same nucleus of operative facts that were at issue in his prior lawsuits. <em>See Test Masters Ed. Servs., Inc. v. Singh, </em>428 F.3d 559 (5th Cir.2005) (citing <em>New York Life Insur. Co. v. Gillispie, </em>203 F.3d 384, 387 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Davis v. Dallas Area Rapid Transit, </em>383 F.3d 309 (5th Cir.2004)) (The \u201ccritical issue\u201d in a res judicata analysis \u201cis whether the two actions are based on the \u2018same nucleus of operative facts.\u2019 \u201d). We agree with the district court that Ar-izpe has failed to make the required showing that his claims are not barred by collateral estoppel, res judicata, or another legal doctrine. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Arizpe leave to file his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b497-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
