J &amp; J Sports Productions, Inc. (\u201cJ &amp; J\u201d) sued Taquer\u00eda Jalisco, Inc. (\u201cTaquer\u00eda\u201d) and its manager, Juan Carlos Lopez, for unlawfully exhibiting a boxing program to which J &amp; J owns the exclusive nationwide distribution rights. The material facts are not in dispute. <em>See </em>Order dated December 30, 2011 at 2. J &amp; J had exclusive rights to the <em>Oscar de la Hoya v, Manny Pacquiao-Welterweight Championship Fight Program </em>which took place on December 6, 2008; Taquer\u00eda displayed the program at its restaurant that day; Ta-quer\u00eda and Lopez did not pay a commercial licensing fee to show the program (but Lopez paid the residential fee for the program); Taquer\u00eda and Lopez received the program via satellite signal; and the program was shown on two screens to patrons at the restaurant. Since the material facts were not in dispute, the District Court ruled that J &amp; J were entitled to summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 6.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court\u2019s order directed J &amp; J to submit proof of its damages and gave the defendants an opportunity to respond. After reviewing the parties\u2019 submissions, the court, in an order dated February 24, 2012, awarded J &amp; J $7,500 in statutory damages, <em>see </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 605(e)(3)(C)(i)(II),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> $50,000 in enhanced statutory damages,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and $13,255 in attorney\u2019s fees. The court thereafter entered judgment for J &amp; J against the defendants in the foregoing amounts, $70,755.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-13\">Taquer\u00eda and Lopez appeal the court\u2019s judgment, arguing that (1) they were entitled to a jury trial with respect to the statutory damages, Appellants\u2019 Br. at 12; (2) because J &amp; J failed to prove \u201cactual damages\u201d (J &amp; J represented to the court that it could not quantify its actual loss), J &amp; J could not \u201cdemonstrate an \u2018injury in fact\u2019 \u201d, as required by Article III of the Constitution, and therefore \u201clacked standing to pursue [its] claims\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 13; (3) J &amp; J failed to prove its entitlement to the enhanced statutory damages, <em>id. </em>at 18; and (4) the court \u201cabused its discretion when it allowed [J &amp; J] to amend the complaint to include a known party,\u201d i.e., Lopez, <em>id. </em>at 20. For the reasons stated in the District Court\u2019s orders of December 30, 2011, and February 24, 2012, these arguments lack merit. The District Court\u2019s judgment is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b989-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b989-10\">. The court also granted J &amp; J summary judgment on Taqueria\u2019s counterclaim for state and federal RICO violations and fraud in an order dated February 29, 2012. This decision is not before us in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b989-11\">. J &amp; J elected to receive statutory rather than actual damages. <em>See </em>Order, February 24, 2012. Section 605(e)(3)(C)(i)(II) authorizes damages for each violation of not less than $1,000 nor more than $10,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b989-16\">.If the court finds that the violation was committed \"willfully and for purposes of direct or indirect commercial advantage or private financial gain,\u201d it may award enhanced damages not to exceed $100,000 for each violation. <em>See </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 605(e)(3)(C)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
