The refund was ordered because Mariculture failed to comply with the requirement that it purchase Non-insured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (\u201cNAP\u201d) coverage for two years. Maricul-ture brought this action in the District Court as an appeal of that administrative decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-18\">In an order entered on June 9, 2011, the District Court, on the basis of the administrative record, granted the Secretary of the USDA (and the Farm Service Agency) judgment. The court concluded that the refund decision was supported by substantial evidence and was not arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion. Maricul-ture appeals the District Court\u2019s judgment, arguing that the District Court\u2019s findings (in support of its judgment) are \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 20, 27-29. We find no merit in Mariculture\u2019s appeal, for the reasons stated in the District Court\u2019s June 9, 2011 order, and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
