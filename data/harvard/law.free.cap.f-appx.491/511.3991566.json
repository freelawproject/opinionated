Construing Russell\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel in a \u201ccrack case\u201d as an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction based on a retroactive amendment to the crack cocaine guidelines, the district court granted Russell a one-month reduction in his sentence. In denying Russell\u2019s subsequent motion to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, the district court certified that Russell\u2019s appeal was frivolous and was not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Russell now seeks leave to appeal IFP, and he has filed an appeal brief. By moving to proceed IFP, Russell is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into whether an appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence in certain cases where the sentencing range has been subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). We review the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Russell argues that the indictment was invalid, that he was \u201c \u2018RAILROADED\u2019 \u201d by the Government, that he was not trafficking in drugs, that the drugs found pursuant to a search warrant were \u201cFruits of the Poisonous Tree,\u201d that the Government did not prove any violation of Texas\u2019s weapons or drug statutes, that the pre-sentence report contained inaccurate information, and that his sentence should be reduced to time served. He seeks the return of seized currency in the amount of $7,637. Russell\u2019s arguments are not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Dillon, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2691-94. Accordingly, Russell has failed to show that his appeal involves a nonfrivolous issue. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">IT IS ORDERED that his motion for IFP is DENIED. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b537-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
