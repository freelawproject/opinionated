He argues that the district court erred in denying his request for a mitigating-role adjustment under the Sentencing Guidelines. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Miranda pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute oxycodone in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, multiple counts of distribution of oxycodone in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C), and multiple counts of distribution of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C). At sentencing, the district court adopted the factual findings in the presen-tence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), and held Miranda accountable for 7,109 pills of oxycodone, the total number of pills distributed by the whole conspiracy during the period he was a member of it. Miranda sold oxycodone as part of a conspiracy to unlawfully acquire prescription drugs (primarily oxycodone) and distribute them. According to the PSI, when law enforcement officers visited the drug house under surveillance in order to purchase drugs, Miranda would usually be the person selling the drugs. The PSI also indicated that Miranda played a larger role in the conspiracy than merely selling drugs: he seemingly protected the drug house with a loaded shotgun pointed at the entrance; he screened prospective buyers to ensure they were not law enforcement officers by questioning buyers and, sometimes, forcing them to use the drugs before buying them; and he arranged for future transactions by giving buyers his cell phone number.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Based on the number of pills involved, the total offense level was 81. Although Miranda requested a reduction for his minor role in the offenses, the court did not apply a mitigating-role adjustment. The offense level, combined with a criminal history category of III, resulted in a guideline range of 135-168 months. The district court departed downward from this range and sentenced Miranda to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. This is Miranda\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">We review a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense, a finding of fact, only for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc). </em>At sentencing, the defendant has the burden of proving a mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 939. \u201c[A] district court is not required to make any specific findings other than the ultimate determination of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 940. We should affirm \u201c[s]o long as the basis of the [district] court\u2019s decision is supported by the record <em>and </em>does not involve a misapplication of a rule of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">A district court may grant a 4-level reduction in the offense level to a \u201cminimal participant\u201d in the crime, a 2-level reduction to a \u201cminor participant,\u201d and a 3-level reduction to cases falling in between. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. A \u201cminimal participant\u201d is a defendant who is \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group,\u201d and a \u201cminor participant\u201d is one who is \u201cless culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (nn.4-5).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">In making the mitigating-role determination, the district court must first measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which he has been held accountable. <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>175 F.3d at 940. \u201cOnly if the defendant can establish that [he] played a relatively minor role in the conduct for which [he] has already been held accountable \u2014 not a minor role in any larger criminal conspiracy \u2014 should the district court grant a downward adjustment ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. Second, to the extent the record permits, the court may measure the defendant\u2019s culpability in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>comparison to that of other participants in the relevant conduct. <em>Id. </em>The district court may grant a reduction only if the defendant was less culpable than most other participants. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Miranda argues that the district court clearly erred in denying a mitigating-role adjustment because he was not personally responsible for the quantity of drugs for which he was held accountable. We disagree. Although he was held accountable for more drugs than he personally sold, the record supports a conclusion that Miranda was neither a minor participant nor a minimal one. As discussed above, he played a larger role in the conspiracy than selling drugs, and the record does not indicate that he sold an insignificant portion of the drugs for which he was held accountable.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Additionally, the record reflects that Miranda was not, as he suggests, the \u201cbottom person in the hierarchy.\u201d Although he did not organize the conspiracy or acquire the drugs for it, he served an integral role by routinely selling drugs out of a house over a period of approximately four months. <em>See United States v. Matthews, </em>168 F.3d 1234, 1249 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201cThe district court, considering a drug distribution conspiracy, is justified in denying a downward departure ... to any defendant who regularly sells ... drugs.... \u201d). The record supports a conclusion that Miranda was no less culpable than some other members of the conspiracy, such as those who acquired the oxycodone.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Because we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in denying Miranda\u2019s request for a mitigating-role adjustment, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
