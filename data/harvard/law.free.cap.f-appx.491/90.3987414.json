After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-18\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b117-19\">A. The Royalty Fees Contract</p>\n<p id=\"b117-20\">Plaintiff Wilkening\u2019s company, Big Bin Services, Inc. (\u201cBig Bin\u201d), purchased a piece of property in Lowndes County, Georgia. Big Bin then obtained a permit to operate a landfill on the site.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-21\">In 1991, Plaintiff Wilkening sold Big Bin and its assets to Equivest Waste Solutions. At the same time, Big Bin agreed to pay Plaintiff Wilkening royalty fees of \u201c$1.00 for <em>each ton of waste, if any, delivered to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number><em>the Landfill (including any contiguous </em>and/or vertical <em>expansions thereof </em>approved by the Environmental Protection Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources) ... and accepted by Big Bin.... \u201d (Emphasis added). The contract defined \u201ccontiguous\u201d to mean \u201cany property within a one mile radius of the Landfill.\u201d Thus, Big Bin agreed to pay royalty fees for \u201cwaste\u201d delivered to the landfill or to an expansion on any property within one mile of the landfill.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">In 1998, through a series of mergers and corporate name changes, Defendant Veolia Pecan Row Landfill, LLC (\u201cVeolia Pecan Row\u201d) became the owner and operator of Big Bin\u2019s \u201cLandfill.\u201d Defendants Veolia Pecan Row and Veolia ES Evergreen Landfill, Inc. (\u201cVeolia Evergreen\u201d) are both wholly-owned subsidiaries of Veolia ES North America, LLC.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">In 2002, Defendant Veolia Evergreen acquired an already-permitted landfill from the Deep South Regional Solid Waste Management Authority (\u201cDeep South Authority\u201d). Veolia Evergreen\u2019s landfill is adjacent to, and shares a common boundary with, Veolia Pecan Row\u2019s landfill. Veolia Evergreen acquired this adjacent landfill intending to move Veolia Pecan Row\u2019s operations and waste stream to the Evergreen landfill once the Pecan Row landfill reached capacity, which it did in 2010. In addition, between 2002 and 2010, the two landfills shared Pecan Row\u2019s mailing address, front entrance, scales and some internal roads.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">B. Wilkening\u2019s Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Plaintiff Wilkening\u2019s complaint alleged that Defendants breached the royalty fees contract by failing to pay Wilkening for (1) reusable or recyclable material delivered to Veolia Pecan Row\u2019s landfill and (2) material deposited in Veolia Evergreen\u2019s adjacent landfill. Wilkening sought damages in the form of royalty payments for material deposited in Veolia Pecan Row\u2019s and Veolia Evergreen\u2019s landfills.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">After extensive discovery, Wilkening moved for summary judgment. In response, Defendants Veolia Pecan Row and Veolia Evergreen argued: (1) that recyclable and reusable material delivered to the Pecan Row landfill is not \u201cwaste\u201d under the royalty fees contract because it is not deposited in the landfill so as to deplete capacity; and (2) that Veolia Evergreen\u2019s landfill is a separate landfill, rather than an \u201cexpansion\u201d of Veolia Pecan Row\u2019s landfill within the meaning of the royalty fees contract.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-13\">C. District Court\u2019s Rulings</p>\n<p id=\"b118-14\">The district court granted Plaintiff Wilk-ening\u2019s summary judgment motion as to liability, but denied it as damages. The district court found the term \u201cwaste\u201d in the royalty fees contract to be unambiguous and refused to \u201clook outside the four corners of the Agreement to define the term.\u201d Instead, the district court concluded that \u201c[wjaste simply means waste.\u201d The district court referred to the ordinary, dictionary definition of \u201crefuse or superfluous material\u201d and \u201cdamaged, defective, or superfluous material produced during or left over from a manufacturing process or industrial operation, scrap, refuse from places of human or animal habitation and garbage, rubbish.\u201d (Quotation marks omitted). The district court determined that the ordinary definition of \u201cwaste,\u201d would include the kind of recyclable and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>reusable material (such as construction and demolition material, chemical mixing agents, shredder fluff, foundry sand and by-product ash) delivered to Defendants\u2019 landfills and that how Defendants classified this material after delivery was irrelevant. Thus, the district court concluded that under the royalty fees contract, Wilk-ening is entitled to payment for waste, including waste Veolia Pecan Row classified as recyclable and reusable, delivered to Veolia Pecan Row\u2019s landfill.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">With respect to Veolia Evergreen\u2019s landfill, the district court noted the following undisputed facts: (1) the EPD issued a solid waste permit for the landfill Veolia Evergreen purchased, and the permit was transferred to Veolia Evergreen; (2) Veo-lia Evergreen \u201cpurchased the Evergreen Landfill in order to continue and expand its solid waste business\u201d; (3) \u201cthe Evergreen Landfill is located within one mile of the Pecan Row Landfill.\u201d The district court concluded that, because Veolia Evergreen\u2019s landfill is located within a one mile radius of Veolia Pecan Row\u2019s landfill, Wilk-ening is entitled to royalty payments for past and future waste delivered to the Veolia Evergreen landfill. After a hearing, the district court issued a second order awarding Wilkening $707,411.01 in damages for unpaid royalty payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">On appeal, Defendants do not challenge the amount of damages. Rather, they argue, as they did in the district court, that (1) \u201cwaste\u201d does not include recyclable or reusable material; and (2) the Veolia Evergreen landfill is not a contiguous \u201cexpansion\u201d of the Veolia Pecan Row landfill.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">After review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment to Wilkening. The district court properly concluded that the term \u201cwaste\u201d in the royalty fees contract is unambiguous and should be given its plain and ordinary meaning. See <em>American Empire Surplus Lines Ins. Co. v. Hathaway Dev. Co., Inc., </em>288 Ga. 749, 750, 707 S.E.2d 369, 371 (2011) (explaining that if the contract\u2019s terms are unambiguous, the court enforces the contract according to its terms and looks only to the contract for the meaning); <em>Benton v. Patel, </em>257 Ga. 669, 672, 362 S.E.2d 217, 220 (1987) (stating that words in a contract \u201cwill be given their ordinary signification, and where the language in the document is plain, its meaning will not be extended by interpretation\u201d); O.C.G.A. \u00a7 13-2-2(2) (providing that contract terms are generally given their \u201cusual and common signification\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">For the reasons given by the district court, we find no merit to Defendants\u2019 argument that the term \u201cwaste\u201d actually refers to \u201csolid waste,\u201d as defined in the Georgia\u2019s Solid Waste Management Act, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 12-8-22(25). Nor do we accept that the term \u201cwaste\u201d contains a latent ambiguity in that it could refer to \u201csolid waste.\u201d As the district court explained, had the parties intended this meaning, commonly used in the waste management industry, they could have inserted the word \u201csolid\u201d before the word \u201cwaste,\u201d but they did not. Moreover, because the term \u201cwaste\u201d is clear and unambiguous, the district court correctly declined Defendants\u2019 invitation to look outside the contract to determine the parties\u2019 intent. <em>See Invin v. Laxmi, Inc., </em>266 Ga. 204, 205, 467 S.E.2d 510, 512 (1996) (\u201cParol evidence may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>be considered unless the written instrument is ambiguous.\u201d); <em>S. Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n of Atlanta v. Lyle, </em>249 Ga. 284, 287, 290 S.E.2d 455, 458 (1982) (stating that the court may \u201clook outside the written terms of the contract\u201d to determine the parties\u2019 intent only when an ambiguity exists).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Defendants also challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that the Veolia Evergreen landfill was a \u201ccontiguous\u201d \u201cexpansion\u201d of Veolia Pecan Row\u2019s landfill. Defendants point to the fact that the Evergreen landfill was originally developed and separately permitted by the Deep South Authority to compete with the Pecan Row landfill. However, in this record, it is also undisputed that Veolia Evergreen acquired the landfill in 2002 for the purpose of moving Veolia Pecan Row\u2019s operation and customers to the Veolia Evergreen landfill when the Pecan Row landfill filled up. In fact, Veolia Evergreen represented to the EPD that its landfill was intended \u201cto serve as a continuation of landfilling for the Pecan Row Landfill once that landfill reaches capacity\u201d and that \u201cboth landfills will handle the same waste stream in succession from Pecan Row Landfill to Evergreen Landfill.\u201d Similarly, in meetings with EPD staff, Veolia consultants explained that Veolia (the parent company of Veolia Pecan Row and Veolia Evergreen) planned to \u201cmove their operations to the Evergreen site\u201d as the Pecan Row landfill filled up. Between 2002 and 2010, the Veolia Evergreen landfill shared the Veolia Pecan Row landfill\u2019s mailing address, front entrance, scales and some internal roads. And, by the time the Veolia Evergreen landfill began operating in 2010, the Veolia Pecan Row landfill\u2019s customers and employees in fact had been \u201ctransitioned\u201d to the Veolia Evergreen landfill.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Defendants also point out that the EPD does not consider the Veolia Evergreen landfill to be a horizontal or vertical \u201cexpansion\u201d of the Veolia Pecan Row landfill, as those terms are defined by Georgia law, and has not regulated it as such. This is not surprising since no one contends that the Veolia Evergreen landfill is a horizontal or vertical expansion. <em>See </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 12-8-24(e)(l)(C)(ii) (requiring permit modifications for \u201cvertical or horizontal expansion\u201d); Ga. Comp. R. <em>&amp; </em>Regs. \u00a7 391-3-4-01(29) &amp; (74) (defining lateral and vertical expansion). Moreover, EPD staff testified that, although the Veolia Evergreen and Veolia Pecan Row landfills are separately-permitted landfills, they would be counted as one landfill under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 12-8-25.4 because the Veolia Evergreen landfill is a \u201ccontiguous expansion\u201d of the Veolia Pecan Row landfill under that statute. <em>See </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 12-8-25.4 (allowing only three permitted solid waste facilities within a two-mile radius, but providing that two contiguous facilities with the same owner and permitted for the same type of landfill are counted as one).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Finally, Defendants assert two additional arguments for why they are not liable: (1) Veolia Evergreen was not a \u201csuccessor\u201d party to Big Bin under the royalty fees contract; and (2) Veolia Pecan Row itself never \u201caccepted\u201d waste delivered to the Veolia Evergreen landfill. Because Defendants did not fairly raise these issues before the district court, we do not address them. <em>See Resolution Trust Corp. v. Dunmar Corp., </em>43 F.3d 587, 598-99 (11th Cir.1995) (en banc) (explaining that arguments not fairly raised in the district court generally are not considered on appeal); <em>In re Pan Am. World Airways, Inc., </em>905 F.2d 1457, 1462 (11th Cir.1990) (\u201c[I]f a party hopes to preserve a claim, argument, theory, or defense for appeal, she must first clearly present it to the district court, that is, in such a way as to afford the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>court an opportunity to recognize and rule on it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">For these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s final judgment in favor of Plaintiff Wilkening.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b117-10\">. \"We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standards that bind the district court.\u201d <em>Storfer v. Guar. Trust Life Ins. Co., </em>666 F.3d 1277, 1278-79 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b118-8\">. Veolia ES North America, LLC was named as a defendant in Wilkening\u2019s original complaint, but not in his amended complaint.
