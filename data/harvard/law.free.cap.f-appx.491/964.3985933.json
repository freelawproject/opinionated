California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). An independent review of the record reveals no issue of arguable merit for us to consider on appeal. Therefore, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED and Milton\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED. We do note a clerical error in the judgment, however. The written judgment states that Milton was convicted of possessing cocaine base with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), but Milton was convicted of distributing cocaine base under that statute. We therefore VACATE AND REMAND for the limited purpose of entering a judgment in conformity with the indictment and Milton\u2019s plea.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
