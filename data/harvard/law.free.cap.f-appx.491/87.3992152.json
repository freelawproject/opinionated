At that time, the district court determined that Cover was eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because Amendment 599 was retroactively applicable and had the actual effect of lowering his guideline range from 211-248 months of imprisonment to 138-157 months of imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But, after considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court declined to exercise its discretion to reduce Cover\u2019s sentence. The court specifically emphasized that Cover had not assisted the government in identifying other participants in the underlying offense. The court found that Cover \u201cnever evinced true remorse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">In the course of later appeals, different panels of this Court affirmed the substance of this ruling, holding that it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to deny relief. And, in rejecting Cover\u2019s latest motion for a sentence reduction, the district court concluded that there was no reason for it to reconsider its prior analysis. On appeal, Cover urges us to set aside this decision. Specifically, he argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s intervening decisions in <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010), and <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), have undermined the district court\u2019s 2001 ruling. Cover also asserts that the district court\u2019s reliance on the fact that he had chosen not to identify other participants in his offense was improper because it infringed upon his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-15\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 792 (11th Cir.2009). However, we review <em>de novo </em>the legal conclusions the district court makes in ruling on such a motion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-16\">Section 3582(c)(2) provides that a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if a defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by an amendment to the guidelines. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be consistent with the policy statement issued by the Sentencing Commission regarding this kind of relief, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 (2011). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Under these provisions, a district court undertakes a two-step process for ruling on a motion for a sentence reduction. <em>See Dillon, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2691. First, the district court must determine the guideline range that would have applied to the defendant had the amendment to the guidelines been in effect at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>defendant\u2019s sentencing. <em>See id. </em>Second, if the amendment has the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s guideline range, then the court must decide whether to exercise its discretion to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence by considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See id. </em>at 2691-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">As set out above, the district court held at step one that Cover was eligible for a sentence reduction because Amendment 599 was retroactively applicable and had the effect of lowering his guideline range. But, at step two, the district court concluded that a sentence reduction was not warranted in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. With this background in mind, we turn to the arguments that Cover raises in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">First, Cover asserts that the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Dillon </em>and <em>Freeman </em>require reconsideration of the district court\u2019s 2001 ruling. We are not persuaded by this argument. The specific question that the Supreme Court considered in <em>Dillon </em>was whether its decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), rendered the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement on sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) advisory. <em>See Dillon, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2687. The Supreme Court held that it did not. <em>See id. </em>This holding simply does not indicate that the district court in this case abused its discretion in considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors at step two of the inquiry. If anything, <em>Dillon </em>affirms the framework that the district court applied, including the principle that, at step two, it is \u201cin [the] discretion\u201d of the district court to determine whether a reduction is ultimately warranted. <em>Id. </em>at 2692.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">Neither does <em>Freeman </em>change the picture. The question presented in that case was whether a defendant who, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C), enters into a plea agreement that recommends a particular sentence is eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Freeman, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2689 (plurality opinion). In her controlling concurrence,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Justice Sotomayor concluded that such a defendant is eligible for relief, but only if the sentencing recommendation in the 1 1(c)(1)(C) plea agreement itself was expressly made on the basis of a guideline range. <em>See id. </em>at 2695 (Sotoma-yor, J., concurring in the judgment). This holding has no bearing here. Cover pleaded guilty without entering into a plea agreement, let alone one pursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(C). <em>See United States v. Cover, </em>199 F.3d 1270, 1273 (11th Cir.2000). Also, the district court held at step one that Cover <em>was </em>eligible for a reduction. It simply decided not to exercise its discretion to grant relief at step two.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">Finally, Cover asserts that, by relying on the fact that he had chosen not to identify other participants in the underlying offense to deny his request for a sentence reduction, the district court im-permissibly infringed upon his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The weight of our precedent requires us to reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-13\">We have previously dismissed a Fifth Amendment challenge to the provision of the Sentencing Guidelines that authorizes a reduction in a defendant\u2019s offense level based on the defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 (2011). <em>See United States v. Carroll, </em>6 F.3d 735, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>739-40 (11th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Henry, </em>883 F.2d 1010, 1010-12 (11th Cir.1989). Specifically, we held that \u201cconditioning sentence reductions on a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility does not violate the Fifth Amendment,\u201d even though this may mean that a defendant who chooses to remain silent may face a longer sentence. <em>Carroll, </em>6 F.3d at 739. The reason for this, we said, is that the acceptance of responsibility provision \u201cis not a punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 740. Instead, \u201cit provides only for [a] sentence reduction\u201d and thus is best understood as a \u201cbenefit,\u201d one that reflects a \u201ctradition of leniency\u201d toward defendants who show remorse. <em>Henry, </em>883 F.2d at 1011 n. 6, 1012. This being the case, we concluded that the denial of a reduction in the offense level of a defendant who chooses to remain silent does not amount to a penalty for the exercise of that right. <em>See id. </em>at 1011-12; <em>see also Carroll, </em>6 F.3d at 739-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">This reasoning applies with equal \u2014 if not, greater \u2014 force to sentence reductions pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The Supreme Court has observed that sentence reductions under this statutory provision \u201care not constitutionally compelled.\u201d <em>Dillon, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2692. \u201cRather, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) represents a congressional act of lenity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The statute offers \u201cprisoners the benefit of later enacted adjustments to the judgments reflected in the Guidelines,\u201d one that would otherwise be simply unavailable because of the rule of finality. <em>Id. </em>Given that a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is thus a benefit, its denial\u2014 under our precedent \u2014 cannot be said to amount to a penalty. See <em>Carroll, </em>6 F.3d at 739-40; <em>see also Henry, </em>883 F.2d at 1011 (declining to \u201cequate the possibility of leniency with impermissible punishment\u201d). From this, it follows that a district court\u2019s decision to deny a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) in light of a defendant\u2019s decision to remain silent does not infringe upon the exercise of that Fifth Amendment right.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b114-9\">.
