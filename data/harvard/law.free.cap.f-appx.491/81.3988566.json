No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">On 14 January 2010, Smith filed his section 1983 complaint against various prison' officers and medical staff (\u201cDefendants\u201d), alleging that he had received inadequate medical care for his knee injury in violation of the Eighth Amendment. On 30 March 2010 \u2014 before Defendants filed a responsive pleading and before the district court ruled on his original complaint\u2014 Smith filed a \u201cSupplemental Complaint\u201d in which he asserted new claims and named additional defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">Defendants moved to dismiss Smith\u2019s original complaint for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies under section 1997e(a). Under the Georgia Department of Corrections grievance process, prisoners must attempt to resolve grievances internally by following these three steps: (1) file an informal grievance, to which the prisoner\u2019s counselor must respond within 10 days; (2) file a formal grievance, to which the warden must respond within 30 days; and (3) file an appeal with the Central Office in Atlanta, to which the Commissioner must respond within 90 days. Smith completed the first two steps of this grievance process and filed an appeal with the Central Office. But he failed either to receive the Commissioner\u2019s denial of his appeal or to wait the requisite 90 days before filing his section 1983 complaint. The Commissioner then provided a timely denial of Smith\u2019s appeal on 1 March 2010, well after Smith filed this suit on 14 January.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-13\">The magistrate judge concluded that Smith had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and recommended granting Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. In a footnote, the magistrate judge acknowledged Smith\u2019s supplemental complaint, but stated that \u201cfor reasons which will become apparent in this recommendation, the addition of these [defendants] and [Smith\u2019s] new claims is unnecessary.\u201d Smith objected to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, contending that his supplemental complaint \u2014 filed after he received the Commissioner\u2019s denial of his appeal \u2014 cured the exhaustion defect. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and dismissed Smith\u2019s complaint. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>We review <em>de novo </em>dismissals for failure to exhaust administrative remedies under section 1997e(a). <em>See Alexander v. Hawk, </em>159 F.3d 1321, 1323 (11th Cir.1998). In addition, we liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>See Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">Section 1997e(a) provides that \u201c[n]o action shall be <em>brought </em>with respect to prison conditions under [section 1983], or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) (emphasis added). \u201cCongress enacted this mandatory exhaustion requirement ... as part of the PLRA\u2019s effort to curtail frivolous and abusive prisoner litigation.\u201d <em>Alexander, </em>159 F.3d at 1324. Because \u201cexhaustion is now a precondition to suit,\u201d courts lack discretion to waive the exhaustion requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 1325-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">We have interpreted the term \u201cbrought\u201d \u2014 as used in section 1997e(a) \u2014 to mean \u201cthe filing or commencement of a lawsuit, not ... its continuation.\u201d <em>See Harris v. Garner, </em>216 F.3d 970, 974 (11th Cir.2000) <em>(en banc) </em>(interpreting section 1997e(e) of the PLRA, but noting expressly that we interpret the term \u201cbrought\u201d identically under both sections 1997e(a) and 1997e(e)). Thus, \u201cwhen a state provides a grievance procedure for its prisoners, as Georgia does here, an inmate alleging harm suffered from prison conditions must file a grievance and exhaust the remedies available under that procedure <em>before </em>pursuing a \u00a7 1983 lawsuit.\u201d <em>Brown v. Sikes, </em>212 F.3d 1205, 1207 (11th Cir.2000) (emphasis added). That Smith failed to exhaust his administrative remedies before filing his original complaint is undisputed. But on appeal, Smith contends that his supplemental complaint cured the exhaustion defect.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">As an initial matter, whether Smith sought to amend his complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a), or to supplement his complaint under Rule 15(d), is unclear. The record also fails to establish whether the district court ever permitted Smith to amend or supplement his complaint. That Smith\u2019s \u201cSupplemental Complaint\u201d was never served on Defendants and that the magistrate judge\u2019s report indicated that such a supplement was \u201cunnecessary\u201d suggest that such permission was not granted. But, even if we assume \u2014 without deciding \u2014 that Smith was permitted to amend or supplement his complaint, his \u201cSupplemental Complaint\u201d fails to cure the exhaustion defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-12\">The only facts pertinent to determining whether a prisoner has satisfied the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement are those that existed when he filed his original complaint. <em>See Harris, </em>216 F.3d at 981. Because Smith\u2019s attempt to amend or supplement his original complaint did not change the important historical fact: his administrative remedies were unexhausted when he filed his original complaint. Therefore, he cannot cure the exhaustion defect. <em>See id. </em>(stating that an amended or supplemental complaint could not cure the original defective complaint because \u201c[n]o amendment or supplement to a pleading can change a historical fact.\u201d). And although Rule 15(d) permits parties to supplement a pleading even when the original pleading is defective, Rule 15 \u201cdoes not and cannot override a substantive requirement or restriction contained in a statute (especially a subsequently enacted one).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 982-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Because Smith failed to exhaust his administrative remedies before he \u201cbrought\u201d his section 1988 suit, dismissal was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b109-6\"> Smith also argues that he was not required to identify each Defendant during the prison grievance process. Because we conclude that Smith failed to exhaust his administrative remedies on other grounds, we need not address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
