They were able to secure a Cambodian flag, and their venture seems to have been relatively successful, although the age of the ship resulted in numerous expensive repairs. In 2008, the ship\u2019s classification was withdrawn, and it was quarantined in port, unable to sail.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Around that same time, Chaban loaned Goldstein $1,150,000 for a separate business venture. Soon thereafter, both sides allegedly suffered serious financial hardships as a result of the downturn in the world\u2019s economy. On January 25, 2009, the parties agreed in writing (the \u201cJanuary 25 Agreement\u201d) that Goldstein would pay back the loan by March 9, 2009, with interest. Goldstein\u2019s 50% interest in the <em>Chalsi </em>was presented as collateral. If Goldstein did not pay by March 9, 2009, Chaban had the right to sell Goldstein\u2019s interest in the ship.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Goldstein did not repay the loan, and on March 4, 2009, he voluntarily transferred his 50% interest in the <em>Chalsi </em>to Chaban.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The parties never agreed on the value of the <em>Chalsi, </em>but they both recognized that the transfer of the ship did not satisfy the full loan amount. In April 2009, Goldstein made a payment of $400,000. He stated that he valued his share of the ship at $750,000, and thus he had completely repaid the loan amount of $1,150,000. Cha-ban disputed this, claiming that Goldstein\u2019s share of the ship was worth somewhere around $200,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-12\">Chaban brought suit, alleging that Gold-stein agreed to pay $1,150,000 but had paid only $400,000 to-date. Goldstein answered by claiming, <em>inter alia, </em>that he had already paid the outstanding balance by tendering his 50% interest in the <em>Chalsi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-13\">As the district court stated, the primary issue to be decided was: \u201cwhat was the value, in March 2009, of a 50% share of ... a specially-modified, Romanian-built, Cambodian-flagged, 1968 Volgo-Don dry-cargo freighter that usually carried scrap metal and coal on the Black Sea, but which at that time was undergoing extensive repairs?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-14\">The district court held a bench trial, where neither party presented solid evidence as to the value of the ship. Chaban claimed at varying times that Goldstein\u2019s share was worth $200,000, $250,000, $800,000, or $0. Madeline Kooy, a vessel broker who had never seen the <em>Chalsi </em>testified as a lay witness<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and stated that she had previously estimated that the value of Goldstein\u2019s share was between $175,000 and $200,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-15\">The district court issued an order listing its factual and legal conclusions. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>court gave no weight to Kooy\u2019s valuation of the ship, due to the limited scope of her testimony and limited knowledge of the ship itself. And given Chaban\u2019s varying personal valuations of the ship, the court stated that Chaban had completely failed to present any credible evidence as to the value of the <em>Chalsi. </em>Because there had been no evidence on this issue, the court concluded that Chaban had failed to prove that the value of the ship was not equal to $750,000, and thus Chaban had failed to prove any damages resulting from Gold-stein\u2019s breach of the January 25 Agreement, except for the interest on the loan\u2014 which Goldstein conceded had not been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Chaban moved for reconsideration, stating that the court had improperly shifted the burden. Chaban claimed that it was Goldstein\u2019s burden to prove the value of the ship because that issue went directly to Goldstein\u2019s defenses of payment and accord-and-satisfaction. Since the court found that there was no evidence as to the value of the <em>Chalsi, </em>Chaban claimed that Goldstein had failed to prove either defense, and thus Chaban was entitled to the full unpaid amount of $750,000, plus interest. The court denied this motion, stating that it had construed the parties\u2019 loan documents as contracts, and contract law required the plaintiff \u2014 Chaban\u2014to prove his damages, which he had failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Chaban maintains on appeal that the district court misunderstood the burdens in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">When reviewing the results of a bench trial, we consider the district court\u2019s factual conclusions under a clearly erroneous standard and its legal conclusions <em>de novo. Renteria-Marin v. Ag-Mart Produce, Inc., </em>537 F.3d 1321, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">The contract at issue here is a promissory note: an \u201cunconditional written promise, signed by the maker, to pay absolutely and in any event a certain sum of money either to, or to the order of, the bearer or a designated person.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1162 (9th ed.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">Although the ship was pledged as collateral, Goldstein surrendered it voluntarily as payment, and accordingly the district court analyzed the January 25 Agreement under standard contract law rather than as a UCC Article 9 deficiency action. Defenses like payment and accord-and-satisfaction can be alleged in any breach of contract dispute; they are not limited to secured transactions. <em>See Moore v. Jarvis Enters., Inc., </em>523 So.2d 1233, 1234 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1988) (\u201cAccord and satisfaction was properly found to be an avoidance to appellants\u2019 breach of contract count....\u201d). Thus, regardless of the terminology used to describe the January 25 Agreement, the point is that Chaban provided evidence showing that Goldstein owed $750,000, and Goldstein claimed that he had already paid the amount due by tendering his interest in the <em>Chalsi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">In other words, as he specifically stated in his answer to Chaban\u2019s complaint, Gold-stein was alleging the defense of payment. \u201cPayment is an affirmative defense, <em>the burden of proof of which rests upon the defendant.\u201d Touchberry v. Nemec, </em>264 So.2d 466, 467 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1972) (emphasis added). Florida has stated that \u201cthe burden of proving each element of an affirmative defense rests on the party that asserts the defense.\u201d <em>Custer Med. Ctr. v. United Auto. Ins. Co., </em>62 So.3d 1086, 1097 (Fla.2010); <em>see Click v. Dowd, </em>102 Fla. 336, 135 So. 840, 840 (1931) (\u201cThe rule is elementary that when the defendant in an action on a promissory note tenders a plea of payment the burden is on him to prove his plea by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(c)(1) (noting that payment is an affirmative defense); Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.110(d) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">The district court concluded that the value of the ship went both to Goldstein\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>affirmative defense of payment <em>and </em>to Chaban\u2019s claim for damages, and thus the burden fell on Chaban to prove a value for the ship because this value would determine the damages that Chaban was entitled to receive from Goldstein for the breaeh-of-contraet claim. Because there was no solid evidence as to the value of the ship, the district court concluded that Cha-ban was entitled to no damages, except for interest on the loan, which both parties agreed was owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">We disagree with the district court\u2019s conclusion for two reasons. First, whenever a defendant asserts payment as an affirmative defense, the amount that the plaintiff is ultimately entitled to recover will always depend on whether (and to what extent) the defendant can establish the defense of payment. Even though Chaban\u2019s recoverable amount depended on the value of the <em>Chalsi, </em>this does not mean that Chaban had the burden of proving said value. The value was relevant because it determined the amount of Goldstein\u2019s payment; in other words it determined the extent to which Goldstein\u2019s defense of payment would succeed. The burden of proving this defense remains on the defendant. The plaintiff does not have to prove lack of payment. <em>Jacobs v. Becks, </em>355 So.2d 1241, 1243 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1978) (\u201cThere is no requirement that the Plaintiff present evidence as part of her case in chief that the notes remain unpaid _\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Second, Florida courts have made it clear that a plaintiff satisfies his prima facie case merely by presenting the valid promise to pay. \u201cThe promissory note is itself evidence of the existence of the debt and its introduction into evidence is sufficient to establish a prima facie case. When it is regularly admitted into evidence no additional evidence of the present existence of the debt is necessary upon the case of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Knauer v. Levy, </em>115 So.2d 776, 777 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1959); <em>see also Crum v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., </em>468 So.2d 1004, 1006 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1985); <em>Touchberry, </em>264 So.2d at 467. Accordingly, under Florida law, Chaban met his prima facie burden simply by presenting the valid promissory note for $1,150,000 and claiming that $750,000 remained unpaid. It was then Goldstein\u2019s burden to prove the defense that he had actually paid the $750,000 when he tendered his interest in the <em>Chalsi </em>(i.e., by providing evidence to show that his interest in the ship was worth $750,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">This issue was an affirmative defense under both Florida and Federal law, and it was treated as an affirmative defense by the parties in their pleadings. No amount of recharacterization of the transaction between the parties would change the conclusion that the burden of showing payment always rested with the defendant Gold-stein. In other words, \u201cit would appear that the trial court misconceived the applicable law and erroneously placed upon plaintiff-appellant the burden of proving non-payment of the note, rather than correctly placing upon defendant-appellee the burden of proving payment.\u201d <em>Touchberry, </em>264 So.2d at 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-12\">We cannot rely on any purported presumption that the fair market value of the ship was equal to the amount of debt that it secured. First, that rule was applied in the context of a \u201ccommercially unreasonable\u201d disposal of collateral by the lender\u2014 which does not apply in the case sub judi-ce. See <em>Weiner v. Am. Petrofina Mktg., Inc., </em>482 So.2d 1362, 1364-65 (Fla.1986). Second, the parties\u2019 own behavior shows that they never intended for the ship to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>serve as collateral for the entire $1,150,000 loan \u2014 which was the outstanding loan value when the ship was offered as collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Additionally, there is no way to characterize Goldstein\u2019s payments as an accord-and-satisfaction. Chaban immediately challenged Goldstein\u2019s claim that his $400,000 payment, in conjunction with the previous surrender of his interest in the <em>Chalsi, </em>meant that the entire $1,150,000 had been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Given the district court\u2019s misunderstanding of the burdens in this case, and given that Chaban himself seems to have admitted at trial that Goldstein was entitled to some amount of credit for surrendering his interest in the Chalsi<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we believe the best course is to remand for the district court to have an opportunity to reconsider its factual conclusions on this issue under the proper legal standards and then recalculate damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b69-7\">. We previously remanded the case for the district court to determine whether diversity jurisdiction exists in this case. The district court concluded that jurisdiction does exist. We agree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b69-8\">. Both men signed the January 25 Agreement.
