The conditions of probation required that Rasco \u201cshall answer truthfully all inquiries by the probation officer and follow the instructions of the probation officer\u201d and \u201cshall work regularly at a lawful occupation, unless excused by the probation officer for schooling, training, or other acceptable reasons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b985-19\">In No. 11-14699, Rasco appeals the District Court\u2019s judgment, arguing that the District Court erred in requiring her to work as a condition of probation and in delegating to the probation officer the ministerial authority to excuse her from that work for \u201cschooling, training, or other acceptable reasons.\u201d Such delegation, she contends, constituted an unlawful delega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>tion of a judicial function to a probation officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">Following the District Court\u2019s imposition of sentence, Rasco did not object to the sentence for the reasons she now presents as arguments for reversal. We therefore consider them under the plain error doctrine. Rasco points to no case which would have informed the District Court that the conditions of probation she now challenges could not lawfully be imposed. Rasco has therefore failed to establish plain error and thus a basis for reversing the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">In March 2012, the Probation Officer notified the District Court that Rasco had violated the conditions of her probation. On April 11, 2012, the court held a revocation hearing and concluded that Rasco</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj6\">violated the terms and conditions of probation by repeatedly failing to follow instructions of the probation officers, by failing to gain any gainful employment and by failing to work, by failing to take the responsibility on herself to have the mental health evaluation that the Court ordered in this case, and by failing to generally respect the order of this Court placing her on probation and the conditions of that order; and also, as a result of her continued insistence of innocence in this case, by generally failing in every respect to cooperate with the United States Probation Office ..., and maintaining a constant disrespectful attitude toward the whole process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">The court therefore revoked Rasco\u2019s probation and sentenced her to prison for three months. In No. 12-12285, she appeals the revocation and sentence she received.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We find no merit in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">Rasco presents three arguments for reversal: (1) the District Court erred in admitting an absent witness\u2019s hearsay statements made during the revocation hearing without conducting the confrontation balancing test required by <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>26 F.3d 110 (11th Cir.1994); (2) the court erred, and thus denied Rasco due process of law, in relying on facts conceded by her attorney at the revocation hearing regarding her involvement in the underlying health care fraud; and (3) the evidence was insufficient to revoke her probation. Rasco did not raise arguments (1) and (2) in the District Court; thus, we consider them for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-10\">Rasco\u2019s first point is based on testimony Probation Officer Brownstein gave at the revocation hearing. Officer Weber supervised Rasco, but did not attend the hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Brownstein, Weber\u2019s supervisor, informed the court, over Rasco\u2019s hearsay objection, what Weber had told him about her supervision of Rasco. Brown-stein, as part of his supervision of Weber, discussed Rasco\u2019 behavior with Weber on numerous occasions. Those discussions focused on Weber\u2019s difficulties in getting Rasco to comply with the conditions of her probation. Brownstein\u2019s testimony was consistent with the Probation Office\u2019s initial report to the court. Rasco has never contended that the hearsay statements were false or unreliable; we therefore conclude that the court\u2019s <em>Frazier </em>error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-11\">Rasco\u2019s second point is meritless. Rasco cites no case that would have informed the court that it could not rely on counsel\u2019s representations. Rasco\u2019s third point also lacks merit. The evidence established that, from the start of her supervision, Rasco repeatedly refused to follow the instructions of her probation officer\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>she refused to obtain a mental health evaluation, made little or no effort to find a job, declined to give account of her finances, and otherwise failed to live up to the obligations the conditions of probation imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">The judgments in Appeals Nos. 11-14699 and 12-12285 are</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b985-12\">. The charge was that Rasco knowingly violated the terms of assignment in connection with a medical clinic, United Medical, by filing documents with Medicare on behalf of United Medical in which she fraudulently identified herself as the sole owner of the firm, whereas her husband was the true owner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b986-8\">. Rasco was admitted to bail pending the resolution of these consolidated appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b986-12\">. Weber had been in an auto accident and was unable to attend the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
