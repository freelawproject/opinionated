Salazar asks us to reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendant-Appellant Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., and to remand this matter for a jury trial. For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-18\">From June 2007 until his termination in August 2009, Salazar worked in Sears\u2019 San Antonio call center. He had what can charitably be described as a rocky employment experience. After exhibiting inappropriate workplace behavior on a number of occasions, Salazar \u2014 a homosexual man \u2014 gave a sexually explicit letter to a male co-worker. After an investigation, supervisors fired Salazar for violating Sears\u2019 written sexual harassment policy. Several months later, Salazar filed sex discrimination charges against Sears with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. After receiving a \u201cright to sue\u201d letter from the EEOC, Salazar brought suit against Sears in district court, alleging Title VII violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-23\">The matter was referred to the magistrate judge, who wrote a thorough report and recommendation that the district court grant summary judgment in Sears\u2019 favor. In sum, the magistrate judge concluded that Salazar had presented no evidence showing that he \u201cwas replaced by someone outside his protected class or was treated less favorably than similarly situated individuals outside his protected class,\u201d and had thus failed to make out a <em>prima\u25a0 facie </em>sex discrimination claim. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). She further concluded that even if Salazar had made out a <em>prima facie </em>case, he could not obtain relief because he had failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to Sears\u2019 legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating him \u2014 his violation of Sears\u2019 sexual harassment policy. <em>See Rachid, v. Jack In The Box, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 305, 312 (5th Cir.2004). The district court adopted the report and recommendation, and granted Sears\u2019 summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-24\">On appeal, Salazar raises a host of inap-posite, incomprehensible, and erroneous arguments, many of which are squarely addressed in the report and recommendation. In particular, he incorrectly argues that because his behavior did not constitute sexual harassment under Title VII, Sears was not permitted to fire him pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>ant to its own sexual harassment policy. <em>See Nix v. WLCY Radio/Rahall Commc\u2019ns, </em>738 F.2d 1181, 1187 (11th Cir.1984) (\u201cTitle VII does not take away an employer\u2019s right to interpret its rules as it chooses.\u201d). Because Salazar has not remotely impugned any of the magistrate judge\u2019s conclusions (which were adopted by the district court), we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b531-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
