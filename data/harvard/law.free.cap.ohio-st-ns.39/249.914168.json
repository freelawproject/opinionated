T. McCullough andJ. II. </em>Barnhill, for plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-6\">It appears by the record that all of the parties to the action, Smith &amp; Curtis, the plaintiffs, of the city of Cleveland; Gr. C. Hoover &amp; Co., the defendants, of Dennison, Tuscarawas county, who still held property there, although Gr. C. Hoover, of said firm, had removed to Columbus, and W. A. Bovey <em>&amp;\u25a0 </em>Co., the garnishee and successor of Gr. C. Hoover &amp; Co., at Dennison, Ohio, were partnerships formed for, and doing business, or holding property in the state of Ohio, in their respective partnership names, and capable of suing and being sued in such firm names, according to.section 5011, Rev. Stats. Ohio.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-7\">' A partnership formed for, and doing business or holding property in the state of Ohio in its firm name, is in law a <em>person, </em>and can be sued in such firm name in attachment the same as a natural person, or a corporation, under said section 5011, as in force when this action was begun. Rev. Stats. Ohio, \u00a7 5011; <em>Whitman </em>v. Keith, 18 Ohio St. 144; <em>Champion Machine Co. </em>v. Huston, 24 Ohio St. 503.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-8\">The affidavit is sufficient in law to support the attachment and proceedings in garnishment, against the property of a defendant <em>non-resident </em>of the county, whether a natural person, a corporation having no officer, or a partnership, as in this case, having no place of business within the county where process of a justice of the peace can be served as is directed by law. Rev. Stats. \u00a7 6489; <em>Whitman </em>v. Keith, 18 Ohio St. 144; <em>Champian Machine Co. </em>v. <em>Huston, </em>24 Ohio St. 503; <em>Cresser </em>v. Young, 31 Ohio St. 57.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-9\">In all cases against any class of defendants in attachment, where the processes cannot be served at the place or in the manner prescribed by the law; but where property is seized or a garnishee duly served with notice, the justice has acquired jurisdiction of the property, and it cannot be ousted by any adverse answer or denial of the garnishee, and shall continue the case for publication to non-resident defendants. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Rev.

Nor is the plaintiff in any manner concluded by such answer, if the same were made; but'in this case the answer is affirmative. Rev. Stats. Ohio, \u00a7 6504; <em>Nat. Bk. N. London </em>v. <em>L.

Stats., against firms nonresidents of the state of Ohio, while this action is under section. 6489 Rev.

W. Yeagley </em>and <em>Douthitt aud Healea, </em>for plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-9\">I. The record shows that suits were brought against G-. O. Hoover <em>&amp; </em>Co. in attachment, as non-residents, in their firm name. At common law no action could be maintained against any company, not incorporated, without disclosing the names of the several partners composing such firm. 1 Ohitty\u2019s Plead. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>256 (12 Am. ed.) and cases cited, in notes (i) and (1). In Ohio such action can only be maintained by favor of the statute passed February 27,1846. S. <em>&amp; </em>O. Stat. 1138, \u00a7 1. The process against such company or firm shall be served by copy left at their usual place of doing business within the county. S. <em>&amp; </em>O. 1139-, \u00a7 11. , That statute only applies to companies and associations formed for the purpose of carrying on any trade or business, or for the purpose of holding any species of property, in Ohio. Actions by and against all other companies and associations, not incorporated, must be maintained, as at common law, by disclosing the names of the several partners composing such firm. <em>Haskins </em>v. <em>Alcott c&amp; </em>Horton, 13 Ohio St. 210.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-7\">II. Where a statute, upon certain conditions, confers a right or gives a remedy, unknown to the common law, the party asserting the right or availing himself of the remedy, must bring himself, or his case, clearly within the statute. <em>Haskins </em>v. Alcott, 13 Ohio St. R. 216. We think the plaintiffs in error have failed rto do this. It does not appear that summons was left at the usual place of doing business of said firm within the county. On the other hand, it appears from the affidavits in attachment and the return of the constable, that Gr. O. Hoover &amp; Co. had no place of business in the county, and the plaintiffs in error proceeded against said partnership in its firm name, as non-resident, and caused orders of attachment to issue upon the ground of such non-residence. It does not even appear \u2022 in the bills of particulars and affidavits in the action that Gr. C. Hoover <em>&amp; </em>Co. were a company or association formed for the purpose of doing business in Ohio, or that they, had any place of business in Ohio. We think if the record does not show these facts giving jurisdiction, affirmatively, the district court did not err in reversing the judgments of the court of common pleas and justice of the peace. <em>Haskins </em>v. Alcott, 13 Ohio St. 210-215.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-11\">III. The justice must acquire jurisdiction by virtue of the act of February 27, 1846, or he does not acquire it at all. All attachment cannot be issued against a non-resident firm. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>code allows attachments against individuals who are nonresidents, but not against firms as such. <em>Dobell </em>v. <em>Loker, </em>1 Handy, 574; <em>Drownson </em>v. <em>Metcalf, </em>1 Handy, 188 ; <em>Haskins </em>v. <em>Alcott, </em>13 Ohio St. 210.' But it is claimed that if a domestic corporation may be proceeded against by attachment, as non-resident of the county <em>(Champion Machine Co. </em>v. <em>Huston, </em>24 Ohio St. 503), it follows that a domestic partnership may be proceeded against in the same manner. It certainly does not follow at all. A corporation may sue or be sued, but no action lies against its stockholders in the first instance. In a partnership the copartners may be sued in the first instance. If a partnership, like a corporation, can be proceeded against as a non-resident, then, does it not follow, that if the partners composing the firm of (I. O. Hoover &amp; Co. should all reside in Tuscarawas county, but that the firm had its place of business in Franklin county, that an attachment may issue against the partnership property in Franklin county, in the names of the individual partners, upon the ground of the non-residence of the members of such firm in Franklin county; and at the same time, another attachment issue against the property of the firm, in the firm name, in Tuscarawas county, notwithstanding all the partners reside there, because of the partnership (the ideal person) being non-resident of Tuscarawas county ? If such a theory is correct, it must follow that the property of a partnership may be attached, by reason of non-residence, in the very county where all the partners reside, should its place of business happen to be in another county; and its property could be attached in the county in which it did business by reason of the non-residence of the partners composing the firm. This state of facts cannot occur in the ease of a corporation, as no suit in attachment can be maintained by reason of the non-residence of the stockholders. The legislature, in passing the act of February 27,1846, certainly did not intend to license any such wholesale attachment of partnership property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-5\">IV. Ve have examined the authorities cited by counsel for plaintiffs in error, but are unable to discover their application to the questions r.aised in these cases. There is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>no appearance as to the merits of plaintiff\u2019s claim in these actions.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b274-4\">MoIlvaine, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANl\">At common law a partnership could sue and be sued only in the name of the members of the firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">By the act of February 27, 1816 (11 Ohio L. 66), however, it was provided that unincorporated companies formed for the purpose of carrying- on any trade or business, or for the purpose of holding any species of property within the state of Ohio, might sue or be sued in any of the courts of this state by the usual or ordinary name of the company, without setting forth in the process or pleadings the names of the members of such company. Undoubtedly, the original action was intended to be prosecuted under favor of this statute, and the only question before us is, Did the justice of the peace acquire jurisdiction of the defendant company ? The second section of the act provides \u201c That process against any such company or firm, under the provisions of this act, shall be served by a copy left at their usual place of doing business within the county.\u201d It is conceded that jurisdiction was not so obtained : but it is claimed that personal, jurisdiction was acquired by constructive service under section 35 of the Justices\u2019 act of March 11, 1853 (S. &amp; C. 777), which provides for service by publication when property of the defendant has been taken under an order of attachment, and it shall appear that the summons issued in the action has not been and cannot be served on the defendant in the county in the manner prescribed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">A majority of the court are of opinion that this mode of service by publication does not apply in cases which can be prosecuted only under favor of the act of 1816, which specifically prescribes the mode of acquiring jurisdiction of the defendant company, namely, by service of process at the usual place of doing business within the county, to wit: the county in which the process was issued. The statute is special and independent. It gives a new remedy, and prescribes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>mode and manner of enforcing it. Being complete in itself, we think the mode prescribed for acquiring jurisdiction of the defendant, in invitum, is exclusive. This conclusion, it appears to me, is inevitable from the clear intention of the legislature that actions against companies in the firm name should be prosecuted only in the county in which its usual place of business may be situated, without regard to the residence of the members of the firm. The claim, however, of plaintiffs in error makes the non-residence of the members a test of jurisdiction in any county where property of the company may be seized in attachment, without regard to the usual place of business of the company. <em>We </em>think the act of 1846 is inconsistent with such claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Again, it is claimed by plaintiffs in error that defendants in error voluntarily appeared in the action before the justice by filing their motions to dismiss the action, &amp;c. (See statement of case.)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">It is not claimed that a voluntary appearance was intended by the defendants; but the claim is, that the filing of said motions was, in law, an appearance to the merits of the cause, and, consequently, a waiver of any objections to the mode or manner by which jurisdiction over the person of defendants was acquired.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The appearance of a defendant in court for the sole purpose of objecting, by motion, to the mode or manner in which it is claimed that jurisdiction over his person has been acquir* ed, is not an appearance in the cause, or a waiver of any defect in the manner of acquiring such jurisdiction; while, on the other hand, the appearance for the purpose of contesting the merits of the cause, whether by motion or formal pleading, is a waiver of all objections to the jurisdiction of the court over the person of defendant, whether the defendant intended such waiver or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">In respect to this question, an important distinction is made between an objection to the jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the suit, and of the person of defendant, although complete jurisdiction in the court to hear and determine the action is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>not acquired unless the court lias jurisdiction over both the subject-matter and the person. An objection to jurisdiction over the subject-matter is a waiver of objection to the jurisdiction of the person, while an objection to the jurisdiction of the person is a waiver of nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The motions of defendants, which are relied on as an appearance in the original action, when considered in the light of the circumstances disclosed in the record, were objections to the jurisdiction of the court over the persons of defendants, and nothing more. Hence, objections to the manner of acquiring such jurisdiction were not waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">A question somewhat similar to the present arose in <em>Handy </em>v. <em>Insurance </em>Company, 37 Ohio St. 360, in which the filing of a motion by defendant to dismiss the action was held to be a voluntary appearance in. the action. The ground of the motion in that case, however, went to the jurisdiction of the court over the subject-matter of the action, and not to the jurisdiction of the person of defendant. While the motion in that case as well as in this was to dismiss the action, that was for want of jurisdiction over the subject of the suit, this over the person of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b276-8\">Upson and Doyle, JJ., dissent from the first and second propositions of the syllabus.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
