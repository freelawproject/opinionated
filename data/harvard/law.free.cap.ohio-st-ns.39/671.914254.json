In a suit for the price of a lot of iron manufactured by the plaintiff for the defendant, the defendant, in case there is a breach of warranty as to the quality of the iron, may <em>recoup </em>for such damages as he has sustained, although he has used the iron without offering to return it.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b690-6\">Error to the District Court of Hamilton county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b690-7\">Frederika W. Hooglund and Carl Andres Lindroth, doing business as N M. Hooglund, manufacturers and shippers of iron at Stockholm, Sweden, brought suit September 29, 1874, in the Superior Court of Cincinnati, against Lewis M. Dayton, of Cincinnati, engaged in the business of manufacturing nuts and bolts in that city, under the name of American Bolt and Nut Works. The action was to recover the price of twenty tons of Swedish iron, \u201cII. F. S.,\u201d of specified sizes, sold by the plaintiffs (through Nils Mitander, their agent, of the city of New York) to the defendant. The contract was made solely by.letters between Mitander, as such agent, and Dayton.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b690-8\">The answer to the petition sets forth, among other things, by way of counterclaim, that the iron was ordered of the plaintiffs for use by defendant in his business ; that it was sold to him by sample; that the iron furnished was greatly inferior to the sample; that there was much delay in the delivery of the iron ; and that by reason of such inferior quality and such delay, the defendant has been damaged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b690-9\">In reply the plaintiffs admit \u201c that said contract was in the form of an order, made by the defendant, and accepted by the plaintiffs, for said quantity of certain description of plaintiffs\u2019 manufacture; \u201d but they deny the allegations of the answer above mentioned, and say that they \u201c proceeded to prepare and did furnish said iron as soon after accepting said order as was practicable;\u201d and the allegations of the answer, above mentioned, were denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b690-10\">The cause was tried to a jury in February and March, 1878, and a verdict was rendered for the plaintiffs, on which judgment was rendered against Dayton for $2,553.78. The district court affirmed the judgment, and this petition in error is prosecuted by Dayton for the reversal of both judgments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Probably all the evidence offered on the trial is set forth, substantially in the record; but as the bill of exceptions does not purport to contain all the evidence, the question whether the verdict is opposed to its weight, is not for consideration in this proceeding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b691-5\">The fair inference from the testimony is that Dayton knew, from the beginning of the correspondence, that Mitander was agent of the plaintiffs, and clothed with authority to do whatever he undertook to do in the transaction ; and that Mitander knew, and it must be assumed the plaintiffs knew, that Dayton was engaged in business in Cincinnati, and wanted the iron, not for the purpose of selling it in the form received, but for the purpose of manufacturing it into bolts and nuts for sale to his customers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b691-6\">On February 8, 1873, Dayton wrote to Mitander, ordering ten tons of iron (specifying size) of the kind mentioned in Mitander\u2019s circular, which Dayton had received.

It bears no comparison to the first (Steever and Potts) lot. The bolts came back that we made from it. This iron wouldn\u2019t answer. Wouldn\u2019t stand bending when cold, and when made into bolts would break. It was too brittle \u2014 too hard. Besides, there was great diversity in sizes. From this cause there was great loss and inconvenience in making the bolts.\u201d Simpson testified: \u201cNodifference between Swedish and Norway iron. I have always looked upon them as the same. . . . 'These specimens (from the iron in question) are of very poor quality. They look as if the fibres were gone. . . . This iron is worth nothing for Norway bolts. It might make common bolts if it would head.\u201d There was other testimony to the same effect. Defendant testified: \u201c Something over ten tons of the iron remains. I saw the specimens tested. The iron is not good. It is not suitable for making Norway bolts........A large portion of the bolts made from it came back. The sizes are irregular, and a great deal is lost in making it up. This iron is deficient. It would not bend. It had not tensile strength, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>and the sizes were irregular. This twenty ton lot is suitable for making bolts of ordinary strength only \u2014 for common carriage bolts \u2014 such as are made from ordinary American iron. It might be used to make street railroad spikes. Am familiar with the prices of iron in New York.

S. 437.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> Authority, without restriction, to such an agent to sell such property, to be manufactured for such a purchaser, carries with it authority to warrant that it shall be equal, when manufactured, to a sample produced by the agent when he made the sale. <em>Schuchart </em>v. <em>Allens, </em>1 Wall, U. S. 359; Ewell\u2019s Evans on Agency, 158 ; cf. Benjamin on Sales, \u00a7 945. The rule stated in <em>Herring </em>v. <em>Skaggs, </em>62 Ala. 180, even if \u2022sound, is inapplicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number><bracketnum>3.</bracketnum> The agreement under consideration was, in effect, this: Plaintiffs, manufacturers of a superior quality of Swedish iron, known as H. E. S. brand, at Stockholm, knowing that defendant was engaged in manufacturing bolts and nuts at Cincinnati, and wanted iron superior to American iron, not for the purpose of re-selling it in the form received, but for the purpose of manufacturing the same into bolts and nuts, and then selling them to his customers for purposes requiring superior iron, informed the defendant that they had sold to Steever &amp; Potts, Philadelphia, a lot of H. E. S. brand, and advised him to buy of that lot \u201c a ton or so for sample, should you wish to test the quality with a view to import this year.\u201d The defendant having purchased of Steever &amp; Potts, three tons, part of the lot, and finding the quality to be excellent, informed the plaintiffs of the fact, and ordered of them twenty tons of that brand. The question is whether this was a warranty by the plaintiffs to the defendant that the twenty tons should be in quality substantially as good as the iron purchased from Steever <em>&amp; </em>Potts. We hold there was such warranty. True, it was not strictly a sale by sample, for the twenty tons had not been manufactured. It was more than a sale by sample. Something better than American iron was needed by defendant for use in his business. It could only be procured by importation, at a price in advance of American iron. He applied to the plaintiffs, manufacturers of the II. E. S. brand, who, knowing his wants, suggested that he buy, for the purpose of testing its quality, a ton out of a lot of that brand which they had sold to Steever &amp; Potts. The defendant was not engaged in buying iron to sell it without changing its form. The name of the brand, to him and his customers, was nothing; the quality of the iron everything. No case has been cited, nor have we found one, opposed to the view that here was a warranty, only to be satisfied by iron equal in <em>quality </em>with that which the defendant had purchased from Steever <em>&amp; </em>Potts. The Pennsylvania cases relied on by plaintiffs <em>(Boyd </em>v. Wilson, 83 Pa. St. 819, and cases there cited), though thought to be opposed to the current of authority (Benjamin on Sales, 4th Am. ed. by Corbin, \u00a7 369, note 26), are in no way in conflict with our view of this case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Moreover, if there had not been such warranty that the quality should equal the Steever &amp; Potts iron, the plaintiffs, knowing the object which the defendant had in view in obtaining iron from the manufacturers in Sweden, would have impliedly warranted that the iron furnished by them was suitable for the purpose for which it was obtained, and free from latent defects. <em>Rodgers </em>v. Niles, 11 Ohio St. 48; <em>Byers </em>v. <em>Chatpin., </em>28 Ohio St. 300; <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Newsom, </em>2 Q. B. D. 102; <em>Kellogg Bridge </em>v. <em>Hamilton </em>(S. C. U. S.) 18 Cen. L. Jour. 150 ; Benjamin on Sales (4th Am; ed. by Corbin), \u00a7 988, note 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\"><bracketnum>4.</bracketnum> The defendant retains the property, and does not now seek to disaffirm the contract, but to enforce it by claiming damages, by way of recoupment, for the non-performance of the contract with respect to quality (as to which see par. 3 above) and as to delay (as to which see <em>Ogle </em>v. <em>Vane, </em>L. R. 3 Q. B. 272; <em>Hickman </em>v. <em>Haynes, </em>L. R. 10 C. P. 598; <em>Tyers </em>v. <em>Rosedale Iron Co., </em>L. R. 10 Ex. 195; cf. <em>Plevins </em>v. <em>Downing, </em>1 C. P. D. 220). In view of the nature of the warranty, the defendant may use the iron in his business, and in this action for the price, <em>recoup </em>to the extent he has been injured by a breach of the plaintiffs\u2019 warranty. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Eno, </em>14 N. Y. 597; <em>Day </em>v. <em>Pool, </em>52 N. Y. 416; <em>Gurney </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>58 N. Y. 358; Pomeroy\u2019s Rem. (2d ed.) \u00a7779. And see <em>Timmons </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>4 Ohio St. 680. <em>Dounce </em>v. <em>Dow, </em>64 N. Y. 411, cited by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, is not in conflict with these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">In view of the warranty, the evidence as to the quality of the iron, and the evidence as to delay, there was error in rejecting evidence as to the value of the iron, with a view to recoupment. Whether there was such defect, and if so, what damage resulted from it, and whether there was injury from delay, and if so whether it had been waived, are questions for the jury. Besides, parts of the elaborate charge of the judge of the superior court who presided at the trial, are in conflict with the construction we place on the contract; and this also calls for a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
