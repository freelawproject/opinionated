The farm was sold and a fund of about $5,000 realized therefrom, which was loaned out by the trustees, the interest being sufficient for the purposes of the trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-5\">In 1875, C. A. Evans, one of the defendants in error, borrowed $370 of this money from the trustees and executed his note therefor. While the note was liekl by the trustees, Evans proposed to exchange therefor a note which lie owned, of which the following is a copy:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-6\">\u201c $500.00. Detphos, O., March 1, 1875.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-7\">\u201c On or before June 1st, A. d. 1876, we, or either of us promise to pay to Dr. O. A. Evans, Esq., five hundred dollars, for value received, with 8 per cent, interest until due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-8\">.Indorsed, \u201c O.

Scott.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-10\">The trustees had no formal meeting to consider the transfer or exchange of notes, but each trustee assented to it and authorized the clerk to make the exchange. The old note was delivered up to Evans' and this one, indorsed by Evans, taken in its stead. . There was no record of this transaction upon the township books, beyond the mere entry of the note by the clerk in the list of notes belonging to this fund.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-11\">The action was by the trustees against Scott and Jettinger as makers, and' Evans as indorser, upon the note last mentioned. The answer of Scott and Jettinger admitted the execution of the note, but denied the ownership of plaintiffs. The proof established the facts above recited. No claim was made that the note was paid, or that there was any defense against it in the hands of Evans.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-12\">The action was tried to the court without a jury, and judgment rendered in favor of the defendants. Upon error the district court reversed that judgment, and this proceeding is prosecuted by Scott and Jettinger to procure a reversal of that judgment of reversal. Evans refusing, to join as plaintiff is made defendant in error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number><em>Mead d\u00a1 </em>Townsend, for plaintiffs in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-5\">1.

The devise in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>will of Beilis, was not to the township, nor to any of the uses named in said act. It was a devise to the trustees for the exclusive use of the poor of the township, creating a charitable trust to be administered by said trustees. The statute authorizing said devise, if it needed the authority of statute, has been in force in substantially the same form, since 1789. See S. &amp; C. 926, \u00a7 l\u00e9; R. S. \u00a7 20; <em>Urm,ey'\u2019s Executors </em>v. <em>Wooden, </em>1 Ohio St. 165. The testator had the power to devise the property to the poor of the township, in which case the statute provided the trustees, or to make such devise to trustees for the benefit of such poor. In either case granting such discretion and power, in the management of the trust, to whoever the trustees might be, as he saw fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">By the will of Beilis, the trustees are given full power to manage the trust fund, \u201cas they think best for the ben fit of said poor.\u201d They may invest it upon real estate security, or in notes or bonds without such security, being resposible for good faith and prudent management.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> Having the power to purchase the note and maintain an action upon it, the rules of evidence, under the issue presented, are the same as in other cases on a like cause of action. The proof was that the trustees bought the note, which was in their possession regularly indorsed by the payee, and that it belonged to, the trust fund. The payee was a ]3arty to the action and admitted the title of the plaintiffs therein. It was not essential to their right to recover that there should be a record, in the township books, of the transaction. It would be a prudent course for the trustees, and indeed their duty, to keep accurate accounts of all their dealings with this fund, but their failure to enter the same in the township records does not furnish the defense sought to be made here, even a technical support.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
