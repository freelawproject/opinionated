That he also left a large amount of personal property, which, when his estate was settled, was turned over to the defendant herein, in four notes, aggregating $7,323.77, which, or the proceeds of the same are still in her possession or under her control.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-18\">\u201c That after her father\u2019s death she remained for most of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>the time at her homestead with her mother, the defendant herein, until her marriage in 1871, and received during that time simply her food and clothing from her father\u2019s estate, which was received through her mother.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-5\"><em>\u201c </em>That since her marriage she has requested and demanded of her mother her share of her father\u2019s estate, or an adequate provision for her, in accordance with her condition and the extent of said estate; but that the same has always been refused, except one offer made her by her said mother of $100 for a release of all her interest of every kind in her father\u2019s estate, which offer she refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-6\"><em>\u201c </em>Wherefore plaintiff prays the court that the defendant may be compelled to render an account of the personal property, and rents and profits received by her from P.

N. Taylor died on the twenty-sixth day of November 1873, and \u201c that by the terms of said will, said Taylor intended and did convey all of his property both real and personal, to his wife, the defendant herein, coupled with a trust to provide for the plaintiff herein, his adopted daughter ; that by said trust the plaintiff became and is entitled to be provided for out of the estate of said P.

Taylor, with a reasonable and adequate support for her life, proportioned to the estate left by said Taylor and the condition and circumstances in life of the plaintiff\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-6\">Upon this finding the court rendered judgment \u201cthat said plaintiff recover from said defendant such sum as is equivalent to the reasonable and adequate support from the death of said P.

N. Taylor does not arise from any doubt as to the principles of construction, but from the indefiniteness of the few words in which he endeavored\u2019to express his meaning, so far as it relates to his adopted daughter. The words \u00a3( provide for,\u201d are capable of a very broad, or a very narrow, signification. They may be understood to include the furnishing of food, clothing, a dwelling house, household furniture, fuel, lights, and all. that may be needed to enable a person to live comfortably ; or they may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>be interpreted to mean only the supply of necessary food and clothing, or the giving of a suitable marriage portion.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">In reference to the time during which the provision shall be continued, the meaning of those words is equally doubtful; they may require that it should continue while the adopted child remains at the home of the widow, during her minority until her marriage, or during her life.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">In the case of <em>Abraham </em>v. <em>Alman, </em>1 Russ. 509, 46 English Chancery Rep. 453, the will under consideration contained the same words in the following clause: \u201c Also to provide for the two daughters of my child Hannah Embden, namely Sarah Embden and Esther Embden,\u201d and in giving the opinion of the court upon the effect of this clause, the master of the rolls said: \u201c The testator had no doubt intended tq make a provision for the Embdens, but his purpose seems to have been to do so by a distinct provision, and not by attaching a charge upon what was given beneficially to others. What this provision was to be, or in what manner, or out of what fund to be made, the court has no means of determining. . Was the payment to be made by a payment to the children of Hannah Embden during their respective lives, or by the payment of a sum in gross ? How was the amount of it to be calculated ? It appears to me impossible to give any certain construction to the clause on which the plaintiffs found their claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">The court thereupon held that clause of the will to be void for uncertainty. We are not disposed to go so far as that in this case. The language of the clause written in 1863 is plain, and taken alone would give to the widow all,of the property, real and personal, for her own benefit, but it is clear that by the clause added by the t\u00e9stator, November 25 1873, the day before he died, he intended to place his widow under obligation to make some provision for their adopted daughter ; and effect should be given to that intention so far as it can be as ascertained. For this purpose we must first determine- the nature and extent of the provision intended, and in regard to that we are satisfied that the testator-intended to -trust mainly to the discretion of his wife, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>with that discretion, fairly exercised, a court 'of equity would not interfere. It is conceded by Mrs. Taylor that while Mrs, Elder remained at the home of the former, as a member of her family, it was her duty to support her; which duty is admitted to have been performed, but' 'it is claimed by Mrs. Elder that the obligation to support her during life, was imposed upon Mrs. Taylor by her election to take under the will, and that the whole of the property devised and bequeathed, was taken by her subject to that trust. These claims were sustained by the judgment of the superior court, which found that by the terms of the will Taylor \u201c intended to, and did, convey all of his property, real and personal,\u201d to his wife with a trust, by which his adopted daughter became, and w\u2019as, entitled to be provided for, out of the estate, with a reasonable and adequate support for her life, proportioned to the estate left by Taylor, and her condition and circumstances in life; and rendered judgment in accordance with that finding. We cannot concur in that construction of the will, which holds the whole property in trust to secure the support for life of the adopted daughter, and makes the-rights and interests of the widow subordinate. We do not think the language of .the will, or the surrounding circumstances, show that to have been the intention of the testator.' We think it is clear that his principal purpose was to give his \u00a1property to his wife, for her own benefit, but with the obligation to provide, to a reasonable extent, for the adopted daughter. This obligation was fully discharged by the support provided from the death of the testator to the marriage of Mrs. Elder, when it was no longer needed. Cases have been cited, on one side to sustain the position that maintenance for life was intended, and, on the other, that the intended provision was limited to support while the beneficiary should remain a member of the widow\u2019s family; but it has been well stated that \u201c no definite rule can be laid down ; each case must stand upon its own circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The principles which we consider applicable to this case however, so far as they re\u00edale to the extent of the required provision, are stated in the case of <em>Carr </em>v. Living, 28 Beavan, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>644, where the testator devised and bequeathed his real and personal property to trustees in trust to pay the interest to the testator\u2019s wife, for life, for the separate use of his wife, and their children, to be applied for the maintenance and support of herself, and the maintenance, education, clothing and support of the children. Upon the hearing of the case the master of the rolls, Sir J oh\u00bb Romilly, said: \u201c The principle on which I have always acted, and which is consistent with all the authorities, is this, that although the parent in these cases is a trustee for the children, it is only so far as is required for their maintenance and support. Thus if the daughters had married and were supported by their husbands, they could not come and complain that no allowance was made to them,\u201d and the court held that \u201c when the children are otherwise provided for, and do not require support or maintenance, they are not entitled to complain that they do not receive a portion of the fund which is not required for their maintenance, education and support.\u201d The principles applicable to the construction of the will now under consideration are also illustrated by the case of <em>Paisley's </em>Appeal, <em>70 </em>Pa. St. 153. The testator gave to his wdfe the rents and profits of all his property, during her life, for her support, and the support and education of his children, under the direction of his executors, and the court held that this did not create a trust for the children, either in the widow or executors, nor give the orphans\u2019 court, jurisdiction to call them to account, or to decree in favor of the children for the future administration of the estate; that the children had no present interest in any particular shares, and that the testator\u2019s main object was to benefit the widow. In regard to the judgment of the court below the court say, \u201csuch a distribution as that decreed might .be most unjust and inequitable. It might leave the widow with all the cares and responsibilities of the household upon her, without an adequate support for herself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Similar considerations are entitled to great weight in determining the meaning of the words \u201cprovide for\u201d in the will of P. N. Taylor, and upon the whole we are satisfied that the facts stated in the petition of Mrs. Elder are not sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>constitute a cause of action, and that the superior court erred in overruling the demurrer to the petition, as well as in the final judgment against Mrs. Taylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\"><em>We </em>do not decide that circumstances may not occur hereafter which would give Mrs. Elder a right to further provision, nor do we decide what mode of enforcing such provision might be adopted, but that she has no right to any share of the property, nor at this time to other relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\"><em>Judgment reversed, demurrer to petition </em>sustained, <em>and cause remanded.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
