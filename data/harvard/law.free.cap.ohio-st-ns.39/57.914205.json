The petition contains the following allegations: \u201cThat on the 7th day of November, 1878, said Finney, in payment thereof, gave his promissory note, payable to the order of plaintiff, one day after date, for $334.50, with interest at eight per cent, per annum. That said note was not paid at maturity, and on the 18th day of November, 1878, plaintiff obtained a judgment, by confession, on said note, in this court, for said $334.50 and interest from said November 7th, 1878.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-9\">The demurrer of Crooks was sustained and the petition was dismissed, which judgment was reversed in the district court, and the cause remanded for a new trial. On such new trial judgment was rendered in favor of the company for the amount of the lien, and error is prosecuted in this court by Crooks.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b75-10\"><em>R.

The allegation amounts to no more than that the note was given to evidence the time and amount. Hoyt on Mec. Liens, 19; <em>Miller </em>v. Moore, 1 E. D. Smith, 739; <em>Tease </em>v. Christie, 2 E.

Stats. \u00a7\u00a7 4948, 5096); but the petition and answer are required to be in <em>\u201c </em>ordinary and concise language \u201d (Rev. Stats. \u00a7\u00a7 5060, 5070), and no construction can be permitted which will be, in effect, a perversion of their language. Indeed, in some cases the language must be strictly construed. Rev. Stats. \u00a7 4948; <em>Mech. etc. Association </em>v. O'Connor, 29 Ohio St. 651. By this petition, its language being fairly construed, it is admitted that the promissory note was given and received in payment of the company\u2019s claim ; and hence the subsequent steps in endeavoring to perfect and enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien, based on such claim, were wholly ineffectual. <em>Judgment reversed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
