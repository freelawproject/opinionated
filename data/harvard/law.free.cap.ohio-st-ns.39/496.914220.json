It was proved that he made application for a marriage license, in Logan county, on December 2, 1882, and testified as to the ages of the parties to the contemplated marriage, and residence of the female, and the alleged perjury was in the testimony so given. The oath was administered by L. E. Pettit, to whom the application was made. In 1878, R. E. Pettit was elected and duly qualified as probate judge of Logan county. He was re-elected in 1881, and on February 6,1882, entered on his second term, after being duly qualified, and he continues to be such jrjj^e. Evidence was given on the trial tending to show ^ait on December 8, 1879, R. E. Pettit duly appointee, deputy clerk of the probate court, L. E. Pettit, who, being duly qualified, entered on the duties of the appointment, and he has acted as such deputy continuously ever since that time, under the original appointment, and that he was not re-ap-. pointed when .R. E. Pettit entered upon his second term of office, nor since. Staight asked the court to charge the jury, that if they should find the facts to be as above stated, he could not be convicted, but the court refused so to charge, and he excepted. The jury having returned'a verdict of guilty, he was sentenced to the penitentiary, and the sole question on this petition in error is whether the court erred in refusing so to charge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>The Revised Statutes provide as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-5\">\u201c \u00a7 533.

E. Pettit was, at the time he administered the oath in question, acting as deputy clerk of the probate court, and had acted in that capacity about three years, with the assent of the probate judge and the acquiescence of the public, was <em>prima facie </em>sufficient to show that the oath was lawfully administered. <em>R. </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>38 L. T. (N. S.) 690 ; <em>s. c., </em>14 Cox C. C. 101; <em>Keator </em>v. <em>People, </em>32 Mich. 487. The general rule is that as to third persons and the public, the acts of one thus performing service are in all respects as valid as acts done by an officer <em>de jure. Strang, ex parte, </em>21 Ohio St. 610; Cf. <em>Bernier </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>37 Ohio St. 72; <em>Munford </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>6 Munf. 81. But in prosecutions like this the rule is different. Notwithstanding the <em>prima facie </em>proof offered by the state, the accused had the right to show that L. E. Pettit was not ah office]- <em>de jure, </em>and so defeat the prosecution. This was held in the leading case of <em>R. </em>v. <em>Verelst, </em>3 Campb. 432 (1813), where the person administering the oath had been an officer <em>de facto </em>for twenty years, and that case has been repeatedly followed in England and this country. <em>R. </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>supra; <em>R. </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>1 C. &amp; <em>K. </em>469; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hayward, </em>1 Nott &amp; M. 546; <em>Muir </em>v. <em>State, </em>8 Blackf. 154; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hascall, </em>6 N. H. 352; <em>Biggerstaff </em>v. <em>Com., </em>11 Bush, 169 ; <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>The People, </em>76 N. Y. 220; 3 Russ. Cr. 89 ; Ros. Cr. Ev. 815; 2 Bishop\u2019s Or. L. \u00a7 1020. In <em>Stephens </em>v. <em>State, </em>1 Swan, 157, as in <em>Oaks </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>48 Cal. 197, administering the oath in open court, by one not an officer, was regarded as the act of the court which directed it to be administered, and hence that case is not in conflict with the rule as stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">In <em>Warwick </em>v. <em>State, </em>25 Ohio St. 21, it was held that a deputy clerk of the probate court need not be an elector; but there the deputy had \u25a0 been regularly appointed and qualified, hence was a deputy clerk <em>de jxore, </em>and therefore qualified to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>administer an oatb like that in question here ; for the act was ministerial, and a deputy may perform any duty with respect to granting and issuing the license even in his own name <em>(Walke </em>v. <em>Circleville, Chapin </em>v. <em>Allison, </em>15 Ohio, 288, 566), though regularly such acts should be done in the name of the principal. Here evidence was offered to show that L. E. Pettit was not a deputy clerk <em>de jure, </em>but the court said the evidence was immaterial, and therein erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
