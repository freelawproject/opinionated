LINA complains that the district'court erred in concluding that New York law does not govern Moroney\u2019s assignment of his life insurance policy rights to Life Partners. LINA further complains that the district court erred in awarding Moroney and Life Partners attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-20\">Subsequent to the district court\u2019s entry of judgment in favor of Moroney and Life Partners, LINA complied with the district court\u2019s order by recognizing the assignment of Moroney\u2019s rights to Life Partners. It is not within our power to invalidate that assignment. Consequently, there is no live case or controversy with respect to the validity of the assignment on which we or the district court can pass judgment: Federal courts do not render advisory opinions. <em>United States v. Texas Tech. </em>University, 171 F.3d 279, 286 (5th Cir.1999). LINA\u2019s appeal with respect to the validity of the assignment is thus moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-21\">We turn now to LINA\u2019s complaint that the district court erred in awarding Moroney and Life Partners attorneys\u2019 fees. We review the district court\u2019s decision to award attorneys\u2019 fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>for an abuse of discretion. <em>Wegner v. Standard Ins. Co., </em>129 F.3d 814, 820-21 (5th Cir.1997). The fees in question were awarded pursuant to ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1). \u201cAlthough the decision to award attorneys\u2019 fees is discretionary, the court should consider the following five factors in its analysis: (1) the degree of the opposing parties\u2019 culpability or bad faith; (2) the ability of the opposing parties to satisfy an award- of attorneys\u2019 fees; (3) whether an award of attorneys\u2019 fees against the opposing party would deter other persons acting under similar circumstances; (4) whether the parties requesting attorneys\u2019 fees sought.to benefit all participants and beneficiaries of \u00e1n ERISA plan or to resolve a significant legal question regarding ERISA itself; and (5) the relative merits of the parties\u2019 positions.\u201d <em>Wegner, </em>129 F.3d at 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\">Here, the district court considered each of the five <em>Wegner </em>factors. 'The decision to award attorneys\u2019 fees was predicated in part on the court\u2019s findings that LINA\u2019s position \u201cbordered on being frivolous\u201d and that the relative merits of the parties\u2019 positions clearly favored Moroney and Life Partners. While we do not question the district court\u2019s findings with respect to these issues, we conclude that the court abused its discretion in applying the findings to the entire duration of the underlying litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">As the district court itself ruled, the initial complaint filed by Moroney and Life Partners failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted because it alleged only state causes of . action that were preempted by ERISA. Until Moroney and Life Partners amended their complaint on June 8, 1998 to state a cause of action under ERISA, LINA\u2019s defense to the claims was valid and meritorious. We therefore conclude that Moroney and Life Partners should not have been awarded attorney\u2019s fees incurred prior to the amending of the complaint on June 8,1998. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order awarding attorneys\u2019 fees but vacate the amount of that award and remand for a redetermination of the proper amounirof such fees, consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
