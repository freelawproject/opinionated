Argyrou, a/k/a Charles Argyrou, the petitioner, presents is whether the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County abused its discretion when it denied his motion, pursuant to Md. Rule 4-331(c)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and premised on newly discovered evidence, for a new trial. The evidence upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>which the petitioner relied and denominated newly discovered consisted of a confession by one Robert Lee Benner, Jr., which was submitted in affidavit and audio taped form to the court. The circuit court denied the petitioner\u2019s motion, concluding that the confession did not qualify as newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The facts are not in dispute. The petitioner was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County of theft of property valued at more than $300.00. The State\u2019s proof established to the jury\u2019s satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt, that the petitioner was one of two men,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who, on June 30,1992, using the stolen identification of Robert Flens, rented construction equipment, to wit, a jack hammer with four bits, a 2,500-watt generator, an electric breaker, and a cart, from Taylor Rental, located in Glen Burnie, Maryland, which they took away in a van, described as light-colored, <em>i.e. </em>beige or powdery blue, and did not return. Specifically, an employee of Taylor Rental selected the petitioner\u2019s photograph from a photographic array, prepared by the detective investigating the case, and identified the petitioner at trial as the man who claimed to be Robert Flens and who signed the rental agreement. Also, the real Robert Flens testified that he had not rented the equipment and that his wallet, containing his identification and credit cards, had been stolen prior to the Taylor Rental theft. The petitioner was sentenced to five years imprisonment and ordered to pay a $1000.00 fine and $2000.00 restitution to Taylor Rental Company. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed his conviction in an unreported opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">The petitioner moved for a new trial, citing what he contended was newly discovered evidence. The newly discovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>evidence was, the petitioner asserted, a confession by one Robert Benner, in which Benner admitted committing the Taylor Rental theft and, at the same time, fully exonerated the petitioner. The confession was in the form of a notarized statement, his affidavit, taken by the petitioner\u2019s attorneys, when Benner came to their office. The confession was corroborated by handwriting exemplars given by Benner; one of his signature, and the other, Benner\u2019s signing of the name \u201cRobert Flens.\u201d These exemplars were the subject of expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">A hearing was held on the motion for new trial. Benner was not present at the hearing,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and, so, did not testify. Instead, Benner\u2019s notarized statement, <em>i.e. </em>his affidavit, was introduced into evidence. In that statement, after acknowledging that he was on probation and the inculpatory nature of the statements he was about to make, denying that he had been coerced to make them, and recognizing that he could be prosecuted and jailed, and his probation violated as a result, Benner stated that he was involved in the Taylor Rental theft, along with Rodney Seekford and Michael Raub. Benner claimed Seekford acquired the various Flens identifications, which they used to obtain the construction equipment. He admitted that he signed the rental contract. Benner was asked specifically if the petitioner signed the rental contract, to which he positively stated that he had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The statement also contained an account of an incident, involving the use of the same credit cards, that occurred at the Marley Station Mall and that concededly involved the petitioner. According to Benner, he and Seekford had gone to the Mall in order to use the stolen credit cards, to acquire, for resale, expensive tennis shoes. Michael Raub was supposed to be waiting outside for them with a car. Benner stated that he became suspicious when a transaction between a clerk and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Seekford took too long, and he saw a security guard approaching the store where the transaction was occurring and, so, he alerted Seekford and they left. When they exited the Mall, Raub was not in sight, but there were \u201cseveral police coming out the door and ... a jeep ... was right there on top of us.\u201d Having seen a man, the petitioner, sitting in a van, Benner said that he \u201cmore or less commandeered the van by jumping into it and putting a knife into his [petitioner\u2019s] back and telling him to drive.\u201d The jeep followed for a time, but then \u201cveered off,\u201d at which time Benner told the petitioner to pull into a Wendy\u2019s fast food restaurant, the previously agreed destination point where Raub whs to meet him and Seekford, should something go wrong. Benner stated that they met up with Raub, who was driving a blue Grand Prix. Benner again exonerated the petitioner, stating that he had nothing to do with the Marley Station matter.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He described the petitioner\u2019s van as \u201cmaroon\u201d in color and the van they used to haul away the construction equipment as \u201cwhite.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">After one of the petitioner\u2019s attorney\u2019s testified to the circumstances surrounding the acquisition of the handwriting exemplars, especially that of Benner signing \u201cRobert Flens,\u201d noting specifically that the Taylor Rental rental agreement had not been shown to Benner, expert testimony was presented as to whether the same person signed the rental agreement as signed the exemplars. The expert, Katherine Koppenhav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>er, having been qualified as an handwriting expert, testified without equivocation that it was Benner who signed the name of \u201cRobert Flens\u201d on the June 30, 1992 Taylor Rental contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">In addition to the audio-taped statement that it took from Benner, the State offered testimony from two witnesses, Detective Ronald Sappington, who investigated the Taylor Rental matter, and Scott Rowe, the Marley Station Mall security officer who observed Benner and Seekford enter the petitioner\u2019s van and the petitioner drive away. Benner\u2019s audio-taped statement was more detailed than the one he gave the petitioner\u2019s attorneys, perhaps demonstrating, as the petitioner contended, that the State took the \u201copportunity to cross-examine Mr. Benner,\u201d in an effort \u201cto challenge Mr. Benner at length regarding his alleged involvement in the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">In his statement, Benner stated that he did not know the petitioner and had not seen him before the day that he forced the petitioner, at knife-point, to drive him and Seekford away from the Marley Station Mall. He also stated, however, that about six months after that incident, in the western part of Baltimore City, where he had gone to buy drugs, he saw the petitioner and the van and \u201cit clicked together,\u201d <em>ie., </em>he recognized the petitioner as the person he car-jacked. At that time, Benner maintained that he began making inquiries about the petitioner. Initially Benner said that he sought to discover if the petitioner had identified him to the police as the person who had car-jacked him at the Marley Station Mall. Later, the focus was on what happened to the petitioner. As a result of these inquiries, made of various individuals in the area, Benner learned that the petitioner had been convicted of the Taylor Rental theft and sentenced to five years imprisonment. With that information and having learned who the petitioner\u2019s attorney was, Benner said that he went to petitioner\u2019s attorney\u2019s office and confessed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As to why he did so, Benner had this to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>\u201cI had found out from his attorney. I mean, the night that I was there, he had kids but I\u2019m more or less trying to get my life back. I don\u2019t want nobody doing five years for something that they didn\u2019t do. I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 I guess maybe crime is not my, you know, something that I like I do. Maybe I just have the right outlook for it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Later, he gave another reason for coming forward and confessing: Benner said that it was not simply because it bothers his conscience, but also because it could help him get off drugs, which he wanted to do. As he- put it,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">\u201cWell, I mean you know, apparently, you know, I\u2019m going to be incarcerated here for a short period of time. And however short period of time will be time that I\u2019m away from drugs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">At the beginning of the interview, Benner had explained why he\u2019d come to the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">\u201c... I have a lot of personal problems myself that I\u2019d like to get straightened out, and this is one way that I feel I can go about it. But also, I can\u2019t ??? see somebody else actually taking the blame for something I\u2019ve done. You know, I\u2019m trying to put my life back together and this is something that I don\u2019t want to come back in the future. So, I\u2019d like to get it ironed out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">Benner did not name anyone from whom he received information about the petitioner. Even when pressed, he gave only the names, \u201cBob,\u201d whose last name he claimed not to know, and \u201cGary or something,\u201d again claiming not to know the last name. And he also refused to point out any of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>persons he said he spoke with to the State, explaining that he was not \u201ctrying to get anyone else involved in this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The State\u2019s questioning of Benner leaves no doubt that it did not consider him or his story to be reliable. In that regard, the State inquired why Benner had failed to meet with the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney following the postponed hearing on the motion for new trial. Benner had apparently agreed to do so, but did not. Benner also failed to meet with the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney two days later, again, as he also had agreed. The interview likewise contained references to Benner\u2019s failure to respond to letters the State sent to him. Benner\u2019s answers were not very enlightening. As to the first question, for example, he offered only, \u201cI was\u2014yeah, I was a little maybe\u2014caught me a little off guard, maybe a little apprehensive. Thought maybe I should get\u2014try to get an attorney or something before I talked ??.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The Assistant State\u2019s Attorney informed the court that, at the conclusion of the interview, he accompanied Benner down to the cafeteria to get him something to eat and drink. When they returned to the office, he continued, Benner told him that he was going to take a smoke. The Assistant State\u2019s Attorney then informed Benner that he wanted him to remain so that he would be present when the detective who was going to interview Benner arrived. Notwithstanding that Benner stated that he would be glad to cooperate and was simply going to take a smoke, the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney asserts that Benner left the building and disappeared, not to be seen again by the State. He also maintains that letters subsequently sent to Benner\u2019s home produced no result.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Testifying at the hearing, Sappington testified that he was involved in the investigation of the Taylor Rental theft. He explained why his attention was drawn to the petitioner as a suspect in that theft\u2014after speaking to Flens, and learning that his credit cards and identification had been used at various stores other than Taylor Rental, including stores in the Marley Station Mall, he also learned that, on July 2, 1992, the petitioner had reported being car-jacked shortly after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>occurrence of an incident at the Marley Station Mall in which the Flens credit cards and identification were used. When asked \u201cwhen he joined [the petitioner] and the Flens deal together,\u201d Sappington explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">\u201cUhm, yes. The thing being is that what seemed funny to me was\u2014is that he was reporting a abduction to where Mr. Flens\u2019 identification and credit cards were used in some thefts and attempt thefts, and plus the Taylor Rental case where, uhm, [the Taylor Rental employee], after being showed a photo line-up picks out [the petitioner] as the person who used the identification of Mr. Flens. I don\u2019t know what the odds of that would be, but I think it would be really thin, I would think, just in my opinion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">He thus thought it more than coincidental that the petitioner, who had been identified \"with the Taylor Rental theft just two days before, would have been abducted by men who had used the same identification and credit cards as had been used to effect that theft.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Sappington also testified that he attempted, without success, to interview the petitioner concerning his car-jacking complaint. In fact, although he did speak to the petitioner, Sappington asserted that the petitioner declined his invitation to come by his office to discuss the case, and otherwise refused to speak to him about the incident. According to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Sappington, the petitioner claimed to have spoken to a lawyer, whose phone number he purported to give to Sappington. When Sappington called the number, a woman answered and stated that she had never heard of either the lawyer or the petitioner. Sappington also testified that the only time the petitioner cooperated in the investigation was following his conviction. At that time, Sappington stated, the petitioner called and made an appointment to give Sappington his handwriting samples; however, the detective was told by the petitioner\u2019s counsel \u201cnot to talk to [the petitioner] about anything, just take the handwriting sample.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The Marley Station Mall Security officer testified about the circumstances surrounding the petitioner\u2019s \u201cabduction.\u201d He testified that, having been alerted by a call from the Athlete\u2019s Foot, a store in the Marley Station Mall, that \u201cthey had some suspicious subjects in the store, possibly using a stolen credit card,\u201d he went to the store. Finding no one there at that time, the officer continued, he obtained a description of two men who had been in the store attempting to make a purchase in excess of $300.00. The officer stated that another security officer radioed another description of two men whom that security officer had observed in the Foot Locker. Armed with that description, the officer located them and followed them from that store. The men, he observed, \u201cwalked, uh, rather hurriedly. They weren\u2019t running, it was just a quick pace, uh, directly to one of the mall exits.\u201d Once outside on the sidewalk, the officer stated that the men \u201cappeared to be looking around for the car, for a ride, or where they\u2014they were looking over the parking lot itself, trying\u2014it appeared to me that they were looking for\u2014their car.\u201d After about ten seconds, he concluded \u201cthat, uh, someone got their attention.\u201d Although the officer did not see the wave, he assumed that it was done with a wave; he testified initially that he \u201cdidn\u2019t hear any voices, or any yells or anything like that, any whistles or_\u201d and later that, \u201cI didn\u2019t hear\u2014a call, I didn\u2019t hear a whistle. I\u2019m assuming it was\u2014it was a wave or he just stood there long enough to be seen. I don\u2019t know.\u201d The officer believed that what got the men\u2019s attention was a light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>colored van, to which they walked quickly and entered the front passenger door. He further testified that there did not appear to be any animosity between the driver of the van and the two men who entered it as passengers, and that he did not observe the use of any force. And the driver of the van did not, he said, give any distress signal. The officer stated that he did not see the driver of the van, but he did note the license tag number.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The trial court denied the petitioner\u2019s motion for a new trial. It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">\u201cAs I said before, I believe the testimony of Mr. French [petitioner\u2019s attorney] with regard to the scenario that he testified with regard to the person that came in and told him that he [Benner] was the signer of the name in question in this case and I believe the testimony with regard to the fact that [Benner] did sign in front of him [French], and in reviewing the signature I find that the signature is remarkably like that of the document on the case. I believe that if the testimony of that signer was elicited before a jury it may well produce a verdict of acquittal, as opposed to a verdict of guilty that occurred in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">\u201cWhat I do not believe is that this is newly discovered evidence. I do not believe the defendant learned of the identity of this person and this testimony ... after the trial of the case. The burden is upon the defendant to prove this at this time, and I find that the defendant has not met that burden that it\u2019s newly discovered evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">\u201cTherefore, I deny the motion for new trial.... I take [the affidavit] as evidence and take that if that fellow [Benner] went in and testified before the jury I think very well there would be a different verdict in this case ... I just find that it was not newly discovered evidence. Now, I think it\u2019s upon him [the petitioner] to ... establish that at this time ... and I find that it was not newly discovered.\u201d1<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>3</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>His motion for reconsideration having been denied, the petitioner noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. That court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court in an unreported opinion, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that the evidence offered as newly discovered evidence was not, in fact, newly discovered. We granted certiorari to consider this important question. We shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">That a new trial may be granted in a criminal case tried before a jury cannot be doubted and, indeed, is well settled. <em>In re Petition for a Writ of Prohibition, </em>312 Md. 280, 308, 539 A.2d 664, 677, 686 (1988). <em>See also Ford v. State, </em>12 Md. 514 (1859); Md.Code (1957, 1995 Repl.Vol.) Art 27, \u00a7 594.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A trial court has wide latitude in considering a motion for new trial and may consider a number of factors, including credibility, in deciding it; thus, the court has the authority to weigh the evidence and to consider the credibility of witnesses in deciding a motion for a new trial. <em>Id </em>at 325-26, 539 A.2d at 686. In <em>In re Prohibition, </em>the new trial motion was based on the contention that the jury\u2019s verdict was against the weight of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>the evidence. The trial courts also, have authority to weigh the evidence and to consider credibility of witnesses when the motion is grounded on newly discovered evidence. <em>Yorke v. State, </em>315 Md. 578, 582, 556 A.2d 230, 231-232 (1989). <em>See also Jones v. State, </em>16 Md.App. 472, 477, 298 A.2d 483, 486 (1973) (\u201cIt is essentially the function of the trial judge to evaluate and assess the newly discovered evidence and where such evidence consists of testimonial evidence from a witness allegedly discovered after the trial has been concluded, it is for the trial judge to determine the materiality and the credibility of such testimony.\u201d); <em>Jones v. United States, </em>279 F.2d 433, 436 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>364 U.S. 893, 81 S.Ct. 226, 5 L.Ed.2d 190 (1960) (\u201cWhere there is a grave question of the credibility of after-discovered evidence ... the role of the trial judge is that of the fact-finder.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">It may be said that the breadth of a trial judge\u2019s discretion to grant or deny a new trial is not fixed and immutable, it will expand or contract depending upon the nature of the factors being considered, and the extent to which its exercise depends upon the opportunity the trial judge had to feel the pulse of the trial, and to rely on his or her own impressions in determining questions of fairness and justice. <em>Buck v. Cam\u2019s Rugs, </em>328 Md. 51, 58-59, 612 A.2d 1294, 1297. Of course, the exercise of the discretion is reviewable for abuse. <em>Wiggins v. State, </em>324 Md. 551, 570, 597 A.2d 1359, 1368 (1991); <em>Yorke, </em>315 Md. at 590, 556 A.2d at 235-236; <em>Stevenson v. State, </em>299 Md. at 304, 473 A.2d 450,</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Maryland Rule 4-331(c) provides for the grant of a new trial, or other appropriate relief, on the basis of newly discovered evidence, but only if the prescribed requirements are met. To qualify as \u201cnewly discovered,\u201d evidence must not have been discovered, or been discoverable<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> by the exercise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>due diligence, within ten days after the jury has returned a verdict.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In addition, the motion premised on newly discovered evidence must have been filed in the circuit court, within the later of one year after the imposition of sentence or the issuance of a mandate by the appropriate appellate court. Maryland Rule 4-331(e)(2). Case law has delineated other essential requirements. The evidence offered as newly discovered must be material to the result and that inquiry is a threshold question. <em>Stevenson v. State, </em>299 Md. 297, 302, 473 A.2d 450, 452 (1984). That means that it must be more than \u201cmerely cumulative or impeaching.\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>16 Md. App. 472, 477, 298 A.2d 483, 486 (1973); <em>Love v. State, </em>95 Md.App. 420, 432, 621 A.2d 910, 917 (1993). In addition, the trial court must determine that \u201c[t]he newly discovered evidence may well have produced a different result, that is, there was a substantial or significant possibility that the verdict of the trier of fact would have been affected.\u201d <em>Yorke, </em>315 Md. at 588, 556 A.2d at 235.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>But, like materiality, <em>see, Stevenson, </em>299 Md. at 302, 473 A.2d at 452, whether the proffered evidence is, in fact, \u201cnewly discovered evidence which could not have been discovered by due diligence,\u201d is a threshold question. Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-5\">\u201c[ujnless and until there is found to be \u2018newly discovered evidence which could not have been discovered by due diligence,\u2019 one does not weigh its significance. It is only when this definitional predicate has been established that the provisions of Rule 4-331(c) even become involved. Without this definitional predicate, the relief provided by subsection (c) is not available, no matter how compelling the cry of outraged justice may be.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-6\"><em>Love, </em>95 Md.App. at 432, 621 A.2d at 916-17. The question of whether evidence is newly discovered has two aspects, a temporal one, <em>ie., </em>when was the evidence discovered?, and a predictive one, <em>ie., </em>when should or could it have been discovered? It is to the latter that the requirement of \u201cdue diligence\u201d has relevance. Although a critical concept in \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d jurisprudence, we have yet to define it in that context or, for that matter, in any other Rule using that term, <em>ie., </em>Maryland Rule 2-535(c)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>; Maryland Rule 3-535(c)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The Court has provided guidance as to its meaning, however. Addressing the timeliness of probation revocation proceedings, this Court has equated \u201cdue diligence\u201d with \u201creasonable promptness so as to avoid prejudice to the defendant\u201d and \u201creasonableness.\u201d <em>State v. Berry, </em>287 Md. 491, 500, 413 A.2d 557, 562-563 (1980). <em>See, State v.

Thus, we believe that, as used in Maryland Rule 4-331(c), \u201cdue diligence\u201d contemplates that the defendant act reasonably and in good faith to obtain the evidence, in light of the totality of the circumstances and the facts known to him or her.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">As we have seen, the trial court denied the motion for new trial. It accepted the testimony authenticating the Benner signatures and the circumstances under which they were given and the expert testimony indicating that it was Benner that signed the Taylor Rental agreement. It also accepted Benner\u2019s confession as evidence and expressed the belief that, if Benner were to have been called to testify consistent with it, the result of the trial \u201cmay well [have produced] a verdict of acquittal, as opposed to a verdict of guilty that occurred in this case.\u201d The court thus determined the evidence to be material and would have the requisite effect on the result. It did not believe, however, that the proffered evidence was newly discovered, that \u201cthe petitioner learned of the identity of [Benner] ... after the trial of the case.\u201d The court does not explain or give any reasons for its disbelief; it simply says that the burden is on the petitioner to prove that the evidence offered is, in fact, newly discovered and that he has not carried that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The petitioner argues that the State presented no evidence at the hearing on the new trial motion, or at any other time to suggest, not to mention, establish, that he could have discovered Benner, or obtained Benner\u2019s statement any earlier than he did. Moreover, pointing to the trial court\u2019s finding with respect to the possibility that a different result would have been produced, the State\u2019s response to his motion for reconsideration, <em>ie., \u201c </em>The State agrees that statements elicited at different times from Mr. Benner by both counsel and this writer, if presented to a jury might produce a different verdict,\u201d and the comparison of Benner\u2019s handwriting exemp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>lar to that contained on the Taylor Rental contract, the petitioner asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-4\"><em>\u201cthere is no dispute as to the credibility, admissibility, scope, persuasiveness, weight, materiality, or effect of this evidence. </em>The evidence therefore confirms the fact that [the petitioner] <em>did not commit this crime.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">He urges this Court to reverse the judgments below and, thus, prevent the incarceration of a person who did not commit the crime for which he has been convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The State argues that affirmance of the trial court\u2019s judgment is the proper result consistent with Maryland rule 4-381(c). It contends that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">\u201c[T]o afford [the petitioner] a new trial would render nugatory the requirement that evidence be newly discovered in order to qualify as a basis for relief under Maryland Rule 4-331(c) and abolish the fundamental principles that the assessment of the credibility of such evidence is the role of the fact finder, not the appellate courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">Benner did not appear, as we have seen, at the second motion\u2019s hearing and, so, his confession was before the court only in the form of a notarized statement and an audio-taped statement. And, judging from the court\u2019s comments concerning the effect that Benner testifying at trial would have on the outcome of the trial, it may be inferred that the court did not find the entire confession incredible. Indeed, the comments concerning the similarity of the signature on the Taylor Rental agreement and the exemplars given the petitioner\u2019s counsel would suggest that it believed that Benner signed the rental agreement. Thus, it would appear that Benner\u2019s credibility Was not the decisive factor in the court\u2019s denial of the petitioner\u2019s new trial motion. Rather, it clearly seems to be that the court distrusted the circumstances surrounding the confession; it found the timing of it untrustworthy and suspicious. While the confession may have largely been true, the court was not satisfied that, viewed from the perspective of Rule 4-331(c), it was timely. In short, the court focused not on the credibility of the confession in all of its details; it was, instead, focused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>on the trustworthiness of the totality of the circumstances giving rise to the confession. In so doing, the court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">To be sure, the credibility determinations of the trial court in this case are important. It is obvious that, in reaching its threshold determination, the court believed the witnesses for the state. Indeed, it was that testimony which, it must be inferred, caused the court to distrust the timing and circumstances of the confession. The testimony of the Mall security officer permitted the court to conclude that the petitioner knew, and was in cahoots with, Benner and Seekford and, in fact, that it was the petitioner who was supposed to pick them up, as he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Sappington\u2019s testimony provided the basis for the court to infer that the petitioner did not act with due diligence or in good faith. It also may have provided an explanation of why the petitioner, though a part of the conspiracy, would report a car-jacking. Notwithstanding his having reported the alleged car-jacking, his subsequent refusal to cooperate was, to say the least, suspicious. And the petitioner\u2019s uncooperativeness takes on an even more ominous aspect, and becomes quite understandable, once it is learned that the petitioner has been identified as one of the principals in the Taylor Rental theft. The court could, and obviously did, believe that it was unnecessary for the petitioner to act with due diligence, or in good faith, to locate the person who signed the Taylor Rental agreement because he did not have to; he already, and always, knew who it was\u2014he was his confederate. Moreover, the court was aware, from the petitioner\u2019s trial, that three men were involved in the Taylor Rental theft and it could have inferred, from the security officer\u2019s testimony, that there were three involved in the Mall incident as well. In any event, the court believed quite clearly that the petitioner and Benner were both involved in the two incidents. Its conclusion that the petitioner did not learn of Benner\u2019s identity after the trial of the case can be explained only in that way.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>The cases that have addressed this issue have focused not simply on the credibility of the person offering the exculpatory evidence, but on the credibility or trustworthiness of the evidence itself, as well as the motive, or other impeaching characteristics, of those offering it. When the evidence is offered and the circumstances surrounding it are matters that have been found to inform the former inquiry. In <em>United States v. Oliver, </em>683 F.2d 224 (7th Cir.1982), a letter exculpating the defendant was offered in support of the defendant\u2019s motion for new trial. In denying the motion, the court noted \u201c[s]erious questions concerning trustworthiness and motive\u201d surrounding the letter, that the letter was not sent until after trial, and that the author was the defendant\u2019s friend and a felon, concluding that an \u201caura of suspicion and doubt engulfed\u201d the evidence. <em>See Taul v. State, </em>862 P.2d 649, 659 (Wy.1993) (credibility of new evidence); <em>Horton v. State, </em>249 Ga. 871, 295 S.E.2d 281, 287-88 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1188, 103 S.Ct. 837, 74 L.Ed.2d 1030 (1983) (same); <em>State v.

As we have seen, the State produced two witnesses, whose testimony the court obviously credited. Because their testimony was not at all consistent with Benner\u2019s confession and, in fact, if believed, substantially undermined it, it follows that not only did the State challenge the confession, but that challenge was sufficient to convince the court that Benner\u2019s confession was not newly discovered evidence. .As the proponent of the new trial motion, the petitioner had the burden of establishing, among other things, that the confession was newly discovered evidence. The petitioner simply failed to carry it. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the petitioner\u2019s motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">ELDRIDGE, J., joins in the result only.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b627-14\">.

This account is consistent with the account of the car-jacking that the petitioner gave to the police when he reported the incident. Within an hour of the Marley Station Mall incident, the petitioner called the Anne Arundel County Police Department and reported that he had been carjacked. According to the petitioner, he was sitting in his van at the Marley Station Mall when two men, one wielding a knife, jumped in and forced him to drive down Ritchie Highway, eventually telling him to pull into a Wendy's parking lot. The petitioner also stated that, after he pulled into the Wendy's parking lot, he jumped out of the van and ran, but while running away, he saw the two car-jackers get into a blue car and leave. When he returned to his van, the petitioner claimed, he discovered that sixty dollars were missing from the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Benner was not asked by the petitioner\u2019s counsel whether he or Seekford took anything from the petitioner or the van. In a statement given to the Assistant State's Attorney, however, Benner denied taking anything from either.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b631-6\">.

Benner did not act immediately, however. In response to the question what did he do after learning that the petitioner had been sentenced to five years and the name of his attorney, Benner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-11\">\"Nothing. I mean, I sat over a month or so thinking about it and you know, maybe I started to feel guilty after a month or so.

Detective Sappington explained why he focused on the petitioner as a suspect in the Taylor Rental case. He stated that he learned from speaking with the officer who took the petitioner's report of being carjacked, that the petitioner was, when he called, \"very jumpy and nervous, seemed very jumpy and nervous, like, hyper.\u201d That description along with the additional fact of the description, given by the Taylor Rental employee, of one of the suspects in the Taylor Rental theft, <em>i.e. </em>\"[a] short white male, five foot six, twenty-seven to twenty-eight years old, very nervous and jumpy,\u201d caused Sappington to become suspicious and to suspect that the petitioner might be connected to the Taylor Rental case. His suspicions thus aroused, Sappington said that he showed the Taylor Rental employee who described the men who rented the stolen equipment six photographs, one of which was a photograph of the petitioner. The employee selected the petitioner\u2019s photograph as depicting one of the perpetrators of the Taylor Rental theft, the one who signed the rental contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b636-9\">. At the hearing on the motion for new trial, the trial court expressed concern whether an affidavit, rather than live testimony, suffices as newly discovered evidence for purposes of the Rule. Indeed, it asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>counsel to address the question whether the Rule contemplates that the newly discovered evidence be evidence that is admissible at trial. Although the petitioner filed a memorandum addressing that issue, the trial court did not decide the issue. Instead, it found the evidence offered to be sufficient to permit the grant of a new trial had it been newly discovered. Consequently, we will not consider this threshold issue initially raised by the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b637-7\">.
