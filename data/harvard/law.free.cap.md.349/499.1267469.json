Specifically, the case involves a dispute regarding the payment of the children\u2019s medical expenses, which were paid by Total Health Care under contract with the State of Maryland through its Medicaid program. Total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Health Care has asserted a statutory and equitable subrogation claim against a tort settlement received by the children in connection with the poisoning, to recoup the amount it paid to treat the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The State of Maryland, through the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, provides comprehensive medical health care assistance to low-income persons who meet certain eligibility requirements. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1982, 1994 Repl. Vol., 1997 Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 15-101 through 15-124 of the Health-General Article. Most relevant to this case is the provision that, to be eligible for benefits under the program, recipients are deemed to have assigned to the State any rights to payment for medical care from legally liable third parties. Section 15-109(d) currently states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">\u201c(d) <em>Automatic assignment of </em>benefits.\u2014As a condition of eligibility for medical assistance, a recipient is deemed to have assigned to the Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene or the Secretary\u2019s designee any rights to payment for medical care services from any third party who has the legal liability to make payments for those services, to the extent of any payments made by the Department on behalf of the recipient.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Additionally, \u00a7 15-120 grants the State a right of subrogation to any cause of action which a program recipient has against a third party for payment of medical services. At all times relevant to the resolution of this case, \u00a7 15-120 stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">\u201c\u00a7 15-120. Subrogation claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">\u201c(a) In general.\u2014If a Program recipient has a cause of action against a person, the Department shall be subrogated to that cause of action to the extent of any payments made by the Department on behalf of the Program recipient that result from the occurrence that gave rise to the cause of action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-10\">\u201c(b) Holding money for Department.\u2014(1) Any Program recipient or attorney, guardian, or personal representative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>of a Program recipient who receives money in settlement of or under a judgment or award in a cause of action in which the Department has a subrogation claim shall, after receiving written notice of the subrogation claim, hold that money, for the benefit of the Department, to the extent required for the subrogation claim, after deducting applicable attorney fees and litigation costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">\u201c(2) A person who, after written notice of a subrogation claim and possible liability under this paragraph, disposes of the money, without the written approval of the Department, is liable to the Department for any amount that, because of the disposition, is not recoverable by the Department. <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Thus, \u00a7 15-120(a) grants the Department a right of subrogation to any claim that a program recipient may have against a third party, where the third party\u2019s actions resulted in medical care for which the Department paid. Section 15\u2014120(b)(1) requires the program recipient or the recipient\u2019s attorney to hold funds sufficient to satisfy the Department\u2019s subrogation claim from any judgment or settlement proceeds received, upon receiving notice of the subrogation claim from the Department. Finally, \u00a7 15\u2014120(b)(2) states that, if anyone required by \u00a7 15\u2014120(b)(1) to hold the funds disposes of them, that person will become personally liable on the Department\u2019s claim if the Department is later unable to recover the money. Under this section, if after receiving notice of a subrogation claim under \u00a7 15-120(a), an attorney releases settlement funds to a client without holding back an amount sufficient to satisfy the subrogation claim, and the Department later is unable to recover the funds from the client, the attorney will be personally liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">Sections 15-109 and 15-120 represent the State of Maryland\u2019s effort to comply with the federal law on medical assistance, which requires states to seek reimbursement for medical assistance payments made where a third party is legally liable for that medical care. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(25)(B) (1994) (State plan for medical assistance must provide that \u201cin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>any case where [third party] legal liability is found to exist after medical assistance has been made available on behalf of [a program recipient] and where the amount of reimbursement the State can reasonably expect to recover exceeds the costs of such recovery, the State or local agency will seek reimbursement for such assistance to the extent of such legal liability\u201d); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(25)(I) (1994) (State plan for medical assistance must provide that \u201cthe State has in effect laws under which, to the extent that payment has been made under the State plan for medical assistance for health care items or services furnished to an individual, the State is considered to have acquired the rights of such individual to payment by any other party for such health care items or services\u201d); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396a(45) and 1396k(a)(l)(A) (1994) (State plan must require a program recipient \u201cto assign the State any rights ... to support (specified as support for the purpose of medical care by a court or administrative order) and to payment for medical care from any third party\u201d); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7'433.135 through 433.154 (1997).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">As part of its medical assistance program, the Department contracts with Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>provide medical services to medical assistance recipients, in exchange for monthly per capita payments to the HMO. <em>See </em>Code (1982,1994 Repl.Vol., 1997 Supp.) \u00a7\u00a7 15-103(b)(2)(i), 15-103(b)(18)(i) of the Health-General Article. The Department entered into such a contract with Total Health Care.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The contract between the Department and Total Health Care contained the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">\u201c9. Third-party Liability</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">\u201ca. If an enrollee [program recipient] under the terms of this contract has a cause of action against a person, the HMO-MA shall be subrogated to that cause of action to the extent of any payments made, or costs incurred, by the HMO-MA on behalf of the enrollee that result from the occurrence that gave rise to the cause of action. Costs incurred by the HMO-MA may be considered as including the HMO-MA\u2019s reasonable and customary charges for services furnished by the HMO-MA\u2019s own staff or that of subcontractors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">\u201cb. The Department intends hereby to assign to the HMO-MA its right of subrogation under section 15-120, Health-General Article, <em>Annotated Code of Maryland, </em>but only to the extent to which these rights are assignable under the laws of Maryland. The Department accepts no liability for the failure or inability of the HMO-MA to recover sums potentially available to it under the terms of this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Thus, the Department intended that Total Health Care would carry out the State\u2019s duty to provide medical care to low-income persons, while also possessing the State\u2019s right of subrogation granted by \u00a7 15-120. The amount of the capitation payment that the State would pay Total Health Care for each program recipient was determined on the assumption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>that Total Health Care would have the right to recover any amounts it paid for medical treatment from responsible third parties. <em>See </em>8:4 Md. Register 355 (February 20,1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">With this general background in mind, we turn to the facts of this case. Georgette Roberts and her two minor children, Shaneira and Corina Deloatch, were enrolled with Total Health Care under the State\u2019s Medicaid program from 1987 through 1991. In 1987 Shaneira and Corina suffered lead poisoning and required significant medical care which Total Health Care could not provide at its facilities. Therefore, Total Health Care arranged for the two girls to receive treatment at the Kennedy Institute for Handicapped Children, for which Total Health Care paid $59,880.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">In 1988, Shaneira and Corina sued their landlord for the injuries they suffered as a result of the lead poisoning. Upon learning of the suit in June 1991, Total Health Care sent a \u201clien letter\u201d to the children\u2019s attorney asserting its \u201cstatutory subrogation lien and rights provided in \u00a7 15-120\u201d as assigned to it by the State. This letter requested that the children\u2019s attorney forward a check for $59,880 out of any settlement or judgment received by the children, and stated that \u201cany settlement entered into concerning the matter may be overturned if THC is not consulted or paid.\u201d Total Health Care sent a second letter asserting its \u201cstatutory lien under \u00a7 15-120\u201d in July 1992. The children\u2019s civil suit was settled for $330,000 in October 1993, at which time Total Health Care made both an oral and a written demand for payment of $59,880 from the settlement proceeds. When payment was not forthcoming, Total Health Care brought this action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, naming both Georgette Roberts and her attorney, Saul E. Kerpelman, as defendants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>In its complaint, Total Health Care claimed a right to payment of the $59,880 which it had expended for Shaneira and Corina\u2019s medical care based on a statutory subrogation claim under \u00a7 15-120 (as assigned to it by the Department), and, alternatively, based on principles of non-statutory equitable subrogation. Total Health Care filed a motion for summary judgment. In opposing the motion, Roberts and Kerpelman argued that \u00a7 15-120 violated their due process rights, that the State\u2019s rights under \u00a7 15-120 were not assignable to Total Health Care, and that Total Health Care had no right to equitable subrogation. After oral argument, the circuit court granted Total Health Care\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Roberts and Kerpelman then appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, repeating their arguments that \u00a7 15-120 is unconstitutional under due process principles, that the \u00a7 15-120 subrogation right was not assignable to Total Health Care, and that Total Health Care had no right of equitable subrogation. The Court of Special Appeals rejected their arguments and affirmed. <em>Roberts v. Total Health Care, Inc., </em>109 Md. App. 635, 675 A.2d 995 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Roberts and Kerpelman then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari which this Court granted. <em>Roberts v. Total Health Care, Inc., </em>343 Md. 566, 683 A.2d 178 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">The petitioners\u2019 primary argument is that \u00a7 15-120 violates principles of procedural due process because the statutory obligation to withhold funds constitutes a lien imposed without the opportunity for a prior hearing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">Both the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Rights<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> protect interests in life, liberty and property from deprivation or infringement by government without appropriate procedural safeguards. At \u201c[t]he core of due process is the right to notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>LaChance v. Erickson, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 118 S.Ct. 753, 756, 139 L.Ed.2d 695, 700 (1998). <em>See Blue Cross v. Franklin Sq. Hosp., </em>277 Md. 93, 101, 352 A.2d 798, 804 (1976), and cases there cited; <em>Accrocco v. Splawn, </em>264 Md. 527, 534-535, 287 A.2d 275, 279-280 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Due process, however, is not a rigid concept. As this Court stated in <em>Department of Transportation v. Armacost, </em>299 Md. 392, 416, 474 A.2d 191, 203 (1984), \u201c[d]ue process does not require adherence to any particular procedure. On the contrary, due process is flexible and calls only for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\u201d Thus, in determining what process is due, the Court will \u201cbalanc[e] the private and government interests affected.\u201d 299 Md. at 416-420, 474 A.2d at 203-205. According to the Supreme Court <em>(Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 903, 47 L.Ed.2d 18, 33 (1976)): <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number><em>See also United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, </em>510 U.S. 43, 53, 114 S.Ct. 492, 501, 126 L.Ed.2d 490, 503 (1993) (discussing application of the balancing test to determine whether predeprivation notice and hearing are required).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>\u201c[I]dentification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of three distinct factors: First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Before the protections of due process are implicated requiring the Court to engage in this balancing test, however, two threshold inquiries must be satisfied. As we stated in <em>Golden Sands Club v. Waller, </em>313 Md. 484, 488 n. 4, 545 A.2d 1332,1334 n. 4 (1988):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">\u201c[T]o invoke the protections of procedural due process in a property context, the party asserting unconstitutionality must show that (1) State action has been employed (2) to deprive that party of a substantial interest in property. <em>Tulsa Professional Collection Serv. v. Pope, </em>485 U.S. [478, 485], 108 S.Ct. 1340, 1344-1345, 99 L.Ed.2d 565, 575 (1988); <em>Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Div. v. Craft, </em>436 U.S. 1, 9, 98 S.Ct. 1554, 1560, 56 L.Ed.2d 30, 39 (1978); <em>Department of Transportation v. Armacost, </em>299 Md. at 416, 474 A.2d at 203; <em>Pitsenberger v. Pitsenberger, </em>287 Md. [20,] 27, 410 A.2d [1052,] 1056 [ (1980) ]; L. Tribe, <em>American Constitutional Law </em>\u00a7 10-8 at 680 (2d. ed.1988).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-7\"><em>See also, Barry Properties v. Fick Bros., </em>277 Md. 15, 22-23, 353 A.2d 222, 227-228 (1976). This Court summarized the appropriate inquiry in <em>Riger v. L &amp; B Ltd. Partnership, </em>278 Md. 281, 288-289, 363 A.2d 481, 485-486 (1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">\u201cIn analyzing any contention that a state is depriving one of his property without due process of law, several issues are logically presented. There must be sufficient governmental involvement in the action complained of to constitute \u2018state\u2019 action.... In addition, the government action must result in a \u2018deprivation\u2019 of the complainant\u2019s interest____ Moreover, the private interest involved must rise to a \u2018property* interest within the meaning of the Due Process Clause____ Finally, if there is state action depriving one of a property interest, the pertinent inquiry then relates to the procedure which is constitutionally required under the circumstances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>as the requirements of procedural due process are flexible, involving a balancing of the various interests at stake----\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Consequently, Roberts and Kerpelman can prevail only if \u00a7 15-120 deprives them of a significant property interest. We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Kerpelman, as Roberts\u2019s attorney, obviously has no personal claim to the settlement proceeds themselves. Furthermore, his right to receive payment for the legal services which he performed is not affected by \u00a7 15-120. Legal fees are deducted from the total amount of the settlement prior to any distribution to satisfy the subrogation claim. <em>See </em>\u00a7 15-120(b)(1) (an amount sufficient to satisfy the subrogation claim should be held \u201cafter deducting applicable attorney fees and litigation costs\u201d). Therefore, the fact that \u00a7 15-120 requires money to be held from the settlement proceeds does not affect any property interest of Kerpelman.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Also, there is no deprivation of a property interest of Roberts or the children resulting from the requirement that the money be held. As mentioned previously, upon accepting medical assistance, Roberts and the children were deemed to have assigned to the State \u201cany rights to payment for medical care services from any third party who has the legal liability to make payments for those services----\u201d \u00a7 15-109(d). The effect of an assignment is to transfer all interests in the property from the assignor to the assignee. <em>See, e.g., Fifield Manor v. Finston, </em>54 Cal.2d 632, 640, 7 Cal.Rptr. 377, 382, 354 P.2d 1073, 1078 (1960) <em>(en </em>banc) (both assignment and subrogation \u201coperate! ] to transfer from one person to another a cause of action against a third\u201d); <em>Bouchard v. People\u2019s Bank, </em>219 Conn. 465, 473, 594 A.2d 1, 4-5 (1991) (\u201cSuccession by an assignee to exclusive ownership of all or part of the assignor\u2019s rights respecting the subject matter of the assignment, and a corresponding extinguishment of those rights in the assignor, is precisely the effect of a valid assignment\u201d); <em>Vowers &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Strasheim, </em>248 Neb. 699, 704, 538 N.W.2d 756, 760 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>(1995) (\u201cAn assignment is a transfer vesting in the assignee all the assignor\u2019s rights in property which is the subject of the assignment\u201d); <em>Achrem v. Expressway Plaza Ltd., </em>112 Nev. 737, 917 P.2d 447, 450 (1996) (\u201c[Wjhen a client assigns rights to the proceeds of a tort action to a creditor, those proceeds no longer belong to the client\u201d); <em>Romero v. Earl, </em>111 N.M. 789, 810 P.2d 808 (1991); <em>Leon v. Martinez, </em>84 N.Y.2d 83, 88, 614 N.Y.S.2d 972, 974, 638 N.E.2d 511, 513 (1994) (to effect an assignment \u201cit is only required that there be a perfected transaction between the assignor and assignee, intended by those parties to vest in the assignee a present right in the things assigned\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Therefore, when Roberts and the children asserted a right to recover for medical expenses, they were asserting a right which belonged to the State to the extent of any payments under the Medicaid program. To the extent that they recovered money in settlement for medical expenses that were paid under the Medicaid program, that recovery did not belong to them, but belonged to the State by virtue of the prior assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">A similar conclusion was reached recently by the New York Court of Appeals in a Medicaid recoupment context. <em>Cricchio v. Pennisi, </em>90 N.Y.2d 296, 660 N.Y.S.2d 679, 683 N.E.2d 301 (1997). The question in that case was whether the Department of Social Services could make a claim for recoupment of Medicaid benefits against settlement proceeds despite the fact that \u201ca Medicaid hen ordinarily may not be imposed against the property of any <em>individual </em>prior to his death____\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 90 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>N.Y.2d at 806, 660 N.Y.S.2d at 682, 683 N.E.2d at 304. The court concluded that the recoupment claim could be made because, to the extent that the settlement proceeds were intended to compensate for medical care they were not the property of the recipient. 90 N.Y.2d at 306-307, 660 N.Y.S.2d at 682-683, 683 N.E.2d at 304-305. The court reasoned as follows (90 N.Y.2d at 307, 660 N.Y.S.2d at 682-683, 683 N.E.2d at 304-305):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-5\">\u201cAs the Medicaid recipient\u2019s assignee ..., [the department] obtains all of the rights that the recipient has as against the third party to recover for medical expenses, including the ability to immediately pursue those claims against the third party. Because the injured Medicaid recipient has assigned its recovery rights to [the department], and [the department] is subrogated to the rights of the beneficiary ..., the settlement proceeds are resources of the third-party tortfeasor that are owed to [the department.] Accordingly, the lien on the settlement proceeds attaches to the property of the third party, and thus does not violate the statutory prohibition against imposing a lien against a beneficiary\u2019s property until after his or her death.... The flaw in plaintiffs\u2019 theory that the lien cannot be satisfied until the recipient\u2019s death is that it fails to appreciate this critical distinction between the assets of a responsible third party and assets belonging to the Medicaid recipient.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">We agree with the analysis of the New York court. To the extent that the settlement proceeds received by Roberts and the children represent compensation for medical expenses paid under the medical assistance program, they are not Roberts\u2019s property. They are State property.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See also, e.g., Payne v. State, Dept. of Human Resources, </em>126 N.C.App. 672, 677, 486 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>S.E.2d 469, 471 (1997) (reaching a conclusion similar to that reached by the New York court); <em>Layman v. </em>Woo, 78 Ohio St.3d 485, 488, 678 N.E.2d 1217, 1219 (1997) (holding that department was \u201cthe real party in interest\u201d with respect to recovery of medical expenses).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Even if we assume <em>arguendo </em>that a property interest held by Roberts or Kerpelman is involved, the obligation to hold sufficient funds from the settlement proceeds to satisfy the Department\u2019s subrogation claim would not violate due process principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Relying on this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Barry Properties v. Fick Bros., supra, </em>277 Md. 15, 353 A.2d 222, Kerpelman and Roberts argue that \u00a7 15-120 works a deprivation of their property interests requiring prior notice and hearing because it constitutes a statutory lien. In <em>Barry Properties, </em>the Court struck down portions of Maryland\u2019s mechanics\u2019 lien statute as violative of due process principles after reviewing four cases from the United States Supreme Court. <em>See North Georgia Finishing, Inc. v. Di-Chem, Inc., </em>419 U.S. 601, 95 S.Ct. 719, 42 L.Ed.2d 751 (1975); <em>Mitchell v. W.T. Grant Co., </em>416 U.S. 600, 94 S.Ct. 1895, 40-L.Ed.2d 406 (1974); <em>Fuentes v. Shevin, </em>407 U.S. 67, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972); <em>Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp., </em>395 U.S. 337, 89 S.Ct. 1820, 23 L.Ed.2d 349 (1969). This Court held in <em>Barry Properties </em>that the imposition of a lien under the mechanics\u2019 lien statute, prior to notice and a hearing, constituted a deprivation of a significant property interest without due process. <em>Barry Properties v. Fick Bros., supra, </em>277 Md. at 23-25, 353 A.2d at 227-228.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Under the mechanics\u2019 lien statute at issue in <em>Barry Properties, </em>\u201cthere [was] a \u2018subsisting lien\u2019 as soon as materials [were] supplied or work [was] performed, ... which constituted] a cloud on the property owner\u2019s title____ [Thus,] he no longer [had] unfettered title [and] his equity [was] diminished to the extent of the Hen.\u201d 277 Md. at 23-24, 353 A.2d at 228. <em>See also Connecticut v. Doehr, </em>501 U.S. 1, 11, 111 S.Ct. 2105, 2113, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>115 L.Ed.2d 1, 14 (1991) (prejudgment attachment of real property \u201cclouds title; impairs the ability to sell or otherwise alienate the property; taints any credit rating; reduces the chance of obtaining a home equity loan or additional mortgage; and can even place an existing mortgage in technical default where there is an insecurity clause\u201d); <em>North Georgia Finishing, Inc. v. Di-Chem, Inc., supra, </em>419 U.S. at 606, 95 S.Ct. at 722, 42 L.Ed.2d at 757 (\u201ca bank account, surely a form of property, was impounded and, absent a bond, put totally beyond use.... \u201d); <em>Fuentes v.

Under \u00a7 15-120, the settlement proceeds were not seized but were left in the possession of Kerpelman. Also, no lien existed, nor was any action taken by Total Health Care or the State beyond notifying Kerpelman of the subrogation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">In <em>United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, supra, </em>510 U.S. 43, 114 S.Ct. 492, 126 L.Ed.2d 490, there was a due process challenge to pre-hearing government seizure of a residence subject to forfeiture under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(a)(7) as property used to commit or facilitate the commission of a federal drug offense! The Supreme Court upheld the challenge, holding that the government could not seize the property without affording the owner prior notice and hearing. <em>United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, supra, </em>510 U.S. at 62, 114 S.Ct. at 505, 126 L.Ed.2d at 508. In so holding, however, the Supreme Court specifically endorsed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>various governmental means of preventing disposal of property prior to forfeiture judgment as less onerous alternatives to seizure, and indicated that no prior notice and hearing would be required by such action. One such action cited with approval by the Supreme Court was the filing of a notice of <em>lis pendens. </em>The Supreme Court stated that (510 U.S. at 58-59, 114 S.Ct. at 503-504,126 L.Ed.2d at 506-507):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">\u201cThe Government\u2019s legitimate interests at the inception of forfeiture proceedings are to ensure that the property not be sold, destroyed, or used for further illegal activity prior to the forfeiture judgment. These legitimate interests can be secured without seizing the subject property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">\u201cSale of the property can be prevented by filing a notice of <em>lis pendens </em>... There is no reason to take the additional step of asserting control over the property without first affording notice and an adversary hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-7\"><em>See also U.S. v. Real Prop. Known &amp; Numbered as 429 S. Main Street, </em>52 F.3d 1416, 1420 (6th Cir.1995); <em>U.S. v. 408 Peyton Rd., S.W., Atlanta, Ga., </em>112 F.3d 1106, 1110 n. 5 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Subsequently, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit was presented with a due process challenge to a state procedure providing for the filing of a lien notice against property subject to civil forfeiture prior to judgment. <em>Aronson v. City of Akron, </em>116 F.3d 804 (6th Cir.1997). Relying on <em>United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, supra, </em>the Court of Appeals held that the filing of the lien notice did not violate due process principles even if filed without prior notice and hearing. This was so because <em>(Aronson v. City of Akron, supra, </em>116 F.3d at 811-812)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-9\">\u201c[t]he filing of a lien notice has the same practical effect as the filing of a <em>lis pendens </em>notice. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-10\">\u201cIn addition to impairing the owner\u2019s ability to sell his interest in the property, a <em>lis pendens </em>or corrupt activity lien may taint the owner\u2019s credit rating, may place an existing mortgage in technical default, may make it impossible to obtain a second mortgage, and may have other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>adverse consequences. But under <em>Good\u2019s </em>evaluation of the <em>Mathews </em>factors, as our court recognized in <em>429 South Main Street, </em>this \u2018would not trigger the notice and hearing requirement.\u2019 <em>429 South Main Street, </em>52 F.3d at 1421. The mere filing of an ordinary lien or <em>lis pendens </em>notice simply does not represent the sort of \u2018grievous <em>loss\u2019\u2014see Mathews, </em>424 U.S. at 333, 96 S.Ct. at 901-02\u2014that necessitates prior notice and an opportunity to be heard.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The procedure under \u00a7 15-120 does not constitute as great an intrusion as the lien discussed in <em>Aronson v. City of Akron, supra, </em>or the <em>lis pendens </em>discussed in <em>United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, supra. </em>Under \u00a7 15-120, nothing is filed with a court and no lien attaches. Rather, a notice is sent to the recipient or her attorney informing them of the State\u2019s subrogation claim and the obligation to withhold sufficient funds to satisfy that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Furthermore, the withholding requirement of \u00a7 15-120 is consistent with other State and Federal statutes involving government reimbursement and subrogation claims, as well as the common law of assignment. Roberts and Kerpelman mischaracterize \u00a7 15-120 when they state that \u201cit makes the program recipient\u2019s lawyer the agent of the State for collection of the \u2018debt\u2019 upon penalty of personal liability if the \u2018debt\u2019 is not collected.... As long as the claim is made, the lawyer must hold back the money or face personal financial liability for it.\u201d (Petitioners\u2019 brief at 10). Attorneys are often held liable for funds distributed to clients without satisfying government subrogation or reimbursement rights. <em>See, e.g., Green v. United States Dept. of Labor, </em>775 F.2d 964, 970 (8th Cir.1985) (holding an attorney jointly and severally liable to the government for funds received by the attorney and distributed to the client without first satisfying the government\u2019s reimbursement claim under the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act); <em>United States v. Limbs, </em>524 F.2d 799, 803 (9th Cir.1975) (stating that, under the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act, an attorney \u201cwho receives settlement from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>third party tortfeasor ... has an explicit duty to reimburse the federal government before paying his clients\u201d); <em>U.S. v. Sosnowski, </em>822 F.Supp. 570, 573 (W.D.Wis.1993) (noting that, under the Federal Medicare system, \u201c[t]he government has an independent right of recovery against any entity, including a beneficiary or an attorney, which has received a third party payment. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 411.24(g)\u201d); <em>Matter of Barr, </em>325 S.C. 240, 241, 481 S.E.2d 702, 702 (1997) (noting that, under South Carolina law, a lawyer may be held legally obligated to pay a Medicaid subrogation claim). <em>See also, e.g., </em>Haw.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 346-37(e) and (i) (1993 Repl., 1997 Cum.Supp.) (providing for personal liability on part of attorney who fails to satisfy a government claim out of proceeds of a suit or settlement); Iowa Code \u00a7 249A.6(3) (1994, 1998 Cum.Supp.) (same); S.D. Codified Laws Ann. \u00a7 28-6-7.1 (1997 Supp.) (same); W. Va. Code \u00a7 9-5-11(b) (1998) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Even absent a statute, courts generally hold that an attorney may be held liable for funds distributed to a client if they were received by the attorney with the knowledge that they had previously been assigned to a third party, as they were in the instant case. <em>See, e.g., Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. v. Aguiluz, </em>47 Cal.App.4th 302, 305, 54 Cal.Rptr.2d 665, 666 (1996) (\u201can attorney on notice of a third party\u2019s contractual right to funds received on behalf of his client disburses those funds to his client at his own risk\u201d); <em>Bonanza Motors, Inc. v. Webb, </em>104 Idaho 234, 237, 657 P.2d 1102, 1105 (1983) (holding a law firm \u201cliable to the creditor for funds relinquished to the client in violation of the assignment\u201d); <em>Frontier Enterprises, Inc. v. Anchor Co. of Marblehead, </em>404 Mass. 506, 511, 536 N.E.2d 352, 355 (1989) (stating that \u201c[a]n attorney may be liable for paying funds to his or her client which are \u2018earmarked\u2019 for a third party and which \u2018belong\u2019 to the third party\u201d); <em>General Exchange Ins. Corp. v. Driscoll, </em>315 Mass. 360, 364-365, 52 N.E.2d 970, 973 (1944) (insurance company was subrogated to an insured\u2019s cause of action for property damage to the insured\u2019s car, and therefore had the \u201cright to receive the proceeds\u201d of any cause of action for that property damage; insured\u2019s attorney held liable to insurer for distribut<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>ing settlement proceeds to the insured which were specifically marked as being for property damage).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Also, \u00a7 15-120 is consistent with a lawyer\u2019s ethical duties regarding the safekeeping of property belonging to the client and third parties. See Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.15(b). The official comment to Rule 1.15 states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">\u201cThird parties, such as client\u2019s creditors, may have just claims against funds or other property in a lawyer\u2019s custody. A lawyer may have a duty under applicable law to protect such third-party claims against wrongful interference by the client, and accordingly may refuse to surrender the property to the client.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Thus, \u00a7 15-120 does no more than to restate an already recognized principle of law that attorneys, with notice of an assignment of settlement proceeds by their client to a third party, are obligated to protect the interests of that third party and may be held liable for failure to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Moreover, any intrusion into the property interests of Roberts in the settlement proceeds is counterbalanced by strong governmental interests. The government has a strong interest in keeping its Medicaid program as efficient as possible and limited to its function of being the payor of last resort. The State\u2019s right of subrogation to claims against responsible third parties is an important mechanism in ensuring that the State will only pay for medical care as a last resort. <em>See Arkansas Dept. of Human Services v. Wilson, </em>323 Ark. 151, 913 S.W.2d 783, 786 (1996), quoting <em>Arkansas Department of Human Services v. Walters, </em>315 Ark. 204, 206, 866 S.W.2d 823, 823 (1993) (\u201c \u2018Medicaid is to be the payor of last resort\u2019 \u201d); <em>Shweiri v. Commonwealth, </em>416 Mass. 385, 391, 622 N.E.2d 612, 616 (1993) (recognizing the \u201cgoal that Medicaid be the payor of last resort\u201d); <em>Cricchio v. Pennisi, supra, </em>90 N.Y.2d at 305, 660 N.Y.S.2d at 680, 683 N.E.2d at 303, (noting that \u201c[rjecoupment from responsible third parties is necessary to ensure that the Medicaid program remain the payor of last resort\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Wahl v. Morton County Social Services, </em>574 N.W.2d 859, 864-865 (N.D.1998) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>(\u201cThe Medicaid program is intended to be the payor of last resort, with other available resources being used before medicaid pays for an individual\u2019s care\u201d); <em>Matter of Estate of Higley, </em>810 P.2d 436, 437 n. 2 (Utah App. 1991). The obligation to -withhold funds from any settlement or judgment proceeds, in turn, helps to ensure that the State\u2019s right of subrogation will not be meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The State has a preexisting interest in the settlement proceeds derived from its right of subrogation as well as the earlier assignment of recovery rights by Roberts to the State. Under \u00a7 15-120, the State is seeking to recoup money it has already expended on a recipient\u2019s behalf. Requiring the State to give notice and a hearing prior to informing the recipient of her obligation to withhold funds from any settlement proceeds would severely undermine the State\u2019s ability to enforce its subrogation and assignment rights by giving the recipient an opportunity to dispose of the funds. It could endanger the viability of the Medicaid program.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Thus, the instant case presents a situation similar to that presented when the government utilizes summary procedures to collect taxes. The Supreme Court has \u201cpermitted the <em>ex parte </em>seizure of real property when the Government was collecting debts or revenue.\u201d <em>United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, supra, </em>510 U.S. at 59, 114 S.Ct. at 504, 126 L.Ed.2d at 507. According to Professor Tribe, \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has consistently held that the federal and state governments may validly resort to summary procedures in order to assure effective collection of taxes by minimizing the taxpayer\u2019s opportunity to waste assets in anticipation of a collection attempt.\u201d L. Tribe, <em>American Constitutional Law, </em>\u00a7 10-14 at 722 n.18 (2d ed.1988). According to the Supreme Court, \u201c[t]he prompt payment of taxes is always important to the public welfare. It may be vital to the existence of a government. The idea that every tax-payer is entitled to the delays of litigation is unreason.\u201d <em>Springer v. United States, </em>102 U.S. 586, 594, 26 L.Ed. 253, 256 (1881). Like the collection of taxes, the recoupment of funds paid on behalf of a Medicaid recipient, who has the ability to repay them, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>important to the public welfare and the further health of the Medicaid system.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Based on all of the above considerations, we cannot conclude that \u00a7 15-120 violates principles of procedural due process by requiring an attorney or Medicaid recipient to withhold funds from any settlement proceeds from a responsible third party to satisfy the State\u2019s subrogation interests to the extent of any payments made on behalf of the recipient under the Medicaid program.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Roberts and Kerpelman next attack the validity of Total Health Care\u2019s claim on the grounds that the State had no power to assign its subrogation rights under \u00a7 15-120. They rely on the lack of a common law right of subrogation under the circumstances and upon the absence in the statute of an express provision authorizing assignment of the subrogation right.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Although we have not ruled upon the issue, and find it unnecessary to do so in the present case, a majority of cases hold that a state does not enjoy a common law subrogation right or a right of recoupment for social services benefits provided to individuals.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Ogdon v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd., </em>11 Cal.3d 192, 199-200, 113 Cal.Rptr. 206, 210-211, 520 P.2d 1022, 1026-1027 (1974) <em>(en </em>banc) (\u201cAt common law in the absence of fraud in procuring relief a recipient of charity was under no obligation to repay the government agency disbursing such charity....

Sterling, </em>39 N.Y.2d 397, 401, 384 N.Y.S.2d 128, 130-131, 348 N.E.2d 584, 587 (1976) (\u201cAt common law the recipient of public assistance was not obliged to repay, and no action could be brought to recover sums expended for his care and maintenance\u201d); <em>Chester v. Drake, </em>126 Vt. 472, 475, 236 A.2d 664, 667 (1967). <em>But see Com. v. Schuylkill County, </em>361 Pa. 126, 129 n. 1, 62 A.2d 922, 923 n. 1 (1949) (recognizing a \u201ccommon-law doctrine that there is an implied duty on the part of a recipient of public assistance to make reimbursement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Upon its creation by statute, however, the State\u2019s subrogation right was freely assignable as a chose in action under the common law, and no statutory authority for the assignment was necessary. The State\u2019s \u00a7 15-120 subrogation right is a chose in action. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>at 305 (4th Ed.1968) (defining chose in action as a \u201cright to receive or recover a debt, demand, or damages on a cause of action\u201d). As this Court stated in <em>Summers v. Freishtat, </em>274 Md. 404, 407, 335 A.2d 89, 90-91 (1975), \u201cthe modern rule ... recognizes] that a chose in action, whether arising in tort or ex contractu, is generally assignable____ The only limitation, in the absence of a contrary statutory provision, is that the right of action be of a sort which would survive the death of the assignor and pass to his personal representatives____\u201d <em>See also Medical Mutual v. Evans, </em>330 Md. 1, 29, 622 A.2d 103, 116 (1993) (\u201ca chose in action may be validly assigned\u201d). Therefore, the State\u2019s \u00a7 15-120 subrogation right, as a chose in action, is generally assignable \u201cin the absence of a contrary statutory provision,\u201d <em>(Summers v. Freishtat, supra, </em>274 Md. at 407, 335 A.2d at 91), and this Court is unaware of any such contrary statutory provision. The fact that the subrogation right itself may not have existed at common law is immaterial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">Finally, Roberts and Kerpelman argue that even if the \u00a7 15-120 subrogation right was assignable, Total Health Care can recover only what the State could have recovered, which is nothing. They base this argument on the language of \u00a7 15-120(a) which states that the State shall be subrogated \u201cto the extent of any payments made by the Department on behalf of the program recipient that result from the occurrence.... \u201d They reason that, under \u00a7 15-120, the State only had a right to recover what the State itself paid as a result of the children\u2019s lead poisoning. Thus, their argument continues, the only right which the State could have assigned to Total Health Care was the right to recover what the State had paid as a result of the poisoning. Because the Department pays Total Health Care a monthly capitation payment for all of the children\u2019s health care, the Department paid nothing extra directly as a result of the lead poisoning. Therefore, according to Roberts and Kerpelman, Total Health Care was assigned a right to recover exactly that\u2014nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The above-summarized argument takes a far too formalistic approach to the statute. \u201cIn construing any statute, our principal aim is to effect the intent of the Legislature____\u201d <em>County Commissioners v. Bell Atlantic, </em>346 Md. 160, 169, 695 A.2d 171, 176 (1997). Furthermore, \u201c[w]hen interpreting any statute, we must look to the entire statutory scheme, and not any one provision in isolation, to effect the statute\u2019s general policies and purposes.\u201d <em>County Commissioners v. Bell Atlantic, supra, </em>346 Md. at 178, 695 A.2d at 180. It is clear that it would not effectuate the intent of the General Assembly, in light of the entire statutory scheme, to deny Total Health Care a recovery of the money it expended for the children\u2019s medical care on behalf of the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The entire thrust of the medical assistance program is to provide the necessary amount of medical care to low-income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>persons while minimizing expenditures by the State. Thus, as discussed earlier, recipients are required to assign to the State any rights to recover damages for medical treatment from responsible third parties, \u00a7 15\u2014109(d), and the State is subrogated to those claims, \u00a7 15-120. These two provisions help to minimize costs to the State by ensuring that the State will pay only when the program recipient has no other resources available. <em>See Arkansas Dept. of Human Services v. Wilson, supra, </em>913 S.W.2d at 786; <em>Shweiri v. Commonwealth, supra, </em>416 Mass, at 391, 622 N.E.2d at 616; <em>Cricchio v. Pennisi, supra, </em>90 N.Y.2d at 304-306, 660 N.Y.S.2d at 680-681, 683 N.E.2d at 303-304; <em>Wahl v. Morton County Social Services, supra, </em>574 N.W.2d at 864-865; <em>Matter of Estate of Higley, supra, </em>810 P.2d at 437 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Similarly, as discussed above, the State has reduced its costs by contracting with HMOs such as Total Health Care to provide medical care to program recipients for a monthly capitation fee. \u00a7\u00a7 15-103(b)(2)(i) and 15-103(b)(18)(i). <em>See </em>Ch. 500 of the Acts of 1995, Preamble (\u201can innovative managed care Medical Assistance program [will] obtain the greatest amount of savings while assuring quality of care and access to services\u201d). Obviously, when the costs incurred by the HMOs for the treatment of program recipients are lowered, the State directly benefits through lower capitation payments. Thus, allowing the HMOs to recover expenditures from responsible third parties is in accord with the entire statutory medical assistance scheme because it further reduces the amounts paid out by the State in the form of capitation payments, while ensuring medical care for low-income persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The reasonable interpretation of the statutory scheme is that the HMO is to be substituted for the State for purposes of \u00a7 15-120. The HMO is acting as an agent or administrator for the State in providing medical care to indigent persons and in collecting back any payments received for medical treatment from responsible third parties. This is an efficient system which maximizes the savings to the State by keeping capitation payments as low as possible. Furthermore, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Department has consistently interpreted \u00a7 15-120 in this manner. As noted earlier, in its contract with Total Health Care the Department made clear that it intended for Total Health Care to have all of the same rights as the State in providing medical care to program recipients, stating that \u201c[if] an enrollee [program recipient] under the terms of this contract has a cause of action against a person, the HMO-MA shall be subrogated to that cause of action to the extent of any payments made, or costs incurred, by the HMO-MA on behalf of the enrollee that result from the occurrence that gave rise to the cause of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">This interpretation by the Department dates back at least to 1981. Prior to that time, the regulations under \u00a7 15-120 required HMOs to \u201cdetermine whether the enrollee ha[d] third-party coverage, [to] seek recovery from that source for any medical services rendered, and [to] refund such payments, excluding Medicare, to the Department.\u201d COMAR 10.09.16.09.C (1977). In 1981, however, the regulations were amended, and the requirement that the HMO refund any recoveries to the Department was eliminated. <em>See </em>8:4 Md. Register <em>355-356 </em>(February 20, 1981). According to the Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene, this change was made <em>(id. </em>at 355, emphasis added),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">\u201cto achieve equity in payments to health maintenance organizations. <em>Medical assistance rates for these organizations are calculated on the assumption that collections from liable third parties will help defray the cost of services to Medical Assistance enrollees. </em>To require instead that these collections be refunded to the Department is to place an undue financial burden on the organizations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">This long-standing interpretation of \u00a7 15-120 by the administrators charged with its enforcement should be accorded considerable weight. <em>Lussier v. Maryland Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>343 Md. 681, 696-697, 684 A.2d 804, 811-812 (1996) (interpretation of a statute by the officials charged with administering the statute is afforded great weight, especially when accompanied by legislative acquiescence). <em>See, e.g., Md. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number><em>Classified Employees v. Governor, </em>325 Md. 19, 33, 599 A.2d 91, 98, <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 1090,112 S.Ct. 1160, 117 L.Ed.2d 407 (1992); <em>Morris v.
