L.D., T.E.P. v. Anne Arundel County Department of Social Services, </em>and <em>D.N. v. Frederick County Department of Social Services.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In each of these cases, the individuals have been the object of child abuse or child neglect investigations by the respective local departments, and in each of the cases, the investigation resulted in local department findings of either \u201cindicated\u201d or \u201cunsubstantiated.\u201d These appeals follow from each individual\u2019s petition in the circuit court for judicial review of the local department\u2019s actions with respect to the inclusion of the petitioners\u2019 names on databases that they contend are \u201ccentral registries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Before our discussion of the law and resolution of the issues of this appeal, we shall describe briefly the procedural history and questions presented in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">\n<em>L Facts and Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Abr\">\n<em>Montgomery County Department of Social Services v. L.D.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">1. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">Pursuant to sections 5-706.1 and 5-706.2 of the Maryland Code (1984, 1991 Repl.Vol., 1997 Supp.) of the Family Law Article,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) affirmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>MCDSS\u2019s<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> finding that L.D., a day care provider, was responsible for \u201cindicated\u201d neglect. L.D. filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. L.D.\u2019s appeal was stayed pending this Court\u2019s decision in <em>C.S. v. Prince George\u2019s County Department of Social Services, </em>343 Md. 14, 33, 680 A.2d 470, 480 (1996), where we held that section \u201c5-715 provides a right to a contested case hearing\u201d before entering the name of an alleged child abuser or neglector in a central registry.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">In reaction to our opinion in <em>C.S., </em>'the Department of Human Resources (Department or DHR), deactivated the Child Abuse and Neglect Central Registry (Central Registry).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> MCDSS then notified L.D. that L.D.\u2019s name would not be entered into the Central Registry because it had been deactivated. L.D.\u2019s name, however, would be listed along with the local department\u2019s findings on a computerized central database known as the Automated Master File (AMF). MCDSS then moved to dismiss L.D.\u2019s petition for judicial review for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on grounds that because L.D.\u2019s name would no longer be entered on the Central Registry, <em>C.S.\u2019s </em>requirement that a local department hold a contested case hearing was no longer applicable and because sections 5-706.1 and 5-706.2, the statutory provisions authorizing a limited hearing at which an accused individual can contest local department findings, do not authorize judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The Circuit Court for Montgomery County denied MCDSS\u2019s motion. The court found that MCDSS\u2019s entry of the names of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>individuals found by MCDSS to have committed child abuse or neglect into the AMF or the Client Information System (CIS),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which could be accessed by agencies and other entities throughout the state, constituted an entry into \u201ca central registry.\u201d The court further found that, under <em>C.S., </em>the inclusion of L.D.\u2019s name on this registry invoked a right to a \u201ccontested case\u201d hearing under the Administrative Procedure Act, Maryland Code (1984, 1995 Repl.Vol., 1997 Supp.), sections 10-201 through 10-227, State Government Article (SG). MCDSS noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and this Court granted the local department\u2019s Petition for Writ of Certiorari before that court heard arguments in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">2. Questions Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">MCDSS presents the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">1. May local departments maintain files relating to child abuse and neglect investigations and reference those files in a computerized data base without triggering a right to a contested case hearing and judicial review?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-8\">2. Absent a showing that a Chapter 318 hearing affects any right, entitlement, benefit, or license due under law, does the judiciary have an inherent right to review a local department\u2019s investigation of a report of suspected child abuse or neglect?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Because of our ultimate resolution in this case, it is unnecessary for us to address directly MCDSS\u2019s second question.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">\n<em>D.N. v. Frederick County Department of Social Services</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">1. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">D.N. is a tenured public school teacher originally found by FCDSS as responsible for the indicated abuse of a student. The accusation arose out of an incident in which D.N., an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>industrial arts teacher for the hearing impaired, burned a student in a shop class by a hot tool D.N. was bringing to the student for the student\u2019s use in the class. According to D.N., the contact was accidental. Complicating the issue was what D.N. perceived as a misunderstanding regarding a distinction in American Sign Language (ASL) vocabulary and the student\u2019s misinterpretation of an ASL sign as demonstrating D.N.\u2019s intent to burn the student. A FCDSS caseworker determined that the contact was intentional and made a finding of \u201cindicated\u201d child abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">FCDSS notified D.N. of its finding. D.N. filed an appeal with the OAH, requesting a contested case hearing. As a result of the first stage of that appeal, FCDSS notified D.N. that it had conducted a review of its records in the case and that its finding would remain as \u201cindicated.\u201d After an <em>in camera </em>review by the OAH, the OAH likewise notified D.N. that FCDSS\u2019s finding would not be modified. Finally, after D.N. submitted supporting memoranda and made a fifteen minute oral argument before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), the ALJ determined that there were serious flaws in FCDSS\u2019s investigative process, but because she did not have the authority to order such a contested case hearing, only reduced MCDSS\u2019s finding to \u201cunsubstantiated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">D.N. filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Frederick County. A hearing on that petition was stayed pending our decision in <em>C.S., </em>343 Md. 14, 680 A.2d 470. After we filed our opinion in that case, FCDSS notified D.N. that D.N.\u2019s name would not be entered on the Child Abuse and Neglect Central Registry. FCDSS retained D.N.\u2019s name and investigation records, however, on the AMF/CIS registries. FCDSS then filed a motion to dismiss D.N.\u2019s petition for judicial review. In an opposing motion for summary judgment, D.N. requested that the trial judge remand the case to the OAH for a \u201ccontested case\u201d hearing pursuant to the APA. The trial judge granted FCDSS\u2019s motion to dismiss, but in his oral ruling from the bench, acknowledged the need for \u201cfurther direction from the [ajppellate [cjourt.... [W]hat you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>really need is for the Court of Special Appeals, or hopefully, Court of Appeals, to take this up and clarify what <em>C.S. </em>means.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">D.N. timely appealed the circuit court\u2019s denial of its petition for judicial review to the Court of Special Appeals. As with the other two cases at hand, we granted Writ of Certiorari and consolidated all three cases before that court heard arguments in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">2. Questions Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">D.N. presents the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">May the local departments of social services elude the Court\u2019s holding in <em>C.S. v. Prince George\u2019s County Department of Social Services, </em>343 Md. 14, 680 A.2d 470 (1996), that, \u201c[Family Law] Section 5-715 provides an alleged abuser with a separate and independent right to an administrative hearing before his or her name may be entered into a central registry[,]\u201d and that \u201cthe hearing under [section] 5-715 qualifies as a \u2018contested case\u2019 hearing under the APA[,]\u201d by disbanding one child abuse registry while continuing to register the child abuse finding in other State-wide central databases?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">Does a public school teacher have a right, under State law and the State and federal constitutions, to a contested case hearing prior to a local department of social services registering] a child abuse finding against that teacher when the public school employer has free access to that child abuse finding and when there is a resultant threat to employment and <em>de facto </em>loss of employment opportunity for that public school teacher?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-10\">Is there a right to petition for judicial review from a ... quasi-judicial decision of the Office of Administrative Hearings regarding the finding that a person is a child abuser, where that decision is a final one as delegated to OAH by a State agency, and where interpretation of State law and rights guaranteed under State and federal constitutions are at issue?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Because of our resolution of D.N.\u2019s first question, we shall not address the third question or resolve directly the second question.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\n<em>T.E.P. v. Anne Arundel County Department of Social Services</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">1. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">T.E.P., a private school teacher, was classified by AACDSS as an \u201cindicated\u201d abuser after an in-school paddling of a student by T.E.P. Although criminal charges were filed against T.E.P., a District Court judge dismissed those charges at a preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">T.E.P. appealed AACDSS\u2019s findings pursuant to sections 5-706.1 and 5-706.2. The ALJ upheld the findings, and T.E.P. sought judicial review of that decision in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. AACDS advised T.E.P., after this Court\u2019s decision in <em>C.S., </em>that T.E.P.\u2019s name would not be entered into the Child Abuse and Neglect Central Registry because that registry had been deactivated. AACDSS then moved to dismiss T.E.P.\u2019s petition for judicial review, arguing that T.E.P. \u201cis not entitled under <em>C.S. </em>to a contested case hearing before OAH or to judicial review of decision rendered in the Chapter 318 hearing.\u201d AACDS informed T.E.P., however, that T.E.P.\u2019s name would be entered in its \u201ccurrent registry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">The circuit court granted AACDSS\u2019s motion. T.E.P. noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. This Court granted the local department\u2019s Petition for Writ of Certiorari and consolidated review with the <em>L.D. </em>and <em>D.N. </em>cases before the Court of Special Appeals heard argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">2. Questions Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">T.E.P. presents the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-12\">1. Are the statewide computer databases classifying individuals as child abusers, \u201ccentral registries\u201d under Family Law Article Sections 5-714 and 5-715 requiring a contested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>case hearing prior to placement of an individual in the database?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-4\">2. Does inevitable governmental dissemination of an \u201cindicated\u201d finding of child abuse to a prospective employer impinge upon an individual\u2019s liberty right to follow a chosen profession thereby mandating contested case procedures, judicial review or other due process under the Maryland Declaration of Rights and the United States Constitution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">3. Does the inherent right of judicial review of arbitrary and capricious administrative decisions involving personal rights attach to a \u201cChapter 318 hearing\u201d in which an \u201cindicated\u201d finding of abuse is sustained?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Because of our resolution of T.E.P.\u2019s first question we will not address directly questions two or three.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The Consolidated Question</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">We shall consolidate the first questions of each petitioner into a single question, the answer to which resolves all of the cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-9\">Does the inclusion of the names of individuals in databases accessible on a statewide basis to all local departments and other entities constitute \u201ca central registry\u201d as contemplated by sections 5-714 and 5-715, therefore requiring that \u201ccontested case\u201d hearings under the APA be afforded prior to the inclusion of names in the databases?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">\n<em>II. Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AsU\">Statutory Framework<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">Maryland\u2019s Child Abuse and Neglect statute is set forth in sections 5-701 to 5-715 of the Maryland Code (1984, 1991 Repl.Vol., 1997 Supp.), Family Law Article. Pursuant to section 5-706, a local department, after receiving a report and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>conducting an investigation of suspected child abuse or neglect, makes a finding as to whether neglect or abuse was \u201cindicated\u201d or \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d or \u201cruled out.\u201d A finding of indicated means that the local department found \u201ccredible evidence, which has not been satisfactorily refuted, that abuse, neglect, or sexual abuse did occur.\u201d \u00a7 5-701(k). A finding of unsubstantiated means the there was insufficient \u201cevidence to support a finding of indicated or ruled out.\u201d \u00a7 5-701(v). A finding of ruled out is \u201ca finding that abuse, neglect, or sexual abuse did not occur.\u201d \u00a7 5-701(t). If the local department makes a finding of indicated or unsubstantiated abuse or neglect, it must notify, within thirty days after the investigation is complete, the person who allegedly committed the abuse or neglect of that finding and his right to appeal the finding in an administrative hearing. \u00a7 5-706.1(a). These hearings to contest local department findings of indicated or unsubstantiated neglect or abuse commonly are called \u201cChapter 318 hearings,\u201d referring to the legislative act creating them. <em>See generally </em>1993 Md. Laws, Chap. 318.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">1. Chapter 318 Hearings</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Upon notification by a local department that an accused has been found responsible for the indicated or unsubstantiated abuse or neglect of a child, he or she can request an administrative hearing by responding to the local department\u2019s notice in writing within sixty days. \u00a7 5-706.1(b). Within ten days of receipt of a request for a hearing, the department must \u201creview all records and reports concerning the alleged abuse or neglect\u201d and then \u201cdetermine whether the finding shall be amended, modified, or expunged.\u201d \u00a7 5-706.1(d). Also within ten days of receiving the request for an administrative hearing, the local department is required to forward to OAH the request for the administrative hearing. \u00a7 5-706.1(c). <em>See also </em>\u00a7 5-706.2(b) (requiring the Department to forward to OAH all reports and records regarding the case upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>accused\u2019s request for a hearing). If the local department has not changed its findings to \u201cruled out,\u201d the records must be transferred to the OAH and the accused can then request an <em>in camera </em>review of the full report or record by an ALJ \u201cto determine the accuracy and sufficiency of the report or record.\u201d \u00a7 5-706.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">After the ALJ determines that the information \u201cin the report or record is sufficient and accurate for purposes of determining an issue in a proceeding,\u201d the information in that record or report may be forwarded to the accused. \u00a7 5-706.2(c). If the accused contests the findings, he or she may submit additional written information to the ALJ. \u00a7 5-706.2(d)(1). The ALJ then determines the correctness of the findings and, if incorrect, must \u201corder the Department to amend, modify, or expunge the finding, as appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is important to note that the informal nature of Chapter 318 hearings allows for no presentation of evidence or testimony of witnesses by the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">2. Maintenance of Records</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Information relating to child abuse or neglect is stored by the local departments and the Social Services Administration (SSA), which is a branch of the DHR. Local departments are required, in cases of child abuse or neglect, to \u201cmaintain records relating to the report and investigation which identify individuals involved in the investigation or assessment by name and address, including the identification of any needed services and an assessment of risk, in accordance with Regulation .18 of this chapter.\u201d COMAR 07.02.07.14B(1). In addition, records relating to any case-related investigations, assessments, or services offered must be maintained by the local department. COMAR 07.02.07.14B(1) and (2). The Child Abuse and Neglect statute defines a record as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-7\">the original or any copy of any documentary material, in any form, including a report of suspected child abuse or neglect, that is made by, received by, or received from the State, a county, or a municipal corporation in the State, or any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>subdivision or agency concerning a case of alleged child abuse or neglect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\u00a7 5-701(r). <em>See also </em>COMAR 07.02.07.02(26); COMAR 07.02.26.02(11). A report is defined as \u201can allegation of abuse or neglect, made or received under\u201d the Child Abuse and Neglect statute. \u00a7 5.701(s). <em>See also </em>COMAR 07.02.07.02(28); COMAR 07.02.26.02(12). If abuse or neglect is ruled out and no further reports of abuse or neglect received, the report and investigative findings are expunged from the local department\u2019s records within 120 days of the conclusion of the investigation. \u00a7 5-707(b)(2); COMAR 07.02.07.18B. If the department concludes that the abuse or neglect is unsubstantiated, reports and findings are expunged within five years of the conclusion of the investigation if no further reports of abuse or neglect are received during that time. \u00a7 5-707(b)(l); COMAR 07.02.07.18(A). Findings of indicated abuse can remain on record indefinitely.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">3. Central Registry</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The Child Abuse and Neglect Central Registry originally was created by the Legislature in 1966, and its existence was mandatory. <em>See </em>1966 Md. Laws, Chap. 221. In 1987, the Legislature amended the statute and provided that the maintenance of the Central Registry was discretionary. 1987 Md. Laws, Chap. 635. Thus, as part of its records and pursuant to the present provisions of \u00a7 5-714, the SSA \u201cand each local department may maintain a central registry of cases reported under this subtitle,\u201d containing the information gathered by the local departments from around the state. \u00a7 5-714(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">The statute does not define \u201ccentral registry.\u201d DHR regulations, however, define it as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>a centralized listing of individuals identified in the local department of social services written findings of an investigation of suspected abuse or neglect, pursuant to Family-Law Article, \u00a7 5-701 et seq., Annotated Code of Maryland, as responsible or allegedly responsible for causing the injury, harm, or substantial risk of harm to a child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">COMAR 07.02.07.02B(4); COMAR 07.02.26.02B(4). The information contained in these records may be accessed and used by the SSA and by any local departments and law enforcement personnel investigating reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. \u00a7 5-714(c). Article 88A \u00a7 6 provides, in pertinent part, that it is unlawful to disclose these records, with several exceptions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-5\">(a) <em>In </em>general\u2014Except in accordance with a court order or to an authorized officer or employee of the State, another state or local government, or the United States, or a fiduciary institution having a right thereto in an official capacity, and as necessary to discharge responsibilities to administer public assistance, medical assistance, or social services programs, it shall be unlawful for any person or persons to divulge or make known in any manner any information concerning any applicant for or recipient of social services, child welfare services ... directly or indirectly derived from the records, papers, files, investigations or communications of the State, county or city, or subdivisions or agencies thereof, or acquired in the course of the performance of official duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-6\">(b) <em>Child abuse or </em>neglect.\u2014Except as otherwise provided in Title 5, Subtitle 7 of the Family Law Article, all records and reports concerning child abuse or neglect are confidential, and their unauthorized disclosure is a criminal offense subject to the penalty set out in subsection (e) of this section.

These procedural safeguards are now codified at section 5-715:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">(b) <em>Notice of entry of name in central </em>registry.\u2014Before the name of a person who is suspected of abuse or neglect is entered in a central registry, the person shall be given notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">(c) <em>Hearing to appeal entry of name in central registry required; </em>exception.\u2014(1) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, on request by a person suspected of abuse or neglect, the Department shall hold an administrative hearing for the purpose of allowing the person to appeal the entry of the person\u2019s name in a central registry. *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">(2) The hearing shall be held in the county in which the person suspected of abuse or neglect resides.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-9\">(3) The name of a person adjudicated a child abuser may be entered in a central registry without an opportunity for a hearing under this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-10\">(d) <em>Requirements for entry of name in central </em>registry.\u2014 The Department may not enter the name of a person in a central registry unless the person has:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-11\">(1) been adjudicated a child abuser;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>(2) unsuccessfully appealed the entry of the person\u2019s name in the central registry under procedures established by the Department and this section; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\">(3) failed to respond within 15 days to notice by the Department of the Department\u2019s intent to enter the person\u2019s name in a central registry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\"><em>See also </em>1987 Md. Laws, Chap. 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">We addressed the procedural safeguards provided by section 5-715 to persons suspected of child abuse or neglect prior to the entering of their names on a \u201ccentral registry\u201d in <em>C.S., </em>343 Md. at 33, 680 A.2d at 480, and there held that section 5-715 provides those individuals a right to a contested case hearing before DHR or a local department can enter their names into a central registry. According to the affidavit of Stephen Berry, Acting Director of the Office of Family and Children\u2019s Services of the Social Services Administration, in reaction to our opinion in <em>C.S. </em>and \u201c[r]ather than offering all individuals on the Central Registry full administrative hearings,\u201d the Department deactivated the formal Central Registry. Accordingly, the Department, on its own accord, ceased entering names on the Child Abuse and Neglect Central Registry in 1996 and effectively disbanded that particular system.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">4. The AMF and CIS Registries</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">As recognized by the local departments in their brief, \u201c[a]lso considered part of the agency\u2019s record are the coded entries in the AMF and CIS.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The departments go on to describe the evolution of the AMF:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-9\">Since the 1940s, prior to local departments having responsibility for CPS [Child Protective Services], DHR and local departments have maintained \u201clists\u201d of their clients. Prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>to automation, this was done by use of a centralized index card filing system known as the \u201cMaster File.\u201d When the Master File was automated in 1986, it was renamed the \u201cAutomated Master File\u201d or AMF. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">In his affidavit for the <em>L.D. </em>case, Acting Director Berry further described the AMF and CIS database systems:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">The AMF, which still operates in many jurisdictions, is accessible to all local departments. The AMF contains coded information about any individual who has applied for or received benefits or services through a DHR program anywhere in the state. As with the Master File, local departments use the AMF to locate active and closed case records; determine what DHR benefits or services individuals have applied for or received; monitor case activity; and extract limited demographic information about individual applicants and recipients. The AMF also generates the data DHR requires for various statistical reports.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">In the early 1990s, DHR began development of a new computer system, CIS. Local departments in all but the largest jurisdictions now use CIS to track clients and services. While CIS jurisdictions still have access to the AMF, they enter new data and cases directly into CIS. The same kinds of data are recorded in both systems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">In both the AMF and CIS, \u201cchild protective services\u201d provided in response to a report of child abuse or neglect are catalogued, as other services, under a \u201ccase head,\u201d usually the female head of the household. Under the case head, local departments enter the names of family members, including the child and other relatives by blood, adoption, or marriage, and of household members. In the case of alleged abuse or neglect, household members include all individuals who lived with the child or were a regular presence in the child\u2019s home. Any other individuals significant to the provision of services are identified as \u201cassociates\u201d and coded with a reference to their relationship to the case head.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>The particular services provided to a family are identified in the AMF or CIS by a code. In the case of reported child abuse or neglect, a service code \u2019for child protective services is entered into the AMF or CIS for the case head as well as for every household or family member or associate. An additional code identifies the alleged maltreatment (physical abuse, sexual abuse, or neglect) and disposition of the investigation (\u201cindicated,\u201d \u201cunsubstantiated,\u201d or \u201cruled out\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">Access to the AMF and CIS is limited. In both systems, access is controlled by the use of passwords provided <em>only </em>to certain local department and DHR employees for whom access is necessary to perform their jobs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Acting Director Berry went on to describe the now defunct Central Registry. He stated that the Central Registry initially was accessible to public and private agencies and that it was not until 1977 that the Legislature \u201cprohibited the Department from entering a person\u2019s name into \u2018the Child Abuse Central Registry unless he or she had been \u2018adjudicated a child abuser\u2019 or had been offered an administrative hearing.\u201d <em>See generally </em>1977 Md. Laws, Ch. 504. Berry noted that in 1981, because of the stigmatizing effect on a family or child and the intrusive nature of the appeals process, the Legislature limited access to the Central Registry to individuals specifically involved in child abuse investigations: \u201cprotective services staff of the Social Services Administration, protective services staff of local departments of social services, who are investigating a report of suspected child abuse, ... and law enforcement personnel who are investigating a report of suspected child abuse.\u201d 1981 Md. Laws Ch. 770 (showing additions and deletions). <em>But see </em>COMAR 07.02.07.28A, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">In 1987, at the request of the Department, the Legislature again amended provisions regarding the Central Registry and clarified that the maintenance of the Central Registry was discretionary rather than mandatory. <em>See </em>1987 Md. Laws Ch. 635 (now codified with amendments at \u00a7 5-714(a)). Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>ingly, in the late 1980s, the Department deactivated the Central Registry. It was reactivated briefly after the passage of the Chapter 318 hearings process, \u201c[biased on [DHR\u2019s] understanding that the Chapter 318 appeal procedures would satisfy, as well, the hearing requirements of section 5-715.\u201d That interpretation proved incorrect when this Court held in <em>C.S., </em>343 Md. at 33, 680 A.2d at 480, that section 5-715 required that individuals be offered full contested case hearings, not simply the limited Chapter 318 hearings, prior to the entry of their names on the Central Registry. As we have stated, in reaction to that decision and rather than offering full contested case hearings, the Department again deactivated the Central Registry. At no time has DHR offered individuals full administrative \u201ccontested case\u201d hearings to challenge the entry of their names on the AMF or CIS.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">The AMF is defined by the DHR in its regulations as an \u201cautomated electronic system that maintains data related to services provided by a local department.\u201d COMAR 07.02.07.02B(3). The AMF also has been referred to as \u201ca statewide, comprehensive database containing records of all cases, including those of suspected child abuse, which are handled by local departments of social services.\u201d Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, Floor Report for House Bill 617, at 2 (1993); Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, Bill Analysis for House Bill 617, at 1 (1993). The local departments assert that \u201c[t]hese databases serve as computerized indices of all of the agency\u2019s files, only a small percentage of which involves [Child Protective Services]. By \u2018running\u2019 a name, a local department can determine whether [it or] any [other] local department has served or assisted an individual or household and the status of such involvement.\u201d The local departments contend that the AMF and CIS systems are not central registries because they are \u201cnot \u2018designed solely to list the names of adjudicated child abusers.\u2019 \u201d <em>C.S., </em>343 Md. at 22, 680 A.2d at 474 (quoting Bill Analysis for House Bill 617, at 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">In the <em>L.D. </em>case, the circuit court below determined that, as matter of law, \u201cthe AMF and CIS databases operated by the Montgomery County Department of Social Services and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>State Department of Human Resources constitute a \u201ccentral registry\u201d as contemplated by Md.Code Ann. Family Law Art., \u00a7\u00a7; 5-714 and 5-715 (1990 &amp; Supp.1996).\u201d In reaching this determination, Judge Mason, in an excellent opinion, explored the factual background and described the AMF and CIS databases: \\</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\">The precursor to the AMF was the Master File index card systems maintained by each individual local department since the 1940s. These systems were unique to each department and kept track of only those services rendered by that respective local department. Statistical data from these files was tabulated and sent to DHR on a monthly basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">In 1986, DHR created the Automated Master File (\u201cAMF\u201d) to replace the card system. Unlike the manual card system, the AMF was the filing system for all local departments and made information entered by one local department instantly accessible to all others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">In 1990, DHR updated the AMF with a new system called the Client Information System (\u201cCIS\u201d). The same data is recorded in both systems. The CIS database is now used in all but the largest jurisdictions. Those jurisdictions using the CIS still have access to the AMF.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">In both systems, data regarding child abuse and neglect is cataloged under a \u201ccase head\u201d and is entered by means of alphanumeric codes. Although the affidavit [of Stephen Berry] does not set out how DSS determines who is the \u201ccase head,\u201d it does state that the case head is \u201cusually the female head of the household.\u201d Nonetheless, all information regarding the case is stored under that name. Included in this information are the identities of all individuals significant to the provision of services along with codes which reveal their relationship to the case head.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-8\">In the case of child abuse or neglect, two codes are entered which are of particular importance:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-9\">\u2022 one signifies that a child protective services investigation has been conducted and identifies the maltreat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>ment alleged in the investigation, <em>ie., </em>whether it is physical abuse, sexual abuse or neglect; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Av3\">\u2022 the second identifies the finding of the investigation, <em>ie., </em>whether it was \u201cruled out,\u201d \u201cindicated,\u201d or \u201cunsubstantiated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">These codes appear under the name of each individual listed under the case head regardless of whether that individual is the perpetrator, victim or is otherwise associated with the case. There is no code which explicitly identifies or otherwise singularly applies to the perpetrator.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">In addition to submitting the affidavit generally describing the codes and procedures used to enter an individual onto the AMF or CIS, DSS also submitted printouts reflecting the information available on [L.D.]. As for the AMF printouts, this information only reflects that [L.D.] ran a day care home. This is because DSS switched from the AMF to the CIS prior to the allegations of neglect against [L.D.]. DSS entered all case information on the CIS, hence, only the CIS contains child neglect information connected with [L.D.].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">The CIS printouts regarding [L.D.] largely confirm the general information regarding the databases summarized above. The information appears in three types of printouts. One printout is the \u201caddress\u201d display which contains [L.D.]\u2019s address. The second printout is the \u201csummary\u201d display wherein [D.N.] is listed as the case head with [L.D.\u2019s] spouse, [L.D.\u2019s] children, [the child and the child\u2019s mother] all listed under [L.D.\u2019s] name. Next to each name is the code for a child neglect investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\">The final type of printout is the \u201cclient inquiry\u201d display. Each individual, including [L.D.] has a distinct display under their name in which certain information appears. All of these displays for each individual contain the same codes signifying: (1) a child neglect investigation; (2) a finding of \u201cindicated neglect\u201d; (3) the location of the office handling the investigation; and (4) the dates the investigation was opened and closed. Additionally, the displays contain codes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>for each individual\u2019s relationship to the case head and their date of birth. [Citations omitted; footnotes omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">With the foregoing discussion in mind, we turn now to the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\n<em>III. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">In this consolidated appeal, we must address the issue left unanswered in <em>C.S., </em>343 Md. at 34 n. 8, 680 A.2d at 480 n. 8: \u201c[W]hether records stored in the AMF [and CIS] are ... \u2018central registries]\u2019 within the meaning of [section] 5-714.\u201d We answer this in the affirmative and hold that because the AMF and CIS registries are statewide, comprehensive databases containing information identifying suspected child abusers, available on a statewide basis, these databases constitute central registries and therefore are subject to the contested case hearing procedures mandated by section 5-715 and <em>C.S.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">\n<em>C.S. v. Prince George\u2019s County Department of Social Services</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">In <em>C.S., </em>343 Md. at 22, 680 A.2d at 474, the Prince George\u2019s County Department of Social Services (PGCDSS) notified C.S. that C.S. had been found responsible for indicated abuse and that it would enter C.S.\u2019s name on the Child Abuse and Neglect Central Registry. ' C.S. received only a limited Chapter 318 hearing, not a contested case hearing. The ALJ upheld the local department\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">C.S. filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. PGCDSS moved to dismiss that petition, arguing that the child abuse statute did not specifically provide for judicial review and that the APA, which provides for judicial review in some cases, did not apply to findings of indicated child 'abuse. The circuit court agreed with the PGCDSS and granted its motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">After an exhaustive review of the legislative history and evolution of Maryland\u2019s Child Abuse and Neglect statute and regulations, we reversed the circuit court and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>conclude[d] that [sections] 5-706.1 and 5-706.2, which implement Chapter 318 hearings, are only applicable to a review of the local department\u2019s records. Section 5\u2014715[, however,] provides an alleged abuser with a separate and independent right to an administrative hearing before his or her name may be entered into a central registry. We further h[e]ld that the hearing under [section] 5-715 qualifies as a \u201ccontested case\u201d hearing under the APA, and that it was improper to provide C.S. with only the limited hearing specified by Chapter 318.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 23-24, 680 A.2d at 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Integral to our holding in <em>C.S. </em>was the developmental history of the statutory and regulatory provisions relating to central registries. We described the various procedural safeguards the Legislature incorporated into the child abuse statute over the years and determined that the Legislature\u2019s enactment of those provisions</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">evidence^] a deep concern on the part of the legislature to give individuals alleged to have committed child abuse or neglect an opportunity to clear their name. This history also demonstrates the legislature\u2019s concern that before information relating to alleged child abuse can be disseminated state-wide, that information must have been demonstrated to be accurate either through adjudication or an administrative hearing. Clearly, [sections] 5-701 to 5-715 grant broad authority to social services and law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute cases of child abuse and to prevent its recurrence. At the same time, the legislature has also shown that this authority must be tempered to ensure that individuals are not labeled as child abusers on the basis of inaccurate or incomplete information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 30, 680 A.2d at 478. <em>See also id. </em>at 24-30, 680 A.2d at 475-78 (describing in detail and analyzing the legislative history of the child abuse statute over the past thirty years).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">We then went on to discuss the history behind Chapter 318 hearings and described the Legislature\u2019s enactment of sections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>5-706.1 and 5-706.2 as \u201ca new avenue of procedural protection ... [for] allowing alleged abusers to request administrative review of <em>the findings </em>made by a local department.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28, 680 A.2d at 477 (emphasis added). Finally, we discussed the Legislature\u2019s amendment of section 5-715 in Chapter 318, which broadened that provision\u2019s scope by replacing each reference to \u201cthe central registry\u201d in section 5-715 to \u201ca central registry.\u201d We noted the significance, stating: \u201cFollowing this amendment, [section] 5-715\u2019s right to a hearing clearly applies to <em>all central registries </em>in Maryland, not one single central registry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29, 680 A.2d at 478 (emphasis added). Thus, we recognized in <em>C.S. </em>that the fundamental distinction between the Chapter 318 protections and the protections previously provided in section 5-715 was that a Chapter 318 hearing was created to allow those found to have committed abuse or neglect to challenge those findings, even if their names are not to be placed on a central registry. Section 5-715, however, continues to provide procedural safeguards for those accused of abuse or neglect before their names can be entered into a central registry.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Having noted the distinctions between the two types of hearings, we then went on in <em>C.S. </em>to analyze how those hearings actually were conducted. We concluded that DHR regulations provided only a limited Chapter 318 type hearing for the distinctly different appeals the departments were to provide under section 5-715. <em>See id. </em>at 31, 680 A.2d at 478. Accordingly, we struck down these regulations because they failed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">to properly implement the legislative scheme because the Chapter 318 hearing was created by the legislature as a new and independent means of review [for a local department\u2019s findings only]. Thus, Chapter 318 hearings were intended to supplement, rather than replace, the pre-existing administrative review of an agency\u2019s decision to enter a person\u2019s name on a central registry, available under [section] 5-715.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqo\"><em>Id. </em>The nature of the hearings required by section 5-715, we then determined, were contested case hearings under the APA. <em>Id. See also </em>SG \u00a7 10-202(d)(l) (defining a contested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>case hearing as \u201ca proceeding before an agency to determine a right, duty, statutory entitlement, or privilege of a person that is required by statute or constitution to be determined only after an opportunity for an agency hearing.\u201d). One of the elements of a contested case hearing, we said, \u201cis whether the entity conducting the hearing acts in an adjudicatory capacity, <em>ie. </em>by determining the facts of a case and applying those facts to some legal standard in order to reach a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32, 680 A.2d at 479 (citing <em>Sugarloaf Citizens Ass\u2019n v. Northeast Waste Disposal Auth., </em>323 Md. 641, 653, 594 A.2d 1115, 1121 (1991) and <em>Medical Waste Assocs. v. Maryland Waste Coalition, Inc., </em>327 Md. 596, 609, 612 A.2d 241, 247 (1992)). During the course of a section 5-715 hearing, the ALJ must answer the sole question of \u201cwhether the alleged incident of abuse or neglect is correctly labeled as \u2018indicated\u2019 or \u2018unsubstantiated,\u2019 \u201d <em>C.S., </em>343 Md. at 33, 680 A.2d at 479. In order to reach that determination, the ALJ must \u201csift between potentially conflicting information presented by the DHR and the alleged abuser to determine\u201d whether the DHR\u2019s label is correct. <em>Id. </em>We held, therefore, that the Legislature intended that this appeal process be conducted as an administrative contested case hearing under the APA. Accordingly, section \u201c5-715 entitles [persons accused of child abuse or neglect] to a contested case hearing before the DHR or [local department] can enter [the accused\u2019s] name on a central registry created under [section] 5-714.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34, 680 A.2d at 480 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">Statutory Interpretation</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Having discussed the backdrop of <em>C.S.\u2019s </em>requirement that a contested case hearing be held before an individual\u2019s name can be entered on a central registry, we must now address whether the AMF and CIS databases currently in use by the local departments constitute central registries, thereby requiring the same contested case procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">We have said that \u201c[t]he cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature.\u201d <em>Oaks v.

[Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Because we have already held in <em>C.S. </em>that the Legislature intended contested case hearings to be held before individuals can be listed on a central registry, the question germane to the issue at hand is the plain meaning of or what constitutes a \u201ccentral registry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>The Child Abuse and Neglect statute uses but does not define the phrase \u201ccentral registry.\u201d As stated, <em>supra, </em>however, a definition can be found in DHR\u2019s regulations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-4\">\u201cCentral registry\u201d means a centralized listing of individuals identified in the local department of social services written findings of an investigation of suspected abuse or neglect, pursuant to Family Law Article, \u00a7 5-701 et seq., Annotated Code of Maryland, as responsible or allegedly responsible for causing the injury, harm, or substantial risk of harm to a child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">COMAR 07.02.07.02B(4). <em>See also </em>COMAR 07.02.26.02B(4). In The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 240 (1983), \u201ccentral\u201d is defined as \u201cconstituting that from which other related things proceed or upon which they depend.\u201d \u201cCentralize\u201d is defined as \u201cto draw or to gather about a central or central point\u201d or \u201cto bring under one control, esp. in government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cCentral\u201d likewise is defined in the Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 186 (10th ed. 1996) as \u201ceasily accessible from outlying districts.\u201d \u201cRegistry\u201d is defined as \u201can official record book.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 985. Taking into consideration the dictionary meanings of the terms \u201ccentral\u201d and \u201cregistry,\u201d along with the regulatory definition of \u201ccentral registry,\u201d we believe that the plain meaning of \u201ccentral registry\u201d is a list of reported instances concerning individuals identified by local departments as suspected of child abuse or neglect that is centrally stored and centrally accessible from outlying areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The AMF and CIS database systems clearly are central registries within the plain meaning of sections 5-714 and 5-715. First, the information stored on the databases is accessible statewide. Using either the AMF or CIS, the local departments input information relating to reports of alleged abuse or neglect from their separate locations, and this information is stored in the databases\u2019 memory banks. Likewise, the information stored is retrievable by any local department throughout the State. In fact, all local departments are required, upon receiving a report of child abuse, to \u201ccheck the Central Registry, AMF, or CIS, and any available case rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>ords for any information about any other services currently being offered or previously offered by the local department to the child,\u201ccaretaker, or household or family member.\u201d COMAE 07.02.07.061.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">The local departments in the case <em>sub judice </em>argue that the mere maintenance of a computerized index of its cases, \u201cin which no individual is <em>identified </em>as an alleged maltreator, does not trigger the hearing right set forth in [section] 5-715.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Moreover, the departments contend these databases were not created to store lists of child abuser or neglect offenders; rather, they are indices of all services provided by the local departments.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">As we perceive their first argument, the local departments assert that because the AMF and CIS registries do not denote specifically who among the individuals listed on the registry as associated with the incident is the perpetrator, this scheme does not enable others accessing the records to discern from the list who committed the abuse or neglect. We disagree. Under section 5-701(b) and under DHR\u2019s own regulations, abuse can be committed only by a parent, a person responsible for the child\u2019s supervision or having permanent or temporary care or custody of the child, or a household or family member. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5\u2014701(b) and COMAR 07.02.07.02B(6). Neglect can be committed only by a parent or person responsible for the child\u2019s supervision or having permanent or temporary care or custody. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5-701(p) and COMAR 07.02.07.02B(7)(a). The statute and these regulations narrow who among the list of individuals associated with the incident can be a perpetrator. Furthermore, the AMF and CIS display the particular finding resulting from the investigation, as well as the ages of the individuals, so one reviewing the record easily can discern who on the record is an adult and who is a child. Therefore, anyone reading a record can learn that the perpetrator is one of the adults listed who necessarily must fall into the relationship categories described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">To the extent the local departments presuppose that many individuals associated with the incident will be listed on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>record, thereby decoying the real perpetrator, this may not be the case. If, for example, an anonymous report of abuse involved a single parent and one child, someone reviewing records related to this incident on the AMF or CIS could infer easily from that record who is the parent listed on the registry. Additionally, the reviewer can discern that the child and parent are entered in the database because of a finding of indicated or unsubstantiated abuse or neglect because no other persons are listed and from the disposition of the case therefore can infer that the parent is responsible for the abuse or neglect. Accordingly, we believe the AMF and CIS regis-' tries sufficiently identify individuals suspected by local departments of abuse or neglect within the meaning of section 5-715.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Although the primary reason for the creation of the Central Registry in 1966 was to track individuals allegedly responsible for child abuse or neglect, we have found no indication by the Legislature that it intended the only central registry in Maryland to be the Child Abuse and Neglect Central Registry then extant. Simply because the local departments store a wide variety of information on the AMF or CIS registries relating to other services offered their clients, that alone does not render those databases any less of a central registry for the purpose of identifying child abusers or neglectors. Although the information entered into the AMF or CIS documents any services that any individuals have received, a necessary subset of those records is services provided by child protective services for cases of abuse or neglect. What is more, in his affidavit, Acting Director Berry asserts the data which had previously been available from the Central Registry was \u201cequally available through the AMF.\u201d Simply because the primary purpose of the AMF or CIS was not to list those found responsible for the abuse or neglect of a child does not mean those databases, or at least the relevant portions of abuse and neglect records stored on the databases, do not constitute central abuse and neglect registries.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">In addition to our interpretation that the AMF and CIS databases constitute central registries under the plain meaning of the statute, legislative history supports this interpreta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>tion. For instance, in addition to creating a new hearing procedure for challenging local department findings, the Legislature broadened the scope of section 5-715 with Chapter 318 by replacing \u201cthe\u201d central registry with \u201ca\u201d central registry. This modification clearly shows that the Legislature no longer intended, if it ever had intended, to limit the statute\u2019s applicability to the Child Abuse and Neglect Central Registry, which sometimes had been deemed \u201cthe\u201d child abuse and neglect registry, meaning the most widely used or most complete registry of child abusers or neglectors in this state. Instead, the Legislature amended the statute to reflect the need to protect persons before they are entered on any central registries. As we have stated, \u201c[flollowing this amendment, [section] 5-715\u2019s right to a hearing clearly applies to all central registries in Maryland, not one single central registry.\u201d <em>C.S., </em>343 Md. at 29, 680 A.2d at 478.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">The local departments argue that the Legislature did not intend to broaden the term \u201ccentral registry\u201d in Chapter 318 to trigger both contested case hearings under section 5-715 and the hearings of limited review as set forth in sections 5-706.1 and 5-706.2, because it twice rejected a comprehensive definition of central registry that would have included the AMF and CIS registries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">\u201cCentral Registry\u201d means any file, database, record, or other information source that is made or kept by a local department or the Department and contains information on child abuse and neglect cases. \u201cCentral Registry\u201d includes the following, whether or not centrally located: A manual file or automated data file; and all reports and records of suspected child abuse and neglect maintained by a local department or the Department.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">1992 House Bill 1016, section 1. <em>See also </em>1993 Md. Laws, Chap. 318 (showing strike-outs amending bill to delete same language defining \u201ccentral registry\u201d). The local departments contend the Legislature\u2019s omission of this proposed definition shows that the Legislature specifically rejected the notion that the AMF and CIS were central registries. We do not believe this to be the case. First, our review of the legislative files for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>House Bill 1016 and House Bill 617 revealed no specific opposition to the contemplated definition of \u201ccentral registry\u201d based on the inclusion of the AMF or CIS as central registries. Rather, some parties expressed concern over the definition including as part of a central registry every \u201cfile, database, record, or other information source ... made or kept by a local department or the Department\u201d pertaining to child abuse or neglect cases. In a letter to Delegate Donald Elliot about the proposed amendments to the child abuse and neglect statute, an assistant attorney general wrote that the definition of central registry in House Bill 1016 essentially would define all files kept by the Department as a central registry. Furthermore, this definition would create \u201ca right to notice and an opportunity for a hearing for every person who is reported to a local department for child abuse or neglect.\u201d Letter from Kathryn M. Rowe, Assistant Attorney Gen., to Hon. Donald B. Elliott of Mar. 2, 1992, at 3. <em>See also </em>Letter from Patricia M. Mannion, Ass\u2019n of Social Services Directors, to John S. Arnick, House Judiciary Comm, of Feb. 26, 1992 (opposing House Bill 1016 because \u201cby redefining central registry as \u2018any file, data base record or other information source,\u2019 the definition of central registry is greatly expanded, ... resulting in a heavy burden on staff time in providing \u2018fair hearings.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">More importantly, although it rejected the comprehensive definition of \u201ccentral registry,\u201d the Legislature also chose not to alter the status quo by supplying another, more limited definition. Rather, the Legislature, aware of the Hodge<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> court\u2019s interpretation that \u201ca central registry\u201d included the AMF and CIS, specifically did not attempt to modify this interpretation. Therefore, we find more persuasive that the Legislature, knowing of the <em>Hodge </em>interpretation, accepted this definition of \u201ccentral registry.\u201d See Senate Judicial Pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>ceedings Committee, Floor Report for House Bill 617, at 2 (1993), <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">\n<em>Hodge v. Carroll County Department of Social Services</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The United States District Court for the District of Maryland already has held that the AMF and CIS constitute central registries within the meaning of section 5-715. In <em>Hodge v. Carroll County Department of Social Services, </em>812 F.Supp. 593 (D.Md.1992), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, Hodge v. Jones, </em>31 F.3d 157 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 1018, 115 S.Ct. 581, 130 L.Ed.2d 496 (1994), the plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of their son, Joseph Hodges, filed a federal section 1983<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> claim against the Carroll County Department of Social Services (CCDSS). The claim arose out of an incident in which the Hodges took their son to the Carroll County General Hospital to examine and treat swelling in Joseph\u2019s right arm. The doctor who initially diagnosed Joseph\u2019s condition believed it to be \u201ca broken right ulna \u2018without adequate historical explanation,\u2019 \u201d and referred the case to CCDSS as an incident of suspected child abuse. <em>Hodge, </em>812 F.Supp. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The next day, a CCDSS social worker began an investigation of the reported abuse. After interviewing the Hodges and other individuals, and finding no evidence of abuse, the social worker classified the Hodge case as \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d and \u201cruled out,\u201d and filed a report with CCDSS. CCDSS then filed its report on the AMF.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Not satisfied with first diagnosis of Joseph\u2019s condition, the Hodges took their son to another doctor. This doctor diagnosed the condition as osteomyelitis, a bacterial bone infection, and treated the condition. Mrs. Hodge later contacted CCDSS and notified them of Joseph\u2019s infection, pointing out that child abuse could not have caused the injury to Joseph\u2019s arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>The Hodges later requested that CCDSS permit them to inspect their case files in order to ensure that CCDSS correctly noted the disposition of the case. Instead of allowing them to review the file, the Assistant Director of CCDSS forwarded to the Hodges a summary of the case and notified them that their names had been entered on the AMF. Skeptical of the CCDSS, and how the Assistant Director handled the case file, and also concerned over the ramifications of their inclusion on the AMF, the Hodges asked the Director of DHR for assistance. She responded that according to Maryland\u2019s confidentiality provisions, she could not disclose to the Hodges the case file\u2019s contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">In evaluating whether the procedural safeguards provided in section 5-715 applied to the AMF system, the federal district court made specific findings as to why the AMF was a central registry<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> under Maryland law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">The individual defendants insist that the AMF is not a central registry because it is not a system designed solely to list the names of adjudicated child abusers, and because it does not identify any person as a suspected child abuser____ [Tjhat argument apparently confuses the general term \u201ccentral registry\u201d with the specific [Child Abuse and Neglect Central Registry]. Clearly, any computerized data base that includes records of cases of suspeeted child abuse is a \u201ccentral registry\u201d under Maryland law. Of course, the [Child Abuse and Neglect Central Registry] is an example of a \u201ccentral registry.\u201d Similarly, the AMF also is a \u201ccentral registry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>The defendants argue further that because the AMF does not identify any persons as \u201csuspected child abusers,\u201d the AMF is not a central registry and [section] 5-715 does not apply. Under Maryland law, however, the AMF <em>is </em>a central registry. Additionally, with regard to the defendants\u2019 initial position, exactly the opposite conclusion follows from the facts presently in the record. CCDSS provides [child protective services] only in cases of suspected child abuse. <em>See </em>COMAR 07.02.07.03A. Further, applicable regulations define \u201cchild abuse\u201d generally as physical injury or sexual molestation inflicted on a child either by a parent or by a guardian. COMAR 07.02.07.02B(3).[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>] Therefore, every record of [child protective services] on the AMF is a record of a case of suspected child abuse. Indeed, several of the documents in the Hodges\u2019 physical case file labeled \u201cReport of Suspected Child Abuse\u201d leave' no doubt about the nature of [the DSS social worker\u2019s] investigation in this case. Finally, even in a record of \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d child abuse, it requires no great leap of faith to conclude that at least one of the parents or guardians listed in the record is suspected of child abuse, regardless of whether the record identifies them explicitly in that way, and the plaintiffs have submitted affidavits from several former DSS employees to support such a conclusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 603-04.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Although we are not bound by the federal district court\u2019s interpretation of the term central registry, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>find its definition in its opinion persuasive. We also cited this case without disapproval in <em>C.S., </em>343 Md. at 22 n. 2, 680 A.2d at 474 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">More importantly, the Legislature also apparently found the federal court\u2019s interpretation persuasive. The Legislature stated that it devised the Chapter 318 hearing procedures and created a mechanism aside from the appeal procedures to be provided prior to listing individuals on a central registry because of the circumstances surrounding the Hodges\u2019 plight. Specifically, Chapter 318\u2019s enactment was \u201cintended to more fully protect persons who are wrongly accused of child abuse or neglect by allowing them to avoid placing sole reliance on <em>Hodge </em>and by creating another mechanism by which they can contest the findings and investigations carried out by local departments of social services.\u201d Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, Floor Report for House Bill 617, at 2 (1993); Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, Bill Analysis for House Bill 617, at 2 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">What is more, the legislature not only was aware of the federal district court\u2019s interpretation of \u201ccentral registry,\u201d it did not alter any of the bill\u2019s wording to contradict that interpretation. In a letter from Delegate Donald B. Elliot, a sponsor of the bill, to the Members of the Judiciary and Judicial Proceedings Committees, with a copy of the <em>Hodge </em>opinion attached, Delegate Elliot wrote: \u201cKindly note\u2014starting on page 8\u2014Judge Herbert Murray\u2019s reaffirmation of the fact that the Automated Master File (AMF) at DHR <em>is </em>a central registry and those persons on the file are entitled to the protections of Family Law Article 5-715 which includes a fair hearing.\u201d Letter from Delegate Donald B. Elliot to Members of the Judiciary and Judicial Proceedings Committees of Feb. 8,1993. Likewise, in the Floor Report and in the Bill Analysis of House Bill 617, after noting that the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>dants in <em>Hodge </em>asserted that the AMF was not a central registry, the documents went on to state that \u201c[t]he federal court, however, found that the AMF should be considered a \u2018central registry.\u2019 \u201d <em>See </em>Floor Report at 2; House Bill at 2. Had the Legislature decided to reject this definition and choose a different definition of the phrase \u201ca central registry,\u201d it clearly could have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">The local departments aver our interpretation would render the Legislature\u2019s provision for Chapter 318 hearings meaningless and nugatory because any entry on the AMF or CIS would require the departments to hold both Chapter 318 hearings and contested case hearings. Although it is true that one found responsible for indicated or unsubstantiated abuse or neglect and also listed by a local department on the AMF or CIS would be entitled to both forms of hearings, that hardly renders Chapter 318 hearings, as codified in sections 5-706.1 and 5-706.2, useless. The purpose of the Chapter 318 proceeding has been made clear: to allow an individual to contest the local department\u2019s findings of indicated or unsubstantiated abuse or neglect. If the local departments choose not to list an alleged perpetrator on the AMF or CIS, then the only hearing required is one pursuant to sections 5-706.1 and 5-706.2. Stated another way, Chapter 318 hearings are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB\">intended to more fully protect persons who are wrongly accused of child abuse or neglect by allowing them to avoid placing sole reliance on <em>Hodge </em>and by creating another mechanism by which they can contest the findings of investigations carried out by local departments of social services. <em>This bill stands apart from the notice and hearing provisions concerning central registries, thereby giving persons a clear and independent basis from which to contest findings of investigations into alleged child abuse and neglect.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALA\">Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, Floor Report for House Bill 617, at 2 (1993); Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, Bill Analysis for House Bill 617, at 2 (1993) (emphasis added). Chapter 318 merely provides to the suspected abuser another means for review; it was not intended to replace section 5-715 rights afforded individuals. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>primary impact of House Bill 617, passed by the Legislature as Chapter 318, upon 5-715 was to change the- terminology \u201cthe central registry\u201d to \u201ca central registry.\u201d In making this change, the Legislature may well have anticipated the Department\u2019s attempt to avoid the necessity for such hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">The local departments also argue that our holding in this case</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">means that CPS workers will not be able to enter any data into the AMF or CIS relating to an open investigation until after giving notice of and completing an evidentiary hearing. As a result, CPS workers will have no ability either to alert other staff when they have begun an investigation or to determine whether another investigation is already underway. This result ... would cripple the local departments\u2019 ability to protect children from abuse and neglect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">We believe the Legislature has spoken on the issue, and it is clear it sought a balance between the critical need to investigate and prosecute child abusers and neglectors and the equally critical need to allow persons accused of abuse and neglect the opportunity to clear their names before dissemination throughout the entire state. Accordingly, the departments\u2019 arguments are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">\n<em>IV. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Taking into consideration the plain meaning of the term \u201ccentral registry\u201d and the legislative history and purpose of the Child Abuse and Neglect statute, we hold that the term \u201ccentral registry\u201d includes the AMF and CIS databases now operated by the DHR and local departments.

As of the date of the <em>Hodge </em>opinion, \"central registry\u201d was then defined in DHR regulation 07.02.07.02B(1) as \"a registry of all reported cases of suspected child abuse and neglect maintained in the Social Services Administration.\u201d The definition has since been amended and renumbered. <em>See </em>COMAR 07.02.07.02B(4). <em>See also </em>07.02.26.02B(4). While the federal district court relied on the older definition in its determination that the AMF and CIS are central registries within the meaning of sections 5-714 and 5-715, we believe the analysis in <em>Hodge </em>remains persuasive, particularly given that court\u2019s comments that the AMF sufficiently identifies those suspected of abuse or neglect, an element required in the current regulation. <em>See Hodge, </em>812 F.Supp. at 604.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b310-7\">.
