We shall hold that the contract, which was authorized by the Governor and approved by the Board of Public Works, is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">On March 27, 1996, the Attorney General, after receiving authorization from the Governor, entered into a contingency fee contract (hereinafter, the \u201cContract\u201d) with a private law firm (hereinafter, \u201coutside counsel\u201d) to \u201cprovide legal counsel, representation, and litigation services to the Attorney General and the State of Maryland in connection with litigation against the tobacco industry.\u201d \u00b6 2.1. The Contract states that the Attorney General contracted with outside counsel for the following three (3) reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-8\">\u201cthe State of Maryland (\u2018the State\u2019) has incurred substantial costs over the years to pay for the health and other care of its citizens afflicted with tobacco-related illnesses; and \u201cthe State has determined to seek the recovery of such costs and other damages arising from the sale and/or distribution of tobacco products from the tobacco industry through litigation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-9\">\u201cthe State lacks sufficient resources to pursue the recovery of such costs without entering into a contract with counsel pursuant to a contingency fee arrangement.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">\u00b6 Preamble. Pursuant to the Contract, the \u201cAttorney General shall have the authority to control all aspects of [outside counsel\u2019s] handling of the litigation ... [and][s]uch authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>shall be final, sole and unreviewable.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Outside counsel\u2019s responsibilities are also enumerated in the Contract as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-4\">\u201cA. Coordinate closely with the Attorney General regarding all aspects of this Contract and the legal remedies authorized thereby;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-5\">\u201cB. Represent the State in any lawsuits filed to: (a) recover federal and State medical assistance payments paid or to be paid under both the federal Medicaid Program and the now discontinued State-only Medical Assistance Program (collectively, \u2018Medicaid Payments\u2019), and in addition, any other types of expenditures made by or on behalf of the State for tobacco related illnesses, including health insurance coverage for State employees. The recovery sought under this Contract will be for medical services rendered or to be rendered to Medicaid recipients and other State employees with tobacco related illnesses. Recovery for additional ancillary expenditures may also be sought as part of the litigation; and (b) recover damages or other monies pursuant to consumer protection, common law fraud, or any other legal theories relating to tobacco-related damages. This representation responsibility shall include acting on behalf of the State in all legal and administrative matters, including all levels of appeal, arising out of or in conjunction with the [tjobacco [ljitigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-6\">\u201cC. Initially bear and be solely responsible for all expenses (filing, legal, expert witness and otherwise) and all other costs of the [tjobacco [ljitigation, subject to reimburse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>ment only in the event of a recovery, and to any limitations imposed by law or the rules of the Maryland Bar, which are the subject of this Contract, and for all employee salaries and all nature of office expenses incurred by or on behalf of [outside counsel].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-4\">\u201cD. Provide copies to the Attorney General of all correspondence received or sent out, all legal pleadings filed or received, and shall in ail other appropriate ways keep the Attorney General aware of the status of any lawsuits brought pursuant to this Contract;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-5\">\u201cE. Shall, in the event of a successful recovery, prepare and provide a final accounting at the conclusion of all related legal proceedings, including all appeals, in the manner and form required by the Attorney General;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">\u201cF. Perform all legal services necessary, as determined by the Attorney General, to successfully litigate on behalf of the State, its claims against the tobacco industry;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">\u201cG. Use its best efforts to obtain all relevant discovery materials from existing and future tobacco litigation, and work with other law firms and attorneys cooperatively to achieve such goals; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-8\">\u201cH. Subject to the overall direction and supervision of responsible State government officials, retain and supervise all manpower necessary to permit this litigation to proceed without significantly impairing the ability of the involved State agencies to meet their ongoing governmental obligations. In this regard, [outside counsel] will retain at its sole expense sufficient manpower (including, but not limited to, clerical, data management, paralegals, software and data processing consultant) to meet the overall needs of the [t]obacco Mitigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">\u00b6 2.1 A through H. The State, through the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, is obligated to appoint one full-time administrative staff person to work with outside counsel as project coordinator. \u00b6 2.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">According to the Contract, compensation of outside counsel is contingent upon the State\u2019s recovery; outside counsel will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>receive compensation if and only if a money judgment is obtained as a result of the tobacco litigation. With respect to the fee, the Contract provides that outside counsel \u201cwill be paid a fee of 25% of the recovered funds plus the reasonable expenses of litigation incurred.\u201d \u00b6 3.1. If no damages are recovered, the Attorney General and the State will owe nothing to outside counsel. \u00b6 3.2. In the event of the r\u00e9covery of damages, the Contract provides for the method of payment. That provision requires outside counsel to proceed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFG\">\u201cA. Hold any monies received as a result of any settlement, legal final judgment, or as a bond, in an interest bearing account in a financial institution acceptable to the State ... and in a joint account bearing the names of both [outside] counsel and the State as account-holders. It is further understood and agreed that contingency fee payments and percentages shall be computed solely on the basis of the total amount of monies actually recovered and transmitted together with all accrued interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-4\">\u201cB. Within thirty (30) days of the earliest legally permissible date, release and transmit any and all monies recovered to the State to the Attorney General, net of costs and fees allowed under this Contract as determined by the Attorney General, pursuant to his instructions, including interest accrued thereon; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABl\">\u201cC. Shall prepare and submit to the Attorney General an itemized computation of the contingency fee and expenses, in a manner and form acceptable to the State auditors, in advance of the payment referred to in paragraph B above.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">\u00b6 3.3. Hence, after outside counsel collects 25% of the gross judgment amount, in addition to reasonable attorneys\u2019 expenses, the remaining amount, 75% of the gross recovery less attorneys\u2019 expenses, is the State\u2019s collection,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which is trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>mitted to the Attorney General, who, by law, must deposit the collected funds into the State Treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">All terms and provisions of the Contract were negotiated and agreed to by the Attorney General and outside counsel. In addition, members of the Board of Public Works, namely, the Governor, Treasurer and Comptroller, also approved and signed the Contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">On January 22,1996, in the Circuit Court for Talbot County, several tobacco manufacturers and tobacco-related companies, (hereinafter, the \u201cappellants\u201d),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> filed an action for declaratory and injunctive relief against Governor Parris N. Glendening, Attorney General J. Joseph Curran, Jr. and Secretary of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Martin P. Wasserman, (hereinafter, collectively, the \u201cappellees\u201d), challenging the legality of the Contract.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Soon thereafter, the parties filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>cross motions for summary judgment. The appellants contended that the Contract, which authorizes outside counsel to institute and prosecute an action on behalf of the State primarily against tobacco manufacturers for reimbursement of public funds expended to provide health care for tobacco-related illnesses,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is invalid because the Attorney General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>lacks constitutional or statutory authority to compensate outside counsel on a contingent fee basis. Specifically, they argued that, because the underlying tobacco litigation sought reimbursement for the expenditure of \u201cpublic funds,\u201d any recovery would constitute \u201cState funds,\u201d <em>in tato </em>and, as such, expenditures thereof must be authorized by a specific legislative appropriation. There has not been any such appropriation enacted by the General Assembly in this case, they pointed out. The appellants further argued that the Contract violates due process and public policy because it provides outside counsel with an improper financial stake in the outcome of the underlying litigation potentially, four billion dollars, 25% of the sixteen billion dollars recovery sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The appellees countered, arguing that the Attorney General, with the Governor\u2019s permission, has the constitutional and statutory authority to retain outside counsel on a contingent fee basis, in order to pursue a suit of significant public interest on behalf of the State. Furthermore, the appellees maintained, the contingency fee contract does not violate the appellants\u2019 due process rights because the Attorney General, the state official with the \u201cfinal, sole and unreviewable\u201d authority to control all aspects of the litigation, has no personal or pecuniary interest in the outcome of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Unpersuaded by the appellants\u2019 arguments, the circuit court first found that, pursuant to Maryland Code (1984, 1995 RepLVol., 1997 Supp.) section 6-105(b) of the State Government Article, the underlying tobacco litigation was \u201cextraordinary.\u201d It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-4\">\u201cUnder the circumstances of the case at bar, the court is satisfied that the underlying lawsuit is \u2018extraordinary\u2019 within the meaning of the term in Section 6-105(b). The State seeks, <em>inter alia, </em>billions of dollars in compensation for its costs of providing medical assistance, including Medicaid benefits, to Maryland residents who are suffering from alleged tobacco-related illnesses. Furthermore, Defendants face unusually wealthy and powerful opponents. For these reasons, the underlying litigation qualifies as \u2018extraordinary.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The trial court then analyzed the language and context of section 6-105(b) and found that the plain language of subsection (b)(2)(ii) did not place any limitation on the source of the funds from which the Attorney General may compensate outside counsel. Consequently, the court \u201cdecline[d] to read . the provision to bar affirmatively the Attorney General from entering into a contingentrfee contract with private counsel. To so construe an unambiguous provision, would be to adopt an overly rigid interpretation that would limit unreasonably the scope of its operation.\u201d Regarding the appellants\u2019 due process argument, .the trial court simply was \u201cnot convinced ... that [outside] counsel\u2019s financial incentive to prevail in the underlying [tobacco] litigation is incongruous with the obligation to do justice.\u201d The court reasoned, \u201cAlthough the Attorney General probably will not direct each aspect of the daily handling of the lawsuit and will ask contingent-fee counsel for advice concerning litigation strategy, counsel plainly will not enjoy boundless discretion in his pursuit of the litigation.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court denied the appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and entered judgment in favor of the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The appellants timely filed a Notice of Appeal to the Court of Specials Appeal. On our own motion, and before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>intermediate appellate court considered the matter, we issued a writ of <em>certiorari. </em>In this Court, the appellants, asserting essentially the same points they argued below, make the following two contentions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\"><em>\u201cFirst, </em>any money that the State might recover in the [tobacco] litigation would be <em>State </em>funds, which must by law be deposited <em>in their entirety </em>in the State Treasury. Once such funds are deposited in the State Treasury, they may only be withdrawn or disbursed by means of an appropriation by the General Assembly. The Contingent Fee Contract flatly contradicts these basic constitutional and statutory requirements by committing the State to pay twenty-five percent of any funds recovered however large that amount may be directly to private counsel, without any appropriation by the General Assembly. <em>Second, </em>the Contingent Fee Contract violates due process and public policy by giving counsel for the State a massive personal stake in the Reimbursement Litigation, creating both the appearance and the reality of bias and corrupting the fair and impartial administration of justice by the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">The appellants argue that the Contract is illegal because \u201c[a]ny recovery in the [underlying tobacco] [litigation would constitute <em>in its entirety </em>State funds,\u201d which must be deposited in the State Treasury and may only be withdrawn or disbursed by legislative appropriation, (emphasis in original). In support of that argument, the appellants first maintain, citing <em>Baylin v. United States, </em>43 F.3d 1451 (Fed.Cir.1995), that the client, not the attorney, \u201cretains ownership interest in the entire recovery, including the contingency fee portion.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Hence, they posit, \u201cit is the State and <em>not </em>its attorneys which owns and retains all rights to any recovery in the [tobacco] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Mitigation.\u201d (emphasis added). This is true, the appellants assert, \u201ceven though ... the State argues that it may never actually take possession of the contingent fee portion of the recovery, and even though ... the State has assigned a portion of its potential recovery to [outside counsel] prior to knowing if and how much it may recover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The appellants further argue that the contingency fee arrangement provided in the Contract constitutes an unlawful appropriation of State funds, as both the constitutionally- and statutorily-based budgetary laws of Maryland require all monies collected on behalf of the State to be deposited in the Treasury. They point to Article VI, Section 3 of the Maryland Constitution, which states that \u201c[t]he Treasurer shall receive the moneys of the State, and until otherwise prescribed by law, deposit them, as soon as received, to the credit of the State,\u201d and to Maryland Code (1985,1995 Repl.Vol.) section 6-213(a) of the- State Finance &amp; Procurement Article, which similarly states that, \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided by law, each unit of the State government monthly shall: (1) pay into the State Treasury all collections, fees, income, and other revenues that are received by the unit; [and] (2) account to the Comptroller for those revenues.\u201d In addition, the appellants argue that Maryland law prohibits State officials from disbursing or obligating State funds without an appropriation, a distinctly legislative act. <em>See </em>Md. Const. Art. Ill, \u00a7 32 (\u201cNo money shall be drawn from the Treasury of the State, by any order or resolution, nor except in accordance with an appropriation by Law.\u201d); Md.Code (1985, 1995 Repl.Vol., 1997 Supp.) \u00a7 7-205 of the State Fin. &amp; . Proc. Article (\u201cMoney may be disbursed from the State Treasury only in accordance with the current appropriation for a program----\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The appellants also argue that the Contract violates section 7-234 of the State Finance and Procurement Article, which provides that \u201c[a]n officer or unit of the State government may not spend money: (1) in excess of the total appropriation to the officer or unit; or (2) in excess of the amounts set forth in the current schedule for apportionment and disbursement of the appropriation.\u201d The appellants reason that section 7-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>234 has been violated because \u201c[u]nder the terms of the Contingent Fee Contract, as soon as the State began receiving services from [outside counsel], it became obligated to pay that firm twenty-five percent of any amount ultimately recovered in the [tobacco litigation].\u201d The Contract, they postulate, effectively ties the hands of the General Assembly and the Governor, by committing the State to spend money before there has been an appropriation. Quoting an Opinion of the Attorney General, the appellants assert that \u201c \u00a7 7-234 is intended to prevent such a diminution of the Governor\u2019s discretion about resource allocation.\u201d Md. Op. Att\u2019y Gen. No. 91-049, 1991 WL 626536 at 4 (Nov. 12,1991).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">In response to the appellants\u2019 arguments, the appellees contend, as the trial court found below, that a proper analysis of this case begins with the authority of the Office of the Attorney General, not with the constitutional and statutory laws governing fiscal policies. They argue that the Attorney General has clear constitutional and statutory authority to employ outside counsel in the capacity of an \u201cassistant counsel\u201d in extraordinary cases such as the underlying tobacco litigation. They assert that \u201c[t]he Attorney General, acting at the Governor\u2019s direction, plainly has the constitutional power under Article V, Section 3, of the Maryland Constitution, to initiate a civil suit in the interest of the State.\u201d Further, section 6-105 of the State Government Article \u201cprovides the Attorney General with substantial flexibility in determining how ... special assistant counsel may be compensated, and conditions the Attorney General\u2019s exercise of his authority only on the approval of the Governor.\u201d They add, \u201cNothing in section 6-105(b) suggests or implies that a contingent fee arrangement could not constitute \u2018proper compensation\u2019 within the meaning of the statute.\u201d Next, the appellees contend that there is no requirement that the gross recovery from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>tobacco litigation must be first deposited in the State Treasury and then, pursuant to specific appropriation, withdrawn to compensate outside counsel. Such a requirement, they argue, \u201cwould thus call into question the State\u2019s ability to engage outside bond counsel, as well as other situations where the State retains and pays outside counsel.\u201d Finally, the appellees argue, \u201cassuming that ... the State already \u2018owns\u2019 the funds that would ultimately be used to pay [outside counsel], there is no question that the Board of Public Works can approve an agreement disposing of that \u2018property of the State\u2019 as long as the State receives adequate consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">In Maryland, contingency fee agreements are commonplace in the practice of law, and, generally, are not illegal or viewed with a jaundiced eye. <em>See </em>Md. Rule of Prof. Conduct 1.5(c) and (d) (contingent fees are permissible, except in domestic and criminal defense cases).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, in determining whether the subject contingency fee arrangement between the Attorney General and outside counsel is valid, we, as the court below observed, \u201cfirst must examine the sources of the Attorney General\u2019s powers\u201d to enter into such an arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">In 1984, in <em>State v. Burning Tree Club, </em>301 Md. 9, 481 A.2d 785 (1984), we chronicled the constitutional provisions relative to the Attorney General and concluded that the Attorney General \u201cpossesses no common law powers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33, 481 A.2d at 797; <em>see also Murphy v. Yates, </em>276 Md. 475, 480-84, 348 A.2d 837, 840-42 (1975). Rather, \u201cthe Attorney General of Maryland has only such powers as are vested in him by the Constitution of Maryland and the various enactments of the General Assembly of Maryland.\u201d <em>Burning Tree Club, </em>301 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>at 32, 481 A.2d at 797. Article V, Section 3 of the Maryland Constitution, for example, provides, in pertinent part, that the Attorney General shall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-4\">\u201c(2) Investigate, commence, and prosecute or defend any civil or criminal suit or action or category of such suits or actions in any of the Federal Courts or in any Court of the State, or before administrative agencies and quasi legislative bodies, on the part of the State or in which the State may be interested, which the General Assembly by law or joint resolution, or the Governor shall have directed or shall direct to be investigated, commenced, and prosecuted or defended.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Md.Code (1912, 1981 Repl.Vol., 1997 Supp.) Const. Art. V, \u00a7 3(a)(2); <em>see also In re Special Investigation No. 244, </em>296 Md. 80, 87, 459 A.2d 1111 (1983). That section also provides that \u201c[t]he Attorney General shall have and perform any other duties and possess any other powers, and appoint the number of deputies or assistants, as the General Assembly from time to time may prescribe by law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 3(b). One such law, which the appellees contend the Attorney General relied upon in the instant case, is section 6-105(b) of the State Government Article. That section explicitly sets forth the terms and conditions under which the Attorney General may retain a private attorney as an \u201cassistant counsel.\u201d Section 6-105 (b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\">\u201c(b) <em>Special employment. </em>(1) In addition to any other staff appointed under this section, the Attorney General, with the written approval of the Governor, may employ any assistant counsel that the Attorney General considers necessary to carry out any duty of the Office in an extraordinary or unforeseen case or in special county work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-7\">\u201c(2) The Attorney General shall submit to the Governor a written request that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-8\">\u201c(i) states the necessity of and each reason for the special employment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>\u201c(ii) states the proposed compensation and its source or certifies that the Attorney General cannot ascertain in advance the proper compensation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-4\">\u201c(3) Compensation that cannot be ascertained in advance may be agreed on or adjusted later.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Md.Code (1984, 1995 Repl.Vol., 1997 Supp.) \u00a7 6-105 of the State Gov. Article. This statutory provision has been neither significantly changed by the Legislature nor interpreted by this Court since its enactment in 1916. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1957 Vol.), Article 32A, \u00a7 11; 1916 Maryland Laws, ch. 560, \u00a7 9.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Needless to say, however, section 6-105(b) clearly authorizes the Attorney General to retain outside counsel, and, more important, establishes requirements (1) the Attorney General\u2019s determination that the case is an extraordinary, unforeseen or a special county work case, (2) the Attorney General\u2019s written request, and (3) the Governor\u2019s approval that must be satisfied before the Attorney General may enter into a \u201cspecial employment\u201d agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">In the instant case, the Attorney General determined, and the Governor, along with other members of the Board of Public Works, agreed that the tobacco litigation was \u201cextraordinary,\u201d as it was \u201cprohibitively expensive\u201d for the State to finance a lawsuit seeking billions of dollars from \u201cunusually wealthy and powerful opponents.\u201d Furthermore, the Attorney General determined that handling the tobacco litigation would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>undoubtedly require a significant commitment of State personnel and financial resources from the Office of the Attorney General and other departments of State government. The enormity of the tobacco litigation is evident from the thirteen-count complaint the State filed against fourteen tobacco manufacturer and tobacco-related companies, alleging various violations of the Maryland Consumer Protection and Antitrust Acts and numerous tort claims.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>In this case, we will not review and, therefore, not disturb the Attorney General\u2019s and the Governor\u2019s determination of extraordinariness, which, pursuant to section 6-105(b), was a decision within their discretionary authority. <em>See United States v. George S.

On March 20, 1996, the Attorney General submitted a written request to the Governor, seeking authorization \u201cto retain outside counsel to assist the State in seeking the recovery of significant State costs from the tobacco industry.\u201d In compliance with the statute, the Attorney General explained that the tobacco litigation \u201cwill be prolonged and expensive, and the most-effective means of advancing the State\u2019s interest is by hiring outside counsel on a contingency basis.\u201d He further explained that \u201c[fjunding for the payment of tobacco counsel services will be obtained from the proceeds of any recovery to the State.\u201d The Governor subsequently approved the request, and thus, pursuant to the dictates of section 6-105(b), the Attorney General certainly was authorized to retain outside \u201cassistant counsel\u201d in connection with the tobacco litigation. <em>See In re Special Investigation No. 244, </em>296 Md. at 87-88, 459 A.2d at 1114-15 (Attorney General was fully vested with the power to pursue investigation of medicaid fraud pursuant to authorization in series of letters from Governor); <em>Bomhardt v.

In fact, section 6-105(b) is a rather procedurally rigid statute, and the only matter covered by it which is subject to the Attorney General\u2019s discretion is the proper compensation of assistant counsel. The appellants, however, argue that any interpretation of section 6-105(b) which authorizes the Attorney General to compensate outside counsel on a contingency basis conflicts with both Article III, Section 32 of the Maryland Constitution, which \u201cexpressly prohibits the Attorney General, and other State officials and agencies, from spending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>any State funds here any moneys recovered in the [tobacco] litigation without an appropriation,\u201d and section 6-213 of the Finance and Procurement Article which establishes that \u201c[t]he Attorney General has a clear statutory obligation to deposit the entire recovery within a month of its receipt with the Treasury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">We find that the language of section 6-105(b) permits the Attorney General to enter into a contingency fee contract.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Section 6-105(b) does not conflict with Article III, Section 32 of the Constitution, which pertains to \u201can appropriation\u201d and to money \u201cdrawn from the Treasury,\u201d not money that has yet to be deposited into the State Treasury. As the trial court observed, citing <em>Bayne v. Secretary of State, </em>283 Md. 560, 570, 392 A.2d 67, 72 (1978), \u201can \u2018appropriation\u2019 constitutes an authorization to withdraw <em>from the </em>Treasury.\u201d As we explained in <em>Dorsey v. Petrott, </em>178 Md. 230, 13 A.2d 630 (1940):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">\u201can appropriation of public funds is made by a constitutional mandate or a lawful legislative act whose primary object is to authorize the withdrawal from the state treasury of a certain sum for a specified public object or purpose to which such sum is applied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 245, 13 A.2d at 637-38. <em>See also Kelly v. Marylanders for Sports Sanity Inc., </em>310 Md. 437, 458-59, 530 A.2d 245, 255-56 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">As for section 6-213, it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-9\">\u201c(a) <em>Monthly accounting. </em>Except as otherwise provided by law, each unit of the State government monthly shall: \u201c(1) pay into the State Treasury <em>all collections, fees, income, and other revenues that are received by the unit. </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-b\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>(emphasis supplied). The gross settlement or judgment recovered from the tobacco litigation does not constitute \u201ccollections, fees, incomes, [or] other revenues\u201d that must be deposited into the State Treasury. According to the Contract, recovered funds will not be \u201ccollected\u201d by the State until outside counsel receives his contingency fee and is compensated his expenses from the gross recovery. <em>See </em>Contract \u00b6 3.3. The Contract provides that the gross recovery of the tobacco litigation will be deposited into a \u201cjoint account bearing the names of both [outside counsel] and the State as account-holders.\u201d Contract, \u00b6 3.3(A). At that time, outside counsel will receive his contingency fee 25% of the gross recovery and will also be compensated reasonable expenses. After this occurrence or within 30 days of receipt of the funds, \u201call monies recovered to the State, net costs and fees\u201d will be transmitted to the Attorney General, who will collect and deposit the funds on behalf of the State. Once the net recovery is collected and deposited into the State Treasury, it thus becomes State funds subject to legislative appropriation, pursuant to Article III, Section 32, which provides that \u201c[n]o money shall be <em>drawn from, the Treasury </em>of the State ... except in accordance with an appropriation by Law.\u201d (emphasis supplied). Thus, the gross recovery from the tobacco litigation is not \u201cState\u201d or \u201cpublic\u201d money subject to legislative appropriation until the State has fulfilled its obligation under the Contract, collected the recovery, net of the contingency fee and litigation expenses, and deposited the funds into the State Treasury. Compare <em>Meredith v. Ieyoub, </em>700 So.2d -478, 484-88 (La.1997), where a divided Supreme Court of Louisiana held invalid a contingency fee contract executed between the Attorney General and private attorneys to represent the State in environmental law enforcement actions. The statute governing recoveries from environment protection actions provided: \u201cAll sums recovered through judgment, settlements, assessment of civil or criminal penalties [and] funds recovered by suit or settlement ... shall be paid into the state treasury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>700 So.2d at 482. It was on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>basis that the statute was \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d and that the majority reached the result it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Dissenting, Chief Justice Calogero wrote: \u201cI believe that in this case, a reasonable interpretation of the sum \u2018recovered\u2019 by the client ... is the amount of the judgment or settlement less the contingency fee, just as the amount of property taxes recovered by a sheriff is the amount collected less the commissions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 485. Similarly, another dissenting judge, Judge Lemmon, noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-6\">\u201cWhile plaintiffs argue that only the Legislature has the power to dispose of property belonging to the state, a disputed legal claim is a unique type of property in that its value can only be realized through a legal settlement or litigation. Once the value of the state\u2019s disputed claims is realized through settlement or judgment, the money or property ultimately recovered for the state by its constitutionally authorized officer, after deduction of the costs of recovery, is the property that the Legislature has the exclusive power to dispose of.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 488 (footnote omitted). Judge Johnson also dissented from the majority\u2019s opinion, however, without a written opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">Although section 6-105(b) does not specifically state that the Attorney General may enter into a \u201ccontingency fee contract,\u201d by its terms \u201c[cjompensation that cannot be ascertained in advance may be agreed on or adjusted later\u201d there is a strong indication that the Legislature did not intend to impose strict conditions under which assistant counsel may be specially employed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Rather, the Legislature sought to provide the Attorney General with, and indeed achieved, a reasonable degree of flexibility in determining when and how special assistant counsel ought to be employed and paid, subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>the Governor\u2019s oversight. <em>See </em>McLCode (1988, 1995 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 13-107 of the State Fin. <em>&amp; </em>Proc. Article.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The appellants\u2019 second and final contention is that the contingency fee contract violates due process and public policy. Specifically, they maintain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">\u201c[T]he Contingent Fee Contract creates an improper motivation for [outside counsel] as lawyer for the State. [Outside' counsel] has an overwhelming financial interest to seek maximum possible money damages irrespective of the interests of justice [and] public policy. This financial interest is at odds with the duty of a public official and the fair and impartial administration of justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Appellants urge this Court to be guided by the principle we recognized in <em>Montgomery County Bd. of Appeals v. Walker, </em>228 Md. 574, 180 A.2d 865 (1962). In that case, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAp\">\u201cInfluences which could affect the mind of one in a position of public trust are so subtle and difficult to appreciate, that in the end our decision must be guided by the general principle that no public officer who has a personal or pecuniary interest, direct or indirect, in the outcome of a case should participate in that matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 580, 180 A.2d at 868. <em>See also Sinclair v. State, </em>278 Md. 243, 254, 363 A.2d 468, 475 (1976). Citing <em>Young v. United States ex. rel. Vuitton Et Fils S.A, </em>481 U.S. 787, 804, 107 S.Ct. 2124, 2136, 95 L.Ed.2d 740 (1987), appellants further maintain that this principle equally applies when a private attorney is specially retained by the State as an assistant counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Instructive of the proper application of the above-stated principle to the instant case, the appellants argue, is <em>People ex. rel. Clancy v. Superior Court, </em>705 P.2d 347, 39 Cal.3d 740, 218 Cal.Rptr. 24 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1121, 106 S.Ct. 1638, 90 L.Ed.2d 184 (1986). In that case, the Supreme Court of California, on grounds of public policy, invalidated a contingency fee contract that the City of Corona entered into with outside counsel to bring abatement actions on behalf of the municipality under a public nuisance ordinance regulating adult bookstores. The Court disqualified outside counsel because \u201cthe abatement of public nuisance involves a balancing of interests,\u201d which included (1) the public\u2019s interest in ridding the city of a dangerous condition, (2) the landowner\u2019s interest in using his property, (3) the landowner\u2019s First Amendment interest in selling protected material, and (4) the public\u2019s interest in having such materials available for purchase. <em>Clancy, </em>705 P.2d at 352, 39 Cal.3d at 749, 218 CaLRptr. at 29. The court also observed that \u201c[p]ublic nuisance abatement actions share the public interest aspect of eminent domain and criminal cases, and often coincide with criminal prosecutions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(\u201cA person who maintains or commits a public nuisance is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d). \u201cThis connection between the civil and criminal aspects of public nuisance law,\u201d the court said, \u201csupports the need for a neutral prosecuting attorney.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353, 39 Cal.3d at 749, 218 Cal.Rptr. at 30. Thus, \u201cany financial arrangement that would tempt the government attorney [or a representative] to tip the scale cannot be tolerated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353, 39 Cal.3d at 749, 218 Cal.Rptr. at 29. Early in its analysis, however, the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-5\">\u201cNothing we say herein should be construed as preventing the government, under appropriate circumstances, from engaging private counsel. Certainly there are cases in which a government may hire an attorney on a contingent fee to try a civil case.... But just as certainly there is a class of civil actions that demands the representative of government to be absolutely neutral. This requirement precludes the use in such cases of a contingent fee arrangement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 352, 39 Cal.3d at 748, 218 Cal.Rptr. at 29.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Clearly, the instant case is distinguishable from <em>Clancy, </em>as there are no constitutional or criminal violations directly implicated here, and, hence, there is no potential conflict of interest.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Also, and more important, notably absent from <em>Clancy </em>is a legislative enactment authorizing the \u201cspecial employment\u201d of outside counsel in \u201cextraordinary\u201d cases. Equally important, is the absence of the oversight of an elected State official, who \u201cshall have the authority to control all aspects of [outside counsel\u2019s] handling of the litigation,\u201d and whose \u201cauthority shall be final, sole and unreviewable.\u201d Contract at \u00b6 2.1. These, we believe, are significant material distinctions which permit a finding that the instant contingency fee contract is not violative of due process or public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Also, although the principle of impartiality, articulated in <em>Montgomery County Bd. of Appeals v. Walker, </em>is generally applicable to cases concerning public officials, the question of \u201c[w]hether, in a particular case, a disqualifying interest exists, is a factual question and is governed by the circumstances of that case, and the enunciation of a definitive rule is not possible.\u201d <em>Walker, </em>228 Md. at 580, 180 A.2d at 868. <em>Walker </em>is readily distinguishable from the present case. In <em>Walker, </em>Philip Fairbanks, an attorney, later a judge of the Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>Court for Montgomery County, was appointed to fill a vacancy on the five-member Zoning Board. During the evaluation process of an application seeking \u201cspecial exception,\u201d Fairbanks disqualified himself from the matter because he had previously resided in the community where the special exception was sought, he had vigorously opposed the original application, and he had been legal counsel for the apartment house corporation of which one of the applicants is the sole owner. As a result of Fairbanks\u2019 voluntary disqualification, the Board\u2019s vote on the special exception application was a 2-2 split vote. An appeal was taken to the circuit court, which found that Fairbanks failed to show \u201csubstantial or grave reasons\u201d for disqualifying himself and ordered Fairbanks to participate in the vote. On appeal, this Court ruled that, because Fairbanks believed that he could not objectively consider the special exception application, we were in no position to hold otherwise. Clearly, these facts bear no resemblance to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">Finally, the appellants posit that \u201c[pjublic policy requires that an attorney representing the State must be completely unbiased in the exercise of governmental power. Allowing an attorney representing the State to have a direct stake in the [tobacco litigation] ... contravenes this policy.\u201d The Supreme Court of the United States, however, has held that due process does not necessarily preclude a prosecutor from having a personal or financial interest in the outcome of a case seeking civil penalties. In <em>Marshall v. Jerrico, </em>446 U.S. 238, 100 S.Ct. 1610, 64 L.Ed.2d 182 (1980), for example, the issue was whether the reimbursement provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act violated due process by creating an impermissible risk of bias in the Act\u2019s enforcement and administration, as each regional office received a share of the total reimbursements collected. The Supreme Court observed that the functions of the assistant regional administrator, who is charged with enforcing the Act, resemble those of a prosecutor more closely than those of a judge. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-5\">\u201cProsecutors need not be entirely \u2018neutral and detached\u2019 ____ In an adversary system, they are necessarily permit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>ted to be zealous in their enforcement of the law. The constitutional interests in accurate finding of facts and application of law, and in preserving a fair and open process for decision, are not to the same degree implicated if it is the prosecutor, and not the judge, who is offered an incentive for securing civil penalties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">446 U.S. at 248, 100 S.Ct. at 1616, 64 L.Ed.2d at 192. The Supreme Court, however, refrained from establishing \u201cwith precision what limits there may be on a financial or personal interest of one who performs a prosecutorial function.\u201d In the present case, we hold that outside counsel\u2019s interest in the outcome in the tobacco litigation, subject to the oversight of the Attorney General, does not exceed reasonable limits of a private attorney performing a prosecutorial function.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR TALBOT COUNTY AFFIRMED, WITH COST TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-11\">.

The comment to Rule 1.5 of the Rules of Professional Conduct defines a contingent fee arrangement as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-9\">\"an agreement for legal services (1) made before the services are completed, and (2) providing compensation of the lawyer which is contingent in whole or in part upon the successful accomplishment or disposition of the legal matter and which is either in a fixed amount or in an amount determined under a specified formula.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b714-7\">.

No such additional assistant shall be employed unless the written request from the Attorney-General to the Governor therefor shall state the necessity and reasons for such special employment, the compensation to be paid, and the source or fund from which the same is to paid. If in any case the Attorney-General cannot ascertain in advance the proper compensation to be paid for such services, he shall so certify to the Governor, and in such case the compensation may be left for future agreement or adjustment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">1916 Maryland Laws, ch. 560, \u00a7 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b715-5\">. The Complaint alleges the appellants committed a \"host of fraudulent and unlawful acts,\" including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\">\"Publicly undertaking, as a paramount special responsibility, the duty of researching and disclosing to public health authorities and the public the full extent of the health risks of cigarette smoking, then setting about to do everything in their power to subvert real scientific research, including suppressing, concealing, distorting, and lying about the state of their knowledge of those risks;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-7\">\"Creating and funding fraudulent organizations as \u2018fronts\u2019 (so described by the tobacco companies), such as the Tobacco Industry Research Council (later the Council for Tobacco Research), which was held out to the public as an independent research organization, but which was in fact secretly controlled by lawyers and public relations firms, to prevent the public from learning what Defendants knew about the health risks of smoking:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-8\">\"Secretly destroying, concealing, and shipping overseas incriminating evidence of industry testing and research on the health risks of cigarette smoking and the addictive nature of nicotine, shutting down laboratories overnight and making personal threats against scientists who tried to publish research revealing what the industry knew, and asserting bogus claims of attorney-client privilege and work product to conceal their scientific research;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-9\">\"Engaging in unfair and deceptive trade practices by, among other things, jointly sponsoring false, deceptive, and misleading advertising and public relations campaigns intended to confuse and create doubt among governmental entities and the public about the health risks of cigarette smoking;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-10\">\"Jointly and collectively making false and misleading representation to Congress, other governmental entities, and the public regarding the health risks of cigarette smoking, the addictive nature of nicotine, and the manipulation of nicotine levels in cigarettes, with the intent to defraud, and knowing that the State and others would reasonably rely on their representations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-11\">\"Conspiring to use monopoly power, and using that power, to suppress research, development, marketing, and sales of \u2018safer\u2019 cigarettes; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-12\">\"Engaging in unfair trade practices by targeting marketing and advertising efforts to promote illegal sales of cigarettes to minors, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>developing products and deceptive advertising campaigns designed to appeal to African-Americans and women.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b717-7\">. In 1989, the opinion of the Attorney General\u2019s Office was requested on the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-8\">\"Is there sufficient authority under law in Maryland for the Attorney General or for some other authority at the State or county level to retain private counsel for debt collection purposes, including litiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>tion, with payment to be made from dollars recovered or is legislation needed?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">74 Md. Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 136 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">The Attorney General observed that a contingent arrangement, \"in effect, contracts away a share of the claimed sum in exchange for the attorney\u2019s services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140. Relying on previously published opinions, the Attorney General also observed that because \"[a] debt to the State is a species of State property,\u201d <em>id. </em>(citing 62 Md. Op. Atty.

Reviewing section 6-105(b), the Attorney General opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-8\">\"The portions of ... subsection [16\u2014105(b)] that deal with compensation contemplate that the amount of an outside lawyer's fee ordinarily is to be fixed in advance.

No specific mention is made of contingent fees, which leave the dollar amount uncertain although they entail a specific contractual agreement that the State will accept some percentage less than the full amount of its recovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-9\">\"This provision falls short of providing sufficient authority for the Attorney General to contract away a portion of property asserted to belong to the State.

Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 136 (1989). The State, however, argues that, although the Attorney General obtained (probably as a precautionary measure) the approval of the Board of Public Works, \"section 6-105, read in its entirely strongly implies that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>Board of Public Works approval would <em>not </em>have been necessary\u201d to hire outside counsel, (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b719-11\">. We expressly reserve the issue of whether section 6-105(b) provides sufficient authority for the Attorney General to enter into a contingency fee contract without the express approval of the Board of Public Works. Needless to say, here, the written approval of the Board was sought and obtained.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b721-9\">. Adoption of the appellants\u2019 position would not only unduly <em>limit </em>the ability of all units of the State to contract with private attorneys for legal services without prior legislative appropriation, but it would also prohibit the State from settling a lawsuit for less money than was originally sought. For certain, this is not the intended consequence of Maryland's budgetary scheme.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b722-9\">. The Legislature has given the Attorney General oversight authority over a procurement officer of a unit of State Government who intends to \"enter into a sole source procurement contract to obtain the services of a contractor in connection with: (i) <em>threatened or pending litigation', </em>(ii) appraisal of real property for acquisition by the State; or (iii) collective bargaining.\" Md.Code (1988, 1995 Repl.
