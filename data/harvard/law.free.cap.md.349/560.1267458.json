Finding in favor of Aurelia Loveman, Guardian for the Estate of Joseph Loveman, appellee, the circuit court held that an exemption provision for health care projects in existence prior to the 1978 enactment of a comprehensive health planning statute was a right that attached to and ran with the land. Accordingly, the circuit court found that the bed rights in dispute belonged to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">We shall reverse the judgment of the circuit court and remand with direction that it affirm the decision of the Maryland Health Resources Planning Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b601-11\">Catonsville Nursing Home (CNH) and the Maryland Health Resources Planning Commission (Commission) appeal from the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County reversing an earlier Commission decision. The Commission had determined that CNH, as the operator and licensee of nursing home services, as opposed to Loveman, as the owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>of the building housing the nursing home operation and CNH\u2019s landlord, held the bed rights in question and, accordingly, was the entity with authority to seek Commission approval affecting those bed rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">This case has a lengthy procedural history and factual background, which were described in a previous appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. <em>Loveman v. Catonsville Nursing Home, </em>114 Md.App. 603, 691 A.2d 693 (1996). There that court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">In 1960, Mr. Loveman opened a 98-bed comprehensive care facility at 333 Harlem Lane, in Baltimore County____ [T]he home was operated through a corporation known as Shangri-La Nursing Center, Inc., in which Loveman owned all the stock.... [H]e was the licensee and he ran the home as an owner-operated facility. In 1978, the Legislature enacted a comprehensive health planning law that, among other things, created a health planning and development agency and provided that a health care facility may not be established, relocated, or undergo a change in bed capacity without a certificate of need (CON) issued by that agency. The law exempted from that requirement ... a health care facility, such as that operated by Mr. Loveman, that was in operation before June 1, 1978. That exemption underlies the instant dispute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">Mr. Loveman operated the home through Shangri-La until 1981, when, as a consequence of his being convicted of medicaid fraud, he was required to surrender his nursing home administrator\u2019s license and refrain from participation in the management or operation of a nursing home in Maryland. [In response to that restriction, Loveman leased] the real property and ... personalty used in the operation to one Dexter Case. Case, in turn, assigned his rights to Joseph Kaplan and Benjamin Ashman, who proceeded to operate the home under the name Inglenook Nursing and Convalescent Center [Inglenook]. Both the lease and the assignment were contingent on Kaplan and Ashman obtaining a license to operate the center. That license was issued in September, 1981. [In order to qualify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>for that license, Inglenook was issued its own certificate of need.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-4\">In 1987, the Center was acquired by Evergreen Health Group, Inc. In December, 1987, Loveman and Evergreen entered into a new four-year lease for the facility, with a six-year renewal option and an option to purchase. HRPC (the successor agency to the Health Planning and Development Agency) concluded that, as there would be no change in services or bed capacity, the acquisition was exempt from CON review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Evergreen eventually exercised the option to renew. Although it is not clear from the record before us, we assume that Evergreen obtained either a new license to operate the home or an approved assignment of the license that had been issued to Kaplan and Ashman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">In November, 1990, Evergreen assigned its lease to appellee, Catonsville Nursing Home, Inc. (CNH). Included in the assignment was Evergreen\u2019s nursing home license, although the assignment was made expressly contingent on (1) approval by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene of the transfer of the license, and (2) a determination by HRPC that a CON was not required to complete the transaction. As in 1987, the Commission, assured that there would be no change in services or bed capacity, determined that the acquisition was exempt from CON review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">... Although not clearly articulated in the briefs or the papers filed below, it is evident that what appellant fears is that, near or upon expiration of the current lease, CNH will seek permission from HRPC to transfer the beds to another location, that the Commission may grant that request by issuing a CON, and that Loveman will then be left in the position of being unable to lease his property to another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>licensee unless that licensee obtains a new CON to replace the bed capacity that was moved.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">114 Md.App. at 605-07, 691 A.2d at 694-95 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">On remand from the Court of Special Appeals, the Commission, in its Final Decision on Petition for Declaratory Relief,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> framed the issue as \u201cwhich entity\u2014the licensee or the owner of the bricks and mortar of a nursing home\u2014has the right to request Commission approvals regarding that nursing home[?]\u201d The Commission resolved the issue by determining \u201cthat CNH as the lessee and operator of the facility\u2014rather than Loveman as the owner of the bricks and mortar\u2014has the right to seek Commission approvals affecting the comprehensive care facility beds currently being operated as Catonsville Community Convalescent Center.\u201d Loveman argued to the Commission, to the circuit court, and now to this Court, that the bed rights in question, which are derived from the right to operate a health care project as provided in a CON or exemption, run with the land because the physical facility itself was exempted from obtaining a CON when the new statutory scheme was enacted by Chapter 911 of the Maryland Session Laws of 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The circuit court agreed with Loveman and disagreed with the Commission\u2019s finding that the CON and its concomitant bed rights belonged to CNH, stating in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">When the health planning statute was enacted in 1978 and Shangri-La was permitted by the legislature to continue to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>operate beds without a showing of need, that right attached to the land. The ... right so created is analogous to the non-conforming use granted to a gasoline station operating in a residential area before zoning laws....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-4\">... [W]hen Loveman surrendered his license to operate a nursing home, only his individual fitness to operate the beds was being impugned. The right to operate beds without further application to the [C]ommission was the expression of the legislature\u2019s determination that the geographic distribution of beds existing in 1978 was an appropriate starting point for future planning. Accordingly, this right ran, and continues to run, with the land.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Appellants filed a timely notice of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. We issued a writ of certiorari prior to that court\u2019s consideration of the issues raised. Appellant CNH presents the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">I. Did the Maryland Health Resources Planning Commission have substantial evidence to support its conclusion that the right to petition the Commission regarding future use of nursing home beds rested with the licensed health care provider, rather than a mere landlord who was forced to terminate providing nursing home care in 1981 due to a medicaid fraud conviction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APa\">II. Did the circuit court err when it decided, without evidence of such a legislative intent, that nursing home bed rights are a real property interest that \u201cruns with the land,\u201d rather than a transferable license or permit?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvD\">The Commission presents one question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">Did the Maryland Health Resources Planning Commission correctly determine that the licensed nursing home provider tenant, rather than the landlord who has been precluded since 1981 from providing nursing home care due to a medicaid fraud conviction, controls the right to request future Commission approvals for usage of nursing home beds?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">We perceive that the resolution of two questions will resolve all of the questions presented: (1) What is the effect of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>provision of the Laws of Maryland 1978, Chapter 911, which stated that a health care project in operation prior to the effective date of the act was not subject to the act\u2019s prohibition against operating a health care project without a CON? (2) What is the effect of appellee\u2019s acquiescence in the obtention by Inglenook of a new CON in 1981 and appellee\u2019s continued acquiescence since 1981 in the operation of the project pursuant to that CON? Each of these questions are of a legal nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A_5\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Judicial review of an administrative agency\u2019s decision is authorized by Maryland Code (1984, 1995 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-222 of the State Government Article. Under subsection (h), when exercising such review, the court may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">(1) remand the case for further proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">(2) affirm the final decision; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-9\">(3) reverse or modify the decision if any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-10\">(i) is unconstitutional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-11\">(ii) exceeds the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the final decision maker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-12\">(in) results from an unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-13\">(iv) is affected by any other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-14\">(v) is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-15\">(vi) is arbitrary or capricious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-16\">In general,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-17\">[a] court\u2019s role is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number><em>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226, 230 (1994); <em>Ward v. Department of Pub. Safety &amp; Correctional Servs., </em>339 Md. 343, 347, 663 A.2d 66, 67-68 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">Our review of the agency\u2019s factual findings entails only an appraisal and evaluation of the agency\u2019s fact finding and not an independent decision on the evidence. <em>Anderson v. Department of Pub. Safety &amp; Correctional Servs., </em>330 Md. 187, 212, 623 A.2d 198, 210 (1993). This examination seeks to find the substantiality of the evidence. \u201cThat is to say, a reviewing court, be it a circuit court or an appellate court, shall apply the substantial evidence test to the final decisions of an administrative agency....\u201d <em>Baltimore Lutheran High Sch.

Engelman, </em>345 Md. 402, 411, 692 A.2d 474, 479 (1997). Accordingly, we may reverse an administrative decision premised on erroneous legal conclusions. <em>See People\u2019s Counsel v. Maryland Marine Mfg., </em>316 Md. 491, 497, 560 A.2d 32, 34-35 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">We are also obligated to \u201creview the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to the agency,\u201d since their decisions are <em>prima facie </em>correct and carry with them the presumption of validity. <em>Anderson, </em>330 Md. at 213, 623 A.2d at 211; <em>Bulluck, </em>283 Md. at 513, 390 A.2d at 1124.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>In the case at hand, the circuit court misconstrued the exemption provision provided in the Health Planning and Development Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">B. Statutory Interpretation</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of those who framed or adopted the statute. <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 35, 660 A.2d 423, 429 (1995). The intention of the legislature must be sought first in the actual languag\u00e9 of the statute. <em>Marriott Employees Fed. Credit Union v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>346 Md. 437, 444-45, 697 A.2d 455, 458 (1997); <em>Stanford v. Maryland Police Training &amp; Correctional Comm\u2019n, </em>346 Md. 374, 380, 697 A.2d 424, 427 (1997)(quoting <em>Tidewater v.

A court, in determining legislative intent, must read the language of the statute in context and in relation to all of its provisions and its purpose. <em>Howard Research &amp; Dev. Corp. v. Concerned Citizens for Columbia Concept, </em>297 Md. 357, 364, 466 A.2d 31, 34 (1983). Furthermore, where the statutory language is plain and free from ambiguity and expresses a definite and simple meaning, courts do not normally look beyond the words of the statute itself. <em>Marriott Employees, </em>346 Md. at 445, 697 A.2d at 458; <em>Kaczorowski v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 513, 525 A.2d 628, 632 (1987); <em>Hunt v. Montgomery County, </em>248 Md. 403, 414, 237 A.2d 35, 41 (1968). <em>See also Brodsky v.

Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"A7P\">A. Statutory Scheme</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">This case addresses an issue of first impression in Maryland of whether the exemption from obtaining a CON runs with the land or terminates when the party exempted ceases to use the health care project as a health care project. Accordingly, we must examine Maryland\u2019s Health Planning and Development Act. Because it was derived from federal provisions, we begin our discussion with federal legislative background.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The United States Congress, in an attempt to curb the rising costs of health care across the country, passed the National Health Planning and Resources Development Act of 1974, Pub.L. No. 93-641, 88 Stat. 2225 (1975) (codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300-k-300n-6 (1982)), <em>amended by </em>Health Planning and Resources Development Amendments of 1979, Pub.L. No. 96-79, \u00a7\u00a7 1-129, 93 Stat. 592 (codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300k-300t (1976 &amp; Supp. V 1981)), <em>repealed by </em>Pub.L. No. 99-660 \u00a7 701, 100 Stat. 3743, 3799 (1986)(Federal Act). This act provided substantial federal funding conditioned on a state\u2019s enactment of certain health care planning laws. As relevant to this opinion, the Federal Act required states to implement a state health plan (SHP) and administer a CON program for \u201cnew institutional health services proposed to be offered or developed within the State.\u201d \u00a7 1523(a)(4)(B), 88 Stat. at 2246. The purpose of the CON requirement was to add \u201cteeth\u201d to the Federal Act and to help Congress achieve its goals of limiting skyrocketing health care costs, preventing unnecessary duplication of health facilities and resources, and fostering equal access to quality health care for a reasonable cost. Patrick McGinley, <em>Beyond Health Care Reform: Reconsidering Certificate of Need Laws in a \u201cManaged Competition\u201d System, </em>23 Fla. St. U.L. Rev. 141, 148 (1995). Congress repealed the CON requirements in 1986, apparently because it was \u201ccounterproductive for reforming health care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Many states, however, including Maryland, retained their CON laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>In 1975, the Maryland General Assembly authorized the Governor to implement provisions of the Federal Act. 1975 Md. Laws, Chap. 383. In 1978, the General Assembly, finding that it was a priority of the State to assure equal financial and geographic access to quality health care for all citizens at a reasonable cost, created the Maryland Health Planning and Development Agency and the Maryland Health Resources Planning Commission to carry out the federal and state legislation. 1978 Md. Laws, Chap. 911. <em>See also </em>\u00a7 19\u2014102(a). This bill was codified as Maryland\u2019s Health Planning and Development Act and implemented the laws and the procedures for obtaining a CON.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">Chapter 911 provided an exemption provision from CON requirements for health care projects in existence prior to 1978. The exemption provision stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">59J. Certificate of Need.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">(A) (1) A person or health care facility may not develop, operate, or participate in a health care <em>project </em>unless the state agency has issued a certificate of need for the <em>project.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">(2) This subsection does not apply to a health care <em>project </em>which:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-8\">(I) was not subject to Certificate of Conformance Review as required by Chapter 222 of the Acts of 1968; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-9\">(II) was completed and in operation on or before June 1, 1978. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">Accordingly, those health care projects in operation before June 1, 1978 were exempt from the process of obtaining a CON. The projects were not exempt from other statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">Although this Court has not reviewed in great depth the CON exemption provision of the Health Planning and Development Act, we have had occasion to review the Act\u2019s purpose. We said in <em>Sinai Hospital v. Maryland Health Resources Planning Commission, </em>306 Md. 472, 473, 509 A.2d 1202, 1202 (1986), that under the comprehensive health care statutory framework \u201c[a] priority of this State is \u2018to promote the development of a health care system that provides, for all citizens, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>financial and geographic access to quality health care at a reasonable cost.\u2019 \u201d <em>See also </em>\u00a7 19-102. The Court of Special Appeals has said that the Federal Act upon which Maryland\u2019s CON laws are based \u201cencouraged states to look at the problems of costly maldistribution and excess supply of certain health services and facilities.\u201d <em>Doctors\u2019 Hospital v. Maryland Health Resources Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>65 Md.App. 656, 662, 501 A.2d 1324, 1327 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Maryland\u2019s goals were refined and put into effect by the Commission in the SHP. By statute, the Commission must develop and adopt, at least every five years, an SHP. The SHP must include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-5\">(i) A description of the components that should comprise the health care system;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">(ii) The goals and policies for Maryland\u2019s health care system;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-7\">(iii) Identification of unmet needs, excess services, minimum access criteria, and services to be regionalized;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-8\">(iv) An assessment of the financial resources required and available for the health care system;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-9\">(v) The methodologies, standards, and criteria for certificate of need review; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-10\">(vi) Priority for conversion of acute capacity to alternative uses where appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">\u00a7 19-114(a)(2). In addition, the Commission must adopt \u201cspecifications for the development of local health plans and their coordination with the State health plan.\u201d \u00a7 19-114(b). With respect to the SHP, the Court of Special Appeals, repeating our language from <em>Sinai, </em>stated that its purpose \u201cis to establish an integrated system of care that \u2018assures geographic and financial access to a range of quality health care services at a reasonable cost for all citizens.\u2019\u201d <em>Changing Point, Inc. v. Maryland Health Resources Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>87 Md.App. 150, 155, 589 A.2d 502, 504 (1991) (quoting CO-MAR 10.24.14.02A).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-12\">A CON must be issued consistent with the goals of the SHP. \u00a7 19-118(c)(l). With regard, to the CON provisions, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>United States District Court for the District of Maryland has noted recently that \u201cthe CON requirement serves \u2018to assure an efficient and effective health care system for Maryland. ...\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Community Home Health, </em>984 F.Supp. 374, 381 (D.Md.1997) (quoting <em>Maryland Gen. Hosp. v. Maryland Health Resources Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>103 Md. App. 525, 528, 653 A.2d 1029, 1031, <em>cert. denied, </em>339 Md. 355, 663 A,2d 72 (1995)). Accordingly, the CON requirements are the \u201cteeth\u201d of Maryland\u2019s Health Planning and Development Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">B. Exemption Clause as a Privilege</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">As we noted, <em>supra, </em>section 59J of Chapter 911 provided that a person or health care entity, which included the nursing home then operated by Loveman, could not develop, operate, or participate in a health care project unless the state agency issued a CON for the <em>project. </em>1978 Md. Laws, Chap. 911, \u00a7 59J(A)(1). The bill also provided, however, that the CON requirement provision did not apply to a health care project which \u201cwas completed and in operation on or before June 1, 1978.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 59J(A)(2)(II). Therefore, Loveman\u2019s health care project, the nursing home services he provided at the facility on 333 Harlem Lane, was not automatically granted a CON. The project was, to the extent of its operations as of June 1,1978, exempted <em>from the requirement to then obtain a CON. </em>Our task in this case, therefore, is to interpret this exemption and what the General Assembly intended by allowing health care projects in existence at the time of the statute\u2019s enactment to be exempt from obtaining an otherwise mandatory CON. This is an issue of statutory construction and a question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Nowhere in section 59J of Chapter 911 did the legislature use the word \u201cexempt.\u201d Instead, the provision stated that \u201cthis subsection does not apply to health care projects already operating by June 1, 1978.\u201d The effect of this subsection, however, was to \u201cexempt\u201d those facilities from the requirement to obtain a CON.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 571 (6th ed.1990), as relative to the case at bar, defines exemption as: \u201cFreedom from a general duty or service; immunity from a general burden.\u201d The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 499 (Unabridged ed.1983) defines exemption as \u201cthe act of exempting,\u201d \u201cthe state of being exempted; immunity.\u201d It defines exempt as \u201cto free from an obligation or liability to which others are subject.\u201d These definitions, although not particularly enlightening, do indicate that exemptions typically relieve someone or something of an otherwise mandatory obligation. This definition appears logical and consistent with the statute in that those health care projects in existence prior to June 1, 1978, were relieved of the burden of then obtaining a CON in order to qualify for a license to continue services already provided by the project at that time, whereas new projects were required to obtain a CON from the outset.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Maryland cases addressing exemptions are very limited. Some relate to creditor/debtor actions and statutory exemptions of certain property from execution or other similarly related areas of law. In any of those circumstances, however, the exemptions can be waived. For example, in <em>Lawrence v. Commercial Banking Corp., </em>165 Md. 559, 169 A. 69 (1933), this Court stated relative to a creditor/debtor action: \u201cThe statute was not, we think, intended to have the effect of preventing the ... employee from waiving the advantages accruing to him thereunder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562, 169 A. at 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\"><em>Green v. State, </em>59 Md. 123 (1882), involved a statutory exemption from the requirement that a person sit on jury duty. That statute provided that \u201call persons over seventy years of age ... shall be exempt from attendance as jurors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125. Green had been indicted by a grand jury and convicted by a petit jury of forgery and sought to challenge his conviction because each jury had persons over seventy years of age serving. We disagreed with- Green, holding that the exemption was a privilege capable of waiver. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\">[A]nd in exempting persons over 70, the law makes - a concession of immunity to them in view of their age, and relieves them from duties so long borne and discharged---<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>They are <em>exempted </em>only\u2014that is they are competent but not compellable. The Act of 1858, ch. 139, first exempted persons over 70. Tt says \u201cthey are hereby exempted and relieved from serving as jurors in all cases.\u201d The codifiers have omitted all after the word exempted. The omitted words show most clearly <em>that it was a personal privilege which was </em>accorded,\u2014relief from the duty, if they chose to avail themselves of it. Webster says, \u201cexemption\u201d is \u201cimmunity,\u201d \u201ca privilege,\u201d and illustrates by applying it to military and jury service: \u201cas exemption from military or jury service.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 128 (some emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">There is little other case law in Maryland or elsewhere construing exemptions in other situations. Some jurisdictions that have addressed exemptions have referred to \u201cexemptions\u201d as personal privileges that can be waived. <em>See, e.g., State v. Stunkle, </em>41 Kan. 456, 459, 21 P. 675, 676 (1889) (\u201cExemption is the personal privilege of the party exempted.... [T]he exempt person may ... waive the privilege conferred by law.\u201d); <em>Pugh v. St. Louis Police Relief Ass\u2019n, </em>237 Mo.App, 922, 938, 179 S.W.2d 927, 936 (1944)(\u201cExemption is a personal privilege.\u201d). <em>Accord Rusk v. Rusk, </em>859 S.W.2d 751 (Mo.Ct.App.1993). <em>See also State v. Exxon Corp., </em>676 So.2d 783, 786 (La.Ct.App.1996) (\u201cAn exemption implies a release from some burden, duty or obligation.\u201d(eitation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">We conclude, accordingly, that an exemption in this context generally is personal to the person or entity exempted. In this case, the entity that held the exemption was the health care project and the party operating that health care project: Shangri-La and Loveman, respectively. Like most personal privileges, the exemption can be waived. To the extent the exemption is related to <em>real property, </em>and we do not hold that it is, the exemption would remain a privilege, an incorporeal hereditament that also can be waived and abandoned, as we shall later explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">There is little or no reference to these exemption provisions in the legislative history of either the original Maryland or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Federal Acts. Additionally, our courts have yet to construe this exemption clause. Other states, however, have addressed tangentially the issue and have held that such an exemption provision must be narrowly construed. For instance, the Supreme Court of Georgia construed a similar exemption from the CON requirement under its State Health Planning Act. In <em>Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital v. Roach, </em>267 Ga. 619, 480 S.E.2d 595 (1997), that court was called upon to examine \u201cwhether a mobile cardiac catheterization unit which was ... exempt from obtaining a certificate of need when it began operating in Vidalia, Georgia, must obtain a certificate of need in order to operate in Albany, Georgia.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 619, 480 S.E.2d at 596. Answering in the affirmative, the court noted first that although the statute exempted from CON requirements projects in existence, prior to the enactment of the State Health Planning Act, the statute provided no exemption for such projects to relocate without first obtaining a CON. The court then went on: \u201cThe exemption provisions of this statute must be followed closely; deviations are not permitted. <em>See Chattahoochee Valley Home Health Care, Inc. v. Healthmaster, Inc., </em>191 Ga.App. 42, 44, 381 S.E.2d 56 (1989)[, <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 1079, 110 S.Ct. 1132, 107 L.Ed.2d 1037 (1990) ]. Thus, in the absence of an express provision authorizing an exemption for the relocation of [the health care project at issue, that project] must obtain a CON if it is relocated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 620-21, 480 S.E.2d at 597. <em>See also Seashore Ambulatory Surgery Center, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Health, </em>288 N.J.Super. 87, 101, 671 A.2d 1088, 1095 (1996) (holding that the clear language of the act providing that a CON was needed for new health care project limited the exemption clause from applying to other situations not specified in the clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">When Loveman\u2019s license was revoked permanently, he ceased operating the nursing home and removed its personalty. Later, he and the corporation attempted to salvage their investment by leasing the existing building at 333 Harlem Lane to other nursing home health care projects. Eventually, Inglenook became licensed and operated its own, new project. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>It obtained an emergency CON and then a permanent CON to operate its nursing home. We found no indication from the record, nor do the parties point us to such an instance, of appellee objecting to the grant of the new CON to Inglenook. Thus, Inglenook and the subsequent operators at that location conducted their business under the aegis of Inglenook\u2019s newly acquired CON, not the prior exemption provided to Loveman and Shangri-La under Chapter 911. Subsequent health care projects and the \u201cchain\u201d of operations can be traced back to the Inglenook CON. Loveman and Shangri-La\u2019s medicaid convictions, the loss of Loveman\u2019s license to operate, and his acquiescence as to the issuance of a CON to another operator for the lessee\u2019s own health care project, constituted a waiver and abandonment of his exemption privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">C. The Exemption is not a Real Property Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">CONs now, and in 1978, are issued for \u201chealth care projects.\u201d 1978 Md. Laws, Chap. 911; \u00a7 19-101(e). As we have discussed, the health care project known in 1978 as ShangriLa Nursing Home was then exempt from obtaining a CON. Nonetheless, the project was dependant upon a license for operation. Shangri-La was exempt from the requirement of possessing a CON in order to qualify properly as a potential licensee.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nothing in Chapter 911, however, excused ShangriLa or Loveman from the necessity of complying with all of the other myriad of requirements and regulations governing the operation of health care projects. Nothing in Chapter 911 or its current codification prohibited the termination of the operation of the project if, once exempted, it thereafter engaged in egregious conduct not conducive to the well-being of its patients and contrary to the SHP. Furthermore, nothing in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>CON exemption provision excused Loveman or Shangri-La from the statutory requirement that licensees convicted of medicaid fraud shall have their licenses revoked. <em>See </em>\u00a7 19-327(a) and Md.Code (1980 Repl.Vol.), Art. 43, \u00a7\u00a7 559 and 560 (superceded). In fact, this was what happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">The argument that Loveman was granted some broad right to retain the CON exemption is premised upon his notions of property law and the contention that the exemption was created to run with the land much like a zoning nonconforming use provision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree. The Health Planning and Development Act is a regulatory scheme. The General Assembly gave the Commission the power to regulate the placement of health care projects, the types of services offered, and the number of persons to be served in an attempt to reduce the number of unused or unuseful projects throughout the State. Accordingly, this statute is regulatory in nature in terms of the distribution of health care services and does not, nor was it intended to, confer any specific real property rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Moreover, if appellee\u2019s interest in the health care project was a property right, it was, at best, an incorporeal hereditament. If it was an incorporeal hereditament, it has been abandoned. Although we do not agree that the exemption privilege was the equivalent of a nonconforming use, a concept unique to zoning law, we nonetheless address an important aspect of that particular zoning concept.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">In <em>Dorman v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>187 Md. 678, 51 A.2d 658 (1947), we were concerned with a property owner\u2019s assertion that he was entitled to utilize his property as a junk business because he had been operating it as such at the time a zoning prohibition against that use was enacted. Subsequent to the time of the enactment, a fire occurred on the owner\u2019s property. After the fire damage and the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>were repaired, the owner did not continue operating the junk business for some period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">We first noted that \u201c[t]he question presented is whether this non-conforming use in a second commercial use district had been abandoned by the former owners of the property\u2014or changed by them to a use of a higher classification, viz., a warehouse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 680, 51 A.2d at 659. We then discussed the law of abandonment, as it applied to nonconforming uses under many zoning statutes, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">Abandonment depends upon concurrence of two factors, (a) an intention to abandon and (b) some overt act, or some failure to act, which carries the implication that the owner does not claim or retain any interest in the subject matter. Time is not an essential element, but may be evidence of intention to abandon and may be considered in connection with acts manifesting such an intention.... The right under Paragraph 11 to \u201ccontinue\u201d a non-conforming use is not a perpetual easement to make a use of one\u2019s property detrimental to his neighbors and forbidden to them.... <em>It is only \u201cto avoid injustice that zoning ordinances generally except existing nonconforming uses. </em>* * * <em>The public effort is not to extend [non-conforming uses </em>], <em>but rather to permit to exist as long as necessary, and then to require conformity for the future. </em>* * * The mere cessation of the use for a reasonable period does not of itself work an abandonment, but once the abandonment is clearly indicated by intention and action, or failure of action for a sufficient period of time, then the owner has lost his right to the nonconforming use.... Were the law otherwise an owner could keep his property in a non-conforming class forever, which would be entirely contrary to the policy underlying zoning [ordinances].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 684-85, 51 A.2d at 661 (emphasis added)(brackets in original) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">There is no hard and fast rule in nonconforming use abandonments that intent to abandon must be actually shown when the zoning ordinance or statute utilizes the word \u201cabandon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>ment.\u201d In <em>Canada\u2019s Tavern, Inc. v. Glen Echo, </em>260 Md. 206, 271 A.2d 664 (1970), it was alleged that intent was required to abandon a nonconforming use under an ordinance providing that a nonconforming use, \u201conce abandoned,\u201d could not be reestablished. The ordinance defined abandonment as the \u201ccessation\u201d of the use for six months. Canada\u2019s Tavern, the lessee, ceased operations and the lessor could not get the premises back into operation within the six-month period, despite diligent efforts to do so. The trial court held not only was cessation of the use required, but also an \u201cintention to abandon\u201d was required. We disagreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-4\">We think the Council ... intended to align itself with those local governments which have found it desirable to delete the factor of intent in respect of the abandonment, discontinuance or cessation of nonconforming uses rather than continuing to run the gamut of its judicial determination in a successation of infinitely variable factual situations. [Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 211, 271 A.2d at 666. <em>See also Harford County v. McDonough, </em>74 Md.App. 119, 124-26, 536 A.2d 724, 726-27 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Even if we were to determine that the exemption here was in some way akin to a zoning nonconforming use, the appellate courts of this State have looked favorably to the public purpose served by the discontinuance and abandonment of such uses, even, as in <em>Canada\u2019s Tavern, </em>in the absence of actual intent to abandon. Thus it is clear that nonconforming uses can be lost by abandonment. Other privileges and rights likewise can be lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">In <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Hettleman, </em>183 Md. 204, 212, 37 A.2d 335, 338 (1944), the city had set up a special benefit assessment for planned street improvements. The improvements were not constructed until several years later. Describing the law of abandonment, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">\u201cAbandonment in law depends upon the concurrence of two, and only two, factors; one an intention to abandon or relinquish; and two, some overt act, or some failure to act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>which carries the implication that the owner neither claims nor retains any interest in the subject-matter of the abandonment. 1 C.J.S., <em>Abandonment, </em>[\u00a7 3, p.] 8. Time is \u2018not an essential element\u2019 of abandonment, although the lapse of time may be evidence of an intention to abandon, <em>Id. </em>[at \u00a7\u00a7 3, 7, pp.] 9, 16, and where it is accompanied by acts manifesting such an intention it may be considered in determining whether there has been an abandonment.\u201d <em>Landay v. Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>173 Md. 460, 469, 196 A. 293, 297, 114 A.L.R. 984; <em>Beyer v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore City, </em>182 Md. 444, 34 A.2d 765.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">See also the trademark case of <em>Sherwood Co. v. Sherwood Distilling Co., </em>177 Md. 455, 462, 9 A.2d 842, 844-45 (1939), and <em>Cristofani v. Board of Education, </em>98 Md.App. 90, 632 A.2d 447 (1993). In <em>Cristofani, </em>the Court of Special Appeals discussed at some length the theory of abandonment relating to easements, adverse possession, and prescription. The court noted the distinction between possessory rights in property, <em>i.e., </em>possession based upon title, which runs with the land and cannot be abandoned, and those rights arising out of the possessory interests in the land, which can be abandoned. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-5\"><em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>726 (6th ed.1990), defines corporeal and incorporeal hereditaments:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\"><em>Corporeal hereditament. </em>Substantial permanent objects which may be inherited. The term \u201cland\u201d will include all such.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\"><em>Incorporeal Hereditament. ...

Of incor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>poreal things, Blackstone enumerates, under the name <em>of </em>\u201cincorporeal hereditaments,\u201d ten varieties, to wit, advowsons, titles [tithes], commons, ways, offices, dignities, franchises, corodies, annuities and rents. [Footnotes omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-4\"><em>Cristofany </em>98 Md.App. at 98, 632 A.2d at 450-51 (brackets in original).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">1 Am.Jur.2d <em>Abandonment, Lost, Etc., Property </em>\u00a7 14 (1962) provides: \u201cWhile a corporal hereditament cannot be the subject of abandonment, easements, franchises and other incorporeal hereditaments may be lost by abandonment____\u201d[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">To the extent an exemption from statutory requirements is in any way related to realty, it is at best an incorporeal hereditament.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Thus, even if the exemption were associated in some way with the land, the rights acquired under it were susceptible to abandonment. Under the present circumstances, such incorporeal rights, if they existed at all, have been abandoned. When Shangri-La\u2019s and Loveman\u2019s qualifications to be licensed were voided as a result of the medicaid fraud conviction, the exemption from the CON requirement for licensees became, in essence, irrelevant and the need for the exemption ceased. When Loveman acquiesced in the granting of the CON to Inglenook, he abandoned whatever residue of interest he may have had in the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Our examination of the legislative history of the statutory scheme in its entirety convinces us that to construe the exemption any other way would lead to absurd results, given what we perceive to be the intent of the legislature to require the Commission to develop a SHP and implement it according to the needs of Maryland\u2019s residents. The act contemplates that the Commission will allot bed availability through the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>administration of the CON program according to the geographic need of Maryland\u2019s citizens, while keeping in mind financial access, as well, to the health care projects. The purpose of the exemption was not to remove existing operations completely from regulatory review or the necessity for those operations to meet the other statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">If, as appellee argues, the exemption right attaches to the physical building, this would defeat not only the Commission\u2019s function, but the Act\u2019s purpose. For example, if instead of being required to cease operating nursing homes in this State for his medicaid fraud conditions, Loveman\u2019s facility at 333 Harlem Lane was destroyed by wind, flood, fire or other catastrophe, and he did not rebuild it as a nursing home but as a bowling alley, office building, or school, under appellee\u2019s argument, he still would retain the right to insist that the bed capacity of the prior nursing home at 333 Harlem Lane not be allotted to other nursing home projects because the exemption runs with the land at issue. Thus, if ten years after Loveman opened the bowling alley, office building, or school, he chose to use the facility again as a nursing home, he could, according to this argument, use the exemption previously granted by the legislature and avoid the necessity of going through CON review. In the meantime, however, ninety-eight \u201cbeds\u201d would be unavailable to serve the needs of the community because Loveman chose not to utilize them but did not permit them to be used by other nursing home facilities desirous of and able to provide those services.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">For us to find for appellee would divest the Commission of its power to implement the SHP, thwart the intention of the legislature, and effectively grant appellee a monopoly as to ninety-eight beds of needed capacity forever, regardless of whether appellee used them and regardless of the need of the community. This cannot be what the General Assembly intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Under the Health Planning and Development Act, the operators of certain health care projects in existence prior to 1978 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>were excused from the necessity of obtaining a CON in order to qualify for licenses to operate their pre-existing health care projects. The exemption is personal to the person or health care operator that operated the health care project prior to 1978 and, if not waived or abandoned, may continue to apply to the specific health care project so long as it remains in operation. That exemption remains with the project and its operator<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and does not run with the specific land upon which the project may have operated prior to 1978 or with the \u201cbricks and mortar\u201d of the building itself. Furthermore, the exemption may be waived when the person or operator of the health care project becomes otherwise unqualified to hold a license by reason of criminal convictions for medicaid fraud or other applicable convictions, when he acquiesces in the obtainment of a CON by subsequent operators for the operation of the project, or when he ceases to operate the health care project for a significant period of time. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>all these are applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT WITH DIRECTION THAT IT AFFIRM THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-7\">. This was pursuant to section 19-115(j)(5)(ii) of the Health-General Article and COMAR 10.24.01.03A, which state that when a person or entity acquires an existing health care facility or service it is exempt, under certain circumstances, from obtaining a new CON. These exemption provisions are not at issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b604-9\">. At several points the Court of Special Appeals referred to a transfer of an exemption. To the extent it was referring to the exemption for Loveman and Shangri-La created by the 1978 statute, it was incorrect. Inglenook obtained in 1981, without objection by appellee, a new CON. All of the subsequent transfers related' to that CON. Any exemptions from new CON compliance after 1981 referred to subsequent exemptions based on Inglenook\u2019s CON and not to the exemption found in Chapter 911 of the Acts of 1978 for health care projects operated by Loveman and Shangri-La.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b604-10\">. COMAR 10.24.01.11 provides that a person can apply to the Commission for a declaration as to the applicability of a statute or regulation to that person\u2019s position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b617-6\">. Section 19-319(c)(l) provides in relevant part that \"[t]he applicant [for a license] shall have a certificate of need ... for the hospital, residential treatment center, or related institution to be operated.\u201d See similar provisions and requirements in effect when Shangri-La was in operation. Md.Code (1957, 1971 Repl.Vol. and 1980 Repl.Vol.), Art. 43, \u00a7 559(a-l) (superceded).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Nursing homes are \"related institutions\u201d under the provisions of this Act. <em>See </em>\u00a7 19-301(Z)(l)(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b618-7\">. We expressly do not decide appellee's assertion that a nonconforming use created under the law of zoning would run with the land under the law of real property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b622-9\">. Although comparable language is not found in the latest second edition of American Jurisprudence, we have not found any contrary language.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b624-5\">. Under the circumstances of this case, we need not resolve the issue of the assignability of the rights created by the exemption, as we hold that Loveman and Shangri-La have abandoned whatever rights they once may have had in the exemption at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
