CATHELL, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A4\">Specially Assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Petitioner Attorney Grievance Commission filed, by Bar Counsel, a Petition for Disciplinary Action in this Court against respondent Lester A.D. Adams on October 30, 1996. The petition alleged violations of Rules 1.15, 4.1, 8.1, and 8.4 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, a violation of Maryland Rule 16-604, and a violation of Md.Code (1989, 1995 RepLVol.), \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations &amp; Professions Article (BOP). Pursuant to Rule 16-709 b,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> this Court referred the matter to the Honorable Sheila R. TillersonAdams of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County for a hearing on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">Upon conducting a hearing on the matter on May 15, 1997, Judge Tillerson-Adams found that Bar Counsel did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that respondent had violated Rules 8.4(c) or (d), 4.1, 8.1(b), or BOP \u00a7 10-306. She did find by clear and convincing evidence, however, that respondent had violated Maryland Rule 16-604<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Rule 1.15<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Bar Counsel excepted only to Judge Tillerson-Adams\u2019s conclusion that respondent did not violate BOP \u00a7 10-306.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although he did not dispute her factual findings, respondent excepted to Judge Tillerson-Adams\u2019s conclusion that he violated Maryland Rule 16-604 and Professional Conduct Rule 1.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Judge Tillerson-Adams made findings of fact and conclusions in her Report and Recommendations, filed in this Court on October 21,1997, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>1. The Respondent has been admitted to the Practice of Law since June 17,1992.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-4\">2. The Respondent and Merlyn G. Walker (also known as Merlyn G. McPherson) hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Client,\u201d have been personal friends since 1980.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">3. March 7, 1994, the Respondent accompanied the Client to the Office of the Director of Compliance for the Comptroller of the Treasury to secure approval for the client to reopen her restaurant, which operated under the name of \u201cSweet \u2018n Spicy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">4. March 7, 1994, the Respondent and the Client had a fortuitous meeting with Stephen M. Cordi, the Director of the Compliance Division for the Comptroller of the Treasury to negotiate the outstanding tax delinquency in an effort to keep the restaurant open.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">5. The Respondent and the Client were informed by Mr. Cordi that the Comptroller needed to receive a payment of $2,000 toward the Client\u2019s delinquent taxes before the Comptroller would approve the reopening of the Client\u2019s restaurant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-8\">6. March 7, 1994, the Respondent tendered a check to Mr. Cordi drawn on his law office operating account at Nations Bank, in the amount of $2,000, payable to the Comptroller of the Treasury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-9\">7. The check was tendered on behalf of the Client to be applied toward her delinquent taxes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-10\">8. The Respondent did not know whether or not he had sufficient funds in his law office operating account to cover the tendered check at the time it was written.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-11\">9. It was understood that the Client was to give the Respondent $2,000 to deposit into his operating account immediately upon her return to the restaurant on March 7, 1994.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-12\">10. On March 10, 1994 and March 16, 1994, Mr. Cordi tried to cash the $2,000 check and on both occasions the check was returned [for] insufficient funds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>11. March 14, 1994, the Respondent received a total of $1,900 ($1,880 in cash, plus a $20 traveler\u2019s check) from the Client to reimburse him for the check he wrote on her behalf to the Comptroller. The Client never paid the balance and still owes the Respondent $100 to cover the check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-4\">12. March 14, 1994, the Respondent deposited the Client\u2019s funds along with other monies for a total deposit of $2,100 into his law office operating account. This deposit raised Respondent\u2019s account balance out of an overdraft balance which existed since February 28,1994.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-5\">13. The Respondent [,\u25a0 however,] still did not have sufficient funds in his operating account after the deposit to cover the check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">14. The Respondent used the Client\u2019s funds, intended for reimbursement of the payment to the Comptroller of the Treasury, to cover checks written on his law office operating account for expenses and other matters unrelated to his representation of the Client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">15. May 25, 1994, the Respondent was contacted by Mr. Cordi to discuss the bad check that was written and the continued delinquency of the Client\u2019s tax account. The Respondent pledged to deliver a cashier\u2019s check to Mr. Cordi the next day to replace the bad check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">16. June 15, 1994, the Respondent purchased a cashier\u2019s check but it was not hand delivered by the Respondent to Mr. Cordi until July 6, 1994[,] under a cover letter dated June 20,1994.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\">17. The Respondent received a letter dated March 13, 1995, from Raymond A. Hein, Assistant Bar Counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-10\">18. The Respondent did not respond in writing to the requests for information and records set forth in Mr. Hein\u2019s letter. However, the Respondent responded to everything eventually through subpoena request and his subsequent interview with Bar counsel\u2019s investigator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">This Court has original and complete jurisdiction over attorney disciplinary proceedings. Md. Rule 16-709 b; <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 470, 671 A.2d 463, 473 (1996); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kent, </em>337 Md. 361, 371, 653 A.2d 909, 914 (1995); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Powell, </em>328 Md. 276, 287, 614 A.2d 102, 108 (1992). Under an independent review of the record, we must determine whether the findings of the hearing judge are based on clear and convincing evidence. \u201cIf they are, and if the conclusions of law are not erroneous, we accept them and limit our discussion to any exceptions and the appropriate sanction.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Breschi, </em>340 Md. 590, 599, 667 A.2d 659, 664 (1995). Accordingly, this Court will make the \u201cultimate decision as to whether a lawyer has violated professional rules.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 599, 667 A.2d at 663. <em>See also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Garland, </em>345 Md. 383, 392, 692 A.2d 465, 469 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The hearing judge concluded that Bar Counsel did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that respondent violated Rules 8.4(c) or (d), 4.1, or 8.1(b) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, or section 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article, primarily because respondent made no intentional misrepresentations in his transactions. While respondent was unsure at the time he issued the check to Mr. Cordi on his general operating account whether that account contained funds sufficient to cover the $2,000 \u201cloan,\u201d he believed the client would reimburse him for the check later that same day. When he finally did receive from the client her partial repayment of $1,900, respondent deposited the repayment into his general operating account. Respondent\u2019s error, Judge Tillerson-Adams noted, was \u201cwhen he wrote checks to other individuals using the $1,900 before the money was properly paid to the Comptroller of the State of Maryland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Consequently, she found that respondent violated Maryland Rule 16-604 and Professional Conduct Rule 1.15(a). The judge stated that as soon as respondent realized the check to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>the Comptroller would not be honored because of insufficient funds, he should have transferred the client\u2019s repayment into a trust account to avoid the funds\u2019 use in covering later-written checks. In the alternative, respondent could have forwarded directly to the Comptroller the client\u2019s partial repayment, notwithstanding that the client had not fully repaid respondent. Respondent\u2019s failure to exercise either of these options, the judge concluded, \u201callowed [cjlient funds to be converted and commingled with other monies in the firm\u2019s operating account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">A. Maryland Rule 16-604</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Rule 16-604 requires that all funds received by a lawyer from a client or third person, and designated to be delivered to a client or third person, be deposited in a trust account. Ordinarily, funds received by a lawyer that constitute the payment of attorney\u2019s fees for past services rendered or funds for \u201creimbursement for expenses properly advanced on behalf of the client,\u201d may not need to be deposited into a trust account. Md. Rule 16-604. <em>But see Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Milliken, </em>348 Md. 486, 517, n. 14, 704 A.2d 1225, 1240, n. 14 (1998), for a further discussion of the issue of \u201cfees.\u201d As in <em>Milliken, </em>we need not resolve this issue. The funds involved in the case <em>sub judice </em>were not fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Respondent excepts to Judge Tillerson-Adams\u2019s conclusion that his failure to transfer the client\u2019s repayment to a trust account was a disciplinary violation. While what he did may not have been wise, respondent argues, it did not violate any rule of professional conduct because the transaction was an exception to Maryland Rule 16-604 as \u201cexpenses\u201d loaned on the client\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Petitioner, on the other hand, asserted at oral argument that respondent\u2019s actions did not amount to an \u201cadvancement\u201d of funds because his account did not contain sufficient funds to cover the check in the first place. Accordingly, when the client gave respondent her \u201crepayment,\u201d it actually was trust money, or should have been deposited into a trust account, because it was designated by the client to reimburse what she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>thought was a good check that, in fact, respondent had yet to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">Although we found no cases in Maryland squarely addressing the issues here presented, we are not persuaded by respondent that this transaction constituted an exception to Rule 16-604. Respondent argues that when he issued a check to the Comptroller, he forwarded funds he characterizes as \u201cexpenses\u201d on the client\u2019s behalf for her tax obligations. Respondent\u2019s check, however, at the time he issued it and at the two times the Comptroller attempted to cash it, could no longer be considered an expenditure of the client to be advanced by respondent because in all three instances, respondent\u2019s account did not contain funds sufficient to cover the check.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although all of the parties involved may have had a legitimate belief that the client would repay respondent the day respondent issued the check to the Comptroller, respondent could not loan what he did not have. At the time he issued the check, even if the matter involved advancement of proper expenses under the exception, respondent was not advancing expenses on the client\u2019s behalf because he had insufficient funds to advance.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">It follows that the client\u2019s \u201crepayment\u201d of $1,900 to respondent was not a reimbursement for advanced \u201cexpenses\u201d because respondent never actually advanced \u201cexpenses\u201d; he only advanced a worthless check to the Comptroller. Thus, the client\u2019s delivery of the $1,900 to respondent could no longer be considered a \u201creimbursement for expenses properly advanced on [her] behalf\u2019 under Maryland Rule 16-604, but the advancement of her own funds to fulfill the preexisting and not properly paid tax obligation to the Comptroller. Accordingly, respondent, upon receiving the funds, had an obligation under Rule 16-604 to place the money in a trust account or forward the money directly to the Comptroller, which he failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Respondent also argues that because the client repaid only $1,900 of the $2,000 \u201cadvanced\u201d on her behalf, to transfer those personal funds to the trust account would have resulted in the impermissible commingling of his personal funds with other client\u2019s funds in the trust account. This argument, however, is predicated upon the notion that the client\u2019s \u201crepayment\u201d retained its character as a reimbursement for expenses advanced on her behalf. As we stated <em>supra, </em>it did not. Therefore, no commingling would have occurred had respondent deposited the client\u2019s $1,900 into the trust account. Accordingly, we overrule respondent\u2019s first exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">B. Rule 1.15</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Rule 1.15(a) of the Rules of Professional Conduct requires that an attorney keep funds belonging to his client or third party, but in the attorney\u2019s possession, in a separate trust account. Respondent argues the trial court erred in determining he violated Rule 1.15(a) because the $1,900 received from the client belonged to respondent, not to the client. Therefore, respondent concludes, \u201cthere was no [client] property to safeguard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">In light of our discussion, <em>supra, </em>respondent\u2019s argument is unavailing. The $1,900 was not a repayment under the circumstances of this case. The client\u2019s alleged repayment to respondent was actually her own funds, which should have been delivered by respondent to the Comptroller. Accordingly, because the $1,900 belonged to the client and not to respondent, he was required to safeguard her property, the $1,900, in a trust account in accordance with Rule 1.15(a). <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kemp, </em>303 Md. 664, 678-79, 496 A.2d 672, 679 (1985). We have held that even an unintentional violation of this rule is still a violation. <em>Glenn, </em>341 Md. at 472, 671 A.2d at 475-76. The hearing judge did not err and, therefore, we overrule respondent\u2019s second exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">As we noted, <em>supra, </em>we found no Maryland cases controlling the issues presented under the circumstances herein described. Likewise, we could find no other similar cases from our sister states. A few cases, however, relate tangentially to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>the case at hand and lend support to the notion that an attorney\u2019s misuse of client funds or failure to use client funds in the matter directed by the client may convert the characteristics of those funds to client trust money. <em>See Matter of Stivers, </em>683 N.E.2d 1312, 1313 (Ind.1997) (holding attorney\u2019s use of client funds, which had been deposited into a trust account, converted client funds into attorney\u2019s funds when attorney used those funds to satisfy his monthly bank service charges); <em>State ex rel. Nebraska State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Bruckner, </em>249 Neb. 361, 365, 543 N.W.2d 451, 455 (1996)(\u201c \u2018Any unauthorized use ... of clients\u2019 funds entrusted to [an attorney], including not only stealing, but also unauthorized temporary use for the lawyer\u2019s own purpose, whether or not he derives any personal gain or benefit therefrom\u2019 \u201d is misappropriation (quoting <em>State ex rel Nebraska State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Veith, </em>238 Neb. 239, 245, 470 N,W.2d 549, 554 (1991))). <em>See also In re Ray, </em>675 A.2d 1381,1386 (D.C.App.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">We turn now to petitioner\u2019s exception regarding respondent\u2019s alleged violation of BOP \u00a7 10-306.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">C. \u00a7 10-306</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Petitioner excepts to Judge Tillerson-Adams\u2019s conclusion that respondent did not violate section BOP \u00a7 10-306. This statute states: \u201cA lawyer may not use trust money for any purpose other than the purpose for which the trust money is entrusted to the lawyer.\u201d Petitioner predicates this exception upon two premises. First is the notion that the money was, in fact, trust money. Second, petitioner relies upon Judge Tiller-son-Adams\u2019s finding at paragraph 14 that respondent misused these funds, \u201cintended for reimbursement of the payment to the Comptroller of the Treasury, to cover checks written on his law office operating account for expenses and other matters unrelated to his representation of the [c]lient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">We have said that in order to invoke disciplinary proceedings for a violation of section 10-306, section \u201c10-307 requires that the attorney\u2019s violation of [section] 10-306 must be <em>willful.\u201d</em><footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Glenn, </em>341 Md. at 482, 671 A.2d at 479 (footnote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>omitted). We went on in <em>Glenn </em>to note that while willfulness \u201cdoes not require some proof of a specific criminal intent, it does require at least proof of a general intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 482, 671 A.2d at 480. .</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The hearing judge did not state with specificity her reason for concluding respondent did not violate section 10-306. Judge Tillerson-Adams did state, however, that \u201cthe actions of [respondent were not intentional.\u201d Further, she described respondent\u2019s handling of the client\u2019s funds as negligent and dilatory, indicating that his actions amounted to sloppy and derelict behavior rather than a willful act. We therefore conclude that the hearing judge was not clearly erroneous in finding that Bar Counsel did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that respondent willfully violated section 10-306. Accordingly, Bar Counsel\u2019s exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The remaining issue is one of sanctions. We have said that the purposes of attorney disciplinary proceedings are to protect the public and the integrity of the legal profession, not to punish the individual offender. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Awuah, </em>346 Md. 420, 435, 697 A.2d 446, 454 (1997); <em>Glenn, </em>341 Md. at 483, 671 A.2d at 480; <em>Kemp, </em>303 Md. at 680, 496 A.2d at 680. The severity of the sanction varies with the circumstances of each case and takes into account mitigating factors. <em>Glenn, </em>341 Md. at 484, 671 A.2d at 480; <em>Powell, </em>328 Md. at 300, 614 A.2d at 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">In the case at hand, although respondent\u2019s actions were sloppy and negligent, and involved the inappropriate handling of client funds, his conduct did not amount to an intentional misuse of the client\u2019s funds. Further, in mitiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>tion, the hearing judge found that this was respondent\u2019s first such violation, the client was a personal friend of the respondent, respondent\u2019s primary intentions in \u201cloaning\u201d the money were good,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the $1,900 given to respondent by the client subsequently <em>was paid </em>to the Comptroller. Accordingly, we believe the appropriate sanction is a thirty-day suspension from the practice of law. Respondent shall pay all costs assessed in this matter. Upon the conclusion of the thirty-day suspension, respondent shall be supervised, at his own expense, by a monitor who will oversee respondent\u2019s practice as to the conduct of his operating and trust accounts, for a period of one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-715c, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION OF MARYLAND AGAINST LESTER A.D.
