A miner was killed. A federal coal mine inspector at once ordered all miners to evacuate that portion of the mine because of \u201cimminent danger.\u201d The next day, upon finding an inadequately supported roof, he extended his closure order to the entire mine. The inspector also found a great many other violations of the Mandatory Safety Standards promulgated by the Bureau of Mines; and the mine stayed closed until July 27, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-12\">The evacuation was ordered for \u201cimminent danger\u201d pursuant to 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 814(a) (1970),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An \u201cimminent danger\u201d is a term of art defined by that Act as \u201cthe existence of any condition or practice in a coal mine which could reasonably be expected to cause death or serious physical harm before such condition or practice can be abated.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Closure of a mine, or the dangerous area of the mine, is mandatory upon finding an imminent danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-13\">The Petitioners here are 126 miners at Meigs No. 2 who were without work from July 19, 1974, to July 27, 1974. Their claim is for compensation from the mine operators for a week\u2019s wages. Under 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 820,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> coal miners idled by a closure order are entitled to pay for the rest of the shift <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>and up to four hours of the next shift,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and they may also receive up to a week\u2019s pay, \u201c[i]f a coal mine or area of a coal mine is closed by an order issued under section 814 of this title for an <em>unwarrantable failure </em>of the operator to comply with any health or safety standard.\u201d (Emphasis added). A separate provision of the statute permits a federal coal mine inspector to close a mine, even though there is no imminent danger, if there is \u201can unwarrantable failure of [an] operator to comply with such mandatory health or safety standards\u201d with respect to two or more violations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1336-4\">Here, the closure order was issued because of \u201cimminent danger\u201d \u2014 the collapsing roof, not by an \u201corder issued . . . for an unwarrantable failure of the operator to comply with any health or safety standard.\u201d Further inspection of the closure order disclosed other, unrelated violations of mandatory safety standards. Petitioners offer to prove in support of their compensation claim that the violation directly leading to the imminent danger closure, and several of the other violations as well, constituted \u201cunwarrantable\u201d failures to abide by mandatory safety regulations. There has developed a body of coal-mine administrative law giving a definite meaning to the term \u201cunwarrantable failure\u201d; it approximates that conduct which in the law of torts is generally described as gross negligence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>poses of this appeal, we must assume petitioners can prove that the circumstances at the Meigs No. 2 mine which led to the closing for imminent danger involved this kind of negligent behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-4\">The issue before this court is thus quite clearly stated. Is the week\u2019s lost pay provision of 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 820(a) limited to closures actually ordered because of two or more unwarrantable failures, or can it extend to closures ordered because of an imminent danger when later investigation demonstrates the existence of two or more unwarrantable failures, perhaps even unwarrantable failures that caused the imminent dangers?</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-5\">I. ADMINISTRATIVE HISTORY OF THE CASE.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-6\">On September 3,1974, petitioners filed, in the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of the Interior, an application for compensation based on the theory above outlined. That application was dismissed on December 11, 1974, by the Administrative Law Judge, and his opinion was, in so far as here relevant, affirmed by the Interi- or Board of Mine Operations Appeals on June 25, 1975.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1337-7\">Petitioners\u2019 application alleged that they \u201cwere idled because of numerous violations of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Acts of 1969 . . . [which] were caused by unwarrantable failures of the respondent to comply with mandatory health or safety standards . . . .\u201d (J.A. 12). The petition thus sought to review certain aspects of the closure order itself (namely, that it was actually due to unwarrantable failures) rather than to challenge aspects of the compensation paid pursuant to the closure order as issued. In so challenging the closure order, the petition relied upon the wrong statutory section. Section 820 of Title 30, U.S.C., provides for the Board to rule on a compensation claim \u201cafter all interested parties are given an opportunity for a public hearing on such compensation.\u2019\u2019 Section 815 of Title 30, U.S.C. permits \u201cany representative of miners in any mine affected by such order . . . [to] apply to the Secretary for review of the order . .\u201d There are important procedural differences between the two statutory review provisions. The most notable difference is that section 815 requires adherence to the Administrative Procedure Act whereas section 820 does not.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Interior Board of Mine Operations Appeals in <em>Clinchfield, infra, </em>has already stated that section 820 hearings \u201care those relating to compensation due the claimants under the order <em>as </em>issued.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There is no great hardship in seeking section 815 review; indeed, it provides for a more complete hearing than does section 820.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-16\">Hence, petitioners have not followed the proper procedure in bringing their claim. They should have first sought to reform the closure order under section 815 to reflect the unwarrantable failures;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and, if successful, sought section 820 review only if the mine operator refused to pay the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1264\">*1264</page-number>week\u2019s compensation. The imminent danger closure was ordered on July 19, and all of the inspector\u2019s findings were completed as of July 28 (J.A. 31), yet the petition was not filed until September 3, 1974 (J.A. 51). Petitions for review under section 815 must be filed within thirty days of the closure order at issue.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Hence, petitioners were also fifteen days late in their filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-4\">However, it would be harsh to bar petitioner\u2019s claim because of untimeliness, since the claim was timely filed as a section 820 complaint (albeit on the last day, and giving credit for the withdrawal order\u2019s amendment on July 20).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Further, the same Board opinion that explained the limited scope of a section 820 proceeding went on to say \u201cwe cannot interpret section [814(c)] to imply that the basis for a finding of unwarrantable failure can be established retrospectively for the purpose of determining compensation under section [820(a)].\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Petitioners knew, therefore, that the Board would not recognize their claim no matter how it was brought. Their only purpose in seeking to review the closure order to prove unwarrantable failures was to establish a compensation claim, so they filed for compensation. The regulation allowed forty-five days for such a claim and they were within the limit. Hence it would be unfair to refuse consideration of the merits of their appeal because they chose the wrong statutory subsection under which to proceed. Particularly is this so in light of the Board\u2019s <em>Clinchfield </em>opinion,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> indicating that, even if proper procedure had been followed and a full section 815 proceeding had taken place, the result would be- precisely the same as the Board did reach.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1338-12\">II. THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF THE CLOSURE COMPENSATION PROVISIONS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-13\">Petitioners contend that the statutory language on its face is not entirely free of ambiguity.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1338-14\">If a coal mine or area of a coal mine is closed by an order issued under section 814 of this title for an unwarrantable failure .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1338-15\">30 U.S.C. \u00a7 820(a). If the normal interpretative rule of the Last Antecedent is applied,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the phrase \u201cfor an unwarrantable failure . . .\u201d would be interpreted to refer directly to the phrase that proceeds it, <em>i. e.: </em>\u201can order issued under section 814 of this title\u201d so that only unwarrantable failure <em>orders </em>would evoke the larger compensation. Alternatively, it is contended that the phrase could modify the main clause, \u201cIf a coal mine ... is closed,\u201d so that any closure traceable to an unwarrantable failure would be entitled to the larger compensation. The first reading is to be preferred as the more normal and less strained, especially considering that there is a separate type of closure order for unwarrantable failures. The second reading is not completely outside the language of the statute because it relies on the reference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number><em>\u201cSection 814\u201d </em>and is not limited to any subsection thereof. The second reading also, would not be inconsistent with some of the general objectives of the Act. It can be argued that where two equivalent mining operations are both run with unwarrantable failures to observe mandatory safety requirements in each, it would be anomalous to impose a lesser monetary burden of compensation on the one whose failures were so severe as to cause imminent danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-4\">Such argument presents the question as to what extent the general objective of the Act should be construed to override its specific provisions. We thus consider the legislative history to determine which interpretation Congress intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-5\">Congress included a declaration of purpose in the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, and codified it at 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 801. The very first sentence of that declaration states a theme that is repeated time and again throughout the hearings, committee reports, and debate on the floor, one theme that is preeminent over all others in the legislative history: \u201cCongress declares that \u2014 (a) the first priority and concern of all in the coal mining industry must be the health and safety of its most precious resource \u2014 the miner . . . .\u201d Should a conflict develop between a statutory interpretation that would promote safety and an interpretation that would serve another purpose at a possible compromise to safety, the first should be preferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-7\">We now turn to the legislative history of the precise sections involved in this appeal. Lost-time compensation provisions were present in the original bills in both the House and the Senate. The Senate version contained a list of premises for a closure order, one of which was essentially 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 814(c)(1) \u2014 concerned with the finding of two or more unwarrantable failures to abide by mandatory safety standards. The compensation section read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1339-8\">Should a mine or portion of a mine be closed by an order issued by the Secretary or his authorized representative for repeated failures of the operator to comply with any health or safety standard established by, or promulgated pursuant to, titles I or II of this Act, the Secretary shall, after all interested parties have been given an opportunity for a hearing, order that all miners who are idled due to the order shall be fully compensated by the operator for lost time, as determined by the Secretary, at their regular rates of pay for such time as the miners are idled by such closing, or for one week, whichever is the lesser.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1339-10\">115 Cong.Rec. 28,254 (Oct. 2, 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-11\">The reference to \u201crepeated failures\u201d encompasses the \u201cunwarrantable failures\u201d section just mentioned, and also the circumstance where a mine-operator failed to correct a violation after having been warned to do so. Under the Senate bill, however, no situation other than \u201crepeated failures\u201d would qualify for the payment of any compensation whatsoever (even for the rest of the idled shift). The reason is stated in the Senate Committee Report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1339-12\">In respect to wage payments for time lost due to closure under a withdrawal order, the committee consensus was that it would not be proper to require the operator to make such payments unless the withdrawal order was based on \u201crepeated failures\u201d to comply with any health or safety standard. The bill accordingly makes payment provisions operative only where there have occurred at least two failures to comply with a health or safety standard. The failures do not have to relate to the same or a similar health or safety standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1339-13\">S.Rep.No. 411, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 37 (1969). The discussion of payments as being \u201cproper\u201d connotes a concern with fairness. The closing of a mine means lost profits for the operator and lost wages for the miners. In most cases, those losses would remain where they fell. Fines would be imposed upon mine operators who violated mandatory safety standards,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> so the further punishment of shifting the burden of lost pay would not be proper, except for unregenerate operators.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>The House bill, on the other hand, was content to leave all punishment to the fine provisions.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> However, it would shift the lost pay burden onto the employer for the rest of the shift and up to four hours of the next shift as a cost of doing business.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This was irrespective of what precipitated the closure order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-4\">When the two bills were hammered out in the conference committee, the House version was adopted, \u201cexcept that where the mine is closed by an order issued on account of an unwarrantable failure of the operator to comply with a health or safety standard, the miners who are idled will obtain the benefits described in the Senate bill.\u201d S.Rep.No. 761, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. (1969), <em>reprinted in </em>2 [1969] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, pp. 2578, 2588. While the statute reads \u201cby an order issued under section 814 of this title <em>for </em>an unwarrantable failure,\u201d the conference report uses the phrase \u201cby an order issued <em>on account of </em>an unwarrantable failure.\u201d (Emphasis added). Also, while the Senate compensation provision applied to any \u201crepeated failure,\u201d the eventual law which emerged from the conference committee bill specified (by virtue of the reliance of section 820(a) or subsection (c)(1) of section 814) that compensation was payable only where the closure was ordered for more than one \u201cunwarrantable failure.\u201d In terms of culpability, a mine operator who did not correct a failure to meet a mandatory standard when warned to do so would be no less guilty than one whose mining operations displayed at least two different unwarrantable failures to comply with mandatory health or safety standards but who had not previously been ordered to correct them. Yet the conference committee singled out the latter for special compensation and let pass the former (which would have been covered by the original Senate bill).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The conference committee\u2019s interpretation of the word \u201cfor\u201d to mean \u201con account of\u201d and its deliberate selection of one particular closing order over others of equal culpability compel a reading of 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 820(a) in its literal sense: Extra compensation is afforded only when the mine is closed by an order issued under 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 814(c)(1) for multiple unwarranted failures.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1340-10\">If it has been established that Congress intended to provide exactly what 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 820(a) says, it might still be argued that it was unreasonable for Congress to do so. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>There is no further guidance available to this Court, after a thorough reading of the legislative history, to explain why Congress made the choices it did. Fines would serve the desired deterrent purpose against any negligent behavior, but it was not irrational for Congress to single out one particular dangerous circumstance for special additional deterrence. The reasonableness of Congress\u2019 choice is not at issue here except as a possible guide to its intent. The legislative scheme here involved, however, is not so unreasonable as to compel a rejection of what the action of the two houses indicated was the intent of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-4\">Even if a higher standard of review, requiring more justification, were appropriate, there is a very good reason not to allow the re-opening of an \u201cimminent danger\u201d closure order for the sake of imposing more liability on the employer. The safety of the miner is the single most crucial motivation behind the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969. That is borne out in the congressional hearings,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> in the first section of the actual statute,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and in judicial review.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> All of these sources support the clear intent of Congress that coal mines, or areas of coal mines, in which imminent danger was found to exist must be evacuated <em>at once, </em>with the benefit of any doubt cut in favor of withdrawal. Section 104 of the Act permits closure orders essentially of two types: for imminent danger (30 U.S.C. \u00a7 814(a)) or for behavior by a mine operator indicating a disregard for the Bureau of Mines\u2019 Safety Standards and orders (30 U.S.C. \u00a7 814(b), (c)(1) &amp; (2)). Imminent danger could exist even without any failing by the mine operator,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> for example, as a result of natural causes; whereas the other closures all involve some negligence by the operator. In the words of the Senate Report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1341-8\">The concept of an imminent danger as it has evolved in this industry is that the situation is so serious that the miners must be removed from the danger <em>forthwith </em>when the danger is discovered without waiting for any formal proceedings or notice. The seriousness of the situation demands such immediate action. The first concern is the danger to the miner. <em>Delays, even of a few minutes, may be critical or disastrous.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1341-9\">S.Rep.No. 761, <em>supra </em>p. 8, at 90 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-10\">Interpreting section 820 to permit the awarding of lost work compensation for up to a full week after an imminent danger closure order would have the necessary effect of making federal mine inspectors more hesitant to issue such orders. Perhaps the additional hesitancy would be very small; perhaps it would be further attenuated by the interposition of a section 820 hearing before the heavy monetary obligation was levied. But neither of those arguments can negate the fact that a mine inspector will think longer before taking an action that will cost the operating company a more serious monetary obligation. Since the obligation is directly proportional to the extent of operations shut down, this hesitancy might take the form of a narrower area defined in the closure order. However it is manifested, it would be intolerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-11\">The Committee hearings demonstrate that the Senate was very concerned by the possibility of any deterrent effect upon federal coal mine inspectors. In setting the size of a fine for violation of a mandatory health and safety standard, the Senate bill had originally proposed a $500 minimum. Mr. John O\u2019Leary, Director of the Bureau <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>of Mines, testified that the administration bill had no such minimum, and the reason was precisely to avoid inducing the slightest reluctance on the part of a mine inspector to issue a citation for a violation.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The bill that was eventually adopted included no minimum level on fines.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The fear of making mine inspectors more hesitant was felt to be serious enough to warrant a change in the proposed bill, even though (1) a full hearing would be available for a mine operator to challenge any fine levied; (2) a closure order did not automatically follow a citation (as it would for imminent dangers); and (3) the monetary obligation inducing this reluctance was only $500 (whereas the loss in pay for a week would total many thousands of dollars more than rest-of-shift-plus-four-hours compensation).</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-4\">The dominant purpose of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 would thus be furthered by avoiding the slightest impediment to the issuance of an \u201cimminent danger\u201d closure order. The true interest of the miner is vindicated far more faithfully by paying attention to this concern than by focusing on money compensation. The interpretation we give to the statute also comports with the reading given by the agency most directly concerned with its enforcement,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and with the clear literal sense of the language. Accordingly, the order of the Interior Board of Operations Appeals denying this petition is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-10\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1335-7\">.

However, it is my view that the statute does not require an absolute and clear dichotomy \u2014 that the closing order must be either for imminent danger, or for unwarrantable failure to maintain safety standards, but not for both reasons. Questions of legislative intent require the courts, in the last analysis, to reconstruct how the legislature would have decided the specific issue if it had been specifically addressed by the legislature.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> I find it hard to suppose that Congress would have said \u2014 We want the operator to be responsible for compensation in an ordinary case of unwarrantable failure, but not in a case that is so extreme that his unwarrantable failure has led to an \u201cimminent danger\u201d of explosion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-14\">The kind of blunt consideration Congress was giving to the problem, as outlined in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>the legislative history reviewed by Judge MacKinnon, is more congruent with its taking the view that compensation orders were appropriate, when the operator was guilty of unwarrantable failures, as an allocation of burden related to guilt, and that this imposition of burden is equally appropriate, and if anything even more appropriate, when the operator\u2019s derelictions (\u201cunwarrantable\u201d failures) had the consequence of presenting an imminent danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-5\">The only possible indicator to the contrary rests on administrative considerations. Certainly the department may reasonably conclude that imminent closure orders could be subject to problems of delay if the inspector were simultaneously <em>required </em>to consider the issue of unwarrantable failure. But it would seem to me open to the department, under this statute, to provide by regulation for a procedure whereby an imminent closure danger <em>could </em>be accompanied by an unwarrantable failure finding\u2014 either in the same order, or a contemporaneous order issued the same day. For example, I have in mind this could be projected when the inspector could make the \u201cunwarrantable failure\u201d determination readily, from observations in hand before the \u201cimminent danger\u201d became apparent. This is a matter that would lie within administrative discretion, in my view. It is not before us in the present case, for I would certainly agree with Judge MacKinnon that the statute may reasonably be interpreted by the administrative agency, in the interest of safety, as permitting the inspector to focus on immediate closure, in the case of imminent danger, without being obligated in a particular case to make the effort and take the time that may be necessary to make a determination, one way or the other, on the issue of unwarrantable failure. Here the closing order made no reference to the unwarrantable failure standard. Accordingly, I concur in the mandate of affirmance.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1342-19\"> <em>Montana Power Co. v.
