We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-11\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-12\">In 1970, Zenith petitioned the Commissioner of Customs,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleging that bounties or grants were being bestowed upon the manufacture and export of certain products<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from Japan. The Commissioner investigated and, on January 7,1976, published a \u201cFinal Negative Countervailing Duty Determination,\u201d announcing that \u201cno bounty or grant is being paid or bestowed, directly or indirectly, within the meaning of section 303.\u201d 41 Fed.Reg. 1298 (1976). Zenith, pursuant to \u00a7 516(d), 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516(d) (Supp. V 1975), contested the determination in the United States Customs Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-17\">\n<em>The Japanese Tax</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-18\">The Japanese Commodity Tax Law, Law No. 48 of 1962, as revised and insofar as it appears in the record, imposes a single-stage \u201ccommodity tax\u201d upon a manufacturer\u2019s shipment of specified electronic products for consumption in Japan. The same products are exempt from the tax when shipped for export.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A tax paid on a shipment for home consumption is refunded if that shipment is later exported.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is undisputed that the tax is internal, and that the application of the tax to internal shipments, while refusing to apply it to exports,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is the sole governmental action which was adjudged below to have created a countervailable bounty or grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-19\">\n<em>The Customs Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-20\">Upon application by the United States, a three-judge panel was convened pursuant to \u00a7 108, Customs Court Act of 1970. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 255 (1970). Both parties moved for summary judgment. Relying heavily upon <em>Downs v. United States, </em>187 U.S. 496, 23 S.Ct. 222, 47 L.Ed. 275 (1903), the court held that remission of the Japanese Commodity Tax constituted a bounty or grant under \u00a7 303, as a matter of law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>Accordingly, the court granted Zenith\u2019s motion for summary judgment and ordered the Secretary of the Treasury to determine the net amounts of the bounties or grants and to assess countervailing duties equal-ling those amounts \u201con the subject electronic products exported from Japan, entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after the day following the date of entry of this Order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-4\">\n<em>The Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-5\">The dispositive issue is whether the mere remission of an excise<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> tax must, as a matter of law, be deemed a bounty or grant under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1303 (Supp. V 1975):<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Am4\">\u00a7 1303. Countervailing duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1286-6\">(a) Levy of countervailing duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1286-7\">(1) Whenever any country, dependency, colony, province, or other political subdivision of government, person, partnership, association, cartel, or corporation, shall pay or bestow, directly or indirectly, any bounty or grant upon the manufacture or production or export of any article or merchandise manufactured or produced in such country, dependency, colony, province, or other political subdivision of government, then upon the importation of such article or merchandise into the United States, whether the same shall be imported directly from the country of production or otherwise, and whether such article or merchandise is imported in the same condition as when exported from the country of production or has been changed in condition by remanufacture or otherwise, there shall be levied and paid, in all such cases, in addition to any duties otherwise imposed, a duty equal to the net amount of such bounty or grant, however the same be paid or bestowed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1286-11\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"AU3U\">\n<em>Prior Cases</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-12\">The rationale supporting the judgment below begins with the view that the applicable law is to be found in a paragraph from the 1903 Supreme Court opinion in <em>Downs, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Though the Customs Court remarked the presence of an elaborate certificates-plus-tax remission scheme, it found primary support for its judgment in this paragraph (from which the court quoted the first and last sentences) in the lengthy <em>Downs </em>opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1286-13\">The details of this elaborate procedure for the production, sale, taxation and exportation of Russian sugar are of much less importance than the two facts which appear clearly through this maze of regulations, viz.: that no sugar is permitted to be sold in Russia that does not pay an excise tax of R. 1.75 per pood, and that sugar exported pays no tax at all. The mere imposition of an import duty of three rubles per pood, paid upon foreign sugar, is, like all protective duties, a bounty, but is a bounty upon production and not upon exportation. When a tax is imposed upon all sugar produced, but is remitted upon all sugar exported, then, by whatever process, or in whatever manner, or under whatever name it is disguised, it is a bounty upon exportation. [187 U.S. at 515, 23 S.Ct. at 228.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1286-14\">Opinions must be read in their entireties and in the light of the facts of the case. <em>Armour &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Wantock, </em>323 U.S. 126, 133, 65 S.Ct. 165, 89 L.Ed. 118 (1944). Though the first and last sentences of the quoted paragraph, considered in vacuo, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>would support the judgment below, their effect as binding precedent depends upon their relationship to the underlying facts and the remainder of the opinion in <em>Downs. </em>\u201cIt is a maxim, not to be disregarded, that general expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection with the case in which those expressions are used.\u201d <em>Cohens v. Virginia, </em>19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264, 398, 5 L.Ed. 257 (1821).</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\">The clearest complete explanation of the complex Russian sugar scheme in <em>Downs </em>appears in the Board of General Appraisers\u2019 opinion, <em>Downs v. United States, </em>4 Treas. Dec. 405, 409-413, T.D. 22984 (1901). The excise tax and certificate elements of the scheme were there described as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-6\">VI. That, upon the exportation of said sugar * * *, the Russian Government, * * * released said sugar from said tax of 1.75 rubles * * * by a refund * * * a cancellation of indebtedness, or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-9\">VII. That, in addition to remitting said excise tax, the Government issued to the exporter a certificate certifying that he had exported * * * free sugar. That * * * such certificates * * * have a substantial market value * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-10\">VIII. That said certificates are sold to and used by sugar manufacturers or refiners, who are thereby enabled to transfer from their \u201cfree reserve or free surplus\u201d to their \u201cfree sugar\u201d an amount of sugar equal to the amount shown by said certificates to have been exported, which amount may then be sold for domestic consumption on paying the ordinary tax of 1.75 rubles per pood (to which free sugar is regularly subject). [4 Treas.Dec. at 411.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1287-11\">The board recognized that the combination of (1) regular and additional tax rebates, and (2) export certificates, operated to confer a bounty on sugar exports:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-12\">It is manifest * * * that the exporter * * * receives a valuable bonus * * * and that this bonus accrues * * * upon the exportation * * *. The export certificates or vouchers * * are only the legal evidence of this valuable privilege or grant conferred by the Government, without whose authority such transfers of sugar would be valueless and of no effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-15\">Our conclusion, therefore, is that a bounty or grant * * * has been paid or bestowed * * * so as to work a benefit or advantage * * * as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-16\">First. * * * the Government remitted or refunded the excise tax * * or otherwise canceled the indebtedness of the sugar manufacturer, so that he was enabled to place his product upon the market free from the burden of either the regular or additional excise tax.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-17\">Second. The certificate * * * had a substantial market value, and was transferable, and operated as a premium, grant, bonus, or reward. <em>[Id. </em>at 413.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZ5V\">The whole Russian scheme, involving import duties, remission of regular and additional excise taxes, export certificates, and sugar transfers, was before the board, which did not decide the matter piecemeal. Hence, the appellate courts were faced with a board decision resting not on either of two independent grounds, but on a single ground having at least two important elements, and there was no call in <em>Downs </em>for the board, the Fourth Circuit, or the Supreme Court to decide whether a nonexcessive remission of an excise tax constitutes a <em>per se </em>bounty or grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-18\">On appeal, the Fourth Circuit affirmed, <em>Downs v. United States, </em>113 F. 144 (4th Cir. 1902), adopting the board opinion and focusing its own attention on the export certificates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-19\">We reach the conclusion that the collector of the port of Baltimore, under the provisions of the fifth section of the tariff act of July 25, 1897, properly imposed the duty now complained of by the appellant. We find that the Russian exporter of sugar obtains from his government a certificate, solely because of such exportation, which is worth in the open markets of that country from 1 ruble and 25 kopecks to 1 ruble and 64 kopecks per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>pood, or from 1.8 to 2.35 cents per pound. Therefore we hold that the government of Russia does secure to the exporter of that country, as the inevitable result of its action, a money reward or gratuity whenever he exports sugar from Russia, and we think it was from such indirect grants as this that the congress of the United States intended to protect the manufacturers of this country, by authorizing the secretary of the treasury to make all proper regulations for the assessment and collection of such additional duties as were imposed by the collector on the sugars imported by the appellant. <em>[Id. </em>at 145.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1288-4\">After devoting over ten pages to the elaborate Russian scheme in <em>Downs, </em>the Supreme Court referred to the petitioner\u2019s position, 187 U.S. at 512, 23 S.Ct. at 227:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAF\">It is practically admitted in this case that a bounty equal to the value of these certificates is paid by the Russian government, and the main argument of the petitioner is addressed to the proposition that this bounty is paid, not upon exportation, but upon production.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1288-5\">The remainder of the paragraph initiated by that sentence explains at length how bounties upon exportation may operate as bounties upon production and vice-versa.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court then responded to Downs\u2019 argument that a Russian exporter received the same amount whether or not he exported:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX9\">But the fact that he receives the same amount, whether the goods are exported or sold at home, is not the proper test whether a bounty is paid upon exportation. If no bounty at all were paid all sugar, or at least all \u201cfree sugar,\u201d would pay the same tax, whether sold at home or exported abroad; and in this case the free sugar upon which the tax is remitted when exported would go abroad burdened with an excise tax of R. 1.75 per pood, which would prevent the manufacturer from selling it at such a price abroad as would enable him to realize a profit. The amount he receives for his export certificate, say, R. 1.25, is the exact amount of the bounty he receives upon exportation, and this enables him to sell at a profit in a foreign market. All manufacturers would prefer to sell at a profit in a foreign market. All manufacturers would prefer to sell at home if they could realize a greater price than by selling abroad, but if by being paid a drawback, or by a remission of taxes, they can find a profitable market in a foreign country, so much sugar as is not needed at home will be sent abroad. [187 U.S. at 514-515, 23 S.Ct. at 228.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1288-8\">Earlier in its extended opinion, the Court discussed the conjunctive effect of the import tariff and excise tax exemption parts of the scheme:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-9\">If the additional bounty paid by Russia upon exported sugar were the result of a high protective tariff upon foreign sugar, and a further enhancement of prices by a limitation of the amount of free sugar put upon the market, we should regard the effect of such regulations as being simply a bounty upon production, although it might incidentally and remotely foster an increased exportation of sugar; <em>but where in addition to that </em>these regulations exempt sugar exported from excise taxation altogether, we think it clearly falls within the definition of an indirect bounty upon exportation. [Emphasis added. 187 U.S. at 513, 23 S.Ct. at 228.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1288-10\">In the middle sentence of the paragraph containing the sentences quoted by the Customs Court, the Supreme Court reiterated its view that an import duty is a bounty upon production. Not without some confusion, the court thus bracketed its reference to import duty with comments that sugar sold in Russia was taxed and that exported was not and that a tax on \u201call sugar produced,\u201d but remitted on sugar exported, constituted a bounty upon exportation. The entire paragraph must be read as a whole, including its reference to import duty, and in the context of the entire opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>ion, including the Court\u2019s earlier discussion of import duty, wherein it had found a bounty in the combination of import duty and excise tax remission. We cannot read the sentences quoted above as though they were divorced from all preceding and succeeding discussion, or as establishing a proposition of law to govern a fact (tax remission alone) not before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-4\">The Supreme Court not only considered the Russian scheme as a whole, but listed the actual price differences it created. The Court ended its opinion with the statement (re certificates) of the Fourth Circuit quoted above and stated, \u201cWe all concur with this expression of opinion.\u201d 187 U.S. at 516, 23 S.Ct. at 229. Thus the Court\u2019s <em>decision </em>was that the scheme bestowed a bounty. The Court did elect to insert in its <em>opinion </em>the broad language of the two sentences which served as foundation stones for the judgment now under review. That broad language was not necessary to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision and was not, therefore, its ratio decidendi.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> When it is read, as it must be read, in light of the facts before the Court, that broad language did not constitute a Supreme Court holding that every nonexcessive remission of every excise tax constitutes a bounty or grant as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-8\">We are mindful, as was the Customs Court, of subsequent references to broad statements in <em>Downs. </em>See e. g., <em>Nicholas &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>249 U.S. 34, 39 S.Ct. 218, 63 L.Ed. 461 (1919); American <em>Express Co. v. United States, </em>67 Cust.Ct. 141, C.D. 4266, 332 F.Supp. 191 (1971), <em>aff\u2019d on other ground, </em>472 F.2d 1050, 60 CCPA 86, C.A.D. 1087 (1973); <em>F. W. Meyers &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>6 Treas.Dec. 260, T.D. 24306 (Bd. Gen.App.1903). Those references cannot, however, require us to disregard the facts in <em>Downs, Nicholas, American Express, </em>and <em>Meyers.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1289-9\">The Supreme Court has instructed us, <em>Kastigar v. United States, </em>406 U.S. 441, 454-55, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 32 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972), that broad language unnecessary to the Court\u2019s decision in an 80-year-old case is not to be blindly accepted as binding authority, despite its having been quoted in many subsequent cases and even though the language had been described as stating the \u201cprinciple\u201d of the old case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-10\">There being no prior instance in which any court has been presented with the question of whether, as a matter of law, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>remission of an excise tax, without more, bestows a countervailable bounty or grant, we confront a case of first impression.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1290-4\">\n<em>The Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-5\">The intent of Congress, as expressed in \u00a7 303 itself, is not difficult to fathom. As the predecessor of this court, in <em>Nicholas &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>7 Ct.Cust. App. 97, T.D. 36426 (1916), and the Supreme Court in <em>Nicholas, </em>249 U.S. at 39, 39 S.Ct. 218, indicated, the words \u201cbounty\u201d and \u201cgrant\u201d are broad but not ambiguous. \u201cNet amount\u201d necessarily means that countervailing duties should equate to the true bounty or grant actually conferred. Congress\u2019 intent to provide a wide latitude, within which the Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary) may determine the existence or non-existence of a bounty or a grant, is clear from the statute itself, and from the congressional refusal to define the words \u201cbounty,\u201d \u201cgrant,\u201d or \u201cnet amount,\u201d in the statute or anywhere else, for almost 80 years. As affects the present case, and consistent with that broad intent, Congress has not statutorily required that every governmental action distinguishing between products consumed at home and those exported shall be deemed the bestowing of a bounty or grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-6\">As this court\u2019s predecessor said in <em>Nicholas, </em>supra, 7 Ct.Cust.App. at 106: \u201cIt was a <em>result </em>Congress was seeking to equalize regardless of whatever name or in whatever manner or form or for whatever purpose it was done.\u201d On appeal in <em>Nicholas, </em>249 U.S. at 39, 39 S.Ct. at 220, the Supreme Court said: \u201cThe statute was addressed to a condition and its words must be considered as intending to define it, and all of them\u2014 \u2018grant\u2019 as well as \u2018bounty\u2019 \u2014 must be given effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-9\">Neither form nor nomenclature being decisive in determining whether a bounty or grant has been conferred, it is the economic result of the foreign government\u2019s action which controls. Thus, the language of \u00a7 303, \u201c[w]henever any country * * * shall pay or bestow * * * any bounty or grant,\u201d requires a factual inquiry. The statute assigns that factual inquiry, in the first instance, to the Secretary. Courts may review a factual record upon which a determination has been based, but are woefully ill-equipped to undertake unaided the complex economic analyses required to determine whether a bounty or grant has in fact been conferred as a result of a particular governmental action. In the present case, the record is silent regarding the economic result of the mere remission of the Japanese Commodity Tax. The Secretary has presumably determined that the economic result here is not the conferring of such a benefit, subsidy, or incentive as would rise to the level of a bounty or grant under \u00a7 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-10\">The factual underpinnings of the Secretary\u2019s negative countervailing duty determination in this case are not under attack. On the contrary, the sole question on this appeal is whether the mere remission of the Japanese Commodity Tax must be deemed a bounty or grant as a matter of law. Nothing in the statute itself so requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-11\">\n<em>Legislative History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-12\">The imposition of countervailing duties, on imports other than sugar, was first provided for in \u00a7 5 of the Tariff Act of 1897, 30 Stat. 205. The parties agree that Congress repeatedly reenacted that basic provision without substantial change (\u00a7 6 of the Tar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>iff Act of 1909, 36 Stat. 85; para. E of the Tariff Act of 1913, 38 Stat. 193; \u00a7 303 of the Tariff Act of 1922, 42 Stat. 935; \u00a7 303 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 46 Stat. 687; and as \u00a7 331(a) of the Trade Act of 1974, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1303 (Supp. V 1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-5\">The United States says the absence of definitions for \u201cbounty,\u201d \u201cgrant\u201d and \u201cnet amount\u201d creates ambiguity, requiring resort to legislative histories of the Tariff Acts of 1890,1894, and 1897. Zenith, as did the Customs Court, cites the Supreme Court\u2019s indication in <em>Nicholas, </em>supra, that \u201cbounty\u201d and \u201cgrant\u201d are not ambiguous. Both parties have supplied extensive reviews of legislative history in support of their respective positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-6\">Respecting the legislative history behind \u201cbounty,\u201d \u201cgrant,\u201d and \u201cnet amount,\u201d we are convinced, after careful review of the cited floor statements, committee reports, submissions and testimony, and after full consideration of the conflicting inferences drawn therefrom by the parties, that Congresses since 1890 have elected to refrain from stating that any specific condition would constitute a bounty or grant effective to require imposition of countervailing duties under \u00a7 303,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and to refrain from specifying a method of calculating net amount. Certain it is that nothing in the voluminous citations of record indicates a congressional intent that countervailing duties must be imposed in response to a nonexcessive remission of an excise tax, the condition now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-10\">Not without reason has Congress refrained from spelling out either the precise criteria for determining what shall constitute a bounty or grant and what shall not, or the calculations to be followed in determining net amount. As this court said in <em>Hammond Lead, </em>supra note 11: \u201cIn the assessment of a countervailing duty, the determination that a bounty or grant is paid necessarily involves judgments in the political, legislative or policy spheres,\u201d 440 F.2d at 1030, 58 CCPA at 137, to which the court might well have added the eminently important economic sphere. Our nation\u2019s relationships in the world family are particularly sensitive to the assessment of the additional duties known as \u201ccountervailing\u201d duties. Such assessment is not just a means of protecting our producers, as Congress has recognized in refusing to require proof of injury before making such assessment; it is also one of the chips in a game played by governments on a world stage. Presumably enacting and reenacting \u00a7 303 in this broad light, illuminative of the statute\u2019s role in the world, Congress in its wisdom has simply refrained from calling all the countervailing duty plays in advance.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1291-11\">Nothing, therefore, in \u00a7 303 itself, or in the cited and researched legislative history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>relating to the terms \u201cbounty,\u201d \u201cgrant,\u201d or \u201cnet amount,\u201d aids the decisional process in the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-4\">\n<em>Congressional Ratification</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-5\">The Customs Court considered the reenactments of \u00a7 5 of the 1897 Act as congressional ratification of the court\u2019s interpretation of <em>Downs. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-6\">The basis for the \u201cratification\u201d view expressed below lies in a paragraph from a 1908 submission to the House Committee on Ways and Means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-7\">In <em>Downs </em>v. <em>United States, </em>187 U.S. 496 [,23 S.Ct. 222, 47 L.Ed.2d 275] (1903), it was held that the remission of the excise tax imposed on sugar sold in Russia granted to the exporter of sugar, which remission is awarded in the form of a certificate having a substantial market value, and the subject of purchase and sale, is equivalent to a bounty, and such sugar when imported into the United States is subject to an additional duty equal to the amount of such bounty.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1292-8\">An assumption that Congress had the quoted paragraph in mind, when it acted in 1909, would not warrant the further assumption that it thereby ratified a holding that excise tax remission alone is a bounty. The author of the submission said the tax remission was \u201cin the form of a certificate having a substantial market value.\u201d We shall never know whether he interpreted <em>Downs </em>as merging remission and certificate elements of the Russian scheme or whether he considered the saleable certificates alone an excessive remission. We know only that a committee was told that the Court had held excise tax remission \u201cin the form of\u201d saleable certificates equivalent to a bounty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-9\">Moreover, if Congress must be assumed to have been informed of <em>Downs </em>in 1908, it must be equally assumed to have been better informed over the last half-century. In 1916, Congress established the Tariff Commission. 39 Stat. 796. In reporting to Congress in 1918, the Commission described <em>Downs:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-12\">The [Supreme] Court affirmed the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals. The substance of the decision may be summarized as follows: \u201cWhen a tax is imposed on all sugar produced but is remitted upon all sugar exported,\u201d <em>and </em>the exporter obtains from his government, \u201csolely because of such exportation,\u201d a certificate which possesses an actual value and is saleable in the open market, the remission of the tax is in effect a bounty upon the exportation. [Emphasis added.]<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1292-13\">Thus, Congress was advised in 1918 that the bounty in <em>Downs </em>involved more than tax remission, and the Commission\u2019s report tends to defeat the notion that Congress, in reenacting \u00a7 303, intended to require the imposition of countervailing duties in response to tax remission alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-14\">In all events, the applicable statute is \u00a7 331(a) of the Trade Act of 1974, 88 Stat. 2049 (amending \u00a7 303 of the Tariff Act of 1930), 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1303, and rusted segments of legislative history, generated in other times, under other conditions, may be of limited value when recent segments, touching more current questions are available. As will be seen, the cognizant committees of the 93rd Congress did refer, albeit ambivalently, to the Treasury Department\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 303 and its long-standing practice under that interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-15\">\n<em>Administrative Practice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AgJ\">Since 1898, the Treasury Department has consistently and uniformly interpreted \u00a7 303 as requiring that there be an \u201cexcessive\u201d remission of an excise tax, i. e., the governmental giving of something above and beyond mere excise tax remission, to have a bounty or grant.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Conversely, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>has consistently and uniformly, for now almost 79 years, interpreted \u00a7' 303 as not requiring that the mere remission of an excise tax, i. e., a \u201cnonexcessive\u201d remission of the type now before us, be deemed a bounty or grant.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1293-5\">A long-continued, uniform administrative practice, if not contrary to or inconsistent with law, is entitled to great weight, <em>Saxbe v. Bustos, </em>419 U.S. 65, 95 S.Ct. 272, 42 L.Ed.2d 231 (1976), particularly where, as here, those charged with its administration adopted that practice contemporaneously with the inception of the statute, <em>Power Reactor Development Co. v. International Union of Electrical Workers, </em>367 U.S. 396, 81 S.Ct. 1529, 6 L.Ed.2d 924 (1961), and when Congress has repeatedly reenacted the statute without change,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Saxbe, </em>supra; <em>Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. United States, </em>288 U.S. 269, 273, 53 S.Ct. 337, 77 L.Ed. 739 (1933); <em>Komada v. United States, </em>215 U.S. 392, 30 S.Ct. 136, 54 L.Ed. 249 (1910); <em>C. J. Tower &amp; Sons v. United States, </em>44 CCPA 41, 44 C.A.D. 634 (1957); <em>United States v. Lawrence, </em>11 Ct.Cust.App. 203, 208, T.D. 38967 (1921), and when Congress has failed to revise the statute in the face of such administrative practice, <em>United States v. Midwest Oil Co., </em>236 U.S. 459, 35 S.Ct. 309, 59 L.Ed. 673 (1915), and when Congress has refused requests to legislate a change, <em>United States v. Bergh, </em>352 U.S. 40, 46, 77 S.Ct. 106, 1 L.Ed.2d 102 (1956); <em>Alstate Construction Co. v. Durkin, </em>345 U.S. 13, 73 S.Ct. 565, 97 L.Ed. 745 (1953). Moreover, to sustain an administrative interpretation of a statute, a court \u201cneed not find that its construction is the only reasonable one, or even that it is the result we would have reached had the question arisen in the first instance in judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Unemployment Compensation Commissioner v. Aragon, </em>329 U.S. 143, 153, 67 S.Ct. 245, 250, 91 L.Ed. 136 (1946). Under the Internal Revenue Code, \u201cTreasury regulations and interpretations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>long continued without substantial change applying to unamended or substantially reenacted statutes, are deemed to have received congressional approval and have the effect of law.\u201d <em>Helvering, Commissioner </em>v. <em>Winmill, </em>305 U.S. 79, 83, 59 S.Ct. 45, 46, 83 L.Ed. 52 (1938).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\">The Customs Court dismissed the effect of Treasury\u2019s administrative practice because it deemed that practice contrary to the law it had gleaned from <em>Downs, </em>and because it found a failure of Congress to codify the practice. As above indicated, there is no judicial precedent contrary to or even inconsistent with the Treasury practice. So too, our study of the applicable legislative history from 1890 to 1975 finds no congressional action contrary to or inconsistent with the administrative practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-5\">The record does reflect unrequited suggestions to Congress that it enact the Treasury practice. We cannot, however, join the Customs Court in inferring therefrom a rejection or disapproval. At the outset, we find it difficult to believe that Congress would harbor in its breast a disapproval of an administrative practice for almost 80 years, while remaining so supine or irresponsible as not to change it. The suggestions on which the Customs Court focused were not that Congress should legislate a new, unheard-of practice. Though the record shows the first specific notice to Congress in 1949,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> we cannot assume that Congress had earlier reenacted the statute four times without ever informing itself of Treasury\u2019s practice. But whether awareness of the practice has continued for 79 or for 28 years, the inference of acquiescence from Congress\u2019 failure to act against the practice over the many years involved, and through many reenactments of the statute, overbalances any inference of rejection from failure to codify it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-9\">In 1950, the Treasury proposed an amendment which would have codified its practice and required injury to domestic industry. Objections were raised only to the injury requirement.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Nonadoption of that amendment can hardly be taken as proof of Congress\u2019 disapproval of Treasury\u2019s practice. The failure to adopt may have been due to concern over the injury requirement, or to any number of reasons. We shall never know. We do know that the proposal fully informed Congress of Treasury\u2019s long-practiced interpretation and administration of \u00a7 303. Congress\u2019 failure to act or even speak against it reflected at least a then-current willingness to allow that administrative practice to continue unabated and unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-10\">In 1968, the Senate Committee on Finance was advised that Treasury considered \u00a7 303 inapplicable to nonexcessive remis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>sions of excise taxes.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Congress took no action at that time. In 1970, it requested a detailed study on the subject.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">In considering the proposed Trade Reform Act of 1973, which evolved into the Trade Act of 1974, the cognizant Committees of Congress were informed, not only of Treasury\u2019s long continued practice, <em>but of the very remission of the Japanese Commodity Tax and of Zenith\u2019s countervailing duty petition now before us. </em>At that time, also, an amendment defining \u201cbounty or grant\u201d as encompassing the remission of an excise tax, the relief sought here,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> was recommended by a witness but was not adopted.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1295-6\">The Congress did adopt, however, as \u00a7 321(b) of the Trade Act of 1974, the administration\u2019s proposed amendment to \u00a7 203, Antidumping Act of 1921, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 162 (Supp. V 1975). The administration said the amendment would conform the standard in the Antidumping Act to the standard under the countervailing duty law. In recommending the amendment, the House Ways and Means Committee stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMUi\">* * * The amendment would conform the standard in the Antidumping Act to the standard under the countervailing duty law, thereby harmonizing tax treatment under the two statutes. However, your committee, in recommending this amendment, does not express approval or disapproval of the standard employed by the Treasury Department in administering the countervailing duty law with regard to the treatment under that law of rebates or remissions of direct and indirect taxes.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1295-12\">And the Senate Committee on Finance stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1295-13\">* * * The standard in the proposed amendment parallels that standard employed by the Treasury Department under the countervailing duty law in determining whether tax rebates and remissions constitute bounties or grants. However the Committee, in recommending this amendment, does not express approval or disapproval of that Treasury practice.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1295-14\">The effect of the Committees\u2019 mutually contradictory approve-disapprove statements is necessarily to leave untouched the status quo with respect to the administrative practice on countervailing duties.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>Finding no guidance in what the committees said, we look to what the Congress did.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\">The adopted amendment to the Anti-dumping Act provides that in determining \u201cpurchase price\u201d of imports there shall be added to the price charged the importer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANcl\">[a] the amount of any taxes imposed in the country of exportation directly upon the exported merchandise or components thereof, which have been rebated, or which have not been collected, by reason of the exportation of the merchandise to the United States, but only to the extent that such taxes are added to or included in the price of such or similar merchandise when sold in the country of exportation; and [b] <em>plus </em>the amount of any taxes rebated or not collected, by reason of the exportation of the merchandise to the United States, <em>which rebate or non-collection has been determined by the Secretary to be a bounty or grant </em>within the meaning of section 303 of the Tariff Act of 1930. [Emphasis added. P.L. 93-618, \u00a7 321(b), 88 Stat. 2045 (amending 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 162 (1970)]<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKBZ\">In so doing, Congress signaled its continuing intent to let the administrative practice under \u00a7 303 stand unmolested. Having decreased the number of taxes added to the purchase price in (a), to the disadvantage of the exporting manufacturer, Congress than added to the price, in (b), the amount of taxes \u201crebated or not collected\u201d <em>and </em>\u201cdetermined by the Secretary\u201d to be a bounty or grant. If Congress intended that all rebates or noncollections by reason of exportation be deemed bounties or grants, no room would have been left for Secretarial determination. In <em>American Express, </em>supra, we expressed the view that Congress required the Secretary to impose a countervailing duty when a bounty or grant has been bestowed, but left to the Secretary the determination of whether a bounty or grant had in fact been bestowed. Nothing has occurred since 1973 to require change in that view.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1296-9\">\n<em>Summary</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-10\">Nothing in \u00a7 303, or in its legislative history, requires that the remission of an excise tax alone must be deemed a bounty or grant as a matter of law. Congress has, through many years and repeated reen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>actments of \u00a7 303, refrained from exercising its power to make such remission a bounty or grant as a matter of law. There is no judicial precedent requiring that under \u00a7 303 such remission must be deemed a bounty or grant. The remaining tool in the decision-making inventory \u2014 a long-continued administrative practice not inconsistent with law \u2014 rests on an interpretation of \u00a7 303 as not requiring that such remission be deemed a bounty or grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">As the Supreme Court said in <em>Saxbe v. Bustos, </em>419 U.S. at 74, 95 S.Ct. at 279:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWR0\">This longstanding administrative construction is entitled to great weight, particularly when, as here, Congress has revisited the Act and left the practice untouched. Such a history of administrative construction and congressional acquiescence may add a gloss or qualification to what is on its face unqualified statutory language.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1297-6\">Paraphrasing what the Court later said in <em>Saxbe, </em>419 U.S. at 79-80, 95 S.Ct. at 281, to fit our case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-7\">Second, if * * * [a nonexcessive remission of an excise tax alone is now to be deemed a bounty,] the Congress [or the Executive] must do it. The changes suggested implicate so many policies and raise so many problems of a political, economic, and social nature that it is fit that the Judiciary recuse itself. At times judges must legislate \u201cinterstitially\u201d to resolve ambiguities in laws. But the problem of * * * [changing a 79 year administrative practice effecting world trade] is not \u201cinterstitial\u201d or, as Mr. Justice Holmes once put it, \u201cmolecular.\u201d It is a massive or \u201cmolar\u201d action for which the Judiciary is ill-equipped.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1297-9\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-10\">Until lawfully changed, the administrative practice of the Treasury Department, in uniformly considering a nonexcessive remission of an excise tax as failing to constitute a bounty or grant, must stand as a lawfully permissible interpretation of \u00a7 303. On this record, that interpretation is fully applicable to the Japanese Commodity Tax Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-11\">It follows that the Customs Court erred in granting Zenith\u2019s motion for summary judgment and in denying that of the United States. There being no issue of fact, the judgment of the Customs Court is reversed and the case is remanded for entry of an order granting the motion for summary judgment of the United States.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1285-13\">.

A review of the cited and researched cases establishes, as in <em>Downs, </em>that the bounty or grant in each case was found to reside in, and was measured by, an <em>excess </em>over the remission of excise taxes. Nor is that surprising in view of Treasury\u2019s practice, discussed infra. Thus, in <em>Franklin Sugar Refining v.

On appeal in <em>American Express, </em>supra, this court found it unnecessary to review the Customs Court\u2019s broad interpretation of <em>Downs </em>and <em>Nicholas </em>and looked to the many <em>hidden </em>taxes which were remitted in excess of any remitted excise tax. <em>United States v.

Treasury\u2019s administrative practice and some of its rationale was described to Congress in <em>Executive Branch GATT Studies, </em>S.Comm. on Finance, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 11-12 (1974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Al-\">Under administrative precedents dating back to 1897, the Treasury Department has generally not construed the rebate, remission or exemption on exports of ordinary indirect taxes (consumption taxes on goods) to be a \u201cbounty or grant\u201d within the meaning of our countervailing duty statute * * * since exports are not consumed in the country of production, they should not be subject to consumption taxes in that country. * * * application of countervailing duties to the rebate of consumption taxes would have the effect of double taxation * * * the United States would * * * impose * * * Federal and state excise taxes and state and local sales taxes, but would also collect, through * * * countervailing duty, the indirect tax imposed by the exporting country on domestically consumed goods.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7i\">The Treasury Department has not applied these precedents to tax \u201crebates\u201d in excess of taxes collected on the exported product. If, for example, the foreign exporter has paid $1 in excise taxes on a product he exports to the United States but receives a rebate of $1.20 on exportation, under long-established administrative precedents of the Treasury Department the imported merchandise would be subject to a countervailing duty of $0.20. The Treasury Department has historically assumed that an excise tax is part of the price paid by home consumers. On the present record, that must be assumed true of the Japanese Commodity Tax. Where the tax is \u201cpaid\u201d by home consumers, its remission on exports has not been considered a bounty or grant because the remission does not increase the manufacturer\u2019s profit margin. In recent years, a dichotomy has grown among economists regarding the possible difference in result when all or part of the tax is either \u201cforward-shifted\u201d or \u201cabsorbed.\u201d See the commentaries listed supra note 11, and Rosendahl, <em>Border Tax Adjustments: Problems and Proposals, </em>2 Law Pol.Int\u2019l Bus. 85 (1970).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1293-11\">.

Justice Holmes wrote: \u201c[Wjhen for a considerable time a statute notoriously has received a construction in practice from those whose duty it is to carry it out, and afterwards is reenacted in the same words, it may be presumed that the construction is satisfactory to the legislature, unless plainly erroneous, since otherwise naturally the words would have been changed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1294-6\">.

Such arguments are irrelevant here. No agency practice may, for any reason, repeal a statute or overrule the courts. If the practice were in conflict with the statute, the intent of Congress, or judicial precedent, it could not stand, and such arguments would have to be directed to the Congress.

Though Congress\u2019 current interest in governmental assistance to foreign manufacturers may be assumed to have been occasioned by falling shares of the American market for American manufacturers, an abrupt change in a long-standing practice may have been viewed as both counter-productive in a trading world of increasingly interdependent economies and as injurious to American consumers on whom the countervailing duty might fall in the form of increased prices.

Under appropriate conditions, courts may, as we do here, hold that an administrative practice reflects a permissible interpretation of a statute, while neither approving or disapproving the merits of the practice.

Whether Japanese manufacturers absorb or shift the Japanese Commodity Tax, however, is an economic issue not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b1296-7\">.

Whether the Secretary could, however, under appropriate conditions, change present practice and begin to deem excise tax remission alone a bounty or grant is not before us. The value and effect of administrative practice, and the Secretary\u2019s authority to change it, have acquired statutory recognition in the field of customs. Under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1315(d) (Supp. V 1975), a practice setting a particular duty, and found by the Secretary to have been uniform, can be changed to assess a higher duty, but only as to imports occurring at least 30 days after publication of the higher duty.

Rates of tax range generally from 5 to 40 percent. Upon exportation of these products from Japan, the tax is either remitted, if previously paid, or the products are exempted from the payment of the tax. [Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1298-8\">Additionally, in its answer to Zenith\u2019s complaint, the Government admitted that the commodity tax is levied on goods shipped for home consumption and that the tax base is generally the manufacturer\u2019s sales price; however, it denied, \u201cfor lack of knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth thereof,\u201d that the commodity tax rates set forth in the complaint were applicable to the enumerated products.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nevertheless, most of the rates alleged are shown in <em>An Outline of Japanese Taxes </em>130-34 (1975), published by the Tax Bureau, Ministry of Finance (Lib.Cong.Ref.

It then says that \u201cthe record is silent regarding the economic result of the mere remission of the Japanese commodity tax\u201d and that \u201c[t]he Secretary has presumably determined that the economic result here is not the conferring of such a benefit, subsidy, or incentive as would rise to the level of a bounty or grant under \u00a7 303.\u201d To this it adds: \u201cThe factual underpinnings of the Secretary\u2019s negative countervailing duty determination in this case are not under attack.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-13\">Of course, such \u201cfactual underpinnings\u201d are not under attack, because there are none to attack. Indeed, even a <em>presumption </em>that the Secretary made a determination regarding the economic result is rebutted by the record. The majority opinion has confused the Secretary\u2019s determination of whether or not remission of the Japanese commodity tax constitutes the payment or bestowal, \u201cdirectly or indirectly,\u201d of a \u201cbounty or grant,\u201d which is a matter of law, with the factual determination yet to be made by the Secretary of the \u201cnet amounts of the bounty or grant paid or bestowed\u201d (on the basis of which countervailing duties are to be assessed) in accordance with the order of the Customs Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>Concerning the Secretary\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d here, all that the record shows is set forth in (1) the Notice of Preliminary Determination, approved by an assistant Secretary of the Treasury on January 30, 1975 (40 Fed.Reg. 5378), referring to the Notice of Countervailing Duty Proceedings<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in the Federal Register of May 19, 1972 (37 Fed. Reg. 10087), and making a preliminary determination, on the basis of an investigation, that benefits under three Japanese programs (none of which related to the commodity tax) constituted bounties or grants, but were considered to be <em>de minim-is </em>; (2) an amendment to said Notice of Preliminary Determination, approved by an Acting Assistant Secretary of the Treasury on May 2, 1975 (40 Fed.Reg. 19853), adding the following paragraph thereto:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1299-5\">Any other programs alleged to result in the payment or bestowal of a bounty or grant within the meaning of section 303 of the Act have been terminated by the Japanese Government and/or are preliminarily determined not to result in the payment or bestowal of a bounty or grant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1299-6\">and (3) the Final Negative Countervailing Duty Determination, approved by an Acting Assistant Secretary of the Treasury on December 31, 1975 (41 Fed.Reg. 1298), merely repeating the Notice of Preliminary Determination that information developed in the investigation established that benefits under the three Japanese programs (unrelated to the commodity tax) were <em>de minimis </em>and concluding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1299-13\">Accordingly, on the basis of the additional facts gathered and the investigation conducted ... a final determination is hereby made in this proceeding, that for the reasons stated, herein and in the notice referred to above [the Notice of Preliminary Determination], no bounty or grant is being paid or bestowed, directly or indirectly, within the meaning of section 303 . . . upon the manufacturer [sic], production, or exportation of certain consumer electronic products from Japan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1299-15\">Thus, it is seen that there was no determination of economic result by the Secretary with respect to the Japanese commodity tax \u2014 not even a <em>de minimis </em>determination as in the case of the three other programs referred to \u2014 but only a conclusion of law that under any current programs, no bounty or grant is being paid or bestowed, directly or indirectly, within the meaning of section 303.

Upon the exportation of the sugar, the Government remitted or refunded the excise tax due thereon . so that he was enabled to place his product upon the market free from the burden of either the regular or additional excise tax.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-13\">Second. The certificate which the Government issued to him upon the exportation of his sugar had a substantial market value, and was transferable, and operated as a premium, grant, bonus, or reward.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-14\">Looked at from the Russian standpoint, these advantages might, perhaps, be described as a bounty on production, but (in the language of the circuit court of appeals in the <em>Hills Brothers </em>case [United <em>States </em>v. <em>Hills Bros. Co., </em>107 F. 107 (CA 2 1901)], <em>supra) </em>\u201cfrom the standpoint of <em>other countries,\" they </em>become a bounty or grant on exportation.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1300-15\">Although the Fourth Circuit, in affirming the Circuit Court for the District of Maryland, which had affirmed the Board (opinion unreported), held that the Government of Russia secured to the exporter of that country a money reward or gratuity whenever he exported sugar from Russia and premised that holding on its finding that the Russian exporter of sugar received a certificate, it said <em>(Downs v.

However, the basis of its decision rested on its interpretation of the key statutory language, particularly the term \u201cbounty.\u201d Thus, it explained, <em>supra </em>187 U.S. at 502, 23 S.Ct. at 223:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-6\">A bounty may be direct, as where a certain amount is paid upon the production or exportation of particular articles, of which the act of Congress of 1890, allowing a bounty upon the production of sugar, and Rev.Stat. sections 3015-3027, allowing a drawback upon certain articles exported, are examples; or indirect, by the remission of taxes upon the exportation of articles which are subjected to a tax when sold or consumed in the country of their production .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1301-7\">Later in its opinion, the Court applied this interpretation to the Russian government\u2019s remission of excise taxes as follows, <em>supra </em>at 515, 23 S.Ct. at 228:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-8\">The details of this elaborate procedure for the production, sale, taxation and exportation of Russian sugar are of much less importance than the two facts which appear clearly through this maze of regulations, viz.: that no sugar is permitted to be sold in Russia that does not pay an excise tax of R. 1.75 per pood and that sugar exported pays no tax at all. . When a tax is imposed upon all sugar produced, but is remitted upon all sugar exported, then, by whatever process, or in whatever manner, or under whatever name, it is disguised, it is a bounty on exportation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1301-9\">With respect to the certificate part of the Russian scheme, the Court noted, <em>supra </em>at 512, 23 S.Ct. at 227:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-10\">It is practically admitted in this case that a bounty equal to the value of these certificates is paid by the Russian government, and the main argument of the petitioner is addressed to the proposition that this bounty is paid, not upon exportation, but upon production.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1301-12\">Referring to the certificate as an <em>additional </em>bounty, the Court then proceeded to answer petitioner\u2019s argument and to determine that the certificate came within its interpretation of the key statutory language, <em>supra </em>at 513, 23 S.Ct. at 228:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-13\">If the additional bounty paid by Russia upon exported sugar were the result of a higher protective tariff upon foreign sugar, and a further enhancement of prices by a limitation of the amount of free sugar put upon the market, we should regard the effect of such regulations as being simply a bounty upon production, although it might incidentally and remotely foster an increased exportation of sugar; <em>but where in addition to that these regulations exempt sugar exported from excise taxation altogether, </em>we think it clearly falls within the definition of an indirect bounty upon exportation. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1301-14\">Thus, the fact that this \u201cadditional bounty\u201d was coupled with remission of the excise tax, which the Court determined to come within its interpretation of \u201cbounty upon exportation\u201d in the statute, was the basis for its decision that the certificate was \u201can indirect bounty upon exportation.\u201d <em>Had the Court not determined that remission of the excise tax was a \u201cbounty on exportation,\u201d its decision on the certificate portion of the Russian scheme would have been otherwise.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1301-15\">Not to be overlooked is the fact that in their briefs before the Court, both Downs and the Government argued the question of whether the remission of excise taxes upon exportation of sugar is a \u201cbounty or grant on exportation\u201d as the terms were used in the statute, with Downs, the importer, contending in the negative and the Government saying (R 236):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-16\">For it seems that any special favor, benefit, advantage, or inducement conferred by the Government, even if it is given as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>a release from the burden and is not a direct charge upon the Treasury, is fairly included in the idea and meaning of an indirect bounty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">Nevertheless, the majority opinion would treat the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the key language in section 5 as mere dictum, saying that the court\u2019s decision was that the Russian scheme (as a whole) bestowed a bounty and that \u201cthe broad language\u201d (quoted above) \u201cwas not necessary to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision and was not, therefore, its ratio decidendi\u201d; further, that the \u201cbroad language did not constitute a Supreme Court holding that every nonexcessive remission of every excise tax constitutes a bounty or grant as a matter of law.\u201d Of course, the quoted interpretative language did not say that every nonexcessive remission of every excise tax constitutes a bounty or grant. The Court carefully phrased its interpretation to couple with such remission the condition that such tax be paid on the articles when sold or consumed domestically.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To conclude that, because the decision had to do with the \u201cRussian scheme,\u201d which included <em>two </em>bounties, (1) remission of the excise tax and (2) provision of certificates of value, the Court\u2019s interpretation of \u201cbounty\u201d with respect to the remission of the excise tax portion of the scheme is not ratio decidendi is manifestly erroneous. As pointed out above, that interpretation was the basis for the decision that the certificate portion of the scheme was an indirect bounty upon exportation. Moreover, since the Supreme Court clearly determined that <em>both </em>remission of the excise tax and the certificate constituted a bounty, there were two grounds upon either of which it rested its decision. Each ground represented the judgment of the court and was of equal validity with the other. <em>Woods v. Interstate Realty Co., </em>337 U.S. 535, 537, 69 S.Ct. 1235, 93 L.Ed. 1524 (1949); <em>Massachusetts v. United States, </em>333 U.S. 611, 623, 68 S.Ct. 747, 92 L.Ed. 968 (1948); <em>Richmond Co. v. United States, </em>275 U.S. 331, 340, 48 S.Ct. 194, 72 L.Ed. 303 (1928); <em>United States v. Title Insurance Co., </em>265 U.S. 472, 486, 44 S.Ct. 621, 68 L.Ed. 1110 (1924); <em>Union Pacific Co. v. Mason City Co., </em>199 U.S. 160, 166, 26 S.Ct. 19, 50 L.Ed. 134 (1905); <em>Railroad Companies v. Schutte, </em>103 U.S. 118, 143, 26 L.Ed. 327 (1880).</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-8\">Thus, the Court\u2019s determination that remission of the excise tax was a \u201cbounty\u201d did not constitute mere <em>obiter dictum </em>as did the statement treated in <em>Kastigar v. United States, </em>406 U.S. 441, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 32 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972), cited by the majority, whose assertion that \u201cwe confront a case of first impression\u201d simply begs the question. Rather, the Court\u2019s interpretation is akin to the Court\u2019s explanation in <em>Towne v. Eisner, </em>245 U.S. 418, 38 S.Ct. 158, 62 L.Ed. 372 (1918), of the essential nature of a stock dividend in interpreting the Income Tax Act of October 3, 1913.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That explanation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>was relied upon by the Court in <em>Eisner v. Macomber, </em>252 U.S. 189, 40 S.Ct. 189, 64 L.Ed. 521 (1920), where the question was whether a stock dividend, made against profits accumulated by a corporation <em>after March 1, 1913, </em>was taxable under the Revenue Act of 1916. In affirming the judgment below for the taxpayer, the Court said, <em>supra </em>at 204-05, 40 S.Ct. at 192:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-5\">Therefore, <em>Towne v. Eisner </em>cannot be regarded as turning upon the point that the surplus accrued to the company before the act took effect and before adoption of the Amendment. And what we have quoted from the opinion in that case cannot be regarded as <em>obiter dictum, </em>it having furnished the entire basis for the conclusion reached. We adhere to the view then expressed, and might rest the present case there . . . because the conclusion there reached as to the essential nature of a stock dividend necessarily prevents its being regarded as income in any true sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1303-7\">In its efforts to downgrade <em>Downs, </em>the majority opinion ignores the Supreme Court\u2019s own recognition of its precedential value in <em>Nicholas &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>249 U.S. 34, 39 S.Ct. 218, 63 L.Ed. 461 (1919), which involved the petitioner\u2019s protest against the action of collectors of customs at Boston and New York assessing countervailing duties on whiskey and gin imported from Great Britain. The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Customs Appeals (the predecessor to this court), which had affirmed a decision by the Board of General Appraisers (the predecessor to the Customs Court) overruling the protests. The issue was the legality of the countervailing duty, which had been determined to be necessary under Paragraph E of section 4 of the Tariff Act of 1913 (38 Stat. 114)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> by reason of the allowance under British law of three pence per gallon upon plain British spirits and five pence per gallon upon British compounded spirits paid on account of export from the United Kingdom.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Referring to Paragraph E, the Court, <em>supra </em>at 39, 39 S.Ct. at 220, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-11\">The statute was addressed to a condition and its words must be considered as intending to define it, and all of them\u2014 \u201cgrant\u201d as well as \u201cbounty\u201d \u2014 must be given effect. If the word \u201cbounty\u201d has a limited sense the word \u201cgrant\u201d has not. A word of broader significance than \u201cgrant\u201d could not have been used. Like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>its synonyms \u201cgive\u201d and \u201cbestow,\u201d it expresses a concession, the conferring of something by one person upon another. And if the \u201csomething\u201d be conferred by a country \u201cupon the exportation of any article or merchandise\u201d a countervailing duty is required by Paragraph E.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">The Court next, <em>supra </em>at 3\u00a3M0, 39 S.Ct. at 220, stated, in language reminiscent of <em>Downs, </em>the pragmatic principle on which it rested its decision that the payment by the British government was the bestowal \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d of a \u201cbounty or grant\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArE\">We have the fact of spirits able to be sold cheaper in the United States than in the place of their production, and this the result of an act of government because of the destination of the spirits being a foreign market. For that situation Paragraph E was intended to provide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1304-5\">The Court cited <em>United States v. Passavant, </em>169 U.S. 16, 18 S.Ct. 219, 42 L.Ed.2d 644 (1898), as support for its pragmatic approach, saying: \u201cIt [the Court in <em>Passavant] </em>regarded the fact and effect of the remitted excise.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It then recognized the precedential value of <em>Downs,</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> supra </em>249 U.S. at 41, 39 S.Ct. at 221:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1304-6\"><em>Downs v. United States, </em>187 U.S. 496, 23 S.Ct. 222, 47 L.Ed. 275, is a like example [of the pragmatic approach], and direct and indirect bounties are illustrated. <em>[A]s instances of the latter, that is, of indirect bounties, the remission of taxes upon the exportation of articles which are subject to a tax when sold or consumed in the country of their production is given, </em>and, as another example, the laws permitting distillers of spirits to export the same without payment of an internal revenue tax or other burden. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1304-13\">If the majority\u2019s erroneous approach to precedent were followed, the judicial function of statutory interpretation would be reduced to merely deciding that the facts of a particular case are or are not within the reach of a particular statute. The judicial function of giving life and meaning to the words of a statute for guidance to other courts as well as to the executive and legislative branches of government would be emasculated, and interminable litigation would be spawned.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1304-14\">\n<em>Judicial interpretation prevails over \u201clong-continued', uniform, administrative practice\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-15\">The majority opinion states that, since 1898, the Treasury Department has consistently and uniformly interpreted \u00a7 303 as requiring that for a remission of an excise tax to constitute a bounty it must be \u201cexcessive.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It then cites the familiar rule that long-continued, uniform administrative practice, if not contrary to or inconsistent with law, is entitled to great weight, particularly when Congress has failed to revise the statute in the face of such administrative practice; and it finds no Congressional action contrary to or inconsistent with that practice. However, it is to be noted that in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>none of the eases cited by the majority opinion had there been a judicial interpretation with which the administrative practice was in conflict!</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-5\">There is another familiar rule, namely: continued reenactment of a statute following its judicial interpretation (especially by the Supreme Court) creates a presumption of Congressional approval of that interpretation. <em>Shapiro v. United States, </em>335 U.S. 1, 16, 68 S.Ct. 1375, 92 L.Ed. 1787 (1947); <em>Burnet v. Harmel, </em>287 U.S. 103, 108, 53 S.Ct. 74, 77 L.Ed. 199 (1932); <em>Hecht v. Malley, </em>265 U.S. 144, 153, 44 S.Ct. 462, 68 L.Ed. 949 (1924); <em>Latimer </em>v. <em>United States, </em>223 U.S. 501, 504, 32 S.Ct. 242, 56 L.Ed. 526 (1912); <em>Sessions v. Romadka, </em>145 U.S. 29, 42, 12 S.Ct. 799, 36 L.Ed. 609 (1892). As will be more fully developed later, there has been no Congressional action contrary to or inconsistent with the interpretation of the key statutory language in <em>Downs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1305-6\">When there is a conflict between administrative practice and judicial interpretation, as has been the case here, this court\u2019s predecessor long ago held that judicial interpretation prevails. <em>United States v. Douglas &amp; Berry, </em>6 Ct.Cust.App. 100, T.D. 35342 (1915). That case involved the question of whether the imported goods in question were classifiable as \u201cplain woven fabrics\u201d under paragraph 283 of the Tariff Act of 1913. In two earlier cases, the court had interpreted identical language in the predecessor provisions to paragraph 283 (contained in the Tariff Acts of 1897 and 1909) and had rejected the classification of similar goods as \u201cplain woven fabrics.\u201d Responding to the importers\u2019 argument that goods like those in question were, during the history of the Tariff Act of 1909, classified as plain woven fabrics and that employment of that language in the Tariff Act of 1913 must be presumed to be a recognition of such administrative practice, the court said <em>supra </em>at 104:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1305-7\">Force is often given to such administrative practice, but in the present case it is difficult to see how it could have the force contended for, for the reason that prior to the enactment of this tariff law rulings of this court had been made in the two cases cited, and more specifically and definitely in the later case of <em>White v. United States [United States v. White &amp; </em>Co.] (3 Ct.Cust.Appls., 382; T.D. 32968), that excluded the goods in question from the term \u201cplain woven fabrics,\u201d and <em>it is the latter authoritative decision which the Congress must be presumed to have followed rather than the administrative practice. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1305-9\">The fact that the executive branch does not follow the interpretation of a law by the judicial branch does not render that interpretation any less the law. Nor would acquiescence by the legislative branch in the failure of the executive branch to follow the interpretation of the law by the judicial branch do so. Indeed, a contrary conclusion would deny the role of the judicial branch in our system of government \u201cto say what the law is,\u201d as declared in <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803).</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-10\">\n<em>The myth of Congressional acquiescence in administrative practice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-11\">Although the principle stated in <em>United States v. Douglas &amp; Berry </em>disposes of the administrative practice point, the following portion of the majority opinion should be answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1305-12\">[W]e find it difficult to believe that Congress would harbor in its breast a disapproval of an administrative practice for almost 80 years, while remaining so supine or irresponsible as not to change it. . Though the record shows the first specific notice to Congress in 1949, we cannot assume that Congress had earlier reenacted the statute four times without ever informing itself of Treasury\u2019s practice. But whether awareness of the practice has continued for 79 years or for 28 years, the inference of acquiescence from Congress\u2019 failure to act against the practice over the many years involved, and through many reenactments of the statute, overbalances any inference of rejection from failure to codify it. [Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>Actually, the record shows that the \u201cfirst specific notice to Congress\u201d came in 1949 during the course of hearings before the Senate Finance Committee. In 1970 Congress amended section 516 of the Tariff Act of 1930 to provide that, in the case of any imported article or merchandise with respect to which the Secretary has not determined whether or not any bounty or grant is being paid, any person may file a petition setting forth his belief that a bounty or grant is being paid.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Customs Administrative Act of 1970 \u00a7 209, Pub.L. No. 91-271, 84 Stat. 274, 286. (Zenith filed such a petition in this case.) So the period of \u201cawareness\u201d of Treasury\u2019s practice on the part of \u201cCongress\u201d before it endeavored to do something about the practice shrinks from 79 to 21 years. The supposition in the majority opinion of a longer period of \u201cawareness\u201d on the part of <em>Congress </em>is pure speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-4\">As Judge Newman noted in his concurring opinion below, the Treasury Department attempted to persuade Congress to amend section 303 of the Tariff Act of 1930 to accord with the Department\u2019s practice of not assessing countervailing duties on the remission of taxes.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This and another attempt (by the State Department)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> failed. In the perspective of the principle stated in <em>United States v. Douglas &amp; Berry, supra, </em>Judge Newman aptly remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1306-5\">It is apparent, then, that Congress could have, but declined to, nullify the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the countervailing duty statute insofar as tax remissions are concerned. A reasonable conclusion from the congressional rejection of the . proposed amendments . is that Congress was satisfied with the way it had earlier written the statute, and approved of the Supreme Court\u2019s construction of the law.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1306-12\">The majority opinion recalls that during hearings before the House Committee on Ways and Means in 1973 on the bill which matured into the Trade Act of 1974 (Pub.L. No. 93-618, 88 Stat. 1978), \u201ca witness\u201d recommended an amendment defining \u201cbounty or grant\u201d as encompassing the remission of an excise tax and that there was no action taken on the recommendation. This can hardly be said to rise to the level of Congressional acquiescence in administrative practice, much less a repudiation by Congress of the interpretation of the key language in section 303 by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-13\">The majority opinion points to Congressional adoption, as \u00a7 321(b) of the Trade Act of 1974, of an amendment to the Anti-dumping Act, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 162 (Supp. V 1975), which parallels the standard in that Act to the standard set forth in the countervailing duty law; further, to the following statements in the committee reports:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_u\">However, your committee [Ways and Means], in recommending this amendment, does not express approval or disap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>proval of the standard employed by the Treasury Department in administering the countervailing duty law with regard to the treatment under that law of rebates or remissions of direct and indirect taxes. [H.R.Rep. No. 93-571, 93d Cong., 1st-Sess. 69 (1973).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1307-5\">And\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-6\">The standard in the proposed amendment parallels that standard employed by the Treasury Department under the countervailing duty law in determining whether tax rebates and remissions constitute bounties or grants. However, the Committee [Senate Finance], in recommending this amendment, does not express approval or disapproval of that Treasury practice. [S.Rep. No. 93-1298, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 172 (1974), U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1974, pp. 7186, 7309.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1307-7\">On the basis of the foregoing, the majority opinion concludes: \u201cThe effect of the Committees\u2019 mutually contradictory approve-disapprove statements is necessarily to leave untouched the status quo with respect to the administrative practice on countervailing duties.\u201d Again the majority ignores the principle stated in <em>United States v. Douglas &amp; Berry, supra. </em>The correct conclusion is that such statements left untouched the status quo with respect to the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the key language in section 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-8\">The majority opinion notes that, in 1968, the Senate Finance Committee was advised that Treasury considered \u00a7 303 inapplicable to nonexcessive remissions of excise taxes; that no action was taken at that time; and that, in 1970, the Committee requested a detailed study on the subject. The \u201crequest\u201d was a direction to the Tariff Commission contained in section 362 of H.R. 17550, which did not become law. The Senate Finance Committee, in its report on the bill (S.Rep. No. 91-1431, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 281 (1970)) stated, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-13\">The committee is also aware of the Supreme Court cases, and a recent Customs Court case which has interpreted the words \u201cbounty\u201d or \u201cgrant\u201d to apply to virtually all subsidies, including the rebate of indirect taxes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1307-14\">A request for a study was subsequently made jointly by the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and the chairman of the Subcommittee on International Trade to the Tariff Commission, which transmitted its voluminous report, Trade Barriers, <em>supra </em>note 6, in 1974.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This can hardly be said to rise to the level of a repudiation by the Congress of the interpretation of the key language in section 303 by the Supreme Court. Rather, the request for a study by the Tariff Commission constituted merely a prudent step by a Congressional committee to acquire information needed to make a decision whether to recommend any changes in the law beyond the 1970 amendment, referred to above, providing for the filing of a petition by any person setting forth his belief that a bounty or grant is being paid. Following receipt of the Trade Commission\u2019s report, the judicial review provision, discussed <em>infra, </em>was enacted as part of the Trade Act of 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-15\">Referring to this court\u2019s opinion in <em>American Express Co. v. United States, </em>472 F.2d 1050, 60 CCPA 86, C.A.D. 1087 (1973), the majority opinion says that \u201cwe expressed the view that Congress required the Secretary to impose a countervailing duty when a bounty or grant has been bestowed, but left to the Secretary the determination of whether a bounty or grant had in fact been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>bestowed\u201d and that \u201c[n]othing has occurred since 1973 to require change in that view.\u201d However, a close reading of the opinion in that case reveals no suggestion whatsoever that this court would approve a Secretarial determination that was contrary to the interpretation of \u201cbounty\u201d by the Supreme Court. With respect to what has occurred since 1973, provision in the Trade Act of 1974 for judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s determination that a bounty or grant is not being paid on foreign merchandise reflects, as shown <em>infra </em>note 26, expressed <em>Congressional concern </em>over \u201cinaction or insufficient action, or . excessive delay in the administrative process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-5\">That provision was enacted in response to the majority opinion of this court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hammond Lead Products, Inc., supra </em>note 3. Hammond Lead had filed a complaint with the Commissioner of Customs asserting that litharge<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> imported from Mexico was the recipient of a bounty or grant from the Mexican government and, therefore, that a countervailing duty was required to be imposed under section 303 of the Tariff Act of 1930. The Commissioner of Customs, acting for the Secretary, responded that the classification and rate of duty on litharge was correct and that countervailing duties were not applicable. Hammond Lead then brought an action in the Customs Court under section 516(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930, protesting the classification and rate of duty. The Government and one Ralph Vails, Party-In-Interest, moved to dismiss on the ground that the Customs Court lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter of an American manufacturer\u2019s protest which complained that the Secretary failed to invoke a countervailing duty. Motions to dismiss were denied, and trial on the merits followed. The Customs Court sustained Hammond Lead\u2019s protest on the theory that there was an indirect bounty or grant on export of the litharge from Mexico.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1308-9\">On appeal, this court, split 3-2, held that the Customs Court lacked jurisdiction.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> It concluded, <em>supra </em>440 F.2d at 1030, 58 CCPA at 137:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-10\">All considered, it appears that countervailing duty is a penal exaction<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> that the Congress did not intend the courts to impose, should the Treasury be recalcitrant, in a 516(b) proceeding .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1308-11\">In the course of extended dicta, the majority opinion obliquely referred to the \u201cdicta\u201d in <em>Downs </em>and went on to say, <em>supra </em>440 F.2d at 1032, 58 CCPA at 140-41:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-12\">It may be asked, if our interpretation of section 516(b) is correct, does it leave the American Manufacturer entirely remediless even in case of an arbitrary and capricious refusal by Treasury to take appropriate action under the countervailing duty law. It is difficult to answer the question without deciding in dictum cases not before us, but a few observations will be made. The Second Circuit, in <em>J. C. Penney Company Inc. v. United States, </em>439 F.2d 63 (decided March 1, 1971), has considered the new statute and reaffirmed holdings under the old, that the regular Federal courts will not interfere in customs cases reviewable in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>Customs Court, because an importer desires to tailor a remedy more satisfactory to him than the Customs Court affords. . Thus it may be that any decision limiting 516(b) may correspondingly limit the access of a complaining domestic industry to any kind of court relief. On the other hand, the modern tendency to fashion a remedy for any injury is a strong one, and it could be the regular courts would take jurisdiction in cases outside section 516(b), where the domestic industry showed clear illegality and substantial injury. Such a proceeding would not be a <em>de novo </em>determination like the one the court below made here, but would, we think, be more in the nature of a review of the administrative decision, which would be overturned only if found arbitrary, capricious, or not founded on substantial evidence. A court considering the fashioning of such relief would have to consider its need in light of judicial remedies, and also such extrajudicial ones as the domestic industry might have, in resort to the Congress or to the Tariff Commission. We do not undertake to predict the answer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1309-6\">The response of Congress was to include in the Trade Act of 1974 an amendment to section 516 which, as noted above, provides for judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s determination that a bounty or grant is not being paid on foreign merchandise.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> As a prelude to this Congressional action, in 1972 the Senate had tacked onto a minor House-passed tariff bill an amendment providing for judicial review, at the instance of American producers, of negative countervailing duty determinations by the Secretary.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Although the amendment was accepted by the House-Senate conferees (H.R.Rep. No. 92-1583, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. (1972); S.Rep. No. 92-1298, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. (1972)), the Conference Report was not brought to a vote in the House as an accommodation to the Secretary, with the understanding that the matter would be given attention in the context of trade legislation in the next Congress (118 Cong.Rec. 37098 (1972)). The judicial review provision was subsequently included in the House-passed version of what became the Trade Act of 1974, with the House Ways and Means Committee Report expressing similar views to those of the Senate Finance Committee (quoted in note 26, <em>supra) </em>in its report accompanying the 1972 bill (H.R.Rep. No. 93-571, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 76 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-12\">In view of the foregoing, the conclusion is inescapable that the Congress has not acquiesced in the administrative practice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>failing to recognize the ordinary remission of excise taxes as a bounty or grant for purposes of section 303, much less repudiated, or given any signal of its disfavor with, the interpretation of the key language in section 303 by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-4\">\n<em>Date for imposition of countervailing duties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-5\">The Customs Court ordered that countervailing duties be assessed on the subject electronic products exported from Japan effective the day following the date of entry of its order. Section 516(g) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516(g)), provides that only merchandise entered for consumption (or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption) after the date of <em>publication </em>of a Customs Court\u2019s decision will be affected. Therefore, the Government argues that the Customs Court\u2019s order in this case \u201cencompasses entries the liquidation of which is not the proper subject of direction by the Customs Court under the enabling statute, which is clearly jurisdictional in its scope and effect.\u201d Appellee contends that <em>entry </em>of the Customs Court\u2019s order constituted <em>\u201cpublication </em>\u201d for purposes of section 516(g) and that the Customs Court\u2019s order was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-6\">Section 257 of 28 U.S.C. provides that all decisions of the Customs Court shall be filed and be open to inspection and that the Secretary shall <em>publish </em>weekly such decisions as he or the court may designate and abstracts of all other decisions. Thus, the statutes distinguish between filing or entry of a decision and <em>publication </em>thereof, which obviously would not occur simultaneously with the filing or entry. Until January 4, 1967, publication was in \u201cTreasury Decisions.\u201d Effective January 4, 1967, the name was changed to \u201cCustoms Bulletin\u201d (31 Fed.Reg. 16580).</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-7\">Although appellee argues that \u201cpublication\u201d means \u201cmaking available to the public,\u201d which would occur upon the filing or entry of court orders and decisions, I am satisfied that the word \u201cpublication\u201d in section 516(g) and the word \u201cpublish\u201d in section 257 are in pari materia; further, that acquiescence by Congress in the Secretary\u2019s practice of carrying out its mandate in section 257 creates a presumption of Congressional approval of that practice. Appellee has provided no evidence clearly showing Congressional disapproval of that practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-9\">Accordingly affirmance of the Customs Court\u2019s decision and judgment with respect to the Japanese commodity tax should be coupled with an order that the order of the Customs Court with respect to the imposition of countervailing duties be modified (1) to become effective the day after the date of publication of its decision in the Customs Bulletin and (2) to provide that assessment of countervailing duties be subject to possible suspension under the provisions of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1303(d)(2).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1298-9\">.

If the majority remains convinced that the economic result of the remission of the Japanese commodity tax is decisive of the issue before us, it should at least remand the case to the Customs Court for development of a record on that point, a task that court is specially equipped to undertake. Failing that, I suggest that the rates of the Japanese commodity tax are such as to establish prima facie that the economic impact <em>(e.g. </em>competitiveness of Japanese exports vis-\u00e1-vis U. S. manufacturers) of remission of the tax would not be <em>de minimis. </em>Significantly, the United States Tariff Commission (now International Trade Commission) made the following statement in its report to the Senate Finance Committee, 5 TRADE BARRIERS 39 (1974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1299-17\">For all but a very few U. S. products, the differential between domestic and export prices which is attributable to the exemption of exports from internal consumption taxes is substantially lower than the price differential found in products of most other major trading nations resulting from the exemption of exports from their domestic consumption taxes.

S. exports. Moreover, similar border adjustments by the United States would be an ineffective weapon, neither mitigating nor offsetting the discriminatory process, because the tax structure of the United States places relatively small emphasis on indirect taxes. This issue is one that the United States will have to resolve.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1300-9\">. \u201cThat whenever any country . . . shall pay or bestow directly or indirectly, any bounty . upon the exportation of any article or merchandise from such country . . . There is no support for the statement in the majority opinion that there was \u201ccongressional refusal\u201d to define the words \u201cbounty\u201d or \u201cgrant.\u201d Customs Law dictates that the common meaning of such words is intended in the absence of evidence to the contrary. <em>United States v. C. J. Tower &amp; Sons, </em>48 CCPA 87, 89, C.A.D. 770 (1961); <em>Meyer &amp; Lange v. United States, </em>6 Ct.Cust.App. 181, T.D. 35436 (1915). <em>Webster's International Dictionary </em>(1890) defines \u201cbounty\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-18\">4. A premium offered or given ... to encourage any branch of industry, as husbandry or manufactures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1300-19\">It was merely customary legislative practice for Congress to leave it to the Treasury Department, subject to judicial review, to make individual determinations within such a broad definition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1302-5\">. Whether the \u201cbounty or grant\u201d in a particular case would be <em>de minimis </em>(not, therefore, warranting imposition of a countervailing duty) or what the net amount of the \u201cbounty or grant\u201d would be as a basis for imposition of a countervailing duty is, of course, another matter. Thus, as appellant has shown, the market value of the certificate in <em>Downs </em>was from 1.25 to 1.64 rubles per pood, and the excise tax remitted was 1.75 rubles per pood; whereas, the <em>net </em>bounty determined ranged from only .38 to .50 rubles per pood (T.D. 22814, 4 Treas.Dec. 184 (1901)). It is not disclosed what factors entered into the determination. See F. <em>W. Woolworth Co. v.

The lower court had decided for the taxpayer, treating the question as inseparable from interpretation of the Sixteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court disposed of the question upon consideration of the essential nature of a stock dividend, disregarding the fact that the dividend involved was based upon surplus earnings that accrued before the Sixteenth Amendment took effect, and quoting from its opinion in <em>Gibbons v.

Paragraph E was substantially the same as section 303 of the Tariff Act of 1930 and as section 303(a)(1) under the 1970 amendment, the statute herein involved. Paragraph E was preceded by Paragraph E of section 4 of the Tariff Act of 1913 (38 Stat. 114, 193); section 6 of the Tariff Act of 1909 (36 Stat. 11, 85); and section 5 of the Tariff Act of 1897 (30 Stat. 151, 205). Prior to the latter, paragraph 182*/2 of the Tariff Act of 1894 (28 Stat. 509, 521) provided for payment of additional duty on sugar, syrups, and molasses where the exporting country paid a <em>bounty </em>on the export thereof; and paragraph 237 of the Tariff Act of 1890 (26 Stat. 567, 584) made similar provision in the case of sugar only. In its brief, the Government contends that the 1897 Act was intended to apply to the refund of taxes only to the extent that the \u201crefund\u201d exceeded the amount of tax actually paid (i. e. the \u201cexcessive remission\u201d). This appears to have been so under the specific language of the 1890 and 1894 Acts. However, different language appeared in the subsequent acts, and the legislative history of the 1897 Act cited by the Government can hardly be used now to overturn the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation in <em>Downs </em>of \u201cbounty\u201d in the 1897 Act. The Government\u2019s argument, of course, has no application to \u201cgrant\u201d (added by the 1897 Act). If it did, it would imply that there was no Congressional purpose in adding \u201cgrant\u201d to the language of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1303-13\">.

The additional duty must be equal to the amount of the bounty or grant, thereby neutralizing the artificial advantage afforded the foreign product by virtue of the subsidy. Consequently, countervailing duties are not, nor were they ever intended to be, penal in nature: they are remedial in nature inasmuch as they operate to offset the effect of subsidies afforded foreign merchandise.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
