Durns appeals from a judgment of conviction for violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201, the federal kidnapping statute. He contends the trial court erred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-9\">(1) in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on grounds of insufficiency of the evidence to sustain the conviction for the offense charged;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-10\">(2) in failing to give the jury a requested lesser included offense instruction, and in failing to give an instruction on identity in the form requested;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-11\">(3) in admitting into evidence a tape recording of a telephone conversation and allowing the recording to be played to the jury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-12\">(4) in admitting into evidence a revolver, a knife and certain articles of clothing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-13\">(5) in admitting into evidence testimony relating to a prior act of the defendant similar to the offense charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-14\">A fair construction of appellant\u2019s specifications of error reveals that all, except the alleged error in failing to instruct on lesser included offense, relate to the issue of identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-19\">I. Facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-20\">The indictment under which appellant was convicted arose out of a series of events beginning on July 8,1976. Around noon on that day, Ethel M. Tanquary of Overland Park, Kansas, parked her car near the Ward Parkway Shopping Center in Kansas City, Missouri. As she was getting out of her automobile, a man forced his way into the car, declaring that he was armed with a knife and a gun and announced a robbery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He took control of the car and drove, with Mrs. Tanquary in the car, several miles south to a gravel road, where he stopped to search Mrs. Tanquary\u2019s purse and remove rings from her fingers. Mrs. Tanquary signed a blank check for her abductor, who then placed tape over her eyes and tied her hands and feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-21\">From the gravel road the abductor drove to the Overland Park State Bank on Met-calf, located in Kansas, and attempted to cash the check signed by Mrs. Tanquary. The teller at the drive-in window of the bank refused to cash the check because of the amount.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> From the Overland Park State Bank the abductor drove back to the Ward Parkway Shopping Center, where he transferred his victim to another automobile. From the Ward Parkway Shopping Center he drove to an apartment in Kansas City, Missouri, where Mrs. Tanquary was held captive.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-22\">While Mrs. Tanquary was being held at the apartment, negotiations for her release were conducted between her abductor and her son, Edward Tanquary. Mr. Tanquary was first contacted at approximately 12:45 P.M. on July 8, the day his mother was kidnapped. At that time he was told where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>his mother\u2019s car was located, and was instructed to get together $22,000 cash in tens, twenties and fifties. The caller informed Mr. Tanquary that he would contact him again the following day at approximately 5:00 P.M. with further instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">After the initial phone conversation, Mr. Tanquary contacted his attorney, who in turn notified the Overland Park Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Tanquary assembled the ransom money as instructed, and with two agents of the F.B.I. awaited further word from the caller at his mother\u2019s apartment. With Tanquary\u2019s permission, one of the F.B.I. agents installed a listening and recording device on the phone at his mother\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The next day, July 9, at approximately 5:00 P.M., Mr. Tanquary received instructions over the phone telling him where and when to drop the ransom money. The drop was made as instructed, and Mrs. Tanquary was released unharmed in Kansas City, Missouri, at approximately 8:30 P.M. on July 9. Around midnight that night, Appellant Durns was arrested at his apartment, and in a search of his person arresting authorities found a quantity of the ransom money, a knife and a wallet containing identification of Donald E. Durns.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">A search of Durns\u2019 apartment<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on July 10 turned up approximately $20,000 in ransom money as well as some bindings and tape used to restrain Mrs. Tanquary during her stay in the apartment, and a paper cup with lipstick smears later identified as having come from Mrs. Tanquary. The same day, July 10, the F.B.I. also recovered from Shirley Nicholi, an ex-girlfriend of Durns, a ring identified by Mrs. Tanquary as one taken from her during the kidnapping, a revolver and a quantity of the ransom money. Shirley Nicholi testified at trial that these items were given to her by Durns, although she was unable to identify the weapon.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A 1970 white over blue Dodge automobile was also recovered from behind Shirley Nicholi\u2019s residence, which was identified at trial as the one used in the kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-13\">At trial, Mrs. Tanquary described her abductor in general terms as a white man between 45 and 50 years old, 5 feet 10 or 11 inches tall, weighing approximately 185 pounds, clean shaven, with dark hair, graying at the temples, and wearing dark rimmed glasses. She was unable to positively identify Durns as her abductor.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-14\">Testimony at trial included that of Janet Renick, who described an incident which occurred on June 28, 1976. Mrs. Renick testified that as she approached her car after shopping at the Prairie Village Shopping Center in Prairie Village, Kansas, an individual whom she identified as Durns was seated in a white over blue Dodge with a license number matching that of the Dodge found behind Shirley Nicholi\u2019s residence. The individual got out of his car, grabbed Mrs. Renick, held a gun to her head and announced a kidnapping. Mrs. Renick struggled with her assailant and was able to break free. Her assailant panicked, returned to his car and fled the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-15\">II. Identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-16\">Appellant concedes, and the record is clear, that the statutory elements to establish the crime of kidnapping under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201 were proven.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s argument is that the evidence is insufficient to establish that <em>he </em>committed the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-17\">On appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence, the court must view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict rendered. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). It must accept as established any and all reasonable inferences from the evidence that tend to support the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>United States v. Overshon, </em>494 F.2d 894, 896 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 853, 878, 95 S.Ct. 96, 42 L.Ed.2d 85 (1974). The evidence need not \u201cexclude every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt [; it is enough] that it be sufficient to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty.\u201d <em>United States v. Shahane, </em>517 F.2d 1173, 1177 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 893, 96 S.Ct. 191, 46 L.Ed.2d 124 (1975). Furthermore, because circumstantial evidence is intrinsically as probative as direct evidence, <em>Holland v. United States, </em>348 U.S. 121, 140, 75 5. Ct. 127, 99 L.Ed. 150 (1954), the same standard applies where a conviction rests entirely on circumstantial evidence. <em>United States v. Carlson, </em>547 F.2d 1346, 1360 (8th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The following circumstantial evidence presented by the prosecution at trial, when viewed under the applicable standards, is clearly sufficient to sustain the finding by the jury that it was Durns who committed the act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">(a) The vehicle used in the kidnapping, a 1970 Dodge, was owned by an ex-girlfriend of defendant, and the car was in Durns\u2019 possession during the period in which the kidnapping took place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">(b) The apartment in which the kidnap victim was held for nearly two days was leased to Durns.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">(c) The bulk of the ransom money was recovered from Durns\u2019 apartment; part of the ransom money was recovered from Durns\u2019 person the night of the ransom transfer, and part was recovered the day following the transfer from his ex-girlfriend, Shirley Nicholi, the owner of the 1970 Dodge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-12\">(d) The ring taken from the kidnap victim, a revolver found under the seat of the Dodge, a part of the ransom money, and the Dodge automobile were turned over to Shirley Nicholi by Durns.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-13\">(e) Durns was identified by a bank teller as the man who attempted to cash a $12,000 check in the drive-up window of Overland Park State Bank on July 8, 1976.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-14\">Our holding that the foregoing evidence relating to the issue of identity is sufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s determination on that issue, taken together with appellant\u2019s concession that the elements of the crime had been proven, renders the appellant\u2019s remaining specifications of error relating to identity, specifically 3, 4 and 5 as set out in this opinion, somewhat moot on that issue. We therefore need only consider whether admitting the evidence in question in those specifications was error, and, if error, whether it was prejudicial. <em>United States v. Bartlett, </em>449 F.2d 700, 706 (8th Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 932, 92 S.Ct. 990, 30 L.Ed.2d 808 (1972); <em>Lowe v. United States, </em>389 F.2d 108, 112 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>392 U.S. 912, 88 S.Ct. 2072, 20 L.Ed.2d 1371 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-15\">III. Tape Recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-16\">The telephone conversation recorded on tape and played to the jury was the July 9 call from the kidnapper to Edward Tanquary, giving him instructions for the ransom drop. Appellant challenges the admissibility of the recording, alleging the caller was not identified. He bases his challenge on <em>United States v. McMillan, </em>508 F.2d 101 (8th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 916, 95 S.Ct. 1577, 43 L.Ed.2d 782 (1975), wherein this Court set out the foundational requirements for the admission of evidence obtained by electronic monitoring.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>concedes that six of the seven foundational requirements of <em>McMillan </em>were met, but contends that, because the evidence at trial was not sufficient to identify the speaker, the recording failed to qualify under the final <em>McMillan </em>requirement, and was thus not admissible. Durns claims that admission of the tape into evidence under these circumstances violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and his Fifth Amendment right to due process of law. Appellant\u2019s claims are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">In <em>McMillan, </em>this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">It is now well settled that a defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights are not violated when the defendant\u2019s conversations with a government informant are electronically monitored by a government agent with the consent of the informant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">508 F.2d at 104 (citations omitted). It follows that an abductor, holding his victim for ransom, has not had his Fourth Amendment rights violated when his communication with the party who is to pay the ransom is electronically recorded by a government agent with the consent of that party.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Durns\u2019 Fifth Amendment claim goes to the heart of the <em>McMillan </em>foundational requirements, the purpose of which is to insure that only competent and reliable tape recording evidence adverse to an accused is allowed to go before the trier of fact. These requirements do not, however, exist <em>in vacuo; </em>they become meaningful only when viewed in light of the facts of a specific case.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">In the case at bar, a call was made by Mrs. Tanquary\u2019s abductor to her son shortly after she was kidnapped. The son was told where he could find his mother\u2019s car, and that her driver\u2019s license, the car</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">keys and a safety deposit box key were under a floor mat inside the car. Hp was also told he would be contacted the following day at approximately five o\u2019clock with instructions for transfer of the ransom money. At about five o\u2019clock the next day the son received another telephone call from the abductor, this time at his mother\u2019s apartment. His mother was put \u201con the line\u201d for a few moments; she stated she was all right and that Tanquary, her son, should do exactly as her abductor said. The abductor then hung up the phone after stating he would call back within five minutes. Approximately thirty seconds later he called back with instructions to leave the ransom money at a certain spot at a specific time. About ten minutes after the money was delivered as instructed, it was picked up, and a little over an hour later Mrs. Tanquary was released. In these circumstances, and especially in light of the similarity between what was arranged on the telephone and what subsequently occurred,</p>\n<p id=\"Ald\"><em>United States v. Hassell, </em>547 F.2d 1048, 1054-55 (8th Cir. 1977), we conclude there was more than sufficient evidence to identify the caller as Ethel Tanquary\u2019s abductor under the <em>McMillan </em>test. <em>United States v. McMillan, </em>508 F.2d at 105; <em>United States v. Bonanno, </em>487 F.2d 654, 659 (2d Cir. 1973); <em>Van Riper v. United States, </em>13 F.2d 961, 968 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>273 U.S. 702, 47 S.Ct. 102, 71 L.Ed. 848 (1926). The tape recording met the <em>McMillan </em>requirements in every respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-14\">Our conclusion is based on the purpose for which the tape recording evidence was offered. Government counsel, in response to defense counsel\u2019s objection at trial, stated that the purpose of the offer of the tape recording was (1) to introduce evidence of a holding \u201cfor ransom or reward,\u201d one of the elements of the offense of kidnapping which the prosecution was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, and (2) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>show the means by which this particular crime of kidnapping for ransom was committed. The decision of the trial court to admit the offered evidence on this basis was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Durns raises an additional issue of prejudice with respect to the tape recording evidence; in substance, he argues that the jury was allowed by the court\u2019s ruling to speculate as to whether he, Durns, was the \u201cother party on the line.\u201d However, the trial judge properly cautioned the jury prior to the playing of the tape as to the purpose of its introduction and as to the proper scope of the jury\u2019s consideration of it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We find this assertion of prejudice without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">IV. Evidence of Weapons and Clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The kidnap victim, Ethel Tanquary, testified that at the time of her abduction she was told by her abductor that he had a knife and a gun and that he would use them if he had to; she further testified that an object was pressed against her side which she was told was a gun, a portion of which she saw and described at trial as being gold in color. When Durns was arrested the night Mrs. Tanquary was released, a knife with a brass end was taken from his person. A revolver, fully loaded, was recovered from his ex-girlfriend, Shirley Nicholi, who testified that at the direction of Durns she took the gun out of the Dodge automobile driven by Durns on the night of July 9, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">We conclude both weapons were sufficiently identified and linked to defendant to have warranted their admission into evidence. <em>Caldwell v. United States, </em>338 F.2d 385, 390 (8th Cir. 1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>380 U.S. 984, 85 S.Ct. 1354, 14 L.Ed.2d 277 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Appellant claims he was prejudiced by the admission in evidence of various items of clothing either worn by him at the time of his arrest or taken from his apartment, but as to those items he has wholly failed to carry his burden to demonstrate prejudicial error. <em>See United States v. Bartlett, </em>449 F.2d at 706, and <em>Lowe v. United States, </em>389 F.2d at 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-12\">IV. Evidence of Other Crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-13\">One Janet Renick was permitted to testify at trial, over objection, that on June 28, 1976, just ten days prior to the Tanquary kidnapping, Durns attempted unsuccessfully to abduct her in a manner similar to that employed in abducting Mrs. Tanquary.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-14\">Evidence of other criminal conduct is inadmissible unless it is relevant to prove motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident. Fed.R.Ev. 404(b).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-15\">It was not an abuse of discretion for the court to admit relevant evidence of the essential issue of motive and intent unless the court found that its probative value was \u201csubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 403.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-16\"><em>United States v. Adcock, </em>558 F.2d 397 (8th Cir. 1977). <em>See also United States v. Maestas, </em>554 F.2d 834 (8th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-17\">The thrust of Durns\u2019 defense at trial and the thrust of his appeal in this Court was on the issue of identity. The other crime evidence was relevant to that issue. On appeal Durns does not raise an issue of its relevancy. He does argue, as he did to the trial court, that it was \u201chighly prejudicial and that its probative worth was far outweighed by its probable prejudicial impact.\u201d The trial court overruled his objections and did not find a danger of unfair prejudice outweighing its probative value. We hold the admission of the evidence was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Y. Jury Instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"ATK\">Appellant\u2019s remaining specification of error relates to jury instructions. His principal contention is that a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201, the kidnapping statute, necessarily encompasses a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202, which prohibits the receipt, possession or disposition of ransom money.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, he argues, the jury should have been instructed on \u00a7 1202 as a lesser included offense<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the provisions of \u00a7 1202 should have been set out in the instructions. He also asserts as error the court\u2019s refusal to give a portion of defendant\u2019s proposed instruction on the issue of identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">a. <em>Lesser included offense.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">In <em>Sansone v. United States, </em>380 U.S. 343, 85 S.Ct. 1004, 13 L.Ed.2d 882 (1965), the Supreme Court held that a lesser included offense charge is proper where the charged greater offense upon which an accused is tried requires the jury to find an additional disputed element which is not required for conviction of the lesser included offense. <em>Id. </em>at 350, 85 S.Ct. 1004. This principle was the basis for the test set forth in <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>492 F.2d 359 (8th Cir. 1974), in which this Court held that in order for a defendant to be entitled to a lesser included offense instruction, it must appear that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">(1) a proper request is made; (2) the elements of the lesser offense are identical to part of the elements of the greater offense; (3) there is some evidence which would justify conviction of the lesser offense; (4) the proof of the element or elements differentiating the two crimes is sufficiently in dispute so that the jury may consistently find the defendant innocent of the greater and guilty of the lesser included offense; and (5) there is mutuality .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">492 F.2d at 362 (emphasis deleted). <em>See also United States v. Klugman, </em>506 F.2d 1378 (8th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-14\">The indictment in this case charged defendant with having willfully and knowingly transported in interstate commerce Ethel M. Tanquary, who had theretofore been unlawfully seized, kidnapped and carried away and held by defendant for the purpose of ransom, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201. Establishing a violation of \u00a7 1202 requires proof of a knowing receipt, possession or disposition of money or property which was delivered as ransom or reward, elements that are clearly not identical to any of the elements of a \u00a7 1201 kidnapping offense. The trial court was correct in refusing to instruct on \u00a7 1202 as a lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-15\">\n<em>b. Identification.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b623-16\">The trial court charged the jury quite exhaustively on the issue of identification, utilizing most of defendant\u2019s proposed instruction, which was based on <em>United States v. Telfaire, </em>152 U.S.App.D.C. 146, 152-153, 469 F.2d 552, 558-59 (1972). However, the court deleted the first and last paragraphs of the <em>Telfaire </em>model instruction, and Durns challenges the omission of these paragraphs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-17\">This Court recently discussed the circumstances in which a jury should be instructed on the issue of identification along the lines of the <em>Telfaire </em>instruction. In <em>United States v. Dodge, </em>538 F.2d 770 (8th Cir. 1976), it stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-18\">[although we do not specifically adopt the <em>Telfaire </em>model instruction today, we will view with grave concern the failure to give specific and detailed instructions on identification in future cases <em>where identification of the defendant is based </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number><em>solely or substantially on eyewitness testimony.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 784 (emphasis added). The focus of this Court\u2019s inquiry in <em>Dodge </em>was on the situation where there is little or \u201cno evidence of identification except eyewitness testimony.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">As noted previously, there was substantial circumstantial evidence in this case, other than eyewitness testimony, identifying Durns as the criminal actor. This case is not one in which the identification of the defendant was based solely or substantially on eyewitness testimony. The court\u2019s instruction on identification was clearly adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b618-16\">. Although the individual announced that he was armed, Mrs. Tanquary did not see a weapon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b618-23\">. Under bank policy, checks for amounts over $500 could not be cashed at drive-up windows.
