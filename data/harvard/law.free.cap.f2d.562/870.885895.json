Sigal, its president, (hereinafter referred to collectively as \u201cAMI\u201d). The defendants denied infringement and counterclaimed for a declaration that the patent was invalid and for damages resulting from Paeco\u2019s alleged violations of the Clayton and Sherman Antitrust Acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-26\">In determining whether to grant Paeco an injunction against further infringement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>the district court, Troutman, J., severed the issues of damages and antitrust violations and tried the issues of validity and infringement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In two thorough and scholarly opinions,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Judge Troutman concluded that Claim 1 of the patent was invalid under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b) (1970),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that Claims 2 and 3 were invalid under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a) and (b) (1970) and also under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103, and that Claims 4 and 5 were not infringed. Accordingly, the district court denied Paeco\u2019s request for injunctive relief. Although holding that AMI had failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that Paeco had procured the patent through fraud on the patent office, the district court nevertheless concluded that the case was \u201cexceptional\u201d under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285 (1970) entitling AMI to reasonable attorney fees. Both Paeco and AMI have filed appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">For reasons discussed hereafter, we have concluded that our sole source of jurisdiction is 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) and that our review is therefore directed to those issues bearing on the district court\u2019s denial of injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">I. CLAIM 1</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">Claim 1 of the patent reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"A2e\">1. Replica wooden beams fabricated entirely of molded foam plastic material having the characteristics of rigid urethane foam comprising portions thereof molded to present the appearance of fasteners utilized to secure the replica beams with a surface or with similar replica beams.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-12\">The district court held Claim 1 invalid under \u00a7 102(b) and Paeco appeals from that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-13\">Section 102(b)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> establishes \u201cnovelty\u201d as a prerequisite to a patent. If the invention described in a patent claim was in public use or on sale or described in a printed publication more than one year prior to the date of application for the patent,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the invention is said to lack \u201cnovelty\u201d and the claim is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-14\">The learned district judge accurately stated the law concerning invalidity under \u00a7 102(b): Every patent comes into court clothed with a presumption of validity, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282 (1970); and the party challenging the validity of a patent bears a heavy burden of demonstrating by clear and convincing proof a prior use or sale of the patented invention or the patent\u2019s deficiency in some other respect. <em>See Trio Process Corp. v. L. Goldstein\u2019s Sons, Inc., </em>461 F.2d 66, 70 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 997, 93 S.Ct. 319, 34 L.Ed.2d 262 (1972). Once the party asserting invalidity has convincingly proven the prior use or sale, however, the burden shifts to the patentee to prove that any prior use, sale, or printed publication was for experimental, not commercial, purposes. <em>Azoplate Corp. v. Silverlith, Inc., </em>367 F.Supp. 711 (D.Del.), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>506 F.2d 1050 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 914, 95 S.Ct. 1572, 43 L.Ed.2d 780 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-15\">Applying these principles to the instant case, the district court found that prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>the critical date, Paeco itself sold replica wooden \u201cColony\u201d beams substantially identical to those described in Claim l,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that the sale of these beams was commercially, not experimentally, motivated. Accordingly, Claim 1 was adjudged invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">A. <em>Prior Use or Sale</em></p>\n<p id=\"ADk\">The controversy concerning the Colony beams, in this court as in the district court, centers on the characterization of the protuberances randomly spaced along the sides at the top of each Colony beam giving the appearance of somehow connecting or affixing the beam to the ceiling. Paeco concedes that it sold Colony beams prior to the critical date and that the beams featured protuberances along their sides. The question is whether these protuberances were substantially identical to those described as follows in Claim 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-6\">1. Replica wooden beams fabricated entirely of molded foam plastic material comprising portions thereof molded to present the appearance of fasteners utilized to secure the replica beams with a surface or with similar replica beams.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">To prove the substantial identity between the protuberances of the Colony beam and those described in Claim 1, AMI relied first on the following explanatory language from the patent specification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-8\">[T]he replica beam or panels may be molded or fabricated to additionally represent or provide replicas of fastening means, such as bolts, pegs, dowels, or the like, particularly adjacent the edges or ends therewith, as would ordinarily be utilized to secure the wooden beams with a surface or with each other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">Secondly, AMI presented evidence showing that the Colony beam protuberances were characterized as \u201cpegs\u201d on Paeco\u2019s advertising display boards and in at least one inter-office daily report prepared by Paeco\u2019s president. AMI also used scholarly books on the history of barn architecture to show that peg-shaped pieces of wood were sometimes employed to fasten beams to ceilings. Based on this evidence, AMI argued that the protuberances of the Colony beams as well as the beams themselves fit well within the language of and the specification explaining the Claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-12\">Paeco attempted to counter AMI\u2019s argument with testimony by Bassett, the patentee, that the terms \u201cedges\u201d and \u201cends\u201d in the specification were intended by him to denote a location not along the side of the beams but instead at either end of a given beam. Bassett testified that he had envisioned a pattern of short beam segments joined end-to-end or intersecting on a ceiling to create an integrated beamed ceiling system. The protuberances described in Claim 1 and in the specifications, according to Bassett, were intended to give the appearance of fasteners which joined one beam segment to the next in such an integrated system of beams. As such, Bassett reasoned, the protuberances could be located only at the ends of beams, not along the side of the beams where the Colony beam \u201cpegs\u201d were placed. Paeco presses these same arguments on appeal, stressing Bassett\u2019s concept of a beamed ceiling system with molded protuberances at the end of each beam designed to give the appearance of fastening one beam to the next in tandem or at right angles.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-13\">Interesting as Bassett\u2019s idea may be, we agree with the district court that given the words of the Claim, it is completely irrelevant. Paeco\u2019s argument is premised entirely on Bassett\u2019s concept of a beamed ceiling system. We are told that if we picture how beams would be used in such a system, we will quickly appreciate why the protuberances described in Claim 1 must be located on the ends, not the sides, of the beam. Claim 1, however, contains not a single word describing or even hinting at a beamed ceiling system. In fact, the very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>language of the Claim contradicts the contention advanced by Bassett and Paeco that the protuberances there described must be such as would appear to connect one beam with another. The words of the Claim are \u201cfasteners utilized to secure the replica beams with a surface <em>or </em>with similar replica beams.\u201d (Emphasis added). It is not possible to read this phrase as exclusively describing fasteners which connect one beam to another; the use of the disjunctive word \u201cor\u201d serves as conclusive proof to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Paeco cannot now be allowed to limit its claim in order to exclude the Colony beam from its reach. \u201c[T]he claims measure the invention,\u201d <em>Continental Paper Bag Co. v. Eastern Paper Bag Co., </em>210 U.S. 405, 419, 28 S.Ct. 748, 52 L.Ed. 1122 (1908), and the patentee may not narrow his claims to meet the exigencies of litigation. <em>See Nichols v. Minnesota Mining and Mfg. Co., </em>109 F.2d 162, 165 (4th Cir. 1940). <em>See also Graver Tank Co. v. Linde Air Co., </em>336 U.S. 271, 277, 69 S.Ct. 535, 93 L.Ed. 672 (1949); <em>McClain v. Ortmayer, </em>141 U.S. 419, 12 S.Ct. 76, 35 L.Ed. 800 (1891).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">Where the language of a patent claim is clear, the court need not \u2014 and may not \u2014 go beyond the claim to the specification. <em>Noll v. O. M. Scott, Co., </em>467 F.2d 295, 298 (6th Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>411 U.S. 965, 93 S.Ct. 2143, 36 L.Ed.2d 685 (1973); <em>Schmidinger v. Welsh, </em>383 F.2d 455, 460 (3d Cir. 1967). But even if we were disposed to examine the specification, we would find only further refutation of Paeco\u2019s contentions. Rather than specifying that bolts or pegs are to be placed exclusively at the ends of the beams, the specification speaks of beams \u201cmolded . to . represent . . . bolts, pegs, dowels, or the like, <em>particularly </em>adjacent to edges <em>or </em>ends . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added). The use of \u201cparticularly\u201d implies that the bolts or pegs are unusually <em>but not always </em>to be located at the \u201cedges or ends\u201d of the beams. Moreover, \u201cedges or ends\u201d is in the disjunctive and the word \u201cedges\u201d is not inconsistent with placement of pegs along the \u201csides\u201d of the beam. Finally, the words <em>\u201cwith a surface or with </em>each other\u201d (emphasis added) in the specification, like the words of the Claim itself, contradict the contention that the fasteners must necessarily give the appearance of connecting one beam to another. Thus, even if we were to ignore the rule that the claim, not the specifications, measures the grant to the patentee, <em>Milcor v. George A. Fuller Co., </em>316 U.S. 143, 62 S.Ct. 969, 86 L.Ed. 1332 (1942); <em>Schmidinger, </em>supra; we find nothing in the specifications to limit Claim 1 as Paeco advocates.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-10\">B. <em>Experimental Use</em></p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">Having determined that Colony beams were substantially identical to the beams described in Claim 1, we must now consider whether their sale prior to the critical date was justified under the \u201cexperimental use\u201d doctrine. That doctrine allows an inventor a reasonable period of experimentation wherein he may perfect his ideas, provided that the inventor truly has utilized the public use or sale to that laudatory end, not as a competitive tool to exploit his invention and gain an advantage over others. <em>Koehring Co. v. Nat\u2019l Automatic Tool Co., </em>362 F.2d 100, 103-04 (7th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-12\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the district court found that Paeco had failed to meet its burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that the public sale of the Colony beam prior to the critical date was experimental in nature, motivated by a desire to perfect or improve the invention. We may disturb this finding of fact by the district court only if clearly erroneous. However, we find no clear error here. Indeed, the evidence points strongly to the conclusion that Paeco\u2019s sale of the Colony beam was almost entirely motivated by commercial considerations: Bassett testified that Paeco decided to sell the beams because it was in \u201ca very bad financial condition; \u201d Paeco management was greatly concerned with customer interest in the beams, with customer reaction to advertising display boards, and with proper pricing of the beams. An experiment it may well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>have been, but an experiment in marketing, not in technological improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">C. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">Since we have concluded that the sale of the Colony beams constituted a public use or sale of the product described in Claim 1 more than one year prior to the date of the application for the patent and that the public use or sale was not a <em>bona fide </em>\u201cexperimental use,\u201d we affirm the judgment of the district court declaring Claim 1 invalid under \u00a7 102(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">II. CLAIMS 2 AND 3</p>\n<p id=\"AAW8\">Claims 2 and 3 read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">2. As an article of manufacture, replica wooden beams having the feel, appearance and stain characteristics of wood fabricated of rigid urethane foam molded to a mold having a volume less than the free rise volume of said urethane foam resin, the outer skin surface thereof being non-porous and dense, and a portion of said skin being removed to define an exposed porous surface whereby the easy mounting of said beam is facilitated, said beam stained to provide colorations corresponding to a wooden beam.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">3. Article of manufacture defined in claim 2 comprising, in combination, a base portion and a pair of leg portions extending generally perpendicularly thereof to define a generally U-shaped cross section with the base and legs being adapted to be exposed with the edge portions of the legs being adapted to be mounted adjacent a surface to provide the appearance of the replica beam supporting the surface.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">Claim 3 is dependent on Claim 2 in the sense that if Claim 2 is not valid, neither can Claim 3 be.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-14\">The district court held that Claims 2 and 3 were invalid under both \u00a7 102(a) and \u00a7 102(b). We will review each asserted ground of invalidity in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-15\">A. <em>Anticipation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-16\">Section 102(a)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> renders a patent invalid if the invention was \u201canticipated\u201d by the prior art. Anticipation occurs only when some single prior article, patent, or publication contained within its four corners every element of the claim in question; a patent is not anticipated when its elements are distributed among several prior publications or devices. <em>See Line Material Co. v. Brady Elec. Mfg. Co., </em>7 F.2d 48, 50 (2d Cir. 1925); <em>Philips Elec. and Pharmaceutical Industries Corp. v. Thermal and Elec. Industries, Inc., </em>450 F.2d 1164, 1169 (3d Cir. 1971). Furthermore, in order to invalidate a patent on grounds of anticipation, as on any other ground of invalidity, the party asserting the invalidity bears a heavy burden of demonstrating it by clear and convincing proof. <em>Aluminum Co. of America v. Amerola Product Corp., </em>552 F.2d 1020 (3d Cir., filed April 8, 1977); <em>Tokyo Shibaura Electric Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>548 F.2d 88 (3d Cir., 1977). For reasons which follow, we do not believe that AMI\u2019s proof on the issue of anticipation meets these exacting standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-17\">The district court\u2019s holding that a beam manufactured by Paul Fleck anticipated the invention described in Claim 2 was based both on the court\u2019s construction of certain problematic language in Claim 2 and on findings of fact concerning the physical characteristics of the Fleck beam, the date of its first manufacture, and the date on which Bassett invented the features of his beam which are described by Claim 2. Although Paeco disputes each and every finding of fact, our review of the record convinces us that each finding is supported by clear and convincing evidence. In its con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>struction of the language of Claim 2, however, we believe that the district court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Of the several complex questions concerning the proper interpretation of Claim 2, one is dispositive. That is the question whether in this language\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay7\">replica wooden beams . . fabricated of rigid urethane foam molded in a mold having a volume less than the free rise volume of said urethane foam resin</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">the adjectival phrase \u201chaving a volume less than the free rise volume of said urethane foam resin\u201d describes the \u201crigid urethane foam\u201d <em>of </em>which the beam is made or the mold <em>in </em>which the beam is produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">Paeco argues (1) that this adjectival phrase describes the mold, (2) that a mold can be said to have a finite volume only if the mold is closed, i. e., has a top to it, (3) that the Claim therefore teaches the required use of a closed mold, and (4) that the Fleck beam, not produced in a closed mold, did not anticipate Claim 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">AMI, on the other hand, believes (1) that the adjectival phrase describes a property of the foam material which makes up a beam, (2) that the foam material of the Fleck beam did indeed have a volume less than the free rise volume of the foam out of which it was made, (3) that the Claim does not teach the mandatory use of a closed mold, and (4) that even though it was not made in a closed mold, the Fleck beam anticipated Claim 2. The district court found AMI\u2019s arguments more persuasive and held that \u201cthe language of the claim only teaches a <em>density </em>greater than the free rise volume, not the exclusive use of a closed mold.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-9\">If our inquiry were limited to the words of the Claims themselves, we would regard the two readings of the adjective phrase in question as equally plausible. Supporting Paeco\u2019s reading is the placement of the phrase immediately after the word \u201cmold\u201d rather than after the word \u201cfoam\u201d as well as the complete absence of the word \u201cdensity,\u201d the one word which seems likely to have suggested itself if the language at issue had been intended to describe a property of the foam.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-11\">On the other hand, we cannot dispute AMI\u2019s observation that the phrase \u201ca mold having a volume less than the free rise volume of said urethane foam resin\u201d is a rather awkward way to specify \u201ca closed mold\u201d if that is what was meant. Nor can we deny that the sentence is so structed as to permit the construction advocated by AMI that the adjectival phrase in question refers only to the polyurethane foam of which the <em>beam </em>is made, not the mold.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-12\">Because the claim is capable of two interpretations, we are justified in looking behind the words of the claim to the specification and description of the invention for explication of the Claim\u2019s meaning. <em>See Carnegie Steel Co. v. Cambria Iron Co., </em>185 U.S. 403, 432, 22 S.Ct. 698, 46 L.Ed. 968 (1902). When we do so, we observe that the greater part of the specifications is devoted to describing the process by which the beam may be made, rather than the substance of the beam itself. Thus, it would not be surprising if the ambiguous language of the Claim were intended to refer to the mold, an aspect of the manufacturing process, rather than to the beam as a product. And our suspicion that the words may describe the process, not the product, is reinforced by the principle that even when a patent is for an article of manufacture, as Claim 2 is, it is the manufacturing process described by the claim which is of paramount importance. A patent granted on a product claim describing one process grants no monopoly as to identical products manufactured by a different process. <em>See Nat\u2019l Carbon Co. v. Western Shade Cloth Co., </em>93 F.2d 94, 98 (7th Cir. 1937), <em>cert. denied, </em>304 U.S. 570, 58 S.Ct. 1039, 82 L.Ed. 1535 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-13\">These considerations do not establish with any degree of certainty that the phrase in question describes the mold not the beam, but no such certainty is needed to uphold the claim. The construction which we suggest is at least reasonable, and we believe more probable than the contrary construction. We therefore are constrained to disagree with the district court that AMI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>proved by clear and convincing evidence that Claim 2 is invalid under \u00a7 102(a) as anticipated by the Fleck beam.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\">B. <em>Novelty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">The district court held Claims 2 and 3 invalid under \u00a7 102(b) for lack of novelty based on the sale of beams by Paeco prior to the critical date. We have previously discussed the broad outlines of \u00a7 102(b) in connection with Claim 1 but the application of \u00a7 102(b) to Claims 2 and 3 is somewhat more subtle.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">AMI contends that Paeco\u2019s pre-critical date beams were identical to the beams described in Claims 2 and 3 except with respect to skin removal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> AMI further contends that the skin removal procedure described in Claim 2 was an obvious improvement over the pre-critical date beams.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">If both these contentions are correct, Claims 2 and 3 are invalid. When a claim incorporates an improvement over a product sold prior to the critical date, which product, except for the improvement, is identical to that described in the claim, the improvement itself must be non-obvious under \u00a7 103<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or the whole claim is invalid. <em>See Frantz Mfg. Co. v. Phenix Mfg. Co., </em>457 F.2d 314 (7th Cir. 1972) (Stevens, J.); <em>Package Devices, Inc. v. Sun Ray Drug Co., </em>432 F.2d 272 (3d Cir. 1970). AMI\u2019s contention is that the removal of the skin of the Paeco beam sold prior to the critical date was in itself an obvious improvement and that Claim 2 is therefore invalid. Paeco admits that prior to the critical date it sold beams which, except for skin removal, were identical to those described in Claim 2, but insists that skin removal was not an obvious improvement. The question of Claim 2\u2019s validity under \u00a7 102(b) thus hinges on the determination whether skin removal was an obvious improvement to the pre-critical date beams within the meaning of \u00a7 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-13\">We have recently had occasion to explicate the law of obviousness under \u00a7 103:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXK\">The ultimate determination of patent validity is a conclusion of law reviewable for error, but the resolution of the obviousness issue depends on several basic factual inquiries reviewable under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of Fed.R. Civ.P. 52(a). <em>See Sakraida v. Ag Pro, Inc., </em>425 U.S. 273, 280, 96 S.Ct. 1532, 47 L.Ed.2d 784 (1976); <em>cases cited in Flour City Architectural Metals </em>v. <em>Alpana Aluminum Products, Inc., </em>454 F.2d 98, 106 n.8 (8th Cir. 1972); <em>Philips Electronic &amp; Pharmaceutical Industries Corp. </em>v. <em>Thermal &amp; Electronics Industries, Inc., </em>450 F.2d 1164, 1172 (3d Cir. 1971). In <em>Graham v. John Deere Co., </em>383 U.S. 1, 17, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966), the Supreme Court enumerated the factual inquiries that underlie the determination of obviousness. First, the scope and content of the prior art are to be discerned; second, the differences between the prior art and the claims at issue are to be ascertained; and third, the level of ordinary skill in the art must be resolved. In addition, the Court said, \u201c[s]uch secondary considerations as commercial success, long felt but unsolved needs, failure of others, etc., might be utilized to give light to the circumstances surrounding the origin of the subject matter sought to be patented. As indicia of obviousness, these inquiries may have relevancy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17-18, 86 S.Ct. at 694.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b951-14\"><em>Tokyo Shibaura Electric Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., supra, </em>548 F.2d at 93. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>court in the instant case undertook two of the <em>John Deere </em>inquiries and found essentially (1) that the prior art included patents for simulated wooden beams and for wall panels made out of foamed urethane, and (2) that Fleck, a witness at trial and the manufacturer of a replica wooden beam, was representative of a person having ordinary skill in the pertinent art of making urethane foam replica beams. In this context, of course, the difference between the prior art and the claimed invention had already been determined to be the removal of the outer skin to facilitate mounting the beam on a ceiling, so the need to make the third <em>John Deere </em>finding was obviated.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">The evidence showed (1) that in the spring of 1967, Fleck himself had removed the skin of his beams, although not for the purpose of making it easier to glue the beams to a ceiling; and (2) that Paeco had previously experimented with various techniques of gluing its beams to the ceilings, and had met with indifferent success. The district court held that given this information as well as familiarity with prior patents, the idea of removing the skin of a urethane foam beam for the purpose of making it easier to glue the beam to the ceiling would have been obvious to a person with ordinary skill in the art. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">It seems to us that there is nothing so remarkable in combining (1) the idea of gluing urethane foam beams to ceilings with (2) the knowledge that the skin of a urethane foam beam may be removed, to produce (3) the \u201cinvention\u201d of removing the skin for the purpose of making the gluing easier. Not only Fleck, a disinterested witness, but also Bassett, the patentee himself- \u2014 both of whom were persons actively working in the art of urethane foam beams \u2014 characterized the idea of skin removal for the purpose of making gluing easy as \u201cobvious.\u201d Although their testimony might not be dispositive on the issue of how the problem would appear to a hypothetical person of ordinary skill in the art, the district court was nevertheless entitled to give their opinions great weight. When the relatively simple nature of the skin removal is considered together with this testimony, the conclusion is inescapable that skin removal for the purpose of making gluing easier was an obvious invention within the meaning of \u00a7 103. It follows then, from our discussion above concerning the interplay of \u00a7\u00a7 102(b) and 103, that we must affirm the district court\u2019s holding that Claims 2 and 3 are invalid under \u00a7 102(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">III. ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES AND FRAUD ON THE PATENT OFFICE</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">In addition to ruling on the validity of Claims 1, 2 or 3, the district court also evaluated Paeco\u2019s conduct in prosecuting its patent. While concluding that Paeco\u2019s nondisclosure of certain prior art references did not constitute fraud on the patent office, the district court did find that Paeco\u2019s conduct in the prosecution of its patent was \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cinequitable.\u201d Based on this finding, the court determined that this case was \u201cexceptional\u201d within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285 and that it would be \u201cgrossly unjust\u201d to deny attorneys\u2019 fees to AMI. The order entered by the district court states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-9\">(4) This is an exceptional case under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285 and defendants are entitled to reasonable attorney fees, the amount thereof to be determined and established by agreement of counsel, affidavits submitted or further hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">Paeco has appealed from the district court\u2019s finding that it had engaged in inequitable and unfair conduct and from the above order awarding attorney fees. AMI has cross-appealed from the failure of the district court to grant AMI any relief other than attorneys\u2019 fees based on Paeco\u2019s alleged misconduct. Specifically, AMI contends that the district court also should have enjoined Paeco from asserting its patent defensively in the eventual trial of AMI\u2019s antitrust counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-11\">Interesting as these issues may be we have no jurisdiction at present to consider any of them. The controlling rule as to our appellate jurisdiction was recently set forth by Judge Maris in <em>W. L. Gore &amp; Associates </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number><em>v. Carlisle Corp., </em>529 F.2d 614 (3d Cir. 1976). In <em>Gore, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleged infringement by the defendant of plaintiff\u2019s patents. The defendant\u2019s answer denied the validity of the patents, asserted that one of the plaintiff\u2019s patents was unenforceable because of fraud in its procurement, and counterclaimed for damages based on the plaintiff\u2019s alleged violation of the Sherman Act. After a trial, the district court entered a judgment holding one of the patents valid and infringed and the other patent invalid, granting the plaintiff an injunction restraining the defendant from infringing the patent and determining that the plaintiff had violated the Sherman Act. The judgment postponed until a later date the accounting for the infringement and the determination of damages for the antitrust violation. Both parties appealed from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">The Court in <em>Gore </em>carefully reviewed all the possible sources of jurisdiction. Section 1291 of Title 28 was rejected because the district court\u2019s judgment was interlocutory, not final. <em>See also Liberty Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Wetzel, </em>424 U.S. 737, 96 S.Ct. 1202, 47 L.Ed.2d 435 (1976). Section 1292(a)(4) which confers jurisdiction to review \u201cjudgments in civil actions for patent infringement which are final except for accounting,\u201d was eliminated as a source of jurisdiction because the district court judgment did not include a full and final adjudication of the defendant\u2019s antitrust counterclaim. That left only section 1292(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">Section 1292(a)(1) of Title 28 confers jurisdiction upon the courts of appeals to review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-7\">Interlocutory orders of the district courts granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve injunctions, except where a direct review may be had in the Supreme Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">The district court in <em>Gore </em>both granted and denied injunctions and \u00a7 1292(a)(1) thus conferred jurisdiction on the court of appeals. But as Judge Maris explained, the jurisdiction conferred by \u00a7 1292(a)(1) was of limited scope:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-9\">When, as in the patent infringement case now before us, an injunction against future infringement is sought and is either granted or refused in the judgment determining the issues of validity and infringement, the portion of that judgment granting or denying the injunction becomes appealable under \u00a7 1292(a)(1) as an interlocutory order. And since the propriety of granting or denying the injunction normally depends upon the correctness of the district court\u2019s determination of the underlying issues of validity and infringement, so much of the judgment as determined these issues is necessarily reviewable on such an appeal. In such a situation, however, the jurisdiction conferred upon the court of appeals does not extend <em>to other claims or issues </em>determined by the judgment <em>which have no bearing upon the propriety of the action of the court with respect to the injunction.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">529 F.2d at 617-18 (citations deleted and emphasis added). These principles apply with equal force to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">The district court order in the case <em>sub judice, </em>even more than in <em>Gore, </em>leaves important issues untried: Paeco\u2019s liability for antitrust violations, damages for antitrust violations, and the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees. Thus, the order is interlocutory, not final, and not appealable under \u00a7 1291. As in <em>Gore, </em>\u00a7 1292(a)(4) is also inapplicable since the antitrust claims have yet to be determined. Our jurisdiction is therefore founded exclusively on \u00a7 1292(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-12\">The lesson of <em>Gore </em>is that \u00a7 1292(a)(1) gives us jurisdiction to review only so much of the district court\u2019s order as determined the issues of patent validity upon which 'the district court based the denial of an injunction. The issues we have already discussed \u2014 the validity of Claims 1, 2 and 3 under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 102(a) and (b) \u2014 are clearly reviewable, for the district court\u2019s determination of those issues forms the basis of its denial of injunctive relief to Paeco. On the other hand, that part of the district court order awarding attorney fees to AMI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>is clearly not reviewable; the award of such fees, and, indeed, the underlying determination that this was an \u201cexceptional\u201d case, was irrelevant to the district court\u2019s denial of injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">The district court\u2019s holding that Paeco\u2019s conduct in prosecuting the patent was unfair and inequitable is also not reviewable at this time under \u00a7 1292(a)(1). Paeco points out that in declining to hold the entire patent invalid for fraud on the patent office, the district court stated that the more appropriate sanction for Paeco\u2019s misconduct was \u201cto weaken the statutory presumption of validity normally cloaking a patent.\u201d Paeco argues that the district court\u2019s determination on the issue of fraud and misconduct thus served as a basis for holding Claims 1, 2 and 3 invalid under \u00a7\u00a7 102(a) and (b). This argument finds sufficient answer in the words of the district court opinion immediately following the sentence which Paeco quotes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-5\">We find and conclude the patent to be invalid on statutory grounds distinct and separate from the allegations of fraud. Additionally, with full recognition of the heavy burden on defendants of proving invalidity, we conclude that such burden has been met by a preponderance of the evidence. Thus, were it to be determined that we have erred in this fraud determination, sufficient evidence has been independently adduced in this proceeding by defendants to otherwise prove invalidity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">In light of this statement by the district court, it cannot be said that the district court\u2019s denial of an injunction was dependent on its determination as to fraud and Paeco\u2019s argument plainly has no merit. Furthermore, for the same reasons that we lack jurisdiction over Paeco\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s determination as to fraud, we also lack jurisdiction to consider AMI\u2019s appeal from another element of that same determination. Accordingly, we will not now consider either the award of attorneys\u2019 fees or the district court\u2019s determination on the issue of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the appeal in No. 76-1496 will be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The order of the district court in No. 76-1495 holding Claims 1, 2 and 3 invalid under section 102(b) will be affirmed; the order holding Claims 1, 2 and 3 invalid under section 102(a) will be reversed; and the appeal from the remainder of the district court\u2019s order will be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The case will be remanded to the district court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">Costs shall be taxed against the appellant in each case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b946-7\">. AMI eventually stipulated that its replica beams infringed Claims 1, 2 and 3 of the patent if the patent were valid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b946-8\">.

The district court also indicated in its order that Claim 1 was invalid under \u00a7 102(a) but the accompanying opinion contains no discussion of this issue. Since the facts so well set forth by the court would not seem to support the conclusion that Claim 1 is invalid under \u00a7 102(a), we believe that the reference to that subsection in the district court order was a mistake. Accordingly, we must reverse this aspect of the order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b946-17\">. Section 102(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-18\">A person shall be entitled to a patent unless\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-19\">(b) . . . the invention was patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country or in public use or sale in this country more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the United States ....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b946-21\">. We will follow the usage of the district court and refer to August 16, 1967, one year prior to the date of Paeco\u2019s application to the patent office, as the \u201ccritical date.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b947-10\">. The district court held that Claim 1 was also invalid under section 102(b) because its elements were described in a printed publication more than one year prior to the date of application.
