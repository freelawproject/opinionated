The Board has cross-petitioned for enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-11\">After thoroughly reviewing the record we find sufficient evidence to support the conclusion of the Administrative Law Judge, affirmed by the Board, that petitioner violated \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(a)(1) and (3), by discriminatorily laying off and refusing to reinstate Stanley Strock because of his union and protected concerted activities. However, we find that the conclusion that petitioner violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) by coercively interrogating Strock concerning a union meeting he attended is not substantiated. Therefore, we order that the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s recommended order, adopted by the Board, with the exception of 1(a), be enforced. Each party shall pay its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
