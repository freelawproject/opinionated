The District Judge who conducted a brief and nonevidentiary hearing on this motion denied it on the basis of the record of the jury trial at which he had presided. At that trial appellant had been found guilty of second degree murder in the 1967 stabbing death of his wife and had been sentenced to from seven years to life imprisonment. This conviction had been af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>firmed without opinion by this court (D. C. Cir. # 24,225, decided April 22,1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">On appeal from denial of the \u00a7 2255 motion appellant contends that statements taken from him at the police station without <em>Miranda </em>warnings should have been excluded on constitutional grounds, even though his counsel at the trial did not object to them. Appellant also contends that the record does not conclusively show a deliberate bypass of orderly federal procedure as apparently found by the District Judge who denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Neither of these issues had been presented at trial or on direct appeal. To decide them we need a somewhat detailed statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Appellant\u2019s version of the events on the night of the murder was given only to the police and came into the trial record only by police testimony since he did not testify before the jury. It was that he and his wife separated during the evening in question, he going home earlier, and then after a phone call from her around midnight, that he set out to meet her at the bus stop and found her there stabbed and dying. He and a passer-by took her to the hospital where police reported and took him and the good Samaritan to the station house.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Appellant and the passer-by were both questioned without <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Appellant gave an exculpatory statement indicating that his wife had been fatally wounded when he first met her at the bus stop. Appellant, who had never been told he was under arrest, was released and driven home by the police in the early morning hours. He was questioned again the next day at his apartment to which appellant admitted the police. The police found the deceased wife\u2019s umbrella at the house. This was apparently inconsistent with appellant\u2019s version of the facts since she had had the umbrella with her earlier in the evening. At this point appellant was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">At the trial two witnesses who lived in the same apartment building as appellant testified to hearing noises on the night in question which could have come from appellant\u2019s apartment. One witness testified to a terrifying scream and then the noise of two persons running, and later the noise of one person running back. The deceased wife\u2019s brother testified to finding her injured one night some months before the murder after an altercation during which, appellant told him, he had hit her over the head with a chair. This episode had led to some months of separation which ended with reconciliation just a few weeks before the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">There was no eye witness of the murder who testified. The prosecution succeeded over vigorous objection in introducing the umbrella referred to above and police testimony about where it was found and about the absence of any knives in appellant\u2019s apartment. This latter evidence was arguably relevant both because appellant\u2019s wife died from a stab wound in her neck and because her sister testified that she had given the Johnsons a set of steak knives. A motion to suppress physical evidence seized by the police occasioned a hearing outside the presence of the jury. This was the only occasion on which appellant testified. After listening to appellant\u2019s version and that of the police about their entrance to appellant\u2019s apartment, the District Judge found that the police had entered with appellant\u2019s voluntary consent and admitted the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">On direct appeal, as noted earlier, the validity of this last decision was the primary issue presented and this court affirmed without opinion. No issue was presented on direct appeal concerning police testimony about appellant\u2019s statements at the station house on the night of the murder. But in the motion to vacate sentence and on the present appeal, these statements and their admission at trial are the sole focus.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-12\">Attached to this opinion as Appendices A, B and C are A) the transcript of the hearing on the \u00a7 2255 motion; B) the transcript of the trial court\u2019s sua sponte inquiry into the admissibility of appellant\u2019s statement to the police; and C) the transcript of the statements as related by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>Our reading of Appendix C indicates to us that appellant\u2019s statements to the police as quoted by them were clearly intended to be purely exculpatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Our reading of Appendix B indicates that the District Judge entirely sua sponte raised and insisted on exploring the voluntariness of these statements and the question of whether they were barred by reason of appellant being \u201cin custody\u201d at the time. They were made without his having been given <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1612, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, 706 (1966). At the hearing on this issue initiated by the District Judge, appellant\u2019s attorney made no effort at all to contest the admissibility of appellant\u2019s written statement or to contest police evidence tending to establish that the statements were voluntary on appellant\u2019s part and were given when he was not in custody. Appellant\u2019s counsel indicated approval of the District Judge\u2019s decision that the statements were not made in custody and were admissible. Appellant was present during all these proceedings and offered no objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Our reading of Appendix A (and this record) convinces us that the District Judge had a vivid memory of this case<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and correctly concluded from its record that appellant had \u201cdeliberately bypassed the orderly procedure\u201d of the federal courts within the meaning of <em>Fay v. Noia, </em>372 U.S. 391, 438, 83 S.Ct. 822, 848, 9 L.Ed.2d 837, 868 (1963), and <em>Henry v. Mississippi, </em>379 U.S. 443, 451-52, 85 S.Ct. 564, 569, 13 L.Ed.2d 408, 415 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">In <em>Kaufman v. United States </em>the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-9\">Where a trial or appellate court has determined the federal prisoner\u2019s claim, discretion may in a proper case be exercised against the grant of a \u00a7 2255 hearing. Section 2255 provides for hearing \u201c[ujnless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief . . .\u201d In <em>Sanders v. United States, </em>373 U.S. 1, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963), we announced standards governing the determination whether a hearing should be ordered in the case of a successive motion under \u00a7 2255. Similarly, where the trial or appellate court has had a \u201csay\u201d on a federal prisoner\u2019s claim, it may be open to the \u00a7 2255 court to determine that on the basis of the motion, files, and records, \u201cthe prisoner is entitled to no relief.\u201d See <em>Thornton v. United States, </em>125 U.S. App.D.C. 114, 125, 368 F.2d 822, 833 (1966) (dissqenting opinion of Wright, J.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-12\">Furthermore, the \u00a7 2255 court may in a proper case deny relief to a federal prisoner who has deliberately bypassed the orderly federal procedures provided at or before trial and by way of <em>appeal </em>\u2014 e.g., motion to suppress under Fed.Rule Crim. Proc. 41(e) or appeal under Fed.Rule App. Proe. 4(b). <em>Fay v. Noia, supra, </em>[372 U.S.] n.3, at 438 [83 S.Ct. 822 at 848]. <em>Henry v. Mississippi, supra, </em>[379 U.S.] n.3, at 451-452 [85 S.Ct. 564 at 569-570, 13 L.Ed.2d at 415].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-13\"><em>Kaufman v. United States, </em>394 U.S. 217, 227 n.8, 89 S.Ct. 1068, 1074, 22 L.Ed.2d 227, 238 (1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-14\">We believe that the District Court in this case offered appellant full opportunity to object to admission of the now disputed statements. We also believe that the District Judge was right when at the \u00a7 2255 hearing he said that appellant\u2019s failure to object or present evidence was \u201ca calculated piece of business.\u201d Even appellant\u2019s counsel at the \u00a7 2255 hearing recognized that \u201cfor strategic reasons Mr. Williams [appellant\u2019s trial counsel] wanted that statement in.\u201d Although he did not use the words, we believe his \u00a7 2255 disposition represented his finding of \u201ca deliberate bypassing attributable to the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Haywood, </em>150 U.S.App.D.C. 247, 464 F.2d 756 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-15\">We recognize that appellant relies strongly upon the <em>Haywood </em>case just cited as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>establishing his right to a \u00a7 2255 hearing. In <em>Haywood </em>the facts upon which remand for hearing was predicated were these:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIO\">Appellant, in his <em>pro se </em>Section 2255 motion, alleges that he specifically requested trial counsel to file a motion to suppress the evidence, that just prior to trial a further request was made that since counsel had not filed the motion to suppress, he secure for the court\u2019s approval a copy of the search warrant. Appellant further alleged that at trial, counsel failed to determine for the record the circumstances under which the evidence, which was introduced at trial, was obtained by the search, and that he did not cross-examine any witness who testified regarding the evidence, or object to the statement of the prosecutor that the search was authorized by a legal warrant. These unresolved allegations are quite material to the question whether there was a deliberate bypassing, which could be attributed to appellant, of the orderly procedures. <em>United States v. Haywood, supra </em>at 761-62.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Neither in appellant\u2019s pro se motions, nor in his appointed counsel\u2019s motion, nor in appointed counsel\u2019s proffer of evidence to the District Court at the \u00a7 2255 hearing were any such disavowals of appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s trial strategy set forth. We recognize that the Supreme Court has said that a government claim of a deliberate bypass forfeit of constitutional rights usually requires an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-5\">An evidentiary hearing will ordinarily be required before the District Court can determine whether petitioner made a deliberate strategic waiver of his claim in state court. In this case, a hearing is necessary to determine (1) the reason for counsel\u2019s failure to file a brief or to take further action in the state courts, and (2) the extent of petitioner\u2019s knowledge and participation in that decision. If the District Court cannot find persuasive evidence of a knowing and intelligent waiver on the part of petitioner himself, then the Court should proceed to consider petitioner\u2019s constitutional claims. <em>Humphrey v. Cady, </em>405 U.S. 504, 517, 92 S.Ct. 1048, 1056, 31 L.Ed.2d 394, 407 (1972).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Here, however, the \u00a7 2255 hearing judge had presided at the original trial. He had, sua sponte, raised the admissibility of appellant\u2019s statements and carefully explored the facts under which they were given. The statements were obviously intended to be purely exculpatory and were in fact the only defense which appellant presented before the jury. Appellant\u2019s counsel was given repeated opportunity to object to their admission and (in appellant\u2019s presence, of course) repeatedly waived objection to their admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Under the total facts of this case, we find no grounds for reversal of the District Judge\u2019s denial of this \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">[Mr. Weiss (Appellant Johnson\u2019s counsel) ].</p>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">I proffer, if the Court would allow Mr. Johnson to testify briefly, that his testimony would be that he felt that at the time he was taken from the hospital to the station-house that he was under arrest, and that he wasn\u2019t asked, \u201cWould you like to come along?\u201d He was told to come along. And that there was another witness, a man named Jones, whom I am unable to locate \u2014 I am trying to find him \u2014 who was invited to come along, and that Mr. Johnson was ordered to come along, and that because of this, we would contend that the investigation had already focused upon Mr. Johnson, that he was a suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-12\">THE COURT: Didn\u2019t I go into that at the time of trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b726-13\">MR. WEISS: I have that portion of the transcript. There was a hearing on it. Mr. Johnson did not testify at that hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-14\">THE COURT: I thought that I was pretty sensitive about any statements that might come in. I remember asking some questions about that.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-15\">MR. PROPPER: May it please the Court. Attached is the Government\u2019s opposition is the testimony in which this hearing took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>place. I do have an additional copy. Your Honor brought it up sua sponte, and I do have all of the questions in there.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">MR. WEISS: However, Mr. Johnson did not testify at that hearing. I believe for strategic reasons Mr. Williams wanted that statement in. It was a method of getting Mr. Johnson\u2019s version of the incident before the jury without having him testify and be subjected to cross-examination. So, for that reason I think it was part of Mr. Williams\u2019 theory of the case that he could get his version of the story in and he wouldn\u2019t have to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">THE COURT: I can understand that. If I were representing the man, I would probably take the same tactic, but that is a tactic that counsel chooses to adopt. It is a calculated piece of business. It is a clear indication that he is familiar with the case. It is a clear indication that he is familiar with the problems involved in the case. It is a clear indication that he seeks to take advantage of what there is to be taken advantage of, and in doing so, as frequently happens, there are some risks involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">I think that what you say about the tactic adopted is a logical one, and in fact if it is a trial tactic, I just don\u2019t think that he can be heard to complain about it now.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">I haven\u2019t gone over very carefully how I handled this matter, but I think that I handled this matter\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">MR. PROPPER: It begins on Page 111 of that appendix we attached, your Honor, near the bottom, 350-111.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">THE COURT: Mr. Weiss, what is the posture of this? This is a 2255 matter?</p>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">MR. WEISS: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-12\">THE COURT: He raises this question in the face of this record. What difference does it make that he would testify now?</p>\n<p id=\"b727-13\">MR. WEISS: He would testify as to what his subjective feeling was about the circumstances surrounding the making\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b727-14\">THE COURT: He had an opportunity to do that. He had an opportunity to do that at the hearing. The hearing was outside the presence of the jury. Do you remember? We had the hearing outside the presence of the jury. I took examination of Wilson. And I was concerned about it. And I concluded that he had not been overreached. As you say, counsel said he had no objection to that, and it was obvious to me why.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-16\">You make a proffer that presently he would testify that at the time he left the hospital he was under arrest?</p>\n<p id=\"b727-17\">MR. WEISS: Yes, your Honor, and that there were circumstances surrounding his signing of the statement which amounted to undue pressure upon him, and that he was told that he could leave after he signed the statement. Some of his wife\u2019s family were in the hospital. There was certain hostility that existed between the defendant and his wife that the family knew about, and he wanted to get out of the police station and away from the family, so he signed the statement in order to\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b727-18\">THE COURT: What do you have to say?</p>\n<p id=\"b727-19\">MR. PROPPER: Your Honor, besides the appendix as attached, I have cited in my response various other parts of the transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-20\">It was stated in the motion that he was under questioning for four hours, and in fact he was not. He was in the station house for four hours, but there was a total of twenty questions asked that take up only two and a half pages \u2014 the entire transcript. The questions are quoted in the transcript. They are not coercive at all. The police officer testified that he stayed in the station afterwards for some reason, which he doesn\u2019t know, until 5:00 in the morning. He wasn\u2019t arrested, and he left voluntarily by himself after the questioning. He was not placed under arrest at all. And the officers in fact took everybody who had any knowledge of that crime \u2014 there was another witness also \u2014 down to the station also. And they gave a statement also.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-21\">I don\u2019t see any purpose in the testimony. Subjective feelings, while a factor, certainly should have been brought up at trial, but it is not the only factor. The factor is was this man at that time in custody, and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>he a suspect. And the officer testified both at trial and in the hearing. He didn\u2019t even know what was happening when he got to the hospital. There was a radio run. He found out it was the victim\u2019s husband. He had blood on him. He asked him, \u201cHow did she die.\u201d He asked to come down and simply testify. He wanted to find out the facts of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">In fact, after he spoke to him, he went out and started looking for a weapon. This man wasn\u2019t even present at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">So, I see no reason at all now to try to bring up his feelings, because your Honor at that time found no violation, and in fact counsel had no objection to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">And I think there are two separate issues. Not only did he have no objection to it, but there was no violation, because there is no Escobedo problem in that he was not a suspect. Both persons were questioned. There were general on-the-scene questions, but it was easier to do at Homicide than the emergency room of the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">And he was let go after that. He was not arrested. I see no function in any testimony now. It would only be selfserving.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">THE COURT: I deny your motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">MR. WEISS: May we approach the bench, your Honor, off the record?</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">(Discussion at bench off the record.)</p>\n<p id=\"Addo\">(In open Court.)</p>\n<p id=\"b728-12\">THE COURT: I deny your motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-13\">APPENDIX B</p>\n<p id=\"b728-14\">THE COURT: Is there any question about the statements?</p>\n<p id=\"b728-15\">MR. WILLIAMS: No, no questions about those, as to their admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-16\">THE COURT: But\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b728-17\">MR. WILLIAMS: I am not going to object to their admissibility. I was told on discovery that, and I have a copy of the written statement, and I was told by Mr. Harris when I talked about discovery in this case, that the oral statement was given, the same as a written statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-18\">Now, if something comes out in that oral statement that is not in the written statement, I would certainly object.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-19\">THE COURT: Is it cumulative?</p>\n<p id=\"b728-20\">MR. HARRIS: I do not say it is cumulative. I say it is briefer.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-21\">THE COURT: Are you saying, substantially so?</p>\n<p id=\"b728-22\">MR. HARRIS: I would say substantially so. There might be one or two small differences. The differences I intend to use in my case, one of the differences I think of, right now, is that he stood outside my house and waited for a cab, and I think in the written statement, he says he walked to the bus stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-23\">There is another one, and I\u2019m not quite sure where it is, right now. It is no larger difference, maybe it has to do with, I think in the written one, he said he found her lying on the ground. And I think in the oral one, he said she was walking toward him, and he grabbed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-24\">MR. WILLIAMS: If that is all it is, I have no objection to that.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-25\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b728-26\">Q Did you notice the manner of Mr. Johnson, there?</p>\n<p id=\"b728-27\">A Well, he seemed fairly calm to me. He wasn\u2019t upset.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-28\">Q Did you have any conversation with him?</p>\n<p id=\"b728-29\">A Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-30\">Q Was it at that time?</p>\n<p id=\"b728-31\">A Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-32\">Q Was it there in the waiting room?</p>\n<p id=\"b728-33\">A Yes, it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-34\">Q What was the conversation which you had with the defendant?</p>\n<p id=\"b728-35\">THE COURT: Wait a minute. Before we get into that, come up here.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-36\">(AT THE BENCH IN A LOW MONOTONE.)</p>\n<p id=\"b728-37\">THE COURT: Is this the type matter that I should hear, out of the presence of the jury? You say you do not object to its admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>MR. WILLIAMS: Your Honor, I would like to hear it, outside the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">THE COURT: I thought, under the circumstances, I want to know why Wilson was there.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">MR. HARRIS: I will inform the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">THE COURT: Sir?</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">MR. HARRIS: I will inform the Court. They had been notified, Margaret Johnson was dead, and apparently, from violent causes, and they came there to investigate it. They were aware, already, what the defendant had said, such as the Court has heard, already.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">THE COURT: How were they aware of it?</p>\n<p id=\"b729-11\">MR. HARRIS: I think they had spoken to Mr. Jones, and he told them he had found the defendant with her. I do know what came out of it, that they wanted to know what happened. He told them exactly what the Court has come to understand; that he left his wife at the club, and he received a call from her that she was coming home by cab or bus, and he went outside and waited, and no one came, and he went around the corner, and he saw her and he knows nothing about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-12\">They took him back to the Homicide and typed a statement, as the formality goes.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-13\">MR. WILLIAMS: They were not aware of the story before they talked to Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-14\">THE COURT: What I am concerned with-\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b729-15\">MR. HARRIS: Of course not.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-16\">THE COURT: What I\u2019m concerned with, all I want to know, is that Jones came on the scene, and Johnson said, this woman was his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-17\">All I want to know, is whether or not, at the time Wilson talked to this man, that inquiry, or any inquiry, had focused on him. Apparently, that is not so. There is nothing in the record that points to that, if that is so.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-18\">MR. WILLIAMS: Other than the police officer\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-19\">THE COURT: You know the general suspicions that are direct to the surviving spouse, and out of an abundance of caution, if you want me to, I will examine him in those terms, and find out. Certainly, he isn\u2019t in custody, he is interrogating him, and I do not think this is conclusive. If this man had been zeroed in, if, at the initial stages\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b729-20\">MR. HARRIS: Well, of course the Court and Mr. Williams have heard testimony from Sergeant Boyd, Lieutenant Smith and Lieutenant Buch, and he wasn\u2019t, even under the circumstances, the next morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-21\">MR. WILLIAMS: He was let go, after this.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-22\">THE COURT: I beg your pardon?</p>\n<p id=\"b729-23\">MR. WILLIAMS: He was let go, after that.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-24\">THE COURT: I understand that. What I want to know, and Wilson is an honest officer and he will tell me. It is not so important that they let the man go. If, for instance, a police officer is investigating, and the investigation is focused on a man, he is a prime suspect, and I don\u2019t think they can elicit statements from him, as a suspect by way of remarks of not putting him in custody, if they are satisfied, they can get him, and I do not think they can avoid whatever happens, and they are there to inform him, just by foregoing the formality of placing him under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-25\">I think anybody would agree with me on that. I am satisfied this man was not. In terms of Walker, whether or not that investigation focused on him, at the initial point of the investigation, and he is asking this boy \u2014 well, I will hear from Wilson and see how he approached him.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-26\">(END OF BENCH. IN OPEN COURT.)</p>\n<p id=\"b729-28\">THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you will take your luncheon recess at this point. Between now, and then, do not let anybody discuss this matter with you.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-29\">(The jury left the courtroom at 12:25.)</p>\n<p id=\"A0M\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>OUT OF THE PRESENCE OF THE JURY</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">THE COURT: Mr. Wilson, you may resume the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">(The witness did as directed.)</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">THE COURT: Maybe I can telescope this. It is near the luncheon period and I know what I want to find out. So, if you do not mind my getting to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">MR. HARRIS: It is very gracious of Your Honor. I don\u2019t mind, at all. Thank you.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">THE COURT: Mr. Wilson, you were working 12:00 midnight tour of duty on the 22nd?</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">THE WITNESS: The 22nd.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">THE COURT: Your attention was called to the death of this woman, in what fashion? How did you receive it?</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">THE WITNESS: We received a radio call for a death at the hospital center, at 1:15 in the morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-12\">THE COURT: You got a routine response to the Homicide Squad Office, at the Hospital Center?</p>\n<p id=\"b730-13\">THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-14\">THE COURT: Tell me what happened when you got there. How did you meet up with Mr. Johnson?</p>\n<p id=\"b730-15\">THE WITNESS: They were on a routine call, and we didn\u2019t hurry, at all. It took us about 15 minutes. We got there about 1:30. I was working with Sergeant Hack. I guess, I might say we wandered in and approached one nurse, I don\u2019t know who, and asked, what they had?</p>\n<p id=\"b730-16\">If I remember correctly, they said there was a lady who was just brought in, that had been stabbed and had died. Sergeant Hack asked where she was, and they said she was in one of the treatment rooms in the back, and I believe a uniformed man stayed with this lady\u2019s husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-17\">And I immediately approached him and told him who I was, and asked him what happened, and he proceeded to tell me his version of what happened, not in great detail, at that time. Later, a statement was taken down in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-18\">THE COURT: Now, let me ask you this question. Were there some other witnesses, and statements, taken down in writing, too?</p>\n<p id=\"b730-19\">THE WITNESS: Mr. Jones; just the two of them there, at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-20\">THE COURT: When you saw these people, did you have any notions about \u2014 well, had the finger of suspicion begun to point to anybody, when you saw him?</p>\n<p id=\"b730-21\">THE WITNESS: No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-22\">THE COURT: Let me ask you: when you asked him what happened, did you anticipate that he might have told you something that might have incriminated him?</p>\n<p id=\"b730-23\">THE WITNESS: No, I didn\u2019t know what was happening to him. I didn\u2019t know what had been the cause of death. I saw he had considerable blood on him, which is not unusual, even in natural death. We recover hundreds of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-24\">I approached him, merely to get the information as to what had caused his wife\u2019s death. I didn\u2019t know if she had been stabbed, shot, or what, or struck, or had fallen and hemorrhaged, and there was some internal disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-25\">THE COURT: Do you want to ask any questions?</p>\n<p id=\"b730-26\">CROSS-EXAMINATION</p>\n<p id=\"Apz\">BY MR. WILLIAMS:</p>\n<p id=\"b730-27\">Q Officer, didn\u2019t you just say that you talked to a nurse and she told you, a woman had been stabbed, before you talked to Mr. Johnson?</p>\n<p id=\"b730-28\">A I might have said that. I can\u2019t recall. Maybe I did. I really don\u2019t know.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-29\">Q You might have known this, before you talked to him, that his wife had been stabbed?</p>\n<p id=\"b730-30\">A I might have. I just can\u2019t recall.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-31\">REDIRECT EXAMINATION</p>\n<p id=\"AO_\">BY MR. HARRIS:</p>\n<p id=\"b730-32\">Q Did Sergeant Hack say anything to you, when you spoke to the defendant, or did he go elsewhere?</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>A He went back to the room where he examined the body.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Q You, of course, work as a team, do you not?</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">A Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Q At that time, would you say his function was to find out, directly, what happened to the deceased?</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">A That would be his function.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">Q And what was your function?</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">A Trying, starting to get information as to the cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-12\">Q At that time, you said you had no knowledge, at all, on your own?</p>\n<p id=\"b731-13\">A No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-14\">Q But, possibly, you might have heard?</p>\n<p id=\"b731-15\">A I might have; I couldn\u2019t say for sure.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-16\">MR. HARRIS: I have nothing further.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-17\">MR. WILLIAMS: Just one other question, Your Honor, please.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-18\">RECROSS-EXAMINATION</p>\n<p id=\"Aqe\">BY MR. WILLIAMS:</p>\n<p id=\"b731-19\">Q You say, the oral statement he gave at the hospital, was in much greater detail than what he gave at the Homicide Squad?</p>\n<p id=\"b731-20\">A No, just the reverse. The one I took, the statement I took at our office, was in much more detail than what we learned, there at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-21\">Q Is this a copy of the statement you took from him? The two pages? Is that what you refer to as the detailed statement?</p>\n<p id=\"b731-22\">A Yes, sir, that is right.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-23\">MR. WILLIAMS: I have no further questions, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-24\">MR. HARRIS: I have no other questions of this witness, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-25\">THE COURT: All right. Thank you. You may go to lunch, and be back at 1:45. (Whereupon, the witness left the</p>\n<p id=\"b731-26\">stand.)</p>\n<p id=\"b731-27\">APPENDIX C</p>\n<p id=\"b731-28\">Q And you saw Mr. Johnson with Mr. Collie Jones?</p>\n<p id=\"b731-29\">A I did.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-30\">Q In the waiting room of that hospital?</p>\n<p id=\"b731-31\">A Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-32\">Q I believe you said that you had a conversation with him at that time?</p>\n<p id=\"b731-33\">A I did.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-34\">Q Would you tell us what that conversation was, please?</p>\n<p id=\"b731-35\">A Mr. Johnson told me that he had left his wife at a restaurant in the \u2014 on Ninth Street, Northwest, and had gone home because he had to be at work the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-36\">He stated that he went home, and that it was sometime later, he didn\u2019t know exactly how long, he received a \u2019phone call from her, saying she would be home, either by cab or bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-37\">He said that he got dressed and went outside. His wife wasn\u2019t out there, so he walked down to the bus stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-38\">When he got near the bus stop, he looked up towards New Hampshire and Crittendon and he saw a woman staggering in that area, down the corner.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-39\">He said that he went up there and found his wife. She had been stabbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-40\">He stated that shortly thereafter people started gathering. He asked for help, and Mr. Jones came along and they placed her in his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-41\">He offered to take them to the Hospital Center or a nearby hospital and they did take her to the hospital, where she expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-42\">Q Where did he say that he left his wife, when he was talking to you at the hospital?</p>\n<p id=\"b731-43\">A I don\u2019t recall if he told me right off, but he said that it had been at a bar or a cafe. I don\u2019t recall whether he named it at that time or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-44\">Q Did he say he left her in the place?</p>\n<p id=\"b731-45\">A I think he said in front of the place.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-46\">Q And she telephoned him at home?</p>\n<p id=\"b731-47\">A That is right.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>Q And told him that she was going to take a car or bus?</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">A A cab or bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Q What did he say he did?</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">A He stated that he got dressed, went out, and she didn\u2019t come by cab. So, he walked down to the bus stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">Q How was it that he said that he found her?</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">A He stated when he got \u2014 I think it\u2019s the bus stop at New Hampshire and Decatur, when he got\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">THE COURT: You asked him what he said and he told you what he said. Now you are asking him all over again. Why?</p>\n<p id=\"b732-11\">MR. HARRIS: I was just pointing up those three things, Your Honor. Then I will continue on to the next thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-12\">BY MR. HARRIS:</p>\n<p id=\"b732-13\">Q How was it that he said he found her?</p>\n<p id=\"b732-14\">A He looked up and saw her staggering on the corner, or saw a woman staggering on the corner of New Hampshire and Crittendon.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-15\">He walked up there and found his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-16\">Q Now, on conversing with Mr. Johnson there at the hospital, were you able to form an opinion as to his sobriety?</p>\n<p id=\"b732-17\">A He appeared to be sober to me. I didn\u2019t notice anything that I would say that he was intoxicated or would lead me to believe he was.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-18\">Q Did you examine this item, Government\u2019s Exhibit Number Three, a green leather billfold?</p>\n<p id=\"b732-19\">A This one?</p>\n<p id=\"b732-20\">Q Detective Wilson, have you ever seen this green leather billfold before?</p>\n<p id=\"b732-21\">A Yes, sir; Mr. Johnson had it in his hands at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-22\">Q Did you see any blood on it at that time?</p>\n<p id=\"b732-23\">A Yes, there was.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-24\">Q Would you examine it now, sir?</p>\n<p id=\"b732-25\">(Witness complied)</p>\n<p id=\"b732-26\">Do you see anything on it now?</p>\n<p id=\"b732-27\">A I see what appears to be blood on it now.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-28\">Q Tell us how much blood it had on it, this leather billfold, when you saw it with Mr. Johnson there at the hospital?</p>\n<p id=\"b732-29\">A I would say that the blood was more noticeable at that time. It wasn\u2019t dried out. But his hand was bloody. I think probably the blood had come from his hand that was on this billfold.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-30\">Q Did you discuss with him where he had gotten this when he gave it to you at the hospital?</p>\n<p id=\"b732-31\">A I don\u2019t think I did at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-32\">Q Would you examine these two items, Government\u2019s One for identification and Government\u2019s Two for identification, the white umbrella and the straw purse?</p>\n<p id=\"b732-33\">A Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-34\">Q Have you ever seen those before?</p>\n<p id=\"b732-35\">A I saw them at the office, yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-36\">Q When did you see them at the Homicide Squad Office?</p>\n<p id=\"b732-37\">A I guess it would be the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-38\">Q Was that the first time that you had seen them?</p>\n<p id=\"b732-39\">A Yes, sir, to my knowledge, it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-40\">Q I take it then that you did not see them at the hospital?</p>\n<p id=\"b732-41\">A No, sir, I did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-42\">Q Incidentally, about what time was this that you saw the defendant Joseph Johnson there at the hospital waiting room with the green purse?</p>\n<p id=\"b732-43\">A I would say around 1:30-1:35 in the morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-44\">Q There at the hospital, did you ask him if his wife had been carrying anything else, or if he found any of her property at the scene, other than the green leather billfold?</p>\n<p id=\"b732-45\">A No, I do not recall asking him that.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-46\">Q Now, there came a time that you and Mr. Johnson left the hospital, is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b732-47\">A Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-48\">Q Where did you go?</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>A To the Homicide Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Q At that time, did you in any way suspect complicity on the part of Mr. Johnson in connection with his wife\u2019s death?</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">THE COURT: Read that question back, (the reporter complied)</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">THE WITNESS: As far as I was concerned, he was being taken down there to give a witness\u2019 statement. I had no reason to suspect him.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">BY MR. HARRIS:</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">Q When you went with the defendant Joseph Johnson to the Homicide Squad Office, did you take a witness statement from him?</p>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">A Yes, sir, I did.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-12\">Q Was that a typed statement that he signed?</p>\n<p id=\"b733-13\">A Yes, it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-14\">Q Do you have a copy of that statement here with you?</p>\n<p id=\"b733-15\">A Ido.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-16\">Q Will you tell the Court and jury, please, what it was that the defendant told you in this witness statement that you took from him at the Homicide Squad Office?</p>\n<p id=\"b733-17\">MR. WILLIAMS: I will object if the officer can not recollect.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-18\">I presume that the United States Attorney is using this as a memorandum to refresh. I would think that he would have to exhaust the officer\u2019s memory of that statement before he could use it to read from.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-19\">THE COURT: Did he tell you anything down at the precinct that he didn\u2019t tell you at the hospital?</p>\n<p id=\"b733-20\">THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-21\">THE COURT: What was it?</p>\n<p id=\"b733-22\">THE WITNESS: He told me the actions, where they had been prior to going to the cafe, the name of the cafe, he named the party that his wife talked to in there, he named about the time he had left the place. He repeated about the \u2019phone call, how he found his wife, and then he answered several questions that I propounded to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-23\">MR. HARRIS: If I may, Your Honor, can I just ask the officer what exactly was it that the defendant told him, and proceed from there?</p>\n<p id=\"b733-24\">THE COURT: Sir?</p>\n<p id=\"b733-25\">MR. HARRIS: If I may, I would like to ask the Officer what it was that the defendant told him at the Homicide Squad Office?</p>\n<p id=\"b733-26\">THE COURT: Do you want him to read the whole statement?</p>\n<p id=\"b733-27\">MR. HARRIS: No, Your Honor. I want to have him just testify as to what the defendant told him, including the questions that he asked and the answers that he gave. I don\u2019t intend that he read the whole statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-28\">If he can testify from memory, I would be pleased if he would.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-29\">THE COURT: Tell us what he told you, Mr. Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-30\">THE WITNESS: He told me that he and his wife had gone out on the Friday night. They had gone to some friend\u2019s home over on Northeast. I think their name is Cain. They had a couple of beers there and then had left and gone to the Hollywood Cafe, which is on Ninth Street, Northwest, I think in the vicinity of Ninth and U.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-31\">They went there and had a couple of more beers. His wife talked with a friend of hers who was employed there.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-32\">He stated that he had to go to work the next day. He was employed as an apprentice butcher, I think, at a Safeway Store on Connecticut Avenue; that he decided to go home and his wife decided to remain at the \u2014 in the cafe or go visit other friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-33\">He stated that he caught a cab and went home. He wasn\u2019t sure exactly when he got home, but I think it was right around 11:00. He went to bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-34\">Sometime after 12:00, he was not positive, he received this \u2019phone call from his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-35\">At that time, she stated that he was \u2014 she was starting on her way home, either by cab or bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>He stated that he got dressed and went outside and waited a moment or so and the cab did not come.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">He then walked down to the corner of Crittendon and Decatur \u2014 New Hampshire and Decatur \u2014 and looked back up and he saw this woman at the corner of New Hampshire and Crittendon.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">He went up there and found out it was his wife. She fell over, I believe he said. He helped her up and was trying to assist her when this crowd gathered.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Mr. Jones came along. He asked several people to assist him in taking her to a hospital, that she was hurt, and nobody but Mr. Jones offered to assist him. And they put her in the car and they went to the Hospital Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">I then asked him about how long they had been married, where he worked, and I believe I asked him the name of the party that he had seen at the Hollywood Cafe.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">BY MR. HARRIS:</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">Q Sergeant Wilson, do you recall exactly what the defendant told you with reference to what he did after he left the Cain residence?</p>\n<p id=\"b734-11\">A I think he said they went right to the Hollywood, if I am not mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-12\">Q Do you recall exactly what the defendant told you there in the Homicide Squad about how his wife was, where she was, when he found her or came on her?</p>\n<p id=\"b734-13\">A In the statement that I took from him, I think he said she was on the ground, rolling around on the ground, if I am not mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-14\">Q Now, you say you asked him several separate questions and took down the questions and the exact answers that he gave to you, did you not?</p>\n<p id=\"b734-15\">A Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-16\">Q Do you recall exactly what those questions were, how many there were, and exactly what he said in response to them?</p>\n<p id=\"b734-17\">A I guess there were probably 15 or 20. I don\u2019t recall them all right now.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-18\">MR. HARRIS: If the Court please, could the officer refresh his recollection by referring to the notes that he has in front of him?</p>\n<p id=\"b734-19\">THE COURT: He may.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-20\">BY MR. HARRIS: Using the notes to refresh his recollection, may I have the officer tell the Court and jury the exact questions and the exact answers?</p>\n<p id=\"b734-21\">THE COURT: You may.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-22\">MR. HARRIS: Thank you, Your Honor. BY MR. HARRIS:</p>\n<p id=\"b734-23\">Q Will you please do so, Sergeant Wilson?</p>\n<p id=\"b734-24\">A I asked him a series of questions; the first question: Have you been drinking enough to be drunk?</p>\n<p id=\"b734-25\">\u201cI only had four beers and was not drunk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-26\">\u201cHad your wife had more to drink than you and was she drunk?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-27\">\u201cShe had more than I did, but I do not think she was intoxicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-28\">\u201cHave you had some trouble with your wife in the past?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-29\">\u201cYes; we were separated for about three months, and had been back together for a month and a half.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-30\">\u201cDoes your wife have any boyfriends that you know of?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-31\">\u201cNot that I know of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-32\">\u201cWhen she called you on the \u2019phone, did she say who she was with or where she was?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-33\">\u201cNo, sir, she did not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-34\">\u201cFrom the time she called you on the \u2019phone until you went on the street and found her, how much time about elapsed?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-35\">\u201cI do not know, but it was not long.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-36\">\u201cDid your wife carry a purse?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-37\">\u201cShe carried a little green wallet, that I found on the ground near her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-38\">\u201cDo you have any children by Margaret?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-39\">\u201cYes we have a boy.

Although the <em>Miranda </em>issue presented by appellant is difficult, the district judge did explore the admissibility problem both at trial and at the \u00a7 2255 hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-44\">Appellant urges this court to remand the case for a full evidentiary hearing so that he might testify as to his \u201csubjective feeling\u201d concerning the circumstances surrounding the making of the station house statement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Finding appellant\u2019s proffer insufficient to warrant such a remand in light of the circumstances that appear on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>record before us, I concur in the result reached by the court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">I am troubled, however, by the majority\u2019s reliance on a finding of deliberate bypass to the extent that it suggests that counsel may effect a waiver of such an important right as was involved here,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> absent any indication that counsel ever consulted with appellant or informed him of the existence of such right.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-11\">It is clear that counsel offered no objection to the introduction of testimony concerning appellant\u2019s station house statement. As the opinion points out, the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>was particularly sensitive to the possible <em>Miranda </em>problem. By exploring the issue with counsel at trial, the judge assured himself that the failure to object was an informed tactical decision rather than an inadvertent omission, thus obviating the need for a remand for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether counsel made a deliberate strategic waiver.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The transcript here, however, is devoid of any reference<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which provides a reliable basis for concluding that appellant approved of the waiver on his behalf.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While on occasion decisions during the heat of trial may involve \u201cnice calculations of procedural complexities and jurors\u2019 likely reactions\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which make consultation unfeasible, ordinarily \u201cwe rely upon counsel to speak for his client not because we believe the attorney must make the decision, but because we assume the attorney has consulted with his client, advised him of what is at stake, and helped him toward a wise decision.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-14\">In summary, the record does not demonstrate that appellant was apprised of counsel\u2019s intention to acquiesce in the admission of the now-disputed testimony, and of the potential consequences of such action, al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>though it does indicate that there was ample opportunity for consultation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In these circumstances counsel\u2019s decision, however purposeful, should not preclude appellant from raising his <em>Miranda </em>claim in a proceeding for collateral relief. Counsel\u2019s duty to communicate with his client is gaining increasing recognition,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and should not unnecessarily be relaxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">I therefore join in affirmance based on the insufficiency of appellant\u2019s proffer<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the lack of evidence of material prejudice,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> rather than on a finding of deliberate bypass.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b725-10\">.

Appellant contests only the introduction of testimony relating to his station house statement, and in no way challenges the introduction of testimony concerning the statement he made at the hospital. While the statements are not exactly identical, the station house statement being the more detailed of the two, the damaging import of appellant\u2019s version of the facts was as apparent in the hospital statement as in the station house statement. In its summation to the jury the prosecution did not rely solely, or even more forcefully, on the effect of the station house statement \u2014 some evidence at least of the insignificance of the differences between the two statements. It thus can be argued that appellant could not have been materially prejudiced by the introduction of testimony concerning the station house statement. <em>See Milton v.
