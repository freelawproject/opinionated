SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"AsbH\">The Warner-Lambert Company petitions for review of an order of the Federal Trade Commission requiring it to cease and desist from advertising that its product, Listerine Antiseptic mouthwash, prevents, cures, or alleviates the common cold. The FTC order further requires Warner-Lambert to disclose in future Listerine advertisements that: \u201cContrary to prior advertising, Listerine will not help prevent colds or sore throats or lessen their severity.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm but modify the order to delete from the required disclosure the phrase \u201cContrary to prior advertising.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b826-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b826-16\">The order under review represents the culmination of a proceeding begun in 1972, when the FTC issued a complaint charging petitioner with violation of Section 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by misrepresenting the efficacy of Listerine against the common cold.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-17\">Listerine has been on the market since 1879. Its formula has never changed. Ever since its introduction it has been represented as being beneficial in certain respects for colds, cold symptoms, and sore throats. Direct advertising to the consumer, including the cold claims as well as others, began in 1921.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-18\">Following the 1972 complaint, hearings were held before an administrative law judge (AU). The hearings consumed over four months and produced an evidentiary record consisting of approximately 4,000 pages of documentary exhibits and the testimony of 46 witnesses. In 1974 the ALJ issued an initial decision sustaining the allegations of the complaint. Petitioner appealed this decision to the Commission. On December 9,1975 the Commission issued its decision essentially affirming the ALJ\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>findings. It concluded that petitioner had made the challenged representations that Listerine will ameliorate, prevent, and cure colds and sore throats, and that these representations were false. Therefore the Commission ordered petitioner to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-5\">(1) cease and desist from representing that Listerine will cure colds or sore throats, prevent colds or sore throats, or that users of Listerine will have fewer colds than non-users;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-6\">(2) cease and desist from representing that Listerine is a treatment for, or will lessen the severity of, colds or sore throats; that it will have any significant beneficial effect on the symptoms of sore throats or any beneficial effect on symptoms of colds; or that the ability of Listerine to kill germs is of medical significance in the treatment of colds or sore throats or their symptoms;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-7\">(3) cease and desist from disseminating any advertisement for Listerine unless it is clearly and conspicuously disclosed in each such advertisement, in the exact language below, that: \u201cContrary to prior advertising,- Listerine will not help prevent colds or sore throats or lessen their severity.\u201d This requirement extends only to the next ten million dollars of Listerine advertising.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">Petitioner seeks review of this order. The American Advertising Federation and the Association of National Advertisers have filed briefs as <em>amici curiae.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">II. SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">The first issue on appeal is whether the Commission\u2019s conclusion that Listerine is not beneficial for colds or sore throats is supported by the evidence. The Commission\u2019s findings must be sustained if they are supported by substantial evidence on the record viewed as a whole.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We conclude that they are.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-15\">Both the AU and the Commission carefully analyzed the evidence. They gave full consideration to the studies submitted by petitioner. The ultimate conclusion that Listerine is not an effective cold remedy was based on six specific findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-16\">First, the Commission found that the ingredients of Listerine are not present in sufficient quantities to have any therapeutic effect. This was the testimony of two leading pharmacologists called by Commission counsel. The Commission was justified in concluding that the testimony of Listerine\u2019s experts was not sufficiently persuasive to counter this testimony.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-17\">Second, the Commission found that in the process of gargling it is impossible for Listerine to reach the critical areas of the body in medically significant concentration. The liquid is confined to the mouth chamber. Such vapors as might reach the nasal passage would not be in therapeutic concentration. Petitioner did not offer any evidence that vapors reached the affected areas in significant concentration.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-18\">Third, the Commission found that even if significant quantities of the active ingredients of Listerine were to reach the critical sites where cold viruses enter and infect the body, they could not interfere with the activities of the virus because they could not penetrate the tissue cells.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-19\">Fourth, the Commission discounted the results of a clinical study conducted by petitioner on which petitioner heavily relies. Petitioner contends that in a four-year study schoolchildren who gargled with Listerine had fewer colds and cold symptoms than those who did not gargle with Listerine. The Commission found that the design and execution of the \u201cSt. Barnabas study\u201d made its results unreliable. For the first two years of the four-year test no placebo was given to the control group. For the last two years the placebo was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>inadequate: the control group was given colored water which did not resemble Listerine in smell or taste. There was also evidence that the physician who examined the test subjects was not blinded<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> from knowing which children were using Listerine and which were not, that his evaluation of the cold symptoms of each child each day may have been imprecise, and that he necessarily relied on the non-blinded child\u2019s subjective reporting. Both the ALJ and the Commission analyzed the St. Barnabas study and the expert testimony about it in depth and were justified in concluding that its results are unreliable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Fifth, the Commission found that the ability of Listerine to kill germs by millions on contact is of no medical significance in the treatment of colds or sore throats. Expert testimony showed that bacteria in the oral cavity, the \u201cgerms\u201d which Listerine purports to kill, do not cause colds and play no role in cold symptoms. Colds are caused by viruses. Further, \u201cwhile Listerine kills millions of bacteria in the mouth, it also leaves millions. It is impossible to sterilize any area of the mouth, let alone the entire mouth.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Sixth, the Commission found that Listerine has no significant beneficial effect on the symptoms of sore throat. The Commission recognized that gargling with Listerine could provide temporary relief from a sore throat by removing accumulated debris irritating the throat.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But this type of relief can also be obtained by gargling with salt water or even warm water.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Commission found that this is not the significant relief promised by petitioner\u2019s advertisements. It was reasonable to conclude that \u201csuch temporary relief does not \u2018lessen the severity\u2019 of a sore throat any more than expectorating or blowing one\u2019s nose \u2018lessens the severity\u2019 of a cold.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">In its attack on the Commission\u2019s findings, petitioner relies heavily on a recent study of over-the-counter cold remedies by the Food and Drug Administration <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> which petitioner alleges found Listerine \u201clikely to be effective.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Its argument is two-pronged: first, that the fact that the Commission\u2019s findings differ from the FDA\u2019s proves that the Commission\u2019s findings are wrong; and second, that it was error for the Commission to refuse to reopen its proceedings when the FDA study was released. We conclude that both of these arguments are without merit for the simple reason that the FDA study does not, to any significant degree, contradict the Commission\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-11\">The FDA study is the product of an expert panel appointed in 1972 to study all over-the-counter cold, cough, allergy, bronchodilator, and anti-asthmatic drug products \u2014 some 180 ingredients used in as many as 50,000 products.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The panel\u2019s draft report was issued in February 1976, two months after the FTC issued its order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>against Listerine. The FTC refused to reopen its proceedings to consider the draft report. In September 1976 the expert panel\u2019s report was published, but it has not yet been adopted by the Commissioner of the FDA.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The only evidence pertinent to the effectiveness of Listerine that the FDA panel considered was the St. Barnabas study, and it appears that reference to it was included in the report only as an afterthought.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> More importantly, the reference which does appear does not endorse or adopt the St. Barnabas study; the FDA report merely describes it and recounts the results.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The panel\u2019s own conclusions are reflected in the operative language repeated for each ingredient of Listerine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-6\">There are no well-controlled studies documenting the effectiveness of [eucalyptol/eucalyptus oil, menthol, thymol] as an [antitussive, expectorant, nasal decongestant].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-11\">* * * * * sic</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-12\">For use as a mouthwash: Data to demonstrate effectiveness will be required * * * [<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-13\">Each ingredient of Listerine was placed in Category III, defined as \u201cthe available data are insufficient to classify such condition under either [Category I, generally recognized as safe and effective] or [Category II, not generally recognized as safe and effective] and for which further testing is therefore required.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Petitioner\u2019s assertion that this is equivalent to finding the product \u201clikely to be effective\u201d is not supported by the facts.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>In sum, the FDA study does not reflect any new data not considered by the FTC. Since the FDA did not consider the extensive record compiled in the FTC proceedings, its conclusion that there is insufficient data about the ingredients of Listerine to justify classifying it as effective or ineffective is not necessarily inconsistent with the FTC\u2019s conclusion that Listerine\u2019s advertising claims are deceptive. The FTC did not err in refusing to reopen its proceedings to consider the draft FDA study, and the FDA findings do not establish that the FTC\u2019s conclusions are wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">III. THE COMMISSION\u2019S POWER</p>\n<p id=\"AI8\">Petitioner contends that even if its advertising claims in the past were false, the portion of the Commission\u2019s order requiring \u201ccorrective advertising\u201d exceeds the Commission\u2019s statutory power. The argument is based upon a literal reading of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which authorizes the Commission to issue \u201ccease and desist\u201d orders against violators and does not expressly mention any other remedies.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s position, on the other hand, is that the affirmative disclosure that Listerine will not prevent colds or lessen their severity is absolutely necessary to give effect to the prospective cease and desist order; a hundred years of false cold claims have built up a large reservoir of erroneous consumer belief which would persist, unless corrected, long after petitioner ceased making the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">The need for the corrective advertising remedy and its appropriateness in this case are important issues which we will explore <em>infra. </em>But the threshold question is whether the Commission has the authority to issue such an order.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">Petitioner\u2019s narrow reading of Section 5 was at one time shared by the Supreme Court. In <em>FTC v. Eastman Kodak Co. </em>the Court held that the Commission\u2019s authority did not exceed that expressly conferred by statute. The Commission has not, the Court said, \u201cbeen delegated the authority of a court of equity.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">But the modern view is very different. In 1963 the Court ruled that the Civil Aeronautics Board has authority to order divestiture in addition to ordering cessation of unfair methods of competition by air carriers.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The CAB statute, like Section 5, spoke only of the authority to issue cease and desist orders, but the Court said, \u201cWe do not read the Act so restrictively. * * [W]here the problem lies within the purview of the Board, * * * Congress must have intended to give it authority that was ample to deal with the evil at hand.\u201d The Court continued, \u201cAuthority to mold administrative decrees is indeed like the authority of courts to frame injunctive decrees * * * . [The] power to order divestiture need not be explicitly included in the powers of an administrative agency to be part of its arsenal of authority * * .\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-13\">Later, in <em>FTC </em>v. <em>Dean Foods Co., </em>the Court applied <em>Pan American </em>to the Federal Trade Commission.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In upholding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>Commission\u2019s power to seek a preliminary injunction against a proposed merger, the Court held that it was not necessary to find express statutory authority for the power. Rather, the Court concluded, \u201cIt would stultify congressional purpose to say that the Commission did not have the * * * power ***.*** Such ancillary powers have always been treated as essential to the effective discharge of the Commission\u2019s responsibilities.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aqp\">Thus it is clear that the Commission has the power to shape remedies which go beyond the simple cease and desist order. Our next inquiry must be whether a corrective advertising order is for any reason outside the range of permissible remedies. Petitioner and <em>amici curiae </em>argue that it is because (1) legislative history precludes it, (2) it impinges on the First Amendment, and (3) it has never been approved by any court.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">A. <em>Legislative History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Petitioner relies on the legislative history of the 1914 Federal Trade Commission Act<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and the Wheeler-Lea amendments to it in 1938<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> for the proposition that corrective advertising was not contemplated. In 1914 and in 1938 Congress chose not to authorize such remedies as criminal penalties, treble damages, or civil penalties, but that fact does not dispose of the question of corrective advertising.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">Petitioner\u2019s reliance on the legislative history of the 1975 amendments to the Act<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> is also misplaced. The amendments added a new Section 19 to the Act authorizing the Commission to bring suits in federal District Courts to redress injury to consumers resulting from a deceptive practice. The section authorizes the court to grant such relief as it \u201cfinds necessary to redress injury to consumers or other persons, partnerships, and corporations resulting from the rule violation or the unfair or deceptive act or practice,\u201d including, but not limited to,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-13\">rescission or reformation of contracts, the refund of money or return of property, the payment of damages, and public notification respecting the rule violation or the unfair or deceptive act or practice * * * [<footnotemark>35</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-15\">Petitioner and <em>amici </em>contend that this congressional grant <em>to a court </em>of power to order public notification of a violation establishes that the Commission by itself does not have that power.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-16\">We note first that \u201cpublic notification\u201d is not synonymous with corrective advertising; public notification is a much broader term and may take any one of many forms.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Second, the \u201cpublic notification\u201d contemplated by the amendment is directed at <em>past </em>consumers of the product (\u201cto redress injury\u201d), whereas the type of corrective advertising currently before us is directed at <em>future </em>consumers. Third, petitioner\u2019s construction of the section runs directly contrary to the congressional intent as expressed in a later subsection: \u201cNothing in this section shall be construed to affect any authority of the Commission un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>der any other provision of law.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Moreover, this intent is amplified by the conference committee\u2019s report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-4\">The section * * * is not intended to modify or limit any existing power the Commission may have to itself issue orders designed to remedying [sic] violations of the law. That issue is now before the courts. It is not the intent of the Conferees to influence the outcome in any way.[<footnotemark>38</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">We conclude that this legislative history cannot be said to remove corrective advertising from the class of permissible remedies.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">B. <em>The First Amendment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">Petitioner and a <em>mid </em>further contend that corrective advertising is not a permissible remedy because it trenches on the First Amendment. Petitioner is correct that this triggers a special responsibility on the Commission to order corrective advertising only if the restriction inherent in its order is no greater than necessary to serve the interest involved.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> But this goes to the appropriateness of the order in this case, an issue we reach in Part IV of this opinion. <em>Amici curiae </em>go further, arguing that, since the Supreme Court has recently extended First Amendment protection to commercial advertising<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> mandatory corrective advertising is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-12\">A careful reading of <em>Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer </em>Council<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> compels rejection of this argument. For the Supreme Court expressly noted that the First Amendment presents \u201cno obstacle\u201d to government regulation of false or misleading advertising. The First Amendment, the Court said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-13\">as we construe it today, does not prohibit the State from insuring that the stream of commercial information flow[s] cleanly as well as freelyJ<footnotemark>43</footnotemark>!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-14\">In a footnote the Court went on to delineate several differences between commercial speech and other forms which may suggest \u201cthat a different degree of protection is necessary * * *For example, the Court said, they may</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-15\">make it appropriate to require that a commercial message appear in such a form, or include such additional information, warnings, and disclaimers, as are necessary to prevent its being deceptive.[<footnotemark>44</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>The Supreme Court clearly foresaw the very question before us, and its statement is dispositive of <em>amici\u2019s </em>contention.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">C. <em>Precedents</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">According to petitioner, \u201cThe first reference to corrective advertising in Commission decisions occurred in 1970, nearly fifty years and untold numbers of false advertising cases after passage of the Act.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> In petitioner\u2019s view, the late emergence of this \u201cnewly discovered\u201d <footnotemark>47</footnotemark> remedy is itself evidence that it is beyond the Commission\u2019s authority. This argument fails on two counts. First the fact that an agency has not asserted a power over a period of years is not proof that the agency lacks such power.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Second, and more importantly, we are not convinced that the corrective advertising remedy is really such an innovation. The label may be newly coined, but the concept is well established. It is simply that under certain circumstances an advertiser may be required to make affirmative disclosure of unfavorable facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">One such circumstance is when an advertisement that did not contain the disclosure would be misleading. For example, the Commission has ordered the sellers of treatments for baldness to disclose that the vast majority of cases of thinning hair and baldness are attributable to heredity, age, and endocrine balance (so-called \u201cmale pattern baldness\u201d) and that their treatment would have no effect whatever on this type of baldness.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> It has ordered the promoters of a device for stopping bedwetting to disclose-that the device would not be of value in cases caused by organic defects or diseases.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> And it has ordered the makers of Geritol, an iron supplement, to disclose that Geritol will relieve symptoms of tiredness only in persons who suffer from iron deficiency anemia, and that the vast majority of people who experience such symptoms do not have such a deficiency.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-17\">Each of these orders was approved on appeal over objections that it exceeded the Commission\u2019s statutory authority.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> The decisions reflect a recognition that, as the Supreme Court has stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-18\">If the Commission is to attain the objectives Congress envisioned, it cannot be required to confine its road block to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>narrow lane the transgressor has traveled; it must be allowed effectively to close all roads to the prohibited goal, so that its order may not be by-passed with impunity I<footnotemark>53</footnotemark>!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Affirmative disclosure has also been required when an advertisement, although not misleading if taken alone, becomes misleading considered in light of past advertisements. For example, for 60 years Royal Baking Powder Company had stressed in its advertising that its product was superior because it was made with cream of tartar, not phosphate. But, faced with rising costs of cream of tartar, the time came when it changed its ingredients and became a phosphate baking powder. It carefully removed from all labels and advertisements any reference to cream of tartar and corrected the list of ingredients. But the new labels used the familiar arrangement of lettering, coloration, and design, so that they looked exactly like the old ones. A new advertising campaign stressed the new low cost of the product and dropped all reference to cream of tartar. But the advertisements were also silent on the subject of phosphate and did not disclose the change in the product.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">The Commission held, and the Second Circuit agreed, that the new advertisements were deceptive, since they did not advise consumers that their reasons for buying the powder in the past no longer applied. The court held that it was proper to require the company to take affirmative steps to advise the public.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> To continue to sell the new powder</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-10\">on the strength of the reputation attained through 60 years of its manufacture and sale and wide advertising of its superior powder, under an impression induced by its advertisements that the product purchased was the same in kind and as superior as that which had been so long manufactured by it, was unfair alike to the public and to the competitors in the baking powder business.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">In another case<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> the Waltham Watch Company of Massachusetts had become renowned for the manufacture of fine clocks since 1849. Soon after it stopped manufacturing clocks in the 1950\u2019s, it transferred its trademarks, good will, and the trade name \u201cWaltham\u201d to a successor corporation, which began importing clocks from Europe for resale in the United States. The imported clocks were advertised as \u201cproduct of Waltham Watch Company since 1850,\u201d \u201ca famous 150-year-old company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-12\">The Commission found that the advertisements caused consumers to believe they were buying the same fine Massachusetts clocks of which they had heard for many years. To correct this impression the Commission ordered the company to disclose in all advertisements and on the product that the clock was not made by the old Waltham company and that it was imported. The Seventh Circuit affirmed, relying on \u201cthe well-established general principle that the Commission may require affirmative disclosure for the purpose of preventing future deception.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>It appears to us that the orders in <em>Royal </em>and <em>Waltham </em>were the same kind of remedy the Commission has ordered here. Like Royal and Waltham, Listerine has built up over a period of many years a widespread reputation. When it was ascertained that that reputation no longer applied to the product, it was necessary to take action to correct it.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Here, as in <em>Royal </em>and <em>Walt-ham, </em>it is the accumulated impact of <em>past </em>advertising that necessitates disclosure in <em>future </em>advertising.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> To allow consumers to continue to buy the product on the strength of the impression built up by prior advertising \u2014 an impression which is now known to be false \u2014 would be unfair and deceptive.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>IV. THE REMEDY</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Having established that the Commission does have the power to order corrective advertising in appropriate cases, it remains to consider whether use of the remedy against Listerine is warranted and eq-</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">, uitable. We have concluded that part 3 of the order should be modified to delete the phrase \u201cContrary to prior advertising.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> With that modification, we approve the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Our role in reviewing the remedy is limited. The Supreme Court has set forth the standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-7\">The Commission is the expert body to determine what remedy is necessary to eliminate the unfair or deceptive trade practices which have been disclosed. It has wide latitude for judgment and the courts will not interfere except where the remedy selected has no reasonable relation to the unlawful practices found to exist.[<footnotemark>62</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">The Commission has adopted the following standard for the imposition of corrective advertising:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-9\">[I]f a deceptive advertisement has played a substantial role in creating or reinforcing in the public\u2019s mind a false and material belief which lives on after the false advertising ceases, there is clear and continuing injury to competition and to the consuming public as consumers continue to make purchasing decisions based on the false belief. Since this injury cannot be averted by merely requiring respondent to cease disseminating the advertisement, we may appropriately order respondent to take affirmative action designed to terminate the otherwise continuing ill effects of the advertisement. [<footnotemark>63</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-13\">We think this.standard is entirely reasonable. It dictates two factual inquiries: (1) did Listerine\u2019s advertisements play a substantial role in creating or reinforcing in the public\u2019s mind a false belief about the product? and (2) would this belief linger on after the false advertising ceases? It strikes us that if the answer to both questions is not yes, companies everywhere may be wasting their massive advertising budgets. Indeed, it is more than a little peculiar to hear petitioner assert that its commercials really have no effect on consumer belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-14\">For these reasons it might be appropriate in some cases to presume the existence of the two factual predicates for corrective advertising.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> But we need not decide that question, or rely on presumptions here, because the Commission adduced survey evidence to support both propositions. We find that the \u201cProduct Q\u201d survey data and the expert testimony interpreting them<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>constitute substantial evidence in support of the need for corrective advertising in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">We turn next to the specific disclosure required: \u201cContrary to prior advertising, Listerine will not help prevent colds or sore throats or lessen their severity.\u201d Petitioner is ordered to include this statement in every future advertisement for Listerine for a defined period.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> In printed advertisements it must be displayed in type size at least as large as that in which the principal portion of the text of the advertisement appears and it must be separated from the text so that it can be readily noticed. In television commercials the disclosure must be presented simultaneously in both audio and visual portions. During the audio portion of the disclosure in television and radio advertisements, no other sounds, including music, may occur.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">These specifications are well calculated to assure that the disclosure will reach the public. It will necessarily attract the notice of readers, viewers, and listeners, and be plainly conveyed. Given these safeguards, we believe the preamble \u201cContrary to prior advertising\u201d is not necessary. It can serve only two purposes: either to attract attention that a correction follows or to humiliate the advertiser. The Commission claims only the first purpose for it, and this we think is obviated by the other terms of the order.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> The second purpose, if it were intended, might be called for in an egregious case of deliberate deception,<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> but this is not one. While we do not decide whether petitioner proffered its cold claims in good faith or bad, the record compiled could support a finding of good faith.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> On these facts, the confessional preamble to the disclosure is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-13\">Finally, petitioner challenges the duration of the disclosure requirement. By its terms it continues until respondent has expended on Listerine advertising a sum equal to the average annual Listerine advertising budget for the period April 1962 to March 1972. That is approximately ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>million dollars.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Thus if petitioner continues to advertise normally the corrective advertising will be required for about one year. We cannot say that is an unreasonably long time in which to correct a hundred years of cold claims. But, to petitioner\u2019s distress, the requirement will not expire by mere passage of time. If petitioner cuts back its Listerine advertising, or ceases it altogether, it can only postpone the duty to disclose.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> The Commission concluded that correction was required and that a duration of a fixed period of time might not accomplish that task, since petitioner could evade the order by choosing not to advertise at all. The formula settled upon by the Commission is reasonably related to the violation it found.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Accordingly, the order, as modified, is</p>\n<p id=\"Ar_\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b826-12\">.

We thus find unpersuasive petitioner\u2019s contention that the corrective advertising ordered here is unprecedented in that it seeks \u201cto eliminate perceived future effects of past violations that are wholly unrelated to future conduct * * Petitioner\u2019s br. at 26. We agree with the Commission that the \u201ccommon thread\u201d linking earlier corrective advertising cases extends to the present case as well. <em>See 3A </em>894.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">The distinctions petitioner seeks to draw between the present case and earlier corrective advertising cases are essentially semantic. It argues that, unlike <em>Royal, Waltham, </em>and similar cases, here the Commission made no specific finding that even truthful future Listerine ads would themselves be deceptive without a corrective statement. Petitioner\u2019s br. at 38. Similarly, while petitioner appears to concede that continued <em>sales </em>of a product under false pretenses may constitute violation of the FTC Act justifying imposition of corrective advertising, it argues that the Commission offered no evidence to support a finding of such a violation here. Petitioner\u2019s br. at 26. It seems clear to us that these various different \u201ctheories\u201d are in fact simply different ways of describing the same thing. The nature of the violation, and the nature of the remedy required, are no different whether one says that future truthful <em>ads </em>will be \u201cdeceptive\u201d when viewed against the backdrop of earlier advertising, or that future <em>sales </em>to customers who have been misled by earlier advertising will constitute the deceptive practice, or, as the Commission said here, that \u201cthere is clear and continuing injury to competition and to the consuming public as consumers continue to make purchasing decisions based on the false belief [that arose from prior deceptive advertisements].\u201d JA 894. The Commission\u2019s authority to impose corrective advertising obviously should not turn upon the particular verbal formula chosen in a particular case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"60\">\n<p id=\"b835-10\">.

He gets to use the deceptive advertisements until he is caught \u2014 more precisely, until Commission proceedings, which usually drag on for years, are completed against him. By the time the order has become final, the particular campaign has probably been squeezed dry, if not already discarded. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>the meantime the seller has increased his market share and reaped handsome profits.

The Commission\u2019s authority to enter cease and desist orders is prospective in nature; the purpose of cease and desist orders is \u201cto prevent illegal practices in the future\u201d, <em>FTC v. Ruberoid Co., </em>343 U.S. 470, 473, 72 S.Ct. 800, 803, 96 L.Ed. 1081 (1952), not \u201cto punish or to fasten liability on respondents for past conduct\u201d. <em>FTC v.

FTC, </em>327 U.S. 608, 610-12, 66 S.Ct. 758, 90 L.Ed. 888 (1946), stand only for the proposition that the Commission has broad discretion in determining what conduct of a respondent shall be forbidden prospectively. I think this authority does not encompass the power to employ the retrospective remedy of corrective advertising; and I find no other basis for that asserted power.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">As the majority recognizes, Congress by amendment of the Federal Trade Commission Act in 1975 authorized the Commission to commence civil actions in federal district courts, to remedy unfair or deceptive acts or practices \u201cwith respect to which the Commission has issued a final cease and desist order\u201d. As part of the relief granted in such an action the court was given the power to order \u201cpublic notification respecting the . . unfair or deceptive acts or practices\u201d. So far as pertinent the amendment reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-7\">(2) If any person, partnership, or corporation engages in any unfair or deceptive act or practice (within the meaning of section 45(a) of this title) <em>with respect to which the Commission has issued a final cease and desist order </em>which is applicable to such person, partnership, or corporation, then the Commission may commence a civil action against such person, partnership, or corporation in a United States district court or in any court of competent jurisdiction of a State. <em>If the Commission satisfies the court that the act or practice to which the cease and desist order relates is one which a reasonable man would have known under the circumstances was dishonest or fraudulent, the court may grant relief under subsection (b) of this section.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-8\">(b) The court in an action under subsection (a) of this section shall have jurisdiction to grant such relief as the court finds necessary to redress injury to consumers or other persons, partnerships, and corporations resulting from the rule violation or the unfair or deceptive act or practice, as the case may be. Such relief may include, but shall not be limited to, recission or reformation of contracts, the refund of money or return of property, the payment of damages, and <em>public notification </em>respecting the rule violation or the unfair or deceptive act or practice, as the case may be; except that nothing in this subsection is intended to authorize the imposition of any exemplary or punitive damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 57b(a)(2) and 57b(b). [Emphasis supplied]</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">The majority comments briefly that the 1975 Amendment \u201ccannot be said to remove corrective advertising from the class of permissible remedies\u201d; the expressed \u201ccongressional intent\u201d, says the majority, is to the contrary. I think the 1975 legislation cannot be so lightly dismissed. The amendment indicates to me that at least in the judgment of the Congress the Commission does not have, and is not intended to have, the power to order \u201cpublic notification\u201d by way of corrective advertising. If the Commission already had that power, why was the amendment necessary? Moreover, the majority fails to note that under the amendment a district court can order public notification only on a showing that the respondent acted in bad faith. Yet the theory of the Commission, accepted by the majority, is that the Commission may enter a corrective advertising order even though a false advertisement was published in good faith. To me it is strange that the Congress would require a court to find bad faith, while authorizing the Commission to act in the absence of bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">The majority attempts to distinguish \u201cpublic notification\u201d from corrective advertising. First, says the majority, \u201cpublic notification is a much broader term\u201d than corrective advertising. It is clear to me however that the term public notification includes corrective advertising of the type ordered in this case. Indeed, the examples of public notification given by the majority (n.36) are simply variations of corrective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>advertisements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, the majority says \u201cthe \u2018public notification\u2019 contemplated by the amendment is directed at <em>past </em>consumers of the product . . . whereas the type of corrective advertising currently before us is directed at <em>future </em>consumers.\u201d [Emphasis in original] I think the term \u201cpublic notification\u201d must not be construed so narrowly that future consumers are ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">My view of the significance of the amendment is buttressed by the statement of Senator Moss, a co-sponsor of the bill, 120 Cong.Rec. 40712 (1974): \u201cThe Federal Trade Commission\u2019s improvements specified in the bill will afford, in my opinion, long-term improvement in the fairness of the American marketplace. No longer will the Federal Trade Commission be confined to slapping the wrists of persons who engage in unfair or deceptive practices and telling them not to do it again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">The majority relies upon the statement in the Conference Committee\u2019s report and the provision in the amendment to the effect that it does not affect any \u201cexisting power\u201d of the Commission. S.Rep. No. 93-1408, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 1974, reprinted in [1974] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 7774; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 57b(e). The majority seems to think these statements indicate a congressional intent to give the Commission authority to order corrective advertising. I am unable to understand this reasoning. The question before us is what is the \u201cexisting power\u201d of the Commission, and that question is not answered by either the amendment or the Committee\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">I find nothing in the cases that justifies the Commission\u2019s corrective advertising order. In particular, I am not persuaded by the majority\u2019s quotations from the opinions of the Supreme Court in <em>Pan American World Airways, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U.S. 296, 83 S.Ct. 476, 9 L.Ed.2d 325 (1963), and <em>FTC v. Dean Foods Co., </em>384 U.S. 597, 86 S.Ct. 1738, 16 L.Ed.2d 802 (1966). Taken in the context of the facts of those cases the quoted language does not support the majority\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">In the <em>Pan American </em>case the Court considered the power of the Civil Aeronautics Board under section 411 of the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1958, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381, to order an air carrier to cease and desist from \u201cunfair . . practices or unfair methods of competition\u201d. The Court held that the Board\u2019s jurisdiction over unfair practices and unfair methods of competition, together with its power under the Act to regulate air carriers, and to deal with consolidations, mergers, interlocking relations, pooling arrangements, etc., 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1378, 1379, and its authority to enforce the Clayton Act as it is applicable to air carriers, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 21, empower the Board to order divestiture when a combination between carriers violates the antitrust laws and hinders the Board\u2019s restructuring of routes. Considered in the light of the specific and extensive statutory underpinning upon which the Court based this decision it is a far cry from a holding that the power to order divestiture was derived only from the authority to issue cease and desist orders, as the majority opinion suggests.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Certainly it does not follow from this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>that the power of the Federal Trade Commission to order corrective advertising can be derived from its authority to issue cease and desist orders, standing alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">For similar reasons the language quoted by the majority from the <em>Dean Foods </em>case is not persuasive. As stated by the Supreme Court the issue in that case was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-6\">. the power of the Court of Appeals under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a) (1964 ed.), to temporarily enjoin the consummation of a merger that is under attack before the Federal Trade Commission as violative of \u00a7 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 64 Stat. 1125, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 18 (1964 ed.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 599, 86 S.Ct. at 1740. The Court noted that the Clayton Act granted the Commission the power to determine the legality of a merger and to order divestiture if it proved to be appropriate, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 21(b); and the Court therefore held that the Commission might apply to a court of appeals for a preliminary injunction to maintain the status quo until the Commission decided the matter and the court of appeals reviewed the Commission\u2019s decision. The power to pray for an injunction was described by the Supreme Court as \u201cincidental\u201d to the Commission\u2019s authority under the Clayton Act. <em>Id. </em>at 606, 86 S.Ct. 1738. To deny this plainly incidental power to preserve the Commission\u2019s and the court\u2019s jurisdiction, said the Supreme Court, \u201cwould stultify congressional purpose.\u201d Here again I think this decision does not support the majority\u2019s leap to the conclusion that the power to issue a cease and desist order, without more, authorizes the Commission to enter a corrective advertising order, nor does the decision justify a conclusion that the corrective order can be sustained under some general remedial power of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">The other cases cited by the majority do not justify the Commission\u2019s order. In those cases an affirmative disclosure was required because failure to reveal material facts, in the light of the representations made in advertisements, made them misleading. Thus in the case of <em>Ward Laboratories, Inc. v. FTC, </em>276 F.2d 952 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>364 U.S. 827, 81 S.Ct. 65, 5 L.Ed.2d 55 (1960), cited by the majority, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-11\">Any requirement of an affirmative disclosure of a negative is always to be approached with caution. Merely because a remedy is useful for any one ailment is no reason to demand an accompanying statement of all the ills for which it is not beneficial. Even this principle, however, must yield <em>where the advertisements are misleading because of failure to reveal facts material in the light of the representations made therein. In arriving at such a conclusion the advertisements (format and copy) and the potential customer they are intended to reach must be analyzed.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 954. [Emphasis supplied]</p>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">Similar reasoning may be found in <em>Keele Hair &amp; Scalp Specialists, Inc. v. FTC, </em>275 F.2d 18 (5th Cir. 1960); <em>Feil v. FTC, </em>285 F.2d 879 (9th Cir. 1960); and J. <em>B. Williams Co. v. FTC, </em>381 F.2d 884 (6th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-14\">In <em>Royal Baking Powder Co. v. FTC, </em>281 F. 744 (2d Cir. 1922), relied upon by the majority, a manufacturer by employing false and misleading labeling and advertising represented that a phosphate baking powder which it was offering for sale was the same as the more expensive cream of tartar baking powder which it had manufactured for many years. The baking powder company was in the position a liquor dealer would be in today if he used Haig &amp; Haig pinch bottles and labels when purveying moonshine whiskey. The court held that the Commission properly ordered the company, by correcting its false and misleading advertising, to cease and desist from this unfair method of competition. In <em>Waltham Watch Co. v. FTC, </em>318 F.2d 28 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U.S. 944, 84 S.Ct. 349, 11 L.Ed.2d 274 (1963), an advertisement represented that clocks offered for sale were manufactured by a \u201cfamous 150-year-old company\u201d, the original Waltham Watch Company of Massachusetts. The fact was that the original Waltham Company had nothing to do with the clocks of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>fered for sale, which were imported from Europe. The Commission ordered the advertisers to cease and desist from using the name Waltham in connection with the sale of clocks unless the public was warned that they were not manufactured by the Walt-ham Watch Company in Waltham, Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">The majority finds \u201cthat the orders in <em>Royal </em>and <em>Waltham </em>were the same kind of remedy the Commission has ordered here\u201d. I cannot agree. In those cases advertisements falsely represented that the products offered for sale were the same as the products, well-known to the public, which had been offered in the past. The Commission\u2019s orders simply required these false representations to be corrected in future advertisements using the same or similar format or copy. In the present case, however, when Warner-Lambert has ceased and desisted from advertising Listerine as a remedy for colds and sore throats there will be nothing to correct in the text of the Listerine advertisements. Any \u201ccorrective statement\u201d will relate solely to past advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Finally, in considering the validity of the Commission\u2019s order the majority fails to focus on all its terms. Section III of the order forbids <em>any </em>advertisements for Listerine without the corrective statement. Yet it is conceded that Listerine is effective as a mouth wash and breath freshener, and it appears that in recent years much the greater part of Warner-Lambert\u2019s advertising budget for Listerine has been spent in promoting these uses of the preparation. Thus the Commission and the majority would forbid the publication of truthful advertisements of Listerine\u2019s effectiveness unless coupled with a disclaimer relating to uses advertised in the past. I cannot believe that the statute contemplates such a remedy, which goes far beyond the prevention of \u201cillegal practices in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The theory of the majority is that whenever \u201cadvertisements play a substantial role in creating or reinforcing in the public\u2019s mind a false belief about [a] product\u201d and \u201cthis belief [may] linger on after the false advertising ceases\u201d, corrective advertising may be ordered. As the majority apparently concedes, this test would apply to almost any advertisement which is the subject of a cease and desist order. I cannot accept this concept. I reject the proposition that the after-effects of advertising which has been discontinued pursuant to a cease and desist order can thus expand the Commission\u2019s statutory power to prevent future illegal practices. <em>See Heater v. FTC, </em>503 F.2d 321, 323-25 (9th Cir. 1974). In my opinion such an expansion must be made by the Congress, not by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION ON PETITION FOR REHEARING</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">In its petition for rehearing petitioner has urged this court to reconsider its earlier decision affirming, with some modifications, the order of the Federal Trade Commission requiring Warner-Lambert Company to cease and desist from deceptively advertising its product Listerine as a cure for colds or sore throat and affirmatively to correct in its future advertisements the impression created by its prior deceptive advertising. The primary argument raised in the petition for rehearing is that the Commission is barred by the First Amendment from imposing a corrective advertising order in this case. Having considered this claim carefully, it is our conclusion that it must be rejected. Because of the importance of the issues raised, however, we think it desirable to set forth in some detail our reasons for so concluding.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\">In <em>Virginia State Board of Pharmacy </em>v. <em>Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., </em>425 U.S. 748, 96 S.Ct. 1817, 48 L.Ed.2d 346 (1976), the Supreme Court rejected prior precedents holding that commercial speech is \u201cwholly outside the protection of the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 761, 96 S.Ct. at 1825. In reaching this conclusion the Court emphasized the interest of consumers in the free flow of truthful information necessary for formulation of intelligent opinions and proper resource allocation. <em>Id. </em>at 764-765, 96 S.Ct. 1817. Consistent with this concern, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>the Court was careful to distinguish truthful commercial speech from that which is false, misleading, or deceptive: \u201cUntruthful speech, commercial or otherwise, has never been protected for its own sake. * * * Obviously, much commercial speech is not provably false, or even wholly false, but only deceptive or misleading. We foresee no obstacle to a State\u2019s dealing effectively with this problem.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 771, 96 S.Ct. at 1830 (citations and footnote omitted). Furthermore, the Court went on to suggest that, because of the \u201ccommonsense differences\u201d between commercial speech and other varieties, even commercial speech subject to First Amendment protections may nonetheless enjoy a \u201cdifferent degree of protection\u201d than that normally accorded under the First Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 771-772 n.24, 96 S.Ct. 1817.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Applying these principles to the case at bar, there can be no question of the legitimacy of the FTC\u2019s role in regulating and preventing false and deceptive advertising. In this case it has been found that Warner-Lambert has, over a long period of time, worked a substantial deception upon the public; it has advertised Listerine as a cure for colds, and consumers have purchased its product with that in mind. That the Commission has authority to prohibit Warner-Lambert from continuing to make such false and deceptive claims in its advertisements is not disputed, for it is only truthful claims which are protected under the First Amendment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Here, however, the FTC has determined on substantial evidence that the deception of the public occasioned by Warner-Lambert\u2019s past advertisements will not be halted by merely requiring Warner-Lambert to cease making such claims in the future. To be sure, current and future advertising of Listerine, when viewed in isolation, may not contain any statements which are themselves false or deceptive. But reality counsels that such advertisements cannot be viewed in isolation; they must be seen against the background of over 50 years in which Listerine has been proclaimed \u2014 and purchased \u2014 as a remedy for colds. When viewed from this perspective, advertising which fails to rebut the prior claims as to Listerine\u2019s efficacy inevitably builds upon those claims; continued advertising continues the deception, albeit implicitly rather than explicitly.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It will induce people to continue to buy Listerine thinking it will cure colds. Thus the Commission found on substantial evidence that the corrective order was necessary to \u201cdissipate the effects of respondent\u2019s deceptive representations.\u201d FTC op. at 41, JA 907.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">Under this reasoning the First Amendment presents no direct obstacle. The Commission is not regulating truthful speech protected by the First Amendment, but is merely requiring certain statements which, if not present in current and future advertisements, would render those advertisements themselves part of a continuing deception of the public. As the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Virginia State Board, </em>in some cases it may be \u201cappropriate to require that a commercial message appear in such a form, or include such additional information, warnings, and disclaimers, as are necessary to prevent its being deceptive.\u201d 425 U.S. at 772 n.24, 96 S.Ct. at 1830-31. We must conclude \u2014 as did the Commission \u2014 that this is such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">Admittedly, corrective advertising orders such as that imposed here may give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>rise to concern as to their chilling effect on protected truthful speech. The potential advertiser must consider not only the possibility that he will be forced, at some' future date, to abandon his advertising campaign, but also that he may be required to include specific disclaimers in future advertisements. But this danger seems more theoretical than real. As the Supreme Court pointed out in <em>Virginia State Board, </em>not only is the truth of commercial speech \u201cmore easily verifiable by its disseminator\u201d than other forms of speech, but \u201c[s]ince advertising is the <em>sine qua non </em>of commercial profits, there is little likelihood of its being chilled by proper regulation and forgone entirely.\u201d 425 U.S. at 771-772 n.24, 96 S.Ct. at 1830.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Moreover, whatever incremental chill is caused by a corrective advertising order beyond that which would result from a cease and desist order may well be necessary if the interest of consumers in truthful information is to be served at all. Otherwise, advertisers remain free to misrepresent their products to the public through false and deceptive claims, knowing full well that even if the FTC chooses to prosecute they will be required only to cease an advertising campaign which by that point will, in all likelihood, have served its purpose by deceiving the public and already been replaced. <em>See </em>panel majority op. at - n.60, 562 F.2d at 761 n.60; Pitofsky, <em>Beyond Nader: Consumer Protection and the Regulation of Advertising, </em>90 Harv. L.Rev. 661, 692-693 &amp; nn.129-130 (1976) (emphasizing the relatively small number of complaints issued by the FTC each year and the lengthy time period between complaints and orders); Note, <em>\u201cCorrective Advertising\u201d Orders of the Federal Trade Commission, </em>85 Harv.L.Rev. 477, 482-483 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">A more serious First Amendment problem which may be raised by corrective advertising orders involves the burden thereby imposed upon the constitutional right recognized in <em>Virginia State Board </em>to advertise truthfully: the party subject to a corrective advertising order may be precluded from exercising his right to advertise unless he also includes specified statements undermining his prior deceptive claims. On the facts of this case, no burden is imposed upon truthful, protected advertising since, as the Commission makes clear, Listerine\u2019s current advertising, if not accompanied by a corrective message, would itself continue to mislead the public. Even if, in the circumstances of this case, the current and future advertising of Listerine is considered constitutionally protected speech, however, we think the corrective advertising order in this case remains appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">The Supreme Court, in invalidating the state ban on advertising of prescription drug prices in <em>Virginia State Board, </em>considered the scope of the restriction on First Amendment rights, the governmental purposes and public interests affected by the ban, and the availability of alternative means to accomplish the legitimate governmental objectives. <em>See </em>425 U.S. at 764-770, 96 S.Ct. 1817. <em>See also Bates v. State Bar of </em>Arizona,-U.S.-,---, 97 S.Ct. 2691, 53 L.Ed.2d 810 (1977). As we have indicated, it is not at all clear, even after <em>Virginia State Board, </em>that commercial speech protected by the First Amendment is, apart from \u201ccommonsense differences,\u201d entitled to the same degree of protection as other forms.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Indeed, the opposite conclusion seems the more appropriate one.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But in any event, it does seem clear that the corrective advertising order in this case is the least restrictive means of achieving a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>substantial and important governmental objective and that, on balance, it must be upheld.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 25-29, 65-68, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976); <em>Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., </em>427 U.S. 50, 96 S.Ct. 2440, 49 L.Ed.2d 310 (1976); <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>391 U.S. 367, 377, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968). The governmental interest here, of course, is in protecting citizens against deception \u2014 with its attendant waste and misallocation by consumers to the benefit of the wrongdoers \u2014 by ensuring that advertising conveys truthful information to the public. As we noted earlier, it is this very interest which was invoked by the <em>Virginia State Board </em>Court as support for its conclusion that commercial speech is protected by the First Amendment. See 425 U.S. at 764-765, 96 S.Ct. 1817. See <em>also Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, supra, </em>- U.S. at -, 97 S.Ct. 2691.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">And the facts of this case make it eminently clear that this interest will not be substantially served by the less restrictive remedy \u2014 a cease and desist order. Whatever one may conclude as to the effect of Warner-Lambert\u2019s long history of deception on the protected status of its current advertising, we see no basis \u2014 and none has been offered \u2014 for questioning the Commission\u2019s conclusion that, absent a corrective remedy, consumers will continue to purchase Listerine as a cure for colds. <em>See </em>FTC op. at 38, JA 904. Indeed, at least one advocate of corrective advertising has urged that such orders not be confined to obvious cases such as <em>Warner-Lambert </em>where the proof presented to the Commission of the success of a deceptive campaign is so striking. Noting the long history of a deceptive claim uniquely asserted for Listerine, the absence of consumer confusion as to which mouthwash was effective against colds, and the persuasive evidence that this claim was believed by consumers after the false advertising had ceased, Professor Pitofsky has argued that \u201c[cjomparable proof of deception-perception-memory influence would be virtually impossible in most advertising cases. * * * If the Commission is to do an effective job in regulating deceptive advertising, corrective advertising must apply to more than the one-in-a-million type of ad campaign present in <em>Warner-Lambert.\u201d See </em>Pitofsky, <em>supra, </em>90 Harv.L.Rev. at 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">Finally, the corrective advertising order in this case, by tying the quantity of correction required to the investment in deception, is tailored to serve the legitimate governmental interest in correcting public misimpressions as to the value of Listerine\u2014 and no more.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Taking all these factors into account, we think it beyond doubt that the FTC order is a valid one.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">\n<em>Petition for rehearing denied.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b838-8\">.

As one example of \u201cpublic notification\u201d the majority says in n.36 \u201cit might encompass requiring the defendant to run special advertisements reporting the FTC finding . . 1 note however that according to the FTC such advertisements are \u201ccorrective advertising\u201d. In its opinion in the case before us, 86 F.T.C. 1398, 1498 (1975) the Commission states that it \u201chas accepted numerous consent orders which require corrective advertising.\u201d In support of this statement the Commission cites several cases as examples of cases in which corrective advertising was ordered. <em>(Id., </em>pp. 1498-99, n.22) In at least three of those cases the Commission required the respondent to publish advertisements advising the public of the FTC finding and retracting prior deceptive statements. <em>Pay Less Drug Stores Northwest, Inc., </em>82 F.T.C. 1473 (1973); <em>Boise Tire Co., </em>83 F.T.C. 21 (1973); <em>Wasem\u2019s, Inc., </em>84 F.T.C. 209 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b840-13\">. Compulsory licensing of an illegally obtained patent, referred to in the majority\u2019s n.60, is an aspect of divestiture.

Cease and desist orders aimed at false or deceptive speech may, in theory, have a chilling effect on truthful speech, and be subject to First Amendment scrutiny on that account.
