Appellants, inmates who are or have been assigned to the MCU, appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of an injunction ordering that the MCU be closed or operated differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Appellants\u2019 due process claim should be examined in light of <em>Meachum v. Fano, </em>427 U.S. 215, 96 S.Ct. 2532, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976), and <em>Montayne v. Haymes, </em>427 U.S. 236, 96 S.Ct. 2543, 49 L.Ed.2d 466 (1976), in which the Supreme Court determined that inmate transfers were not subject to a hearing requirement, even when, as in <em>Meachum, supra, </em>the transfer was to a less desirable confinement situation. The presence in this case of procedures for periodic hearings to review an inmate\u2019s assignment to the MCU leads us to conclude that appellants\u2019 due process rights were adequately safeguarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Appellants further claim that assignment to the Management Control Unit violates the equal protection clause by depriving them of certain freedoms and privileges enjoyed by the general inmate population. If the challenged classification furthers some legitimate state interest, however, it will withstand an equal protection challenge. <em>McGinnis v. Royster, </em>410 U.S. 263, 270, 93 S.Ct. 1055, 35 L.Ed.2d 282 (1973). Given the district court\u2019s factual findings regarding the considerable tension and an unusual number of discipline problems within the prison, it is clear that classifications among prisoners maintained the discipline and security in the prison and thus furthered a legitimate state interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">Appellants\u2019 claim that the MCU subjects inmates to cruel and unusual punishment, viewed under the standard discussed in xJ., concurring at 282), similarly must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">For these reasons, aptly elaborated in the district court opinion by the Honorable Clarkson S. Fisher, 421 F.Supp. 1224 (D.N.J.,1976), the judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
