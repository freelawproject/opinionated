Alleging his dismissal was a denial of due process, plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief in the district court. The district judge granted summary judgment for the defendants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In view of plaintiff\u2019s contention that he was denied procedural constitutional rights, and the context of a dismissal for conduct that in other government agencies would likely have resulted in less severe sanction, we have deferred our ruling pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Codd v. Velger, </em>429 U.S. 624, 97 S.Ct. 882, 51 L.Ed.2d 92 (1977). We now enter a judgment of affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-20\">The circumstances surrounding the dismissal are as follows: On the afternoon of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>March 8,1974, plaintiff and a co-worker left their office, the FBI\u2019s Identification Building, to go to a nearby restaurant for a beer. Upon their return, after being confronted by their supervisor, they admitted leaving the building without permission and consuming alcoholic beverages during working hours. Both these activities were contrary to FBI regulations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1352-4\">The employees were informed that their actions had placed their employment in jeopardy, and were given the opportunity to prepare written explanations of their actions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These were forwarded, along with a report prepared by their supervisor, to their superiors in the Files and Communications Division. Plaintiff also met with the Assistant Director of the Division to discuss the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-5\">Following a review of the facts and plaintiff\u2019s explanation, both the Files and Communication Division and the Administrative Division recommended to the FBI Director that plaintiff\u2019s resignation be requested.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This recommendation was approved by the Director. Plaintiff was requested to resign, several times, but refused. He was then discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-6\">Plaintiff now alleges his dismissal constituted a deprivation of both property and liberty without due process of law. We shall discuss these claims separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-7\">I. PROPERTY INTEREST</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-8\">FBI employees are excepted from the competitive civil service,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and thus have not been given the statutory protections normally accorded federal workers. However, plaintiff contends that representations made by FBI personnel both before and during his employment provided a sufficient expectation of continued employment to constitute \u201cproperty\u201d as that term is used in the Fifth Amendment. It is clear that a mutual understanding between employer and employee can create a property interest in continued employment even in the absence of a written contract or statutory protections. <em>Perry v. Sinderman, </em>408 U.S. 593, 601, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972). In the instant case, however, it is unnecessary for the court to determine whether such an interest did in fact exist since the procedures accorded plaintiff fully comported with the requirements of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-16\">In recent years the Supreme Court has decided numerous cases dealing with the types of procedures appropriate to the protection of a property interest. Throughout all these eases runs the consistent thread that due process is a flexible concept, calling for \u201csuch procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\u201d <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 2600, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-17\">In the instant case, appellant admitted violating the FBI regulations in question, and he concedes that he had at least constructive notice of these regulations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, appellant has raised no defenses or mitigating circumstances \u2014 before either the agency or the courts \u2014 which are in any sense \u201ccomplex or otherwise difficult to develop.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, on the facts of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>case, we conclude that the opportunities provided to appellant to explain his conduct \u2014 both in writing and during the meeting with the Assistant Director of the Files and Communications Division \u2014 satisfy the requirements of due process.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1353-5\">II. LIBERTY INTEREST</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-6\">Alleging the stigmatizing effect of his dismissal will make it difficult for him to obtain future employment,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> plaintiff contends that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972), entitles him to a hearing. We disagree. The purpose of a <em>Roth </em>hearing is to provide the individual the opportunity to refute the charges and clear his name. 408 U.S. at 573, 92 S.Ct. at 2707. \u201c[I]f the hearing mandated by the Due Process Clause is to serve any useful purpose, there must be some factual dispute between an employer and a discharged employee which has some significant bearing on the employee\u2019s reputation.\u201d <em>Codd v. Velger, </em>97 S.Ct. 882, 884 (1977). Plaintiff admitted violating FBI regulations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There is no claim that he had any facts in the way of excuse or mitigation to provide beyond the statement in his written explanation. In short, there is no factual dispute in this case, and an oral hearing is not constitutionally mandated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1351-21\">.

I acknowledge that this is strictly against Bureau standards and admit my guilt. In my meager defense I can only say that it was a \u201cspring fever\u201d type reaction with no intentional offense in mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1352-14\">Wehner Memorandum, March 8, 1974, J.A. 42.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1352-18\">.

Since plaintiff admitted violating the regulations it is unnecessary for the court to determine the requisite procedures in those cases involving a factual dispute regarding the employee\u2019s conduct.
