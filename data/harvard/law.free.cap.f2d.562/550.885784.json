The district court,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> sitting without a jury, denied relief on the ground that \u201cthe plaintiff has simply failed to carry his burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>proof with regard to any discrimination.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The sole issue on this appeal is whether the district court\u2019s finding is clearly erroneous. We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">At the time of trial, the plaintiff was 56 years of age and had been an executive of the Monsanto Company in St. Louis for the past eleven years. Living in a two bedroom apartment in University City, he had become dissatisfied with his living conditions partially because of the noise from a nearby highway, and partially because he was in need of larger quarters because of recent changes in his family life. He and his wife had recently been divorced and, because of her decision to leave the country to go with the Peace Corps, he required additional room to house three college-age sons during holidays and vacations from school. What he wanted was \u201ctwo bedrooms, a study or three bedrooms, one of which I planned to use as a study, preferably with two baths.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Such an apartment seemed readily available. While driving through an area known as the \u201cMoorlands,\u201d in Clayton, Missouri, plaintiff noticed a sign in front of 7537 Parkdale reading \u201cFor Rent 3-4 Bedrooms 2-Baths 863-6034.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Plaintiff called defendant on Friday, August 8th. Defendant admitted in her deposition<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that she \u201ccould not recall\u201d that she was able to form an opinion as to his race from the sound of his voice.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Plaintiff went to defendant\u2019s apartment on the following Sunday afternoon to see the apartment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Up to this point it is uncontroverted that there had been nothing to indicate that he was black.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">Upon plaintiff\u2019s attempt to visit the apartment, he was met by defendant\u2019s daughter. She told him that her mother had taken her father to the hospital but had not yet returned, and that she, the daughter, could not show the apartment. Plaintiff gave her his business card with his telephone number. When defendant returned, she was given the card and informed of the plaintiff's race.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-12\">Plaintiff telephoned the defendant later that evening to inquire about the apartment. The defendant replied that she \u201chad somebody who was interested in the apartment\u201d that she \u201cwould have to check the references though and if it were not rented I could call him, I had his \u2018phone number.\u201d She conceded on the stand that this was false. The apartment had not been rented at that time. No one had yet filled out an application, nor had anyone put down a deposit.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-13\">The defendant explained her conduct on the ground that when she finds that a prospective tenant would not be suitable, one device employed by her, in order to avoid personalizing the objection, is to say, \u201c[Wje\u2019ll have to check the references, or check, call back. I have other people interested in it.\u201d When asked \u201cwhy [she] didn\u2019t want to show [her] apartment to Mr. Wharton\u201d she replied \u201cBecause I had disastrous experiences in the past with divorced men in renting to them and it had cost me a great deal of money * * Specifically, they had \u201cbrought in women during the night\u201d and had left the apartment dirty. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Moreover, the activities of unsupervised teenagers had been disruptive to other tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">On the following morning plaintiff called Ms. Hedy Epstein, a white woman, Executive Director of the Greater St. Louis Committee for Freedom of Residence, told her what had transpired and that he thought he had suffered discrimination. Epstein stated that she would do some testing to determine whether or not discrimination had taken place. Accordingly, giving her name as \u201cMrs. Stone\u201d she called defendant and asked if the apartment advertised on the sign<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> was still available. Informed that such an apartment was still available, Epstein went to see it, accompanied by a young white female law student, Susan Chapman, whom she introduced as \u201cmy daughter Susan.\u201d They were shown Apartment 2E at 7533 Parkdale. When asked by defendant about her family, Epstein replied that she was divorced and that she had three college-age children, who would be with her during vacations. At this time she was told that the apartment was available and that no one else had made a deposit on it.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Defendant admits that she gave Epstein an application form,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and told her that she could complete the form at home and mail it back to defendant with a check for $325.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As Epstein was leaving the apartment she asked if there were any \u201ccolored\u201d living in the area. Defendant allegedly answered, in part, \u201c[t]here are none in my buildings. I don\u2019t rent to them. They don\u2019t have that much money.\u201d Coming back to this issue at a later point Epstein said \u201cSo you don\u2019t rent to them?\u201d Defendant replied \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t had to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">On the following day, August 12, 1975, Epstein identified herself on the telephone to defendant, told her of plaintiff\u2019s request for assistance, stated that it appeared that discrimination might have taken place, and told her that if there had been discrimination, it was a violation of both federal and state laws. When she asked defendant what she might tell the plaintiff, defendant replied, \u201cput this in writing please,\u201d whereupon Epstein urged defendant not to rent the apartment to anyone else until the matter had been resolved. Epstein reduced this conversation to a letter to defendant on the same day. The letter appears in the record as plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">Epstein\u2019s letter was received by defendant on August 13,1975. The following day defendant telephoned a Mrs. Leonard Warren, Jr., who had, in the previous month, expressed an interest in the apartment in question.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> On August 15, Mrs. Warren submitted a completed application for the vacant apartment, accompanied by a postdated check for the security deposit. The Warrens executed a lease for the apartment on August 17, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">Stripped of all controversial testimony and relying solely upon admissions and uncontroverted evidence, what this case boils down to in brief is that the plaintiff, a black man who can not be so identified as black by his voice alone, went to see an apartment. He was there observed to be black. His inquiry to the owner that evening concerning the availability of the apartment was met with the statement that it had been committed to another applicant. It is conceded that this assertion was false. The following day a white \u201cchecker\u201d (Epstein) made an appointment to see the apartment. During the appointment she represented herself as being in circumstances reasonably similar to those of the plaintiff, that is, divorced, with three college-age <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>children. She was shown the apartment, given an application, and invited to submit her application with a deposit. When confronted with these events, the defendant quickly contacted a previously interested white couple (the Warrens) and completed the application, credit check, and formal rental procedures for their tenancy within five days.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">The trial court totally rejected Epstein\u2019s testimony on the ground that it was tailored to prove that the conduct of the defendant had been racially discriminatory. True, she was a \u201cchecker,\u201d attempting to ascertain whether or not there had been racial discrimination in the rejection of the plaintiff as a tenant. But the fact that she was a \u201cchecker\u201d does not in and of itself stamp her as lacking in credibility. The use of checkers in this situation is well established and has been recognized as necessary under similar circumstances.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Specifically, the trial court found that Epstein\u2019s written summary of her conversation with defendant \u201cvaries from [her] testimony and those portions of the conversation which are of benefit to the defendant are scratched out in [her] written summary so that [her] preconceived ideas as to the conduct of the defendant might be proved.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The scratching out to which the court refers is the deletion of the clause in Exhibit 1 (Epstein\u2019s handwritten chronology of events) respecting black applicants stating that \u201cnone have come here,\u201d whereas her trial testimony quotes defendant as saying that \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t had to\u201d [rent to any blacks].<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The change was made openly on the exhibit, without any attempt at subterfuge or rewriting of the page to conceal the change. It is at best a minor point, hardly justifying the significance given it by the district court in its analysis of Epstein\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">The total omission from the findings of the corroboration of Epstein\u2019s testimony in all essential particulars by her companion, Susan Chapman, is not explained in the opinion. At oral argument it was sought to be justified on the ground that since Epstein was assertedly totally impeached, \u201cSusan Chapman has to fall with her.\u201d This reasoning we reject for obvious reasons. In addition the trial court found that plaintiff\u2019s written summary of the entire incident (Exhibit 1) and her letter to defendant (Exhibit 2) were mutually impeaching, each of the other. The court has not specified wherein the impeachment lay, but we have reviewed these exhibits with care and we find nothing substantially impeaching, each of the other, therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-12\">The defendant contends simply that plaintiff was rejected under her objective standards just as a white man would have been upon the grounds that he was single, divorced with teenage children, and that he traveled, leaving them unsupervised. The difficulty with this defense is that it is not sustained on the record. She first asserted in her deposition, though not without equivocation, that she \u201calways rent[ed] to families\u201d and, as a rule, did not rent to single persons.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> However, on the record, she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>rented 7533 Parkdale, Apartment 3E to a single male on June 26,1975, the record not indicating whether he was divorced or not. Also, it was clear from her cross-examination that she did not, as her brief asserts, have any consistent objective standards with respect to matrimonial or parental status.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">It is settled law that race is an impermissible factor in housing under both the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Civil Rights Act of 1968. It is equally clear that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">The burden of proof in Title VIII cases is governed by the concept of the \u201cprima facie case.\u201d <em>Williams v. Matthews Co., </em>[499 F.2d 819, 826 (8th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1021, 95 S.Ct. 495, 42 L.Ed.2d 294 (1974)]. To establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination, the plaintiff need prove no more than that the conduct of the defendant actually or predictably results in racial discrimination; in other words, that it has a discriminatory effect. <em>See id. </em>* * * The plaintiff need make no showing whatsoever that the action resulting in racial discrimination in housing was racially motivated. * * * Effect, and not motivation, is the touchstone, in part because clever men may easily conceal their motivations, but more importantly, because</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">* * * [w]hatever our law was once, * * * we now firmly recognize that the arbitrary quality of thoughtlessness can be as disastrous and unfair to private rights and the public interest as the perversity of a willful scheme.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-9\"><em>United States v. City of Black Jack, Missouri, </em>508 F.2d 1179, 1184-1185 (8th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>422 U.S. 1042, 95 S.Ct. 2656, 45 L.Ed.2d 694 (1975) (footnotes omitted; citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-16\">In this case, as we noted, the district court found that no evidence was presented-to establish a prima facie case of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-17\">Our review of this finding is governed by the following considerations:</p>\n<p id=\"b629-18\">\u201cA finding is \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 when, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court, on the entire evidence, is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948).\u201d * * * The question is not simply whether the reviewing court would have found otherwise but whether the trial court could permissibly find as it did. The reviewing court should upset a finding only when it \u201cis convinced on the whole record that the finding does not reflect the truth and right of the case.\u201d Wright, Federal Courts \u00a7 96, at 432.</p>\n<p id=\"AJR\"><em>Movible Offshore, Inc. v. M/V Wilken A. Falgout, </em>471 F.2d 268, 271 (5th Cir. 1973) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-19\">So tested, the trial court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff has failed to carry his burden of proof with regard to a showing of discrimination is clearly erroneous. Our examination of the entire record leaves us with a firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. The chronology of events in the plaintiff\u2019s attempt to obtain an apartment from the defendant contains a strong implication that racial discrimination underlay the defendant\u2019s actions and statements. The defendant\u2019s claim that the plaintiff was rejected on objective, nonracial qualifications cannot be accepted on the record made.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-20\">Defendant had no uniformly applied policy with objective standards. As she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>admits,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> she employed her private subjective standards, if such they may be called, renting to individuals \u201caccording to how I feel.\u201d Her feelings on this topic may best be judged by their results. Defendant owns and manages four apartment buildings, and co-owns a fifth with her husband, involving a total of 23 rental units, all purchased since 1969. She has never rented to a black tenant,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> although evidence was presented that in 1974 she had offered an apartment to a black woman, a Mrs. Woods, to whom we have made prior references.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Racial discrimination has been established both as a matter of fact and law.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">We turn to damages. This court has recently examined the issue of damages in the context of a racial discrimination in housing case in <em>Smith v. Anchor Bldg. Corp., </em>536 F.2d 231 (8th Cir. 1976)<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Punitive damages, the claim for which was abandoned in <em>Smith, supra,</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> </em>may also be recoverable, as well as injunctive relief obtained, upon proper showings. We decline to examine those issues further without first providing the district court an opportunity to decide them.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-17\">Plaintiff also requests this Court to award attorney's fees. A hearing and decision on the plaintiff\u2019s recovery of attorney\u2019s fees were postponed in the district court pending a decision on the merits.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Rather than asking this Court to award attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3612(c),<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> plaintiff asks that we award a fee incident to our authority to enforce his rights under the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1982.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-18\">Recent legislation controls the award of attorney\u2019s fees to a plaintiff successful in an action founded on \u00a7 1982. The Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976, Pub.L.No.94-559 (Oct. 19, 1976), 90 Stat. 2641<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> is the Congressional response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975) that attorney\u2019s fees generally may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>not be awarded absent an express statutory authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Although the 1976 Act did not become effective until after the district court\u2019s decision, Congress clearly intended, and we have so held, that the 1976 Act should apply retroactively in cases pending on appeal on the 1976 Act\u2019s effective date. <em>Gay Lib v. University of Missouri, </em>558 F.2d 848 at 857 (8th Cir. 1977), <em>Finney </em>v. <em>Hutto, </em>548 F.2d 740, 742 (8th Cir. 1977).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The 1976 Act tracks the statutory authorization for attorney\u2019s fees contained in Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000a-3(b),<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> which was expansively construed by the Supreme Court in <em>Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., </em>390 U.S. 400, 88 S.Ct. 964, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968): a plaintiff successful in asserting his rights under Title II \u201cshould ordinarily recover an attorney\u2019s fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.\u201d <em>Newman, supra, </em>at 402, 88 S.Ct. at 966. The ample legislative history of the 1976 Act shows that Congress intended this liberal standard to control a fee award under the new statute. The Senate report on the bill ultimately enacted into law<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> specifies the <em>Newman </em>standard as the touchstone for an award under the 1976 Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aan\">It is intended that the standards for awarding fees be generally the same as under the fee provisions of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. A party seeking to enforce the rights protected by the statutes covered by [the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Award Act of 1976], if successful, \u201cshould ordinarily recover an attorney\u2019s fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.\u201d <em>Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., </em>390 U.S. 400, 402 [88 S.Ct. 964, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263] (1968).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHq\">S.Rep.No.94-1011, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 4 (1976), <em>reprinted in </em>[1976] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm.News pp. 5908, 5912 (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Our previous examination of the record indicated that the defendant violated both 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1982 and 3604.
