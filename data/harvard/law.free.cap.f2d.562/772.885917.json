Although the Act does not expressly provide for withdrawal of objections made within the 60-day period, the Attorney General has promulgated a regulation which specifies that \u201c[a]n objection shall be withdrawn if the submitting authority can produce information not previously available to it which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>satisfies the Attorney General that the change does not have a racially discriminatory purpose or effect.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.24; <em>see id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 51.23-.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Appellants in the instant case, four black individuals registered to vote in Meriwether County, Georgia, brought suit in the District Court seeking to overturn a decision by the Attorney General, pursuant to the above regulation, to withdraw his objection to a redistricting statute enacted by the Georgia legislature with respect to the Meriwether County Board of Commissioners. Count I of appellants\u2019 complaint alleged that the withdrawal was not in fact based on \u201cpreviously unavailable\u201d information and, accordingly, violated the Attorney General\u2019s own regulation and exceeded his authority under the Act. Count II asserted that the Voting Rights Act gives the Attorney General no authority to withdraw an objection after the sixty-day statutory period has elapsed, and that the Attorney General\u2019s action in doing so here was consequently unlawful. The third through the fifth counts of the complaint sought judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act, claiming that the Attorney General failed to make a reasoned decision, and acted arbitrarily and capriciously, in withdrawing his objection to the statute in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">On January 5, 1976, in response to appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint, the District Court issued an opinion and order, <em>Harris v. Levi, </em>416 F.Supp. 208 (D.D.C. 1976), denying the motion to dismiss Count I, granting the motion to dismiss Count II, and staying consideration of the motion to dismiss Counts III-V pending adjudication of Count I. With regard to Count II, the court held that the power to revoke an objection is implied by the power to interpose one, and that the sixty-day period was intended only to limit the Attorney General\u2019s authority to interpose objections. <em>Id. </em>at 211. Appellees urged that the claims set forth in the remaining counts were not subject to judicial review, because section 5 of the Voting Rights Act precludes judicial review of actions taken by the Attorney General under its provisions, and commits the decision to interpose objections wholly to agency discretion. However, the District Court deferred consideration of the review-ability of Counts III through V, and ruled on the basis of <em>Harper v. Levi, </em>171 U.S.App.D.C. 321, 520 F.2d 53 (1975) (holding reviewable the Attorney General\u2019s alleged failure to exercise his independent judgment before deciding not to object to a proposed voting change), that the \u201cprocedural\u201d issue raised by Count I was a proper subject of review. 416 F.Supp. at 210-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">Following discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on Count I. On June 4, 1976, the District Court ruled in favor of appellees, holding that the Attorney General had properly determined, in light of information which in fact was previously unavailable, that the entire administrative record no longer supported his initial objection. <em>Harris v. Levi, </em>416 F.Supp. 211, 214 (D.D.C.1976). The District Court then proceeded to consider the reviewability of Counts III through V and, finding review implicitly precluded by section 5 of the Voting Rights Act and, in addition, that the challenged decision was wholly committed to the Attorney General\u2019s discretion, the Court granted appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss those counts. <em>Id. </em>at 214-17; <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a) (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">Appellants do not question the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Count II of their complaint, which claimed that the Attorney General was without power to withdraw the objection originally made by him in this case. Their appeal is limited to the District Court\u2019s order of June 4,1976, and contends, first, that the District Court erred in holding against them on Count I; and, second, that they were entitled to judicial review of the claims advanced in Counts III to V of their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">In light of two Supreme Court decisions announced subsequent to oral argument before this court, <em>Morris v. Gressette,- </em>U.S.-, 97 S.Ct. 2411, 53 L.Ed.2d 506 (1977), and <em>Briscoe v. </em>Bell,-U.S.-, 97 S.Ct. 2428, 53 L.Ed.2d 439 (1977), we find that the allegations made in Count I, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>well as those made in Counts III through V, are not subject to judicial review; and, following the approach adopted in <em>Briscoe v. Bell, supra, </em>we vacate the District Court\u2019s decisions with respect to Count I, and remand for dismissal of that count, in addition to affirming the dismissal of Counts III-V.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">In <em>Morris v. Gressette, supra, </em>the Supreme Court in effect reversed <em>Harper v. Levi, supra, </em>the decision of this court which the District Court relied upon to conclude that Count I was subject to judicial review. Ruling on the same set of facts that was involved in <em>Harper, </em>the Supreme Court held that, in view of the harshness of the section 5 procedure <em>vis-a-vis </em>covered jurisdictions, and the language and history of the section, it must be inferred that Congress intended to preclude all judicial review of the Attorney General\u2019s failure to object to a proposed voting change within the sixty-day statutory period. See-U.S. at-, 97 S.Ct. at 2422 &amp; n.24. Although <em>Morris </em>involved a failure to object rather than a decision to withdraw an objection previously interposed, the reasoning and indeed some of the language in the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as well as the characterization of the <em>Morris </em>holding in <em>Briscoe v. Bell, </em>supra,-U.S. at-, 97 S.Ct. at 2432-3319,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> leave no room for doubt that judicial review of the claims made in the instant case is also precluded. Assuming, as appellants concede for the purposes of this appeal, that the Attorney General has discretion to revoke objections on the basis of previously unavailable information, exercise of such discretion \u2014 like a failure to object initially within the sixty-day period \u2014 prevents the \u201c \u2018dragging out\u2019 \u201d of the \u2022 statutory suspension of state voting laws,-U.S. at-, 97 S.Ct. at 2420, <em>quoting Switchmen\u2019s Union v. National Mediation Board, </em>320 U.S. 297, 305, 64 S.Ct. 95, 88 L.Ed. 61 (1945); <em>see </em>note 2 <em>supra. </em>And, if there is to be no review of the Attorney General\u2019s application of the section 5 standards in deciding whether to interpose an objection within the sixty-day period, see-U.S. at-, 97 S.Ct. at 2421-22 nn. 23-24, we see no basis for allowing judicial review of the Attorney General\u2019s determination that previously unavailable information justifies withdrawal of an objection, or of his application of the statutory standards in the context of a decision to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-20\">Thus, notwithstanding the fact that appellees have not reasserted in this court their contention that the Attorney General\u2019s compliance with his withdrawal regulation is not amenable to judicial review, we decline to reach the merits of Count I. This disposition is consonant with the approach followed in <em>Briscoe v. Bell, supra, </em>in which the Supreme Court held that, despite the failure by the Attorney General and the Director of the Census to contest the limited review function which the courts below had exercised, all judicial review of actions by those officials under section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act is precluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-21\">The District Court\u2019s dismissal of Counts III through V of appellants\u2019 complaint is affirmed. The grant of summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>in favor of appellees on Count I is vacated, and the case is remanded to the District Court with instructions to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b848-9\">. The nature of the \u00a7 5 remedy . . . strongly suggests that Congress did not intend <em>the Attorney General\u2019s actions under that provision </em>to be subject to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">- U.S. at -, 97 S.Ct. at 2419 (citation omitted) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-13\">Since judicial review of the Attorney General\u2019s actions would unavoidably extend [the period in which implementation of voting changes is barred], it is necessarily precluded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-14\"><em>Id. </em>at-, 97 S.Ct. at 2414.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-15\">Where the discriminatory character of an enactment is not detected upon review by the Attorney General, it can be challenged in traditional constitutional litigation. But it cannot be questioned in a suit seeking judicial review of the <em>Attorney General\u2019s exercise of discretion under \u00a7 5 .</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-23\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote deleted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b848-24\">. The opinion in <em>Briscoe </em>states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-25\">The significant part played by the discretionary authority of the Attorney General in administering the [Voting Rights] Act is . underlined by <em>Morris v. Gressette </em>.... Although \u00a7 5 contains no express preclusion of review, the Court concludes from its structure and purpose that Congress intended no prolonged suspension of the operation of validly enacted state laws to allow judicial review.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
