That order required the company to cease and desist from bargaining with individual employees, and instead to bargain with their union regarding merit increases in pay, changes in job descriptions, and the hiring of new employees at wage rates above those set by the collective bargaining agreement then in force. For the reasons set forth below, we grant enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-13\">The company manufactures and sells plastic, neon, and electric signs at the plant involved in this proceeding. Employees in the plastics department of the plant, roughly 125 in number, are represented by Local 1172 of the United Electrical Radio and Machine Workers of America. The collective bargaining agreement in force at the times relevant to this appeal was executed November 2, 1973, following a six-month strike. The union later learned that the company was paying some employees at wage rates above those set in the collective bargaining agreement, and, in February 1974, it therefore requested information from the company regarding this practice. The company\u2019s initial refusal to release this information led the union to file an unfair labor practice complaint, which was dismissed once the company agreed to supply a list of employees who had received \u201cmerit increases\u201d during the preceding one and one-half years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After examining the list, the union filed the unfair labor practice charges which have resulted in the petition before us. At the conclusion of a hearing on the union\u2019s merit increase charges the General Counsel of the Board amended the complaint to add the charges regarding alterations of job descriptions and hirings at above-contract wage rates. The administrative law judge ruled against the company on all three issues; the Board adopted his decision and a modified version of his recommended order.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-14\">We begin with the proposition that merit increases are \u201ca subject of mandatory bargaining,\u201d <em>NLRB v. Katz, </em>369 U.S. 736, 745, 82 S.Ct. 1107, 8 L.Ed.2d 230 (1962). The Supreme Court, in <em>NLRB v. C &amp; C Plywood Corp., </em>385 U.S. 421, 425, 87 S.Ct. 559, 562, 17 L.Ed.2d 486 (1967), recognized the principle that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>\u201can employer may not unilaterally institute merit increases during the term of a collective agreement unless some provision of the contract authorizes him to do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">See also <em>NLRB v. J. H. Allison &amp; Co., </em>165 F.2d 766 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>335 U.S. 814, 69 S.Ct. 31, 93 L.Ed. 369 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The company argues that this principle only applies where the employer grants merit increases to a significant segment of the work force, relying on a footnote in <em>Katz </em>that distinguished two prior court of appeals decisions as involving only \u201cisolated individual wage adjustments.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Katz, supra, </em>369 U.S. at 747 n. 14, 82 S.Ct. 1107.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Inasmuch as the number of employees granted increases in those two cases represented a larger proportion of the relevant bargaining units than do the nine employees apparently involved in the case before us, this argument has some force.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <em>Katz </em>Court, however, was concerned with wage increases instituted unilaterally during the pendency of contract negotiations. Under established principles such increases amounted to a violation of \u00a7 8(a)(5) unless they \u201cwere a mere continuation of the status quo.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 746, 82 S.Ct. at 1113. Accordingly, the Court emphasized that the wage increases involved in <em>Katz </em>were \u201cin no sense automatic, but were informed by a large measure of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 746, 82 S.Ct. at 1113.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The distinction between general and individual wage increases was important because, even assuming the discretionary nature of the raises instituted during negotiations on a new contract, only a general wage increase was barred by the principles of <em>NLRB v. Crompton-Highland Mills, Inc., </em>337 U.S. 217, 69 S.Ct. 960, 93 L.Ed. 1320 (1949). This difference is not important, however, when merit increases instituted during the term of a collective agreement are involved. Then, as is clear from the Court\u2019s broad language in <em>C &amp; C Plywood, </em>quoted above, the only issue is whether the contract authorizes the company to institute the pay increases unilaterally-</p>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">The company points to the general management rights clause of the contract as supporting its claim for this authority.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That clause cannot be so construed, however. The company\u2019s rights \u201cto direct the working force,\u201d \u201cto transfer employees,\u201d and \u201cto determine . . . the methods and scheduling of production,\u201d do not encompass the authority to grant merit increases above the wage rates specified in the collective agreement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Even if the language were ambiguous, any contention that it was intended to cover merit increases would be impossible, because it is admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>that the parties did not negotiate at all regarding a merit increase policy. And, as we have stated before,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\">\u201c[i]n order to effectuate the relinquishment of a collective bargaining right under the provisions of a collective agreement, . . . the preferable rule requires that whiver be in \u2018clear and unmistakable language.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-6\"><em>NLRB v. Wisconsin Aluminum Foundry Co., </em>440 F.2d 393, 399 (7th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Moreover, this aspect of the Board\u2019s order must be enforced for another reason, <em>viz., </em>our conclusion that at least five of the merit increases resulted from the company\u2019s bargaining directly with individual employees. The testimony of Sharon Beck, a forewoman at the plant, and James Degerstedt, formerly one of the members of her production crew, demonstrates that the \u201cmerit increases\u201d given to five members of her crew were intended as recognition of their \u201coutstanding job\u201d on the Conoco sign contract. Degerstedt testified that the crew had requested a pay increase in their discussions with Beck, in part because they \u201cwere working quite hard on the Conoco order,\u201d and that Beck agreed to \u201csee what she could do.\u201d Beck acknowledged that she and her crew frequently discussed wage rates, and that she recommended the pay increase for her crew to Sobczak, the company\u2019s manufacturing manager. After the increase was approved she informed her crew that the raises were \u201cbecause of the job they had been doing and especially because of the Conoco job . . . .\u201d The employees\u2019 requests and her support as promised led to the ultimate reward of merit increases granted by the company without any union involvement. We agree that, at least in this instance, the company bargained directly with individual employees in contravention of the Act. See <em>Medo Photo Supply Co. v. NLRB, </em>321 U.S. 678, 685, 64 S.Ct. 830, 88 L.Ed. 1007 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">The other two violations found by the Board need be discussed only briefly. One, the alteration of several job descriptions without discussion with the union, is not seriously challenged by the company.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Article X of the detailed collective, agreement provides that \u201c[tjhere shall be a job description and wage rate for each job title.\u201d (The use of the singular is not without significance.) It provides further that the union is to be notified of all new jobs or significant changes in job descriptions, and that any such changes resulting in new rates of pay \u201cshall be subject to the Grievance Procedure.\u201d These provisions were not followed in the instances in which four \u201cmerit increases\u201d were awarded to employees for their \u201cincreased ability\u201d to do the same or slightly different work, or for their assistance with work outside their established job descriptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">Finally, the Board found that the company had hired new job applicants at wage rates higher than those specified in the collective bargaining agreement. The company argues that the starting wage rates were intended only to be minimum wage rates, but the language of the agreement does not indicate such an intention. The attachments and exhibits to the contract set forth specific job descriptions and classifications, and the pay rate applicable to each seniority level in each classification. Inasmuch as the \u201cprogression schedules\u201d are based on seniority within the plant and date of hiring, newly hired employees would begin at the bottom of their classification scale unless otherwise specified. There exists no contrary specification in the collective agreement. Indeed, these exhibits themselves state that one of the specified wage rates applies \u201c[i]f hired on or after June 1, 1971,\u201d and the other \u201c[i]f hired on or before May 31,1971.\u201d It would be difficult to read this term as permitting newly hired employees to begin at higher stages of the progression scale. We therefore reject the company\u2019s argument. If new employees cannot be found to perform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>the jobs available at those wage rates, after the elaborate bidding procedures set forth in the contract are exhausted, then the parties should negotiate about the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The Board\u2019s order is enforced in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-12\">. The list consisted of eight individuals; a ninth employee, whose raise was effective after the list was provided but before the hearing, was added on the General Counsel\u2019s application. Cross-examination of the company\u2019s manufacturing manager, Arthur Sobczak, revealed that more employees may have been granted \u201creevaluation increases,\u201d which he stated were based on different criteria than were the \u201cmerit increases\u201d reflected in the list. It was further shown that several former employees who had received \u201cmerit\u201d or \u201creevaluation\u201d increases or both were also omitted from the list, but Sobczak was able to recall the name of only one of these individuals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b481-7\">. In <em>White v. NLRB, </em>255 F.2d 564, 565 (5th Cir. 1958), five of sixty employees were granted raises, all before bargaining commenced following certification. In <em>NLRB v. Superior Fireproof Door &amp; Sash Co., </em>289 F.2d 713, 720 (2d Cir. 1961), five employees received raises, two of whom were in an eleven-man bargaining unit and the remaining three of whom were in a fourteen-man unit. One employee in the two-man unit also received a second merit increase. In C &amp; C <em>Plywood </em>the wage increases were \u201cacross the board\u201d; in <em>Katz </em>they went to 40 percent of the bargaining unit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b481-8\">. These nine are among 125 employees in the unit. The company\u2019s manufacturing manager, Sobczak, testified that between five and eight percent of the plastics department employees had received \u201cmerit\u201d or \u201creevaluation\u201d raises or both.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b481-9\">. The record demonstrates that the merit increases in this case were also largely discretionary. Although Sobczak claimed that the company had an established policy of granting merit increases, he admitted that the policy \u201cwas not in writing\u201d and that there was not a \u201cset formula\u201d for the granting or size of such increases. The union\u2019s efforts to obtain an explanation of this policy went unanswered. Furthermore, Sobczak\u2019s assertion that \u201cmerit\u201d and \u201creevaluation\u201d raises were based on different criteria is undercut by the confusion regarding these raises, illustrated by the several instances in which increases were incorrectly characterized as being of one type or the other, or both, in company documents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b481-16\">. Article XXX.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b481-17\">. This language is not comparable to the explicit clause quoted in C &amp; <em>C Plywood, </em>in which the company reserved</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-18\">\u201cthe right to pay a premium rate over and above the contractual classified wage rate to reward any particular employee for some special fitness, skill, aptitude or the like.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b482-10\">. The company\u2019s argument regarding the \u201creevaluation raises\u201d awarded to Mary Tomblyn and Pat Priess was limited to the issue of whether they were negotiated with these employees. The company\u2019s statement of facts acknowledges that these two employees were assisting the foreman in performing \u201cadministrative duties.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
