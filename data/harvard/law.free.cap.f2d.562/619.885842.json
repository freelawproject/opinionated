The issues he raises on this appeal deal with proceedings after the jury returned into open court with the first of two verdicts rendered in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">After several hours\u2019 deliberation, the jury returned to the courtroom, and its verdict of guilty was announced. The court then polled the jurors, beginning with Verda Abrusley:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-10\">THE COURT: Is that your verdict, Mrs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-11\">Abrusley? Is that your verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-12\">JUROR ABRUSLEY: I\u2019m still debating on it, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-14\">At that point, the trial judge proceeded to the next juror. The remaining jurors gave affirmative responses to the judge\u2019s inquiry. The court ordered the verdict filed, at which time appellant objected. Appellant\u2019s counsel argued, out of the jury\u2019s hearing, that the first juror\u2019s response to the poll indicated she was not certain and therefore the verdict was not unanimous. The trial judge responded that he understood Mrs. Abrusley\u2019s answer to be that the verdict announced was her verdict. However, upon hearing the proceedings read back by the court reporter, the judge saw fit to further question Abrusley. The record reflects the following inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-15\">THE COURT: Mrs. Abrusley, when I polled the jury, which is a procedure that we\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-16\">JUROR ABRUSLEY: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-17\">THE COURT: \u2014do routinely, I inquired of you first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-18\">JUROR ABRUSLEY: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-19\">THE COURT: And it may have caught you a little off guard and unprepared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-20\">We are not certain that either the Court Reporter or the Court understood your answer to my question, so may I ask you again\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-21\">JUROR ABRUSLEY: May I come?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-22\">THE COURT: No, please stay there and answer my question exactly as you want to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-23\">JUROR ABRUSLEY: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-24\">THE COURT: But answer my question responsively.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-25\">JUROR ABRUSLEY: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-26\">THE COURT: I am inquiring of all the jurors if the jury-verdict form, as read by the clerk, is each of your verdicts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-27\">Now, I am asking you, is that your verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-28\">JUROR ABRUSLEY: Well, I first said, you know, that he was not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-29\">THE COURT: No, ma\u2019m. I don\u2019t want an explanation\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-30\">JUROR ABRUSLEY: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-31\">THE COURT: \u2014of the process you went through, I want to know is that your verdict. Yes or no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-32\">JUROR ABRUSLEY: Due to just the\u2014 what they had against him\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-33\">THE COURT: Mrs. Abrusley, answer my question directly. Is the verdict of guilty your verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-34\">JUROR ABRUSLEY: Not really. I\u2014 they influenced me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-35\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t want to hear any more about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-36\">JUROR ABRUSLEY: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-37\">THE COURT: I\u2019ll ask the jury to retire to the jury room at this time and await further instructions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-38\">At that point, appellant\u2019s counsel moved for a mistrial. He stated he understood Abrusley to have said, \u201cNot really \u2014 they <em>forced </em>me.\u201d The record reflects that she used the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>word \u201cinfluenced\u201d. Appellant\u2019s counsel based his argument largely upon her use of the word \u201cforced\u201d and contended that the jury could not fairly deliberate any further.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Before ruling on appellant\u2019s motion, the trial judge ordered a brief recess during which he reviewed the stenographic record with the court reporter. When the proceedings reconvened, the judge informed appellant\u2019s counsel that the reporter\u2019s notes, which were consistent with the judge\u2019s recollection, indicated Abrusley never used the word \u201cforced\u201d. The trial court noted the juror\u2019s uncertainty, as reflected in her answer that the verdict was \u201c[n]ot really\u201d her verdict and announced his intention to send the jury back for additional deliberations. Appellant\u2019s counsel objected, reiterating his contention that Abrusley used the word \u201cforced\u201d, and requested an opportunity to produce evidence rebutting the stenographic record. He proposed to call persons who were in the courtroom during the colloquy to testify as to what they heard Abrusley say. The trial judge denied his request, as well as his motion for mistrial, and sent the jury back for further deliberation. The jury subsequently returned with a verdict of guilty; a poll indicated the verdict was unanimous. Over appellant\u2019s objection, the judge ordered the verdict filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Appellant contends the trial court erred in denying him the opportunity to present evidence rebutting the stenographic record. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The Court Reporter\u2019s Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753, provides that \u201c[t]he transcript in any case certified by the reporter shall be deemed prima facie a correct statement of the testimony taken and proceedings had.\u201d In <em>United States v. Carter, </em>347 F.2d 220 (1965), <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 888, 86 S.Ct. 178, 15 L.Ed.2d 124, the Second Circuit drew from that language the inference that the record is subject to correction. In <em>Carter, </em>the defendant alleged that the trial court erred in amending the record from the bench. The court affirmed the conviction, noting the authority of the trial judge to make the record conform to the truth. <em>Carter </em>does not, however, support appellant\u2019s contention that upon his mere assertion that the stenographic record is erroneous he is entitled as of right to present testimony in rebuttal. Indeed, that court speaks in terms of the discretion of the trial judge in such matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">We cannot say that appellant\u2019s substantial rights were prejudiced by the trial judge\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s request. The trial judge was present and was a participant in the colloquy with Abrusley. His judgment as to the existence of a bona fide and substantial question regarding the correctness of the record is entitled to great weight. Additionally, appellant has not demonstrated the significance of the juror\u2019s choice of words. The poll of jurors is a procedure to protect the right of an accused to be convicted, if at all, by no less than unanimous assent of the jurors. The only determination to be made on the poll is whether the verdict announced is each jur- or\u2019s verdict. The matter disputed here concerns a comment the juror volunteered concerning the deliberation process. Her indication that the verdict announced was \u201c[n]ot really\u201d her verdict was her only pertinent response. We have held that a juror may not impeach a verdict by testimony concerning the deliberation process. <em>Young v. United States, </em>163 F.2d 187 (10th Cir. 1947), <em>cert. denied, </em>332 U.S. 770, 68 S.Ct. 83, 92 L.Ed. 355; <em>Loney v. United States, </em>151 F.2d 1 (10th Cir. 1945). Abrusley\u2019s proffered explanation was neither pertinent to the poll nor admissible to impeach the verdict. We do not believe, therefore, that a question as to the content of her explanation involved appellant\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">Appellant next contends the trial judge erred in returning the jury for further deliberations rather than discharging the jury when it became apparent that the first verdict was not unanimous.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">Rule 31(d), Fed.R.Crim.P., provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-12\">(d) Poll of Jury. When a verdict is returned and before it is recorded the jury shall be polled at the request of any party or upon the court\u2019s own motion. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>upon the poll there is not unanimous concurrence, <em>the jury may be directed to retire for further deliberations or may be discharged. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">The rule clearly vests the trial judge with discretion. He is in a better position than the appellate court to determine the effect of a dissenting or uncertain vote upon the likelihood that further deliberations will yield a freely given verdict. His judgment is entitled to proper deference. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>137 U.S.App.D.C. 147, 420 F.2d 1350 (1969); <em>Williams v. United States, </em>136 U.S.App.D.C. 158, 419 F.2d 740 (1969); <em>Jackson v. United States, </em>128 U.S.App.D.C. 214, 386 F.2d 641 (1967). We cannot say the trial judge abused his discretion in directing further deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The more substantial question is the fairness of the ultimate verdict of guilty. Appellant contends it was the result of coercion rather than free deliberation. He places primary reliance on <em>United States v. Sexton, </em>456 F.2d 961 (5th Cir. 1972). Sexton was charged with violation of various criminal provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The jury returned with a verdict of guilty. The court proceeded with a poll, asking each juror, \u201cWas it your verdict?\u201d One of the jurors responded, \u201cI didn\u2019t vote either way.\u201d The trial judge asked again, \u201cWell, is it your verdict?\u201d The juror responded, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d The Fifth Circuit held the interchange constituted undue interference by the judge in that the juror, having indicated uncertainty, was required to make up her mind in open court. As the court pointed out, \u201cIf the Court had simply stated that the verdict could not be accepted because it was not unanimous and had returned the jury for further deliberation there would have been no error.\u201d 456 F.2d at 967.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">In the present case, Abrusley was anxious to explain rather than respond to the judge\u2019s question in the poll. The judge refused, politely but firmly, to argue or discuss the matter with her; rather, he sought a responsive answer to the inquiry on the poll. When Abrusley responded that the verdict was not hers, the judge immediately ended his exchange with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">In <em>Sexton, </em>the judge forced a juror, in the face of her expressed uncertainty, to arrive at a verdict in open court. In this case, at the juror\u2019s first direct indication of her nonconcurrence the court stopped the inquiry. We believe the ultimate verdict was the product of free deliberation and not of interference or coercion from the bench. <em>Amos v. United States, </em>496 F.2d 1269 (8th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 896, 95 S.Ct. 174, 42 L.Ed.2d 140; <em>United States v. Fox, </em>488 F.2d 1093 (5th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>417 U.S. 948, 94 S.Ct. 3074, 41 L.Ed.2d 668; <em>United States v. Bendicks, </em>449 F.2d 313 (5th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
