On the basis of this evidence, a jury found them guilty of three counts of possession of LSD and marijuana with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) (1970), and possession of marijuana in the form of hashish, in violation of D.C.Code \u00a7 33-402 (1973), and not guilty of two other counts. Appellant was sentenced to a term of five years probation pursuant to the Federal Youth Corrections Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(a). This appeal questions only the convictions of Davis.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-15\">Convictions on all three counts rest upon a factual determination that appellant Davis possessed the drugs involved. Two of the counts also included the jury\u2019s conclusion that such possession was with intent to distribute the controlled substances. Appellant argues that the link shown between him and the narcotics discovered in the apartment was insufficient to establish his constructive possession of them, and that there is insufficient circumstantial evidence that his possession was with intent to distribute. He contends that the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of the government\u2019s case, and in the alternative that the evidence does not support the conviction. Appellant also attacks the admission of certain documents. We find that the trial court properly denied Davis\u2019 motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of the government\u2019s case, that the evidence supports the convictions and that the trial was without substantial error, and therefore affirm the judgment as to all three counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-16\">I. THE MOTION FOR JUDGMENT OF ACQUITTAL</p>\n<p id=\"b757-17\">In passing upon a motion for judgment of acquittal the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government giving full play to the right of the jury to determine credibility, weigh the evidence and draw justifiable inferences of fact. <em>United States v. Fench, </em>152 U.S.App.D.C. 325, 333, 470 F.2d 1234, 1242, <em>cert. denied, </em>410 U.S. 909, 93 S.Ct. 964, 35 L.Ed.2d 271 (1973); <em>Curley v. United States, </em>81 U.S.App.D.C. 389, 160 F.2d 229, <em>cert. denied, </em>331 U.S. 837, 67 S.Ct. 1511, 91 L.Ed. 1850 (1947). It is only when there is no evidence upon which a reasonable mind might fairly conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt that the judge may properly take the case from the jury. <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>v. <em>Fench, supra; United States v. Lumpkin, </em>145 U.S.App.D.C. 162, 168, 448 F.2d 1085, 1091 (1971). In applying this standard no legal distinction is made between circumstantial and direct evidence. <em>Holland v. United States, </em>348 U.S. 121,139-40, 75 S.Ct. 127, 99 L.Ed. 150 (1954); <em>United States v. Fench, supra. </em>The court must, however, consider only the evidence as it was when the Government rested. <em>Powell v. United States, </em>135 U.S.App.D.C. 254, 257 n.9, 418 F.2d 470, 473 n.9 (1969); <em>Austin v. United States, </em>127 U.S.App.D.C. 180, 189, 382 F.2d 129, 138 (1967). Our review of the evidence adduced in the Government\u2019s case in chief leads us to the conclusion that a prima facie case had been made against Davis on all three counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">To prove constructive possession of narcotics the Government must show that the defendant was in a position or had the right to exercise dominion and control over the drugs. <em>United States v. Watkins, </em>171 U.S.App.D.C. 158, 162, 519 F.2d 294, 298 (1975); <em>United States v. Holland, </em>144 U.S.App.D.C. 225, 227, 445 F.2d 701, 703 (1971); <em>United States v. Bethea, </em>143 U.S.App.D.C. 68, 71, 442 F.2d 790, 793 (1972). In addition, the possession under D.C.Code \u00a7 33 \u2014 402 must be knowing, <em>United States v. Watkins, supra; United States v. Weaver, </em>148 U.S.App.D.C. 3, 458 F.2d 825 (1972). Here, the prima facie showing that appellant was knowingly in a position to exercise dominion and control over the drugs in question rests upon proof that appellant lived in the apartment, that he was physically present there, literally in the middle of all the seized contraband drugs and drug paraphernalia, and that he could observe what was all about him in his apartment. Thus, the jury could have concluded that (1) appellant was in control of the apartment, the same as any person would be who lived there, paid his share of the rent and was physically present at the time in question, and (2) the presence of the drugs was known to him because substantial quantities were in his plain view, some were located in the closet with the clothes he was wearing, and all were readily accessible to him in areas of the apartment that he would normally frequent and were thus subject to his control. These conclusions are supported by the following evidence introduced in the Government\u2019s case in chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">At the time of the search, about 1:00 p. m., appellant and his codefendant Phoenix were found in the apartment. Appellant and Phoenix were wearing only their undershorts (Tr. 62, 64). Phoenix admitted to the police that he \u201clived in\u201d the apartment and made other statements from which it could be inferred that three people lived there (Tr. 106-107). Davis identified himself to the police in the apartment at the time of the search (Tr. 181), and was identified in court as the Davis who was in the apartment at the time of the search (Tr. 68). It was a stipulated fact that Davis \u201cindicated [to the police] that <em>his address </em>' was <em>1910 Third Street,\u201d </em>the address of the apartment (Tr. 468-469). Three pieces of mail matter for all three occupants of the apartment, Davis, Phoenix and Isaac, addressed to them at \u201c1910 Third Street, Apartment 3,\u201d were also found on the \u201cmantle, on the shelf, in the living room\u201d where Davis was found (Tr. 88, Govt. Ex. 11A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">Three baggies of marijuana were found on a shelf in the .living room where Davis was found, 27 in a closet of the living room and another 18 bags elsewhere in the apartment (Tr. 252, 253).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The total mari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>juana weighed 1,134,538.6 milligrams, or about 2.5 pounds (Tr. 249, 347, 354). LSD tablets sufficient for 239 dosages were found in the refrigerator in the kitchen, as were an additional 31 pieces of paper each containing four doses of LSD, <em>i. e., </em>124 dosages (Tr. 251, 252). Total LSD dosages \u2014363. Smaller quantities of hashish (Tr. 252), phendimetrazine (Tr. 251), cocaine and phenmetrazine (Tr. 252) were also found. Three scales of types commonly used for weighing quantities of drugs were found. One scale was on the coffee table immediately next to the place where Davis was arrested, and another was on a shelf in the same room. (Tr. 64, 65, 66, 87,184, 269, 270, 274). Marijuana dust and seeds covered the coffee table and saturated the carpet under it (Tr. 65). Also found were a substantial number of boxes and bags suitable for packaging drugs (Tr. 64-65). A marijuana gin, for grinding rough marijuana into a texture like smoking tobacco, was found containing marijuana seeds (Tr. 66,109,269, 337). Twenty-five pieces of smoking apparatus containing marijuana residue were found (Tr. 253).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Davis was found in the apartment in the front living room-bedroom in the very middle of all the drugs and paraphernalia (Tr. 64, 65, 66, 77, 78, 86-87, 102-103, 181, 186, 196-198, 248, 252-256, 267-268, 274), much of it in plain view and easily accessible to him. That Phoenix, and not Davis, very quickly disclosed to the police the presence of the large amount of marijuana in the closet and the LSD in the refrigerator<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> does not defeat Davis\u2019 joint possession of such drugs. It just happened that the police \u201casked Mr. Phoenix where the narcotics were\u201d (Tr. 64). From their physical location in the apartment, the fact that both lived there and the other facts herein before stated, the jury could conclude that the ample quantities of the drugs that were seized, and which were charged in the counts of which Davis was found guilty, were known and equally accessible at the time to both Davis and Phoenix, and that both were in a position to exercise dominion and control over these drugs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-12\">Appellant\u2019s intent to distribute the marijuana and LSD could be inferred from the large quantity of the drugs, the fact that the marijuana was packaged as if for sale, the paraphernalia and materials for processing and packaging the contraband, and the marijuana debris which indicated that substantial quantities of marijuana had been handled in the apartment and particularly in the area of the scales. <em>See United States v. James, </em>161 U.S.App.D.C. 88, 112, 494 F.2d 1007, 1031, <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1020, 95 S.Ct. 495, 42 L.Ed.2d 294 (1974); <em>Williams v. United States, </em>55 U.S.App.D.C. 239, 4 F.2d 432 (1925). There was expert testimony that 270 tablets of LSD were more than three persons would possess for their personal use (Tr. 333), and that one person would not possess 1,134,358.6 milligrams of marijuana for his own consumption (Tr. 347). Moreover, a reasonable juror could conclude solely on the basis of the total value of all the drugs in appellant\u2019s apartment that they were possessed with intent to distribute. It was testified that the 239 tablets were worth $3 apiece, or $717 (Tr. 331). The additional 31 pieces of paper were worth about $12 apiece, or $372 (Tr. 330-31). Of the total 1,134,538.6 milligrams of marijuana (Tr. 347), 900,260 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>milligrams was packaged in 48 bags (Tr. 253) of the type commonly sold for from $5 to $10 per bag (Tr. 329). Assuming an average value per bag of $7.50, the packaged marijuana alone was worth $360.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">From all this testimony, <em>i. e., </em>the packaging and processing materials, the wide variety of drugs that were confiscated in the apartment \u2014 marijuana, LSD, hashish, cocaine, phendimetrazine, phenmetrazine\u2014 the 25 pieces of marijuana smoking apparatus, a reasonable mind could conclude that, even if the three lessors of the apartment were users, they did not possess over $1,449.00 of a wide variety of drugs (Tr. 253, 329, 330-331) for their personal use. Likewise, the Court, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government\u2019s case-in-chief could find that a reasonable mind might fairly conclude from Davis\u2019 physical presence, his joint interest in the lease of the apartment, the large quantity of a wide variety of drugs (much of it packaged) and the other evidence detailed above that Davis jointly possessed these drugs and that he along with the others intended to distribute the marijuana ($360.00) and LSD ($1,089.00).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">II. THE JURY VERDICT</p>\n<p id=\"AO7\">The Government\u2019s case was greatly strengthened by the testimony introduced by the defendants and through their cross-examination after the close of the Government\u2019s case in chief. A review of the entire record thus reveals even more compelling evidence supporting appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">The testimony of the complete trial permitted the jury to conclude even more conclusively that the appellant was acting in concert with his codefendants, and that they had exclusive joint-control over the apartment. The three defendants were old \u201cfriends\u201d from Cleveland, Ohio (Tr. 605, 710, 711), and were close together in age (Tr. 605). Isaac and Davis were cousins (Tr. 579, 590, 711). The three <em>acted jointly </em>in renting the apartment, and split the rent of $115 or $125 per month \u201cthree ways\u201d (Tr. 602, 604, 710). Davis and the other defendants each had a key to the apartment as did a girlfriend, Miss Pat Seabury (Tr. 601-602), but she had been away from the apartment for more than three months pri- or to the search of the apartment and the arrest of appellant (Tr. 717).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>The jury could also conclude that Davis had personal control over the apartment and knowledge of and control over the drugs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Davis testified that, at the time the drugs were seized, the apartment was \u201chis residence\u201d (Tr. 575) and his mailing and legal address (Tr. 575, 576). He admitted having access to all parts of the small (Tr. 593) apartment, not only the common areas which were strewn with drugs and paraphernalia, but also the closets and the refrigerator where large quantities of the drugs were found (Tr. 591, 619), and the bedroom (Tr. 592); \u201cmany times\u201d he \u201cwould be the only one\u201d in the apartment (Tr. 587). Davis kept some of his clothes in the living room-bedroom closet (Tr. 616-17) where 27 bags of marijuana were found (Tr. 87), and other clothes in the bedroom closet (Tr. 593). While in the apartment Davis generally slept in the permanent bed in the bedroom (Tr. 585) while Isaac slept on a pull-down mattress (Tr. 585-86, 702-04). Davis testified that Issac was there only \u201coccasionally\u201d (Tr. 584). This testimony could lead the jury to conclude that Davis\u2019 relationship to the apartment and its contents was stronger than that of Isaac.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Davis claimed, however, that while he had lived in the apartment on a \u201cfull time basis\u201d from August 1972 to January or late December 1973 (Tr. 578, 603, 604), at the time of his arrest on March 6, 1974, he was only there \u201coccasionally\u201d (Tr. 584) and that other times he was at his girlfriend\u2019s place (Tr. 584, 576). According to Davis, \u201cnot any one defendant used that particular apartment all the time\u201d (Tr. 584). This testimony evoked the inquiry from other defense counsel that, \u201cThen might it be fair to say that you were using the apartment at 1910 Third Street for <em>some other purpose\u201d </em>(Tr. 623). Davis\u2019 reply was: \u201cNo, sir, other than the purpose of a mailing address\u201d (Tr. 623). That he would continue to pay his one-third of the rent for several months merely for a \u201cmailing address\u201d was testimony that the jury could disbelieve and it is apparent that the jury did not credit his testimony in this respect. The jury was not required to.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">The testimony of all three defendants sought to minimize their presence at the apartment and to assert that all of them were largely ignorant of the ownership<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of contraband drugs throughout the apartment (Tr. 648-50, 683, 688, 695, 705, 721). Even Phoenix, who was caught with Davis in the apartment at the time of the search, claimed he was not aware of drugs other than those he disclosed to the police (Tr. 648). The claim of the parties was that they \u201csuspected\u201d (Tr. 649) that an incompletely identified third person with a first name of Stewart, and an unknown \u201cArabic\u201d type last name (Tr. 724), who operated \u201clike a shadow in the dark\u201d (Tr. 683), apparently owned the drugs (Tr. 648-651, 664-667, 682). The defendants testified that Stewart worked with Davis at a clothing store (Tr. 665) and used the apartment where the drugs were seized \u201cquite a bit\u201d (Tr. 650) <em>but paid no rent. </em>Phoenix testified that the marijuana had been in the apartment for two days prior to the search and seizure (Tr. 668) and he had seen the LSD in the refrigerator 4 days before the seizure (Tr. 670). Isaac tried to escape knowledge of the drugs inside the refrigerator by testifying that \u201cnobody used ice\u201d in alcoholic drinks (Tr. 723-724). Phoenix did allow that the drugs \u201ccould have belonged to Davis or Isaac\u201d (Tr. 688, 666) and it was clear that the jury could reach the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>Based on all the evidence, the jury could disbelieve defendants\u2019 incriminatory denials and conclude that each defendant was attempting to hide his knowledge of the drugs. Juries may use their common sense to look through testimony and draw inferences from all the surrounding circumstances that may conflict with specific statements. <em>Cf. Giacona v. United States, </em>257 F.2d 450, 454 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>358 U.S. 873, 79 S.Ct. 113, 3 L.Ed.2d 104 (1958). The jury found, and the dissent agrees, that there was sufficient evidence to support appellant\u2019s conviction for possession of hashish. The testimony that proves possession of the contraband specified in the other two counts is not substantially different from the evidence the dissent admits proves possession of the hashish and we conclude that the jury\u2019s finding that appellant possessed the LSD and marijuana is supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">The jury could likewise have concluded from all the evidence that the LSD and marijuana were possessed with intent to distribute them. <em>See </em>n. 5, <em>supra </em>and n. 8, <em>infra. </em>It was a reasonable inference that Davis was one of the co-possessors who <em>intended </em>to participate in the distribution of the drugs because, in addition to the evidence in the Government\u2019s case in chief, if Davis were to be believed, he continued to pay one-third of the rent of the apartment, where this illegal operation was centered, for several months after his only admitted use of the apartment was for \u201cthe purpose of a mailing address\u201d (Tr. 623). But young people do not ordinarily pay rent on apartments for such a limited purpose. The jury could conclude that Davis had some joint monetary purpose with his codefendants <em>that he wished to conceal </em>and that this monetary purpose was to participate in selling the drugs which were located throughout the apartment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The jury could also conclude that Davis\u2019 purpose in paying rent was to live there.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">The dissent would set aside the convictions on counts one and two (possession with intent to distribute) on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence of appellant\u2019s possession of the large quantities of LSD and marijuana upon which these counts are based, and that therefore there has been no showing that appellant had the specific intent to transfer drugs. The dissent would fashion a standard that would limit possession in cases of joint occupancy, absent specific evidence linking a particular defendant to the partic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>ular drugs seized, practically to the immediate area within reach of the accused at the time he was arrested. While this may be a valid limit for the area that may be searched without a warrant, it expresses an unduly restrictive concept of the limits of possession of articles within one\u2019s residence, The correct law is expressed in the instruetion given to the jury.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Criminal laws are to be strictly construed in favor of the accused, but not to the point of unreason, Proof of guilt beyond a <em>reasonable </em>doubt is all that is required.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Given the joint-participation between appellant and his codefendants in leasing the apartment, the substantial size and nature of the apparent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>drug activities and their extensive presence throughout the apartment and appellant\u2019s physical presence surrounded by contraband substances, we conclude that the jury was perfectly within the law in finding that appellant possessed the drugs in question.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Many of the same factors lead us to reject the dissent\u2019s conclusion that appellant was not shown to share his codefendants\u2019 intent to distribute the drugs. The jury could reasonably conclude from the joint participation of the defendants in the lease of the apartment, and the testimony as to their actual physical presence when arrested and at other times, that they all harbored the same intent.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The dissent also contends that the quantity of marijuana, while more than enough for <em>one </em>person\u2019s own use, might be within the ordinary use of three people. Dissent at n. 18. It was previously noted that the quantity of LSD exceeded what would normally be possessed by three persons for their own use. However, there is more evidence of intent to distribute in this case than quantity alone. According to Davis (Tr. 581) and Isaac (Tr. 708, 721), they only used marijuana \u201coccasionally\u201d and Phoenix testified he would not \u201cconsume all the marijuana,\u201d (Tr. 669) so the testimony as to the amount is helpful but not conclusive. There is also the wide variety of drugs, the exceptionally high dollar value of the drugs, the drug paraphernalia, the processing and packaging material and the packaging. To rely solely on quantity is to take a narrow view of the evidence from which the intent to distribute might be inferred. The presence in the apartment of 25 pieces of smoking apparatus<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> is mute evidence from which a jury could conclude that more individuals than the defendants were smoking the marijuana in the apartment and that those who rented and occupied the apartment and possessed the 25 pieces of smoking apparatus did so as part of a marijuana distribution operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">The decisions upon which the dissent principally relies are factually distinguishable from the present case. In each, there was proof of proximity to the narcotics but <em>no substantial evidence of a proprietary interest </em>in the premises where the drugs were found, <em>i. e., </em>that the defendant lived in or controlled the apartment. In <em>Moore v. United States, </em>429 U.S. 20, 97 S.Ct. 29, 50 L.Ed.2d 25 (1976) (per curiam), appellant was found, apparently unconscious, near bags of heroin and narcotics paraphernalia. The only evidence of Moore\u2019s control of the apartment, however, was an out-of-court statement of an informant which was inadmissible as evidence. The Court found the trial court\u2019s reliance on this statement to be error and remanded for a determination whether it was harmless.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Similarly, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number><em>United States v. Watkins, supra, </em>the only evidence of the appellant\u2019s control of the apartment, rent and utility receipts for two months, was excluded as hearsay. In <em>United States v. Bethea, supra, </em>the controlled substance was found concealed under the back seat of an automobile. The appellant was riding in the front passenger\u2019s seat and he had no proprietary interest in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">In <em>United States v. Holland, supra, </em>there was no proof that appellant was other than an overnight visitor in a girlfriend\u2019s apartment. The opinion states that it was \u201cthe apartment of the woman,\u201d 144 U.S.App.D.C. at 226, 445 F.2d at 702, not the defendant Holland. The dissent seems oblivious to this material factual difference. The dissent is also in error when it contends, on the basis of some language in the <em>Holland </em>opinion, that in this case, and presumably every case, proof of dominion and control is narrowly restricted to evidence showing the \u201cregularity with which [the defendant] occupied the place\u201d. 144 U.S.App.D.C. at 227, 445 F.2d at 703, <em>quoted in </em>dissent at n. 20. But <em>Holland </em>was a case where no <em>proprietary </em>interest in the premises was shown, where the arrest of the defendant resulted from his being found in an apartment that was not shown to be his own. To point out that Holland\u2019s presence in the apartment <em>in that case </em>was not shown to have been with sufficient \u201cregularity\u201d to justify a finding that he constructively possessed the articles in the apartment where he was found does not mean that the equivalent of regular occupancy, <em>i. e., </em>the ability to exercise dominion and control over the contents of the apartment, cannot be subsumed from other facts. That is the case here where a proven proprietary interest, actual physical presence of the defendant in an alert mental condition, coupled with an admission by Davis that he \u201clived\u201d in the apartment and had a key to it, clearly was sufficient evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>dence for a jury to conclude he was in a position to exercise dominion and control over the contraband drugs in the apartment to which he had ready access at the time in question.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">The naivete of the dissent is almost unbelievable where it characterizes the \u201capparently <em>innocent </em>ordinary kitchen objects such as plastic bags and food scales\u201d (dissent at n. 17) (emphasis added). The difficulty that a reasonable mind has in so viewing such articles here is that <em>three </em>kitchen scales could hardly be found in 1% of the homes of the United States. And even if one home had three kitchen scales it is submitted that it would be rare to find two of them <em>in the living room </em>at the same time. And it would be even more rare to find any person who would truly believe that when two \u201ckitchen\u201d scales were found in a living room with marijuana seeds and marijuana litter all around on the floor and additional large quantities of <em>packaged </em>marijuana and hashish, the scales were not intended to be and had not been used to weigh the marijuana prior to packaging. This conclusion becomes absolute, and the intent to use the \u201ckitchen\u201d plastic bags for the illegal purpose of packaging contraband drugs is irrefutably proven by the testimony that the dissent\u2019s \u201cinnocent\u201d plastic bags were <em>actually </em>used to package the $5 and $10 baggies of marijuana in <em>uniform </em>quantities which only weighing scales could produce. In the face of such strong evidence to the contrary it is highly unreasonable to even suggest that the scales and the bags were possessed for culinary purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-11\">The jury were therefore fully justified in reaching the only realistic conclusion that such evidence justified, <em>i. e., </em>that the scales and the plastic bags were further evidence of intent to weigh, package and sell marijuana. Any reasonable juror would conclude that if one intended marijuana for his own use he would not go to such extreme pains to package it in the uniform quantities in which it is often sold on the streets.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, such packaging may be taken to indicate an intent to sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-12\">The facts of the above cited cases differ in almost all material respects from the facts of this case and their holdings are thus not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-13\">The dissent also relies upon <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bonham, </em>477 F.2d 1137 (3d Cir. 1973) (en banc). In that case two half brothers were convicted at trial of possessing heroin found hidden in a recess behind the door frame of a room they shared. The Third Circuit reversed on the ground that the appellant had not been shown to be in constructive possession of the heroin. <em>Bonham </em>is distinguishable since the conviction there rested <em>only </em>upon possession of the heroin and there was no proof that the drugs in question or other contraband substances or narcotics paraphernalia were <em>in view </em>sufficiently to indicate that appellant knew about the contraband and hence could be found to be in possession of the hidden drug.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In connec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>tion with the federal offense, if facts are not present from which knowledge of the presence of the contraband can be concluded, a finding that one \u201cknowingly\u201d possessed the drugs would be impossible to support. Such facts were not present in <em>Bonham </em>but they are present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The dissent accurately points out that, under our case law in this circuit, proof of a proprietary interest in or regular occupancy of the premises <em>alone </em>is not sufficient to prove constructive possession, dissent at n.7. This was made clear to the jury in the typewritten instruction given them on this issue, n.9 <em>supra. </em>As the jury concluded, the facts here reveal considerably more than just a proprietary interest. The joint participation between the appellant and his codefendants in the leasing and occupancy of the apartment, appellant\u2019s presence in the apartment at the time the drugs were seized, the obvious nature of the large-scale processing activities of a wide variety of various drugs, the presence of used drug consuming equipment in the apartment, and the obvious unreasonableness of the explanation he gave for continuing to pay rent on the apartment, with the other evidence previously referred to, could reasonably have convinced the jury that appellant jointly possessed the marijuana and LSD with which he was charged and that he intended to distribute it.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">As for the attempts by the dissent to introduce factual considerations into the judgment which are outside the jury record, we see no need to discuss them- \u2014 nor do we see any need to point out the obvious tortured view of the offenses charged in this case to which they are addressed. See Part III of dissent. The fact that other evidence might not incriminate Davis does not answer the fact that the evidence here does support the jury\u2019s verdict. In coming to this conclusion it should also be pointed out that the principal defect in the dissent is its almost complete basic failure to recognize the probative effect of circumstantial evidence and the reasonable inferences that the jury may draw therefrom<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and its similar failure to recognize the limited authority of appellate courts to overturn factual determinations by juries based on substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">We thus find that the court properly denied Davis\u2019 motion for judgment of acquittal after the close of the government\u2019s case in chief, and that the evidence obtained when the defendants took the stand increased the evidence in support of the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">We affirm the judgments of conviction on all three counts.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-6\">. Davis contests on hearsay grounds the admission of these pieces of mail and the police 163 form recording his statement to one of the arresting officers that 1910 Third Street, the address of the apartment, was his address. In view of the stipulation to this effect, Tr. 468-69, we need not reach either issue. If either admission is objectionable, the stipulation renders both harmless error. <em>Cf. </em>Dissent at n.13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b758-11\">. The dissent accurately points out that the initial testimony of Officer Grace, describing the locations of several of the items seized in the bedroom, was stricken by the trial court as hearsay. <em>Infra, </em>183 U.S.App.D.C. at-, 562 F.2d at 698, Tr. 220, 224. But the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>subsequently stipulated that all of the items introduced as evidence were in fact seized in the apartment, Tr. 249-255. Thus, although there is no admissible testimony in the case regarding the precise locations of, e. <em>g., </em>the 18 bags of marijuana and a number of the smoking instruments, the tangible evidence itself is still in the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b759-7\">. The dissent in n.18 quibbles that the marijuana in the closet did not constitute a \u201clarge quantity.\u201d It had a value of over $200.00 which, it is submitted, satisfies the questioned description. <em>See infra, </em>183 U.S.App.D.C. at -, 562 F.2d at 685-686, 687.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b759-14\">. It was not necessary to rely on any statement of Davis that he was aware of the presence of the drugs because they were in plain view (hashish, marijuana) and in places where he had ready access (closet, refrigerator). This was apparent from the Government\u2019s case in chief and was reinforced by testimony adduced from the defense witnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b760-5\">. The dissent misconceives the nature of the evidence from which a jury may find intent to distribute or dispense. There is no requirement that the government prove that any particular accused possessor intended <em>personally </em>to distribute or dispense. The offense is <em>\u201cpossession] </em>with intent to distribute, or dispense\u201d. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) (emphasis added). Possession with the requisite intent may be shown by facts other than an intent <em>personally </em>to distribute. In fact, where large scale drug operations are uncovered, the intent of those in possession to distribute or dispense is plainly apparent from the large quantities, or packaging, or other attendant circumstances but it is generally others who engage in the actual distribution and sale. For instance, if three people invest $20,000 apiece in 500 lbs. of marijuana and have the the marijuana in a warehouse they jointly rent and each has a key thereto \u2014 on those facts <em>alone </em>\u2014 without <em>any proof as to who was going to sell it </em>\u2014 the intent ultimately to distribute can be found to exist by the jury. Under the view of the dissent every wholesaler of narcotics could defend on the ground that he never personally distributed or dispensed but left those functions to his partners. This case, in a lesser degree, is similar. From the joint venture in leasing the apartment and each paying rent <em>for a limited purpose </em>\u2014the possession of the keys to the apartment \u2014 the large quantity and variety of drugs \u2014 with some of it packaged as if for sale \u2014 the processing and packaging paraphernalia and the evidence of large scale packaging \u2014 and the physical presence of Davis in the midst of all the drugs \u2014 marijuana, hashish, cocaine, LSD, phencyclidine and phenmetrazine \u2014 indicated an unlawful drug operation of sufficient magnitude to support a finding of intent to distribute or dispense \u2014 without any showing that any particular defendant would himself <em>personally </em>distribute or dispense. The plain inference from the facts is that those who possessed the drug did so with intent either to distribute or dispense personally or to cause it to be distributed or dispensed by others. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Who the actual distributors or dispensers might turn out to be is not important \u2014 what is plain from the evidence is that those who possessed the drugs \u2014 and Davis was one of those \u2014 clearly intended that the drugs would be dispensed or distributed. Also, from all of this evidence the jury could, and obviously did, find that Davis, from his physical presence in the apartment and his relation to it and its contents, intended to exercise dominion and control over the drugs. On appeal that finding must be credited by the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b761-6\">. In several instances the dissent displays its erroneous analysis of the offense by referring to whom the drugs \u201cbelong,\u201d <em>Infra, </em>183 U.S. App.D.C. at-n.9, 562 F.2d at 694, 695 n.9. The offense is based on \u201cpossession,\u201d not ownership. To assert that one can divest himself of constructive possession by treating the drugs as belonging to a roommate and having no intent of exercising dominion and control over the drugs may have some force as an abstract proposition; but the jury were free to find to the contrary on the evidence here. Evidence of such divestiture or lack of intent was not present when the court ruled at the close of the Government\u2019s case in chief and the jury were not compelled to draw such inferences from subsequent testimony. Also <em>see </em>n.ll <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b761-12\">. <em>See </em>note 6 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b762-5\">. The dissent in Part II D (183 U.S.App.D.C. at 562 F.2d at 700-701, infra) contends that the interpretation of the evidence with respect to Davis\u2019 relationship to the apartment that is advanced in support of the jury finding that he intended to distribute the drugs (183 U.S.App. D.C. at-, 562 F.2d at 687, supra) is inconsistent with the interpretation advanced to support its finding that he was in constructive possession of the drugs (183 U.S.App.D.C. at -, 562 F.2d at 684 n.6, <em>supra). </em>In furtherance of this argument the dissent fractures the grounds relied upon and twists the comments made with respect to Davis\u2019 testimony minimizing his use of the apartment into a claim of erroneous inconsistency. Not so.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Davis testified in response to a question by counsel for his co-defendants that he used the apartment at 1910 Third Street for no purpose \u201cother than the purpose of a mailing address\u201d and otherwise only stayed there on \u201cextraordinary situation[s] (Tr. 623). With respect to this testimony we point out the obvious, <em>i. </em>e., that \u201cyoung people do not ordinarily pay rent on apartments for such a limited purpose.\u201d Hence, we contend, the jury could <em>reject </em>such testimony and find that he had <em>both </em>a \u201cmonetary purpose\u201d <em>and </em>a residential purpose in paying rent on the apartment. Such purposes support <em>both </em>constructive possession and intent to distribute and such conclusions are supported by other substantial evidence as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">As stated in the text <em>supra, </em>183 U.S.App.D.C. at-, 562 F.2d at 688, the jury\u2019s verdict on the counts charging intent to distribute is supported by <em>\"all the evidence\u201d </em>and the assertion that Davis had a \u201cjoint monetary purpose\u201d probative of his intent to sell which he was trying to conceal by his testimony is not in any way inconsistent with the jury finding that he was also trying to conceal his more extensive use of the apartment which was also probative on the issue of constructive possession: in other words that Davis \u201clived\u201d there, as he said he did, and also that he intended to distribute the contraband he possessed. For other testimony from which the jury could find the requisite intent to distribute <em>see </em>the text accompanying this footnote. The dissent erroneously assumes that the jury must accept Davis\u2019 testimony. It need not. <em>See Giacona v. United States, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b763-11\">. The dissent suggests that the jury may have misunderstood the definition of constructive possession, dissent at n. 5. There is no factual support for this claim. The following instruction on the issue of possession was given by the trial court both during the trial (Tr. 684-85) and at its conclusion (Tr. 798-99). It was not objected to at trial or on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-12\">The law recognizes two kinds of possession: actual possession and constructive possession. A person who knowingly has direct physical control over a thing, at a given time, is then in actual possession of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-13\">A person who, although not in actual possession, knowingly has both the power and the intention, at a given time, to exercise dominion or control over a thing, either directly or through another person or persons, is then in constructive possession of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-14\">The law recognizes also that possession may be sole or joint. If one person alone has actual or constructive possession of a thing, possession is sole. If two or more persons share actual or constructive possession of a thing, possession is joint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-15\">Mere presence in the vicinity of a narcotic drug or mere knowledge of its physical location, does not constitute either actual or constructive possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-16\">You may find that the requirement of possession is satisfied only if you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had actual or constructive possession either alone or jointly with others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-17\">Recognizing its importance to their deliberations, the jury requested and were given a typewritten copy of this part of the court\u2019s instructions (Tr. 810-814) with a change suggested by Davis\u2019 counsel to particularize that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao3\">[mjere presence in the vicinity of a narcotic drug, or mere knowledge of its physical location does not constitute <em>either constructive possession or actual </em>possession.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-18\">(Tr. 811-812) (emphasis indicates added matter). There is thus no basis to conclude or even suggest that the jury were not thoroughly familiar with the court\u2019s instruction in this particular, or that the instruction did not comport with the case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-19\">There is no justification on this record for the assertion in the dissent that the jury were \u201cconfused\u201d when they requested a written copy of the instruction on constructive possess. Dissent at n. 5. Such request was equally consistent with a desire to be completely accurate in following an instruction on an important issue in the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b763-21\">. The dissent relies in part upon Whitebread &amp; Stevens, <em>Constructive Possession in Narcotics Cases: To Have and Have Not, </em>58 Va.L.Rev. 751 (1972). The authors of the article, however, are in error in a fundamental premise. They state that where circumstantial evidence is relied upon, \u201cthe state must overcome all reasonable inferences of innocence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 765. But this view of the burden of proof in such cases was rejected by the Supreme Court in <em>Holland v. United States, </em>348 U.S. 121, 139-40, 75 S.Ct. 127, 137-138, 99 L.Ed. 150 (1954):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar0\">The petitioners assail the refusal of the trial judge to instruct that where the Government\u2019s evidence is circumstantial it must be such as to exclude every reasonable hypothesis other than that of guilt. There is some support for this type of instruction in the lower court decisions, <em>Garst v. United States, </em>4 Cir., 180 F. 339, 343; <em>Anderson v.

The dissent misses the mark in discussing to whom the drugs \u201cbelong\u201d (dissent at n. 9). It is <em>possession </em>that constitutes the offense under the statute, not ownership. And while an individual may have a certain possessory right in contraband superior to anyone except the state or its agents, <em>People v. Walker, </em>33 Cal.App.2d 18, 90 P.2d 854, 855 (1939), there is no property right in contraband property. <em>See, e. g., United States v.

The jury could reasonably have concluded that while someone else, for example \u201cStewart,\u201d had a superior right to possession of the drugs, the defendants also at the time in question \u201cpossessed\u201d them with intent to distribute as charged in the indictment.

An informant had tipped the police that Moore and others were in possession of heroin at \u201cMoore\u2019s apartment,\u201d 429 U.S. at 21, 97 S.Ct. at 30. The police obtained a search warrant, entered the apartment and found Moore lying face down near a coffee table in the living room. A woman was sitting on a couch in the same room. Bags of heroin found on top of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>and beneath the coffee table were seized along with various narcotics paraphernalia. However, the police found no indicia of ownership of the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">In finding Moore guilty of possession with intent to distribute (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1)) the trial court <em>\u201cexpressly </em>relied on the hearsay declaration of the informant\u201d. 429 U.S. at 21, 97 S.Ct. at 30 (emphasis in opinion). The Supreme Court found this to constitute error because it deprived Moore of the opportunity to cross-examine the informant as to the factual basis for believing that Moore was a \u201ctenant or regular resident there,\u201d and otherwise to attack the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">Speaking to the probative effect of Moore\u2019s proximity to the heroin, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APx\">Whether or not the evidence of proximity <em>alone, </em>when viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, could suffice to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Moore was in possession of the heroin, the fact is that the trial court did not find Moore guilty on that evidence alone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">429 U.S. at 22, 97 S.Ct. at 30 (emphasis added). From these facts the dissent asserts that \u201cMoore\u2019s more general message [for us, is] that we should be cautious in inferring possession from the fact that one is found near drugs . .\u201d Dissent at n. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">Moore has limited relevance to this case because of the material difference in critical facts. It was <em>stipulated here, </em>and hence in evidence, that one of the policemen would testify that after the execution of the search warrant at the apartment</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-12\">he spoke to an individual who identified himself as Joseph Davis. That this individual stated that <em>his residence </em>was Apartment No. 3 .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-13\">where he was arrested (Tr. 575). Thus, whereas in <em>Moore </em>there was no competent evidence of Moore\u2019s residence, the fact finder in this case could find on the basis of competent testimony that appellant <em>lived </em>in the apartment. Moreover, Davis was awake and in possession of his faculties when he was arrested. He could see what was all about him in plain view and he apparently had the ability of a normal sober individual to control what was about him in his own apartment. Moore was \u201clying face down,\u201d apparently sleeping or under the influence of something.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-14\">In addition, the case against Davis, unlike that against Moore, does not rest solely on a large quantity of a <em>single </em>drug. Instead, there was a very substantial quantity of two drugs and a wide variety of other contraband drugs. A substantial quantity of one of the drugs was packaged as if for sale, and the paraphernalia scattered throughout the apartment included articles used in processing marijuana and packaging it for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-15\">The real \u201cgeneral message\u201d from <em>Moore </em>is that in a substantially weaker case than the present one, the Supreme Court did <em>not </em>find proximity alone to be an <em>insufficient </em>basis for a finding of possession. The much stronger facts in the present case fully justify an inference of possession.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b766-5\">.

The fact that the suspected drugs which were <em>in plain view </em>were not a subject of prosecution in <em>Bonham </em>is one additional element that distinguishes that case from</p>\n<p id=\"b766-14\">this case and makes it inapplicable here. The Third Circuit also stated in dicta that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0y\">even if the prosecution had proved that these articles were marijuana and phenaphen, as the officer said he suspected, appellant\u2019s awareness of their presence would be no evidence of knowledge that heroin was concealed elsewhere.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-15\">477 F.2d at 1139, <em>quoted in </em>dissent at n. 16. This dictum is not inconsistent with appellant Davis\u2019 conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, even though much of the marijuana was found in the closets, since a substantial quantity of the <em>same </em>drug, together with equipment and materials for processing it, was found <em>in plain view </em>in Davis\u2019 apartment. Appellant\u2019s constructive possession of the hidden quantities of that drug could thus be inferred, but it is not necessary here to rely on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>this logic as appellant\u2019s clothes in the closet where the drugs were found and his access to such closets would be sufficient for that purpose. To the extent that this dictum in <em>Bonham, </em>or the alternative rationale if we choose to call it such, is inconsistent with appellant\u2019s conviction for possession of LSD with intent to distribute, we decline to follow it. The evidence of the defendants\u2019 joint possession and intent to distribute both the marijuana and the LSD found in the apartment is sufficiently strong on the facts of this case to support appellant\u2019s conviction on both of these counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b767-7\">. In n.17 the dissent seeks to offer innocent excuses for the drug \u201cparaphernalia.\u201d The paraphernalia could have been used for an innocent or an illegal purpose but, what the dissent overlooks, is that it was for the <em>jury </em>to decide on all the evidence what use was intended. And with all the drugs around and all the scraps littering the floor and the <em>\u201cinnocent </em>[?] ordinary kitchen . plastic bags\u201d (dissent at n.17) being used to package large quantities of contraband marijuana it was perfectly reasonable for the jury to conclude, as they did, that the paraphernalia was intended to serve an illegal purpose. The dissent refuses to recognize this finding but it is one of the most elementary rules of appellate procedure that on appeal the facts are to be construed most strongly in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict. That rule disposes of the dissent\u2019s \u201cinnocent\u201d argument. It also disposes of the dissent\u2019s claim that appellant\u2019s presence might have been innocent. That too was a jury question and there was sufficient evidence for the jury to return the verdict of guilty that it did.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b767-13\">. It is this erroneous approach to the evidentiary record that is the basis for the assertion by the dissent that the affirmance of the jury\u2019s verdict is based on a \u201cshaky conclusion.\u201d 183 U.S.App.D.C. at-, 562 F.2d at 700, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b767-15\">. The Government set out to prove the location of each of the quantities of drugs in a very precise manner but was hindered in doing so by the trial court.

While guilt may be apparent to the trial judge he does not return the verdict and he should not forget that jurors are not as perceptive as judges and that the Government\u2019s burden of proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt is a very substantial burden which gives it a right, with which the court should not interfere, to introduce all the competent direct and circumstantial evidence that is probative of guilt or innocence. There is no exclusionary rule for minute evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b768-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>BAZELON, Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AQ0\">dissenting in part, concurring in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Three Howard University students were tried and convicted by a jury of possession and possession with intent to distribute narcotics found in an apartment they shared.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On this appeal, one of them challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction. Unfortunately, the majority\u2019s analysis ends where it should begin \u2014 with a recital of the evidence indicating that at least one (but not necessarily all) of the three occupants of the apartment was selling drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Painting with a broad brush, the majority demonstrates conclusively that there is guilt in the air. But guilt by association cannot support a conviction. There must be evidence which permits a reasoned inference that a particular individual was engaged in the charged activity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The record reveals no such evidentiary nexus with this appellant regarding the charges of possession with intent to distribute. Granted, there is plenty of evidence from which a jury might infer that <em>someone </em>intended to distribute the drugs found in the apart-</p>\n<p id=\"AIoz\">ment; there is no evidence that <em>this appellant </em>was the one.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b768-12\">Possession with intent to distribute requires proof of three elements: (1) that defendant possessed contraband, (2) that he did so knowingly and intentionally, and (3) that he harbored the specific intent to transfer it to another. The possession element may, of course, be satisfied by \u201cconstructive possession.\u201d Although lacking direct physical control, if someone \u201cknowingly has both the power and the intention . to exercise dominion and control,\u201d he is in constructive possession.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-13\">Constructive possession requires that a defendant know how to get at the narcotics (either directly or through an agent). Without such knowledge, the necessary \u201cpower\u201d to exercise dominion and control is lacking. However, \u201cmere presence in the vicinity of a narcotic drug, or <em>mere knowledge of its physical location\u201d </em>is not sufficient as a matter of law to establish constructive possession.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Even though someone has the \u201cpower\u201d to exercise dominion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>and control over an object, he is not in constructive possession unless he also has the \u201cintention\u201d to do so. If one is aware of where his roommate keeps narcotics (and therefore may have power to exercise dominion and control), he is not guilty of constructive possession so long as he treats the drugs as belonging to the roommate and has no intention of exercising dominion and control.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">These settled principles have particular application where narcotics are found on premises occupied jointly. Where only one person inhabits an area, it is reasonable to infer in the first instance that anything found there belongs to him.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That inference is unavailable among joint inhabitants. Drugs found in an apartment occupied by several persons may be in the constructive possession of only one of the occupants, several of them jointly, or all of them. Based <em>solely </em>on the fact that drugs are on the premises, a jury may not conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that they are in the constructive possession of any particular defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">The vast majority of courts therefore hold that \u201cwhere the defendant is in nonexclusive possession of premises on which illicit drugs are found, it cannot be inferred that he knew of the presence of such drugs and had control of them, unless there are other incriminating statements or circumstances tending to buttress such an inference.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If the Government is unable to pinpoint which co-tenant is responsible for the presence of the drugs, it cannot sustain the charge against any of them, even though at least one is almost certainly guilty. But the alternative is conviction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>the innocent with the guilty \u2014 something which has always been abhorrent to our legal traditions: \u201cIt is better that ten escape than that one innocent person suffer.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Even where narcotics offenses or other crimes arousing great public outrage are involved, condemning the innocent is an intolerable price for letting none of the guilty escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Moreover, the Government\u2019s burden to link drugs to an individual is not an unreasonably heavy one. A variety of evidentiary details will sustain an inference that a particular defendant had both the power and the intention to exercise dominion and control over narcotics, as the cases cited by the Government illustrate. It may be shown that the narcotics were found in a place over which the defendant had special control, such as a closet containing his clothing. <em>Walker v. United States, </em>489 F.2d 714, 715 (8th Cir. 1974). Or that a particular defendant had in his special control paraphernalia for preparing the drugs for sale or use. <em>United States v. James, </em>161 U.S.App.D.C. 88, 111-112, 494 F.2d 1007, 1030-31, <em>cert. denied sub nom. Jackson v. United States, </em>419 U.S. 1020, 95 S.Ct. 495, 42 L.Ed.2d 294 (1974) (paraphernalia in a locked box in defendant\u2019s dresser); <em>Petley v. United States, </em>427 F.2d 1101, 1106 (9th Cir. 1970) (pipe containing marijuana residue found in defendant\u2019s duffel bag).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s actions or statements may indicate a consciousness of guilt. <em>United States v. Childs, </em>463 F.2d 390 (4th Cir. 1972) (false name given to pick up trunk containing drugs). Or the drugs may be in plain sight in such close proximity to a defendant that it is reasonable to infer that they were under his control. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>461 F.2d 1026, 1036 (3rd Cir. 1972) (heroin being packaged for sale at kitchen table while defendant stood a few feet away washing dishes).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">The facts do not meet the foregoing legal requirements. The evidence disclosed small quantities of marijuana and smoking apparatus in plain view \u2014 which may be consistent with recent <em>use. </em>It may be assumed that these small amounts of the drug would have supported a conviction for mere possession. However, the Government\u2019s case was devoid of anything indicating knowledge and an intention to exercise dominion and control by this individual over the <em>separate </em>large quantities of drugs found elsewhere in the apartment <em>on which the two counts of possession with intent to distribute are based.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-12\">At approximately one o\u2019clock in the afternoon of March 6, 1974, Officers of the Metropolitan Police Department armed with a search warrant broke down the door to apartment three at 1910 3rd Street N.E. They discovered the appellant and a co-defendant, Purnell Phoenix, standing in the living room clad in their undershorts. A third co-defendant, John Isaac, the appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>lant\u2019s cousin, was not present in the apartment at the time it was raided but was arrested later.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">The officers asked where the narcotics were, and Phoenix (not the appellant) led them to the living room closet, where twenty-seven baggies containing marijuana were hidden, and to the refrigerator where two bags containing a total of 270 tablets of L.S.D. were hidden. There was no testimony in the Government\u2019s ease that appellant said or did anything indicating he was aware of the presence of <em>these </em>drugs, or that any of his clothing or other possessions were found in the living room closet.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Nor was there testimony that the presence of the L.S.D. would have been obvious to anyone using the refrigerator.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">Scattered around the living room in plain view were small quantities of marijuana. In an ashtray on the coffee table was a marijuana cigarette butt, and a \u201croach clip,\u201d a metal device for holding a burning marijuana cigarette while smoking it. A small quantity of marijuana was lying on the coffee table; the rug under it was found to contain marijuana seeds and residue. On the mantel piece in the living room were several small bags of marijuana, two small tinfoils of hashish,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> several letters including one addressed to appellant,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and a postal scale which \u201ccould\u201d be used to weigh narcotics as well as mail. A kitchen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>scale (referred to by the brandname \u201cTriner\u201d) was also seized from the kitchen table.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">A search of the single bedroom disclosed several other small quantities of marijuana lying out in plain view, a grinder containing marijuana seeds, a number of smoking pipes and eighteen additional bags of marijuana hidden in the bedroom closet. However, the testimony regarding the items found in the bedroom was later stricken as hearsay, Tr. 220, 224, and could not properly have been considered by the jury in reaching its verdict. While it was later stipulated that these items were found <em>somewhere </em>in the apartment, Majority op., n.2, there was no competent evidence indicating they were in a place visible to the appellant or that he was aware of their presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">If the Government had been content to charge appellant with simple possession of marijuana, there would be little doubt that the evidence was sufficient. Small quantities of marijuana \u2014 enough to suggest personal use but not distribution \u2014 were obvious throughout the apartment. Moreover, appellant testified that he had smoked marijuana in the apartment on several occasions. Tr. 580-81, 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-11\">But the Government chose also to prosecute all three roommates for possession with intent to distribute the <em>additional </em>large quantities of bagged marijuana hidden in the closet and the L.S.D. hidden in the refrigerator.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> There cannot be much question that Phoenix knew about these drugs \u2014 he led the officers to them. But there is no evidence indicating that <em>this appellant </em>even knew they were there. And assuming he did, what evidence is there indicating <em>this appellant </em>intended to exercise dominion and control over them?</p>\n<p id=\"b772-12\">To my knowledge, no federal court has ever before held that someone' can be convicted of constructive possession of drugs hidden in an apartment he shares with other people absent evidence linking him to the drugs. In a case the majority \u201cdecline[s] to follow,\u201d Majority op. at n.17, the en banc Third Circuit unanimously held directly to the contrary.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">Assuming constructive possession, the Government\u2019s case would still fail for lack of support for a finding that <em>this appellant </em>had the specific intent to transfer drugs. The majority relies on \u201cthe obvious nature of the large-scale processing activities\u201d in the apartment. Majority op.,-of 183 U.S.App.D.C., 693 of 562 F.2d. Even if true, that utterly begs the question of whether <em>this appellant </em>was part of the operation, or was simply guilty of a poor choice of roommates. There is no support for the notion that mere presence at the site of a large-scale narcotics operation is sufficient to convict for possession with intent to distribute.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s approach confuses possible toleration with active participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-12\">To be sure, the scales, the bags and other paraphernalia also tend to indicate <em>an </em>intent to distribute (as opposed to use). But <em>whose </em>intent to distribute? The fact that <em>someone </em>had packaged the marijuana for sale<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and evidently intended to distribute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>it does not indicate that <em>this appellant </em>was part of a conspiracy to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">To prop up its shaky conclusion, the majority argues that Davis\u2019 intent to sell the drugs is also shown by the fact that \u201che continued to pay one-third of the rent of the apartment, where this illegal operation was centered, for several months after his only admitted use of the apartment was for \u2018the purpose of a mailing address\u2019 (Tr. 623).\u201d Majority op.,-of 183 U.S.App.D.C., 688 of 562 F.2d. Opining that \u201c[yjoung people do not ordinarily pay rent on apartments for such a limited purpose\u201d, the majority argues that the jury could have concluded that Davis wished to conceal \u201csome joint monetary purpose\u201d he had for paying rent, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cto participate in selling the drugs\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">For obvious reasons, this theory was not argued to the jury at trial or to the judge on the motion for judgment of acquittal, was not relied on by the Government on appeal, and was not among the several theories suggested from the bench during oral argument. First, the majority misstates the facts. Davis did not testify that he used the apartment <em>solely </em>as a maildrop; he also slept there and kept some of his possessions there while he was living with his girlfriend.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> There is no basis for doubting that Davis would continue for several months to pay $38 to $41 a month for this convenience, unless one were to assume the very proposition that his rent payments are claimed to prove <em>(i.e., </em>that they had no innocent purpose). Moreover, even if one accepted the majority\u2019s characterization of the facts and agreed that a young person is unlikely to pay this sum for a mailing address and must have some \u201cother purpose\u201d for paying rent, the majority\u2019s view of what that other purpose might be is purely speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-14\">Second, the majority contradicts itself. In the denying that Davis used the apartment enough to justify his share of the rent, the majority seems to forget its own earlier statement to the contrary. To establish constructive possession, the majority states the jury could have found that Davis lived in the apartment;<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> to establish intent to distribute, the majority states the jury could have found that he did <em>not </em>live there and therefore must have continued to pay rent for \u201csome other purpose.\u201d In light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>of the jury\u2019s verdict, we are required to give the Government the benefit of all reasonable inference from the evidence. But it is not reasonable to assume that the jury could have simultaneously both accepted and rejected Davis\u2019 testimony that except for \u201cextraordinary situations,\u201d Tr. 624, he lived with his girlfriend rather than in the Third Street apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The legal principles enunciated above do not exist merely to preserve the law\u2019s logical consistency or precision. Reflecting that caution so basic to our jurisprudence, their purpose is to bar the imputation of guilt based on one\u2019s associations, thereby preventing the chance of mistake and injustice when the evidence fails to indicate which of several suspects should be held responsible for drugs found in their shared residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">In this case, however, the evidence is not merely silent about which of the three roommates participated in selling the hidden marijuana and LSD. Out of the presence of the jury, the prosecutor stated that Phoenix was \u201cthe main target in the case.\u201d Tr. 679. The Government also supplied information for use in the presentence report indicating Phoenix was the \u201cmain drug dealer on the Howard University campus.\u201d An undercover informer, who did not testify, had actually purchased drugs at the apartment from a \u201cFelix,\u201d someone he presumably could have identified as Phoenix. Finally, a ledger recovered from the apartment recorded narcotics sales by Phoenix and the third co-defendant, but not this appellant. Tr. 304-12; 365-71. The prosecutor frankly conceded the ledger incriminated the other two defendants but not Davis. Tr. 37-38. For various technical evidentiary reasons, none of this information was brought to the attention of the jurors, who convicted all three defendants alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">These indications that appellant Davis had no part in the selling of the marijuana and LSD found concealed in his apartment underscore the prudence of the principles reviewed in Part II. But evidence of possible innocence is not a prerequisite to the activation of those principles. To the contrary, their purpose is to assure that no one is convicted simply because he is unable to refute an inference of guilt drawn from his proximity to drugs or his association with dealers. It is because the majority so carelessly disregards these legal safeguards that I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b768-14\">. At the close of the Government\u2019s case, the trial judge dismissed four counts of the indictment charging possession with intent to distribute phencyclidine and hashish, simple possession of marijuana, and receipt of stolen property. The jury convicted appellant and his two co-defendants of possession with intent to distribute L.S.D., possession with intent to distribute marijuana, and simple possession of hashish.

Constructive possession cases almost always require juries to draw subtle inferences regarding \u201cthe power and the intention to exercise dominion and control\u201d indirectly from circumstantial evidence. Since the concepts involved are almost metaphysical, and easily misunderstood, judges should be especially vigilant to insure that there is adequate evidence to support a jury verdict. <em>See generally, </em>Whitebread &amp; Stevens, <em>Constructive Possession in Narcotics Cases, </em>58 Va.L.Rev. 751, 759-762, 765-66 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The danger that the jury has misunderstood what is required to convict is especially great here, where the jury was so confused by the definition of constructive possession that it requested a written copy of this portion of the instructions.

It is by no means clear that Whitebread &amp; Stevens misstate the burden of proof, as the majority suggests.

We held that before a jury could make an inference of constructive possession, it must at a minimum have before it \u201cinformation about the regularity with which the person in question occupied the place and about his special relationship with the owner or renter.\u201d At 227, 445 F.2d at 703. But <em>Holland </em>clearly did not adopt the converse: that proof of regular occupancy is <em>sufficient </em>to establish constructive possession. (The majority agrees. Majority op.,-,-of 183 U.S.App.D.C., 692, 693 of 562 F.2d) Nor could it have done so in light of the definition of constructive possession discussed above.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b770-5\">.

Mere presence of paraphernalia in common areas occupied by several persons is as ambiguous as the presence of drugs themselves \u2014 either might belong to only some inhabitants. This is especially so when the drugs are hidden, so that other inhabitants may be completely unaware of their presence, or when the \u201cparaphernalia\u201d, although visible, consists of ordinary objects such as plastic bags or kitchen scales which are innocent in appearance but \u201ccould\u201d be used to prepare drugs for sale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b770-7\">. Those cases which rely on \u201cplain view\u201d to show that several individuals intended to exercise joint dominion and control rest on assumptions which are ripe for reexamination. Certainly \u201cplain view\u201d supports an inference of knowledge, but it is also probative of an intention to exercise dominion and control? The premise must be that one who is aware of the presence of narcotics would not remain in the vicinity unless he was a coventurer. That inference may have been valid in the past when drug abuse was uncommon. Today, 53 percent of young people between 18 and 25 admit having used marijuana, National Institute on Drug Abuse, The Public Experience with Psycho-Active Substances: A Nationwide Study Among Adults and Youth (Oct. 1975). It is time to ask whether passive toleration of drug usage has become so prevalent as to strip this inference of all probative value.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b771-5\">. Appellant took the stand in his own defense and admitted on cross-examination that a few of his possessions were in the living room closet. Tr. 616-17. However, in deciding whether the motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of the Government\u2019s case should have been granted, we do not consider evidence adduced later. <em>See Powell v.

On the contrary, appellant testified he did not live in the apartment at all but with his girlfriend, <em>cf. Holland v. United States, supra </em>note 7, using the apartment only as a mail drop and occasionally sleeping there.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b771-8\">. On the contrary, a number of legitimate prescription tablets belonging to Isaac were also seized.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b771-9\">. I believe there was sufficient evidence to permit the jury to infer that appellant was in constructive possession of the hashish in violation of 33 D.C.Code \u00a7 402 (1973), and therefore join the majority in affirming that count of the indictment. Appellant was found in his underwear in close proximity to the hashish. Smoking pipes and other paraphernalia for use were present. Appellant admitted having smoked marijuana in the apartment in the past. Tr. 581, 595. The hashish was left out in the open. Although it is close, I believe that that is enough to permit the jury to infer that appellant knew about the hashish and intended to exercise dominion and control over it by use.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-13\">The requirements of <em>Holland, supra </em>note 7, were satisfied by appellant\u2019s having given the apartment as his address to the arresting officers. While appellant challenges the admission of the Police 163 Form showing this address, I cannot say the district judge \u2014 who observed the demeanor of the witness \u2014 abused his discretion in admitting the form based on the \u201crefreshed recollection\u201d of Officer Hill regarding his conversation with the appellant, Tr. 423-437, even though Hill remained unable to identify him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b771-14\">. The letter was admitted over appellant\u2019s timely hearsay objection to prove that he resided at the apartment. I agree that the letter was inadmissible as an implied statement by the sender, a declarant not present in court, that appellant received his mail at the address listed. See <em>United States v. </em>Davis, 506 F.2d 587 (6 Cir. 1974); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>469 F.2d 267 (9th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-15\">Nor is the problem cured by the \u201cwell-recognized presumptions relating to . . regularity of the mail.\u201d Appellee\u2019s brief, 8 n.6. The presumption only applies if it is first shown the letter was <em>correctly addressed. </em>29 Am.Jur.2d <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 196 at 249-50. <em>See also Kiker v. Commissioner, </em>218 F.2d 389 (4th Cir. 1955); <em>Flowers </em>v. <em>Aetna, </em>163 F.2d 411 (6th Cir. 1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-17\">However, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the admission of the letter was harmless error. The letter was cumulative with the Police 163 Form and appellant\u2019s own testimony that the apartment was his \u201clegal and mailing address.\u201d Tr. 576.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b772-7\">. See note 1 supra. The trial court suspended sentence and placed appellant on five years probation subject to the Youth Corrections Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(a), on all three counts concurrently. Since I agree that the conviction of simple possession of hashish should be affirmed, <em>see supra </em>note 13, appellant\u2019s sentence might not be affected by the two possession with intent to distribute counts. In such circumstances our practice when troublesome problems are present is to vacate the judgment on the additional counts. <em>See United States v. Hooper, </em>139 U.S.App.D.C. 171, 432 F.2d 604 (1970). Even though no reduction in sentence follows, the additional stigma arising from convictions of possession with intent to distribute is certainly substantial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b772-8\">. <em>United States v. Bonham, </em>477 F.2d 1137 (3rd Cir. 1973) (en banc). In <em>Bonham, </em>two brothers shared a bedroom. Both men were in the room when the officers entered. Heroin was discovered hidden in a recess above the doorway. An officer also testified that \u201csuspected marijuana\u201d and \u201csuspected phenaphen tablets\u201d were in plain view on a table. The Third Circuit reversed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-9\">Here there was nothing except the joint occupancy of the room upon which an inference of possession could be based. A fact finder could only speculate whether both of the room\u2019s occupants or a particular one of them even knew of the cache, must less exercised control over the hidden contraband.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-14\">477 F.2d at 1139. Nor would the presence of small quantities of drugs in plain view warrant an inference of possession regarding the drugs which were hidden:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-15\">We have not overlooked the testimony of one of the searching officers that suspicious articles other than heroin were found in plain view on a table in the bedroom. But even if the prosecution had proved that these articles were marijuana and phenaphen, as the officer said he suspected, appellant\u2019s awareness of their presence would be no evidence of knowledge that heroin was concealed elsewhere.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-16\"><em>Id. </em>(This passage stands as an alternative rationale for the holding and is not dictum, as the majority asserts, <em>supra </em>n.17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b772-17\"><em>See also Moore v. United States, </em>429 U.S. 20, 97 S.Ct. 29, 50 L.Ed.2d 25 (1976) (per curiam). The defendant had been convicted of possession with intent to distribute heroin. The evidence showed that when the police entered the apartment identified by an informant, they found Moore and a woman in close proximity to bags of heroin and narcotics paraphernalia lying on and under a coffee table. The Supreme Court vacated the conviction because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>the trial judge had relied on inadmissible hearsay evidence to find that Moore was a tenant of the apartment at the time of the seizure. The Court also remanded to the Fifth Circuit to determine whether the error was harmless, i.e., \u201cwhether or not the evidence of proximity alone, when viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, could suffice to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Moore was in possession of the heroin\u201d. At 22, 97 S.Ct. at 30. The Court stated that the answer to this question \u201cwas far from clear,\u201d stressing that \u201cthe only competent evidence of Moore\u2019s possession of the narcotics was his proximity to them in an apartment in which another person was also present and of which he was not shown to be the tenant or even a regular resident\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">In the present case, the jury could have found that Davis was a tenant of the apartment. <em>See </em>note 13 <em>supra. </em>Yet <em>Moore\u2019s </em>more general message \u2014 that we should be cautious in inferring possession from the fact that one is found near drugs \u2014 remains relevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b773-9\">. On occasion courts have upheld the inference of participation from mere presence at an illegal operation. <em>United States v. Gainey, </em>380 U.S. 63, 85 S.Ct. 754, 13 L.Ed.2d 658 (1965) (moonshine still); <em>Beard v. United States, </em>65 U.S.App.D.C. 231, 82 F.2d 837, <em>cert. denied, </em>298 U.S. 655, 56 S.Ct. 675, 80 L.Ed. 1382 (1936) (gambling parlor). However, those cases rest on the fact that the illegal activity was in active operation in the defendant\u2019s presence. Since such illegal activities are usually carried out clandestinely, <em>see United States v. Gainey, </em>380 U.S. at 67-8, 85 S.Ct. 754, anyone allowed to witness them is probably a trusted confederate or customer. Moreover, the <em>Gainey </em>court, while upholding the statutory presumption against due process attack, pointedly questioned whether the inference from mere presence would be sufficient to support a conviction. 380 U.S. at 68, 85 S.Ct. 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">There was no evidence here that the defendant was present while narcotics were openly being packaged for sale. <em>Cf. United States v. Moore, </em>158 U.S.App.D.C. 375, 442, 486 F.2d 1139, 1206 (en banc) (MacKinnon, J., concurring), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 980, 94 S.Ct. 298, 38 L.Ed.2d 224 (1973); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>461 U.S. 1026, 1036 (3rd Cir. 1972). On the contrary, the quantities of narcotics <em>on which the possession with intent to distribute counts are based </em>were hidden in the closet and refrigerator. (The majority repeatedly glosses over this fact, treating all the drugs as if they were equally in plain view. <em>See, e.g., </em>majority op., -,---:-, - of 183 U.S.App.D.C., 688, 689-690, 692 of 562 F.2d.) The so-called \u201cparaphernalia\u201d consisted of apparently innocent ordinary kitchen objects such as plastic bags and food scales. While their physical presence was \u201cobvious,\u201d their use for an illegal purpose was not. I do not contend that they were not in fact used for packaging marijuana, but only that Davis cannot be presumed necessarily to have known of their illicit use or to have so used them himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-16\">The District once had a statute making it a crime to be present in an establishment where narcotics drugs are sold with knowledge thereof unless \u201c[one] gives a good account of his presence\u201d. 22 D.C.Code 1515(a) (1973). That statute was declared unconstitutional in <em>Holly v. United States, </em>150 U.S.App.D.C. 287, 464 F.2d 796 (1972). However, it is unlikely that Congress would have felt the need for such a statute in the first place if, as the majority apparently believes, someone present at a \u201clarge scale narcotics operation\u201d was already guilty of the more serious offense of possession with intent to distribute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"Aqd\">. The majority also appears to rely on the fact that the baggies of marijuana hidden in the living-room closet were a large quantity. Majority op., -, - of 183 U.S.App.D.C., 684, 685 of 562 F.2d. However, the witness who testified for the government was only willing to say that it was more than <em>one </em>person would have for his own use, not more than three might. Tr. 347. This was no slip of the tongue. Immediately before, the expert testified the quantity of phencyclidine was more than one person might have for his own use. Tr. 346. When the prosecution followed up by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>asking if <em>three </em>people might have that quantity for their own use, the expert admitted they might. Tr. 346. As a result, the trial court dismissed the counts relating to possession of phencyclidine with intent to sell. Tr. 498-500.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">The trial judge did not dismiss the marijuana counts relating to possession with intent to distribute even though the testimony was identical to that he had found insufficient regarding phencyclidine because he incorrectly remembered the expert testimony. His recollection was that the expert had said the marijuana was more than three people would have for their own use. Tr. 508. To compound the mistake, the prosecutor\u2019s closing twice misrepresented to the jury that the quantity of marijuana was more than <em>three </em>people would have for their own use. Tr. 747; 753.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b774-11\">. Tr. 616, 624. After his direct examination, Davis agreed that his \u201cplace of abode\u201d was his girlfriend\u2019s residence and that it was an \u201cextraordinary situation\u201d when he stayed at the Third Street apartment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b774-12\">. To avoid the impact of cases such as <em>United States v. Holland, supra </em>note 7, 144 U.S.App.D.C. 225, 445 F.2d 701, and <em>Moore v. United States, supra </em>note 16, 429 U.S. 20, 97 S.Ct. 29, 50 L.Ed.2d 25, which indicate that an occasional visitor is not presumed to be in constructive possession of contraband found in an apartment (even if it is in plain view), the majority states, \u201cwhereas in <em>Moore </em>[there was no admissible indicia of residence,] the fact finder in this case could find on the basis of competent testimony that appellant <em>lived </em>in the apartment.\u201d Majority op., n.14 (emphasis in original). <em>See also </em>majority op.,---of 183 U.S.App.D.C., 684 of 562 F.2d.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-18\">Of course, the precise question is not whether Davis \u201clived\u201d in the apartment, but the \u201cregularity with which [he] occupied the place\u201d. <em>United States v. Holland, </em>supra note 7, 144 U.S.App.D.C. at 227, 445 F.2d at 703. To establish constructive possession, the government must show, <em>inter alia, </em>that Davis spent enough time in the apartment to impute to him knowledge of the marijuana hidden in the closet and the LSD in the refrigerator. <em>See </em>text at notes 3^1 <em>supra. </em>If one reads the evidence to show that Davis slept in the apartment frequently enough to be presumed aware of the hidden marijuana and LSD, then there can be nothing suspicious about his paying rent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
