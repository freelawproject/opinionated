BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1021-18\">On February 2, 1977, a jury found Talmon Hegwood, Jr. guilty of bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2113(a). Hegwood contends on this appeal that the trial court erred in refusing to subpoena an ostensible alibi witness pursuant to Rule 17(b), F.R.Crim.P. and in denying his motions for a continuance. We find no merit in either contention and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-19\">So that the reader can grasp the limited scope of our holding today, it will be necessary to set forth the facts in some detail.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-20\">\n<em>I. Hedging By Hegwood:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-21\">\n<em>Round I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-22\">The First National Bank of Atlanta was robbed on August 8, 1975. Following the indictment of Hegwood for this offense, the case was assigned to Judge Freeman who appointed counsel for the defendant. Trial was subsequently set for November 29, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-23\">During the pre-trial proceedings, the government, pursuant to Rule 12.1, F.R. Crim.P., demanded that Hegwood give notice of any alibi defense he intended to use. R. at 533. This demand was never answered. During this same period, appellant moved to dismiss his court-appointed counsel, requesting permission to act pro se. The defendant was informed that if he was dissatisfied with his present attorney, legal assistance was available to him from the Federal Defender Program. R. at 534-36. Despite this, Hegwood insisted on representing himself and his motion was granted. R. at 534-36, 542, 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-24\">On November 26, 1976, three days before the trial, Hegwood requested in writing that subpoenas pursuant to Rule 17(b), F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>Crim.P. be issued to Bennett Hegwood of Chicago and to Mrs. Mildred Kelley, Director of Records, Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi. As we point out shortly, the Kelley subpoena was sought to establish an alibi. The subpoenas were issued that same day. R. at 556-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">During the first trial, the defendant attempted to establish that on the date of the robbery, August 8, 1975, he had taken a final examination in a course taught by Professor Thompson at Jackson State University in Jackson, Mississippi. Mrs. Mildred Kelley produced the pertinent school records and testified that Hegwood had been enrolled in Professor Thompson\u2019s course that summer, receiving a grade of \u201cIncomplete\u201d. The class roll book was introduced in evidence but it did not disclose specific dates of absence or presence of any of the students, the exact date on which the final exam was given, or whether Hegwood in fact took the final. R. at 396-401. Pressed on cross-examination, Mrs. Kelley stated that there was no way that she could testify that Hegwood was in class on August 8. R. at 401. Mrs. Kelley further testified that an \u201cIncomplete\u201d would be given if a student failed to take the final examination or to complete class assignments. R. at 400. Professor Thompson was never subpoenaed to testify during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">After the jury was unable to agree on a verdict, Judge Freeman entered an order dated December 3, 1976 declaring a mistrial. R. at 562. Judge Freeman recused himself from presiding on the retrial and the case was assigned to Judge Henderson on December 23, 1976. R. at 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">\n<em>Round II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">The new trial was set for January 31, 1977. Appellant was informed of the new date a little more than six weeks in advance of trial. R. at 29. As before, Hegwood let the Court know that he wished to act pro se. R. at 4. On January 6,1977, Hegwood, through Andrew H. Marshall of the Federal Defender Program, requested that three subpoenas be issued pursuant to Rule 17(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Magistrate Chancey granted this request that same day. R. at 575-76. On January 19,1977, another Rule 17(b) subpoena application was filed; this too was granted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> No application was ever made during this period to subpoena Dr. Thompson at government expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-10\">On the day the trial was to begin, Monday, January 31, 1977, Judge Henderson met in chambers with Hegwood, Mr. Marshall and Mr. Froelich, Assistant U.S. Attorney. During this conference, Judge Henderson first addressed the problem of Hegwood\u2019s desire to act pro se. After being informed that the defendant wished to represent himself despite the availability of court-appointed counsel, Judge Henderson explained that Mr. Marshall of the Federal Defender Program was to sit at the counsel table and assist in the defense if needed. R. at 4-6. The Judge then outlined the trial procedure for the defendant and asked Hegwood, \u201cDo you have any witnesses besides yourself?\u201d Hegwood replied, \u201cNo.\u201d R. at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-11\">Following talk of other matters, Hegwood for the first time raised the question of calling \u201canother witness.\u201d In response to the defendant\u2019s enumeration of problems encountered in obtaining his witnesses, the Judge pointed out that Hegwood had known the ease was going to trial for some time. Hegwood then announced, \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d R. at 19. When Marshall raised the matter of the prior subpoenas and his attempts to contact witnesses for the defense, the Court asked Mr. Froelich to leave the room. R. at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-12\">Discussion then focused on the witnesses already subpoenaed. Of primary relevance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>here was Mrs. Mildred Kelley who had testified at the first trial. Hegwood stated that if the government would stipulate to the authenticity of the school records which had been admitted during the first trial, it would be unnecessary to have Mrs. Kelley appear. R. at 22. Marshall pointed out that the government had refused to so stipulate and went on to report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-5\">\n<em>Friday afternoon Mr. Hegwood told me that he was not interested in those records and that I was to contact the custodian of records at Jackson State and excuse her from the subpoena.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-6\">I explained to Mr. Hegwood that without a witness, since I couldn\u2019t get a Government stipulation as to the authenticity of the records, that it wouldn\u2019t be possible for him to get those records in evidence. Nevertheless, he indicated to me to go ahead and excuse that witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">R. at 23 (emphasis added). See note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">Thereafter, Hegwood \u2014 for the first time \u2014 explained that he had requested Mr. Marshall to contact Dr. Thompson. R. at 24-25. Marshall then detailed his unsuccessful efforts to reach the professor by telephone and the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-9\">[MR. MARSHALL:] . . . <em>So, I cannot state to the Court what Dr. Thompson would testify to, </em>because I have been unable, despite diligent efforts on my part, to contact him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-11\">And I have told Mr. Hegwood, and this is my feeling about it, that if he \u2014 and, of course, subject to whatever the Court\u2019s decision on the matter <em>is </em>\u2014 that <em>he should not announce ready if he wants me to continue to try to get ahold of Dr. Thompson to see what he would testify to. . .</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-12\">THE COURT: What would Dr. Thompson testify to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-14\">MR. HEGWOOD: Your Honor, <em>I feel as if Dr. Thompson could shed some light as to the fact that I was indeed in his class on the date of the alleged bank robbery, </em>and I think, too, that if a subpoena had been issued and had been forwarded to Jackson State University, Dr. Thompson would have honored that subpoena. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-16\">THE COURT: Why are all these problems coming up now? How long has it been since this case has been on the calendar, Mr. Clerk?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-17\">THE CLERK: Judge, I don\u2019t have that record here, but I can find out. It\u2019s been some time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-18\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-19\">MR. HEGWOOD: <em>It\u2019s been a little more than six weeks.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-20\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-21\">THE CLERK: Judge, I anticipated something like this might come up, and last Thursday I called the Magistrate\u2019s office to see if there were any subpoenas that had been issued that the Clerk\u2019s office should look into, and I was informed by Judge Chancey\u2019s secretary that all the subpoenas had been taken care of, everything that had been requested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-22\">MR. MARSHALL: Again, I went\u2014 Judge Chancey told me he would not authorize the issuance of the subpoena to anybody unless I, as an officer of the court, could state to the Court what we would expect to prove by their testimony, and, as I have already told the Court\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-23\">THE COURT: Can you, Mr. Marshall, tell me now that Dr. * * * [Thompson] will testify that the defendant was in his class on the day of this alleged robbery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-24\">MR. MARSHALL: <em>I cannot state that to the Court. I do not know what Dr. Thompson could testify to.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-25\">MR. HEGWOOD: Your Honor, I have his roll book here. It was entered into evidence at the last trial. I could show it to Your Honor, and Your Honor could make a judgment from there and see how important or see whether or not Your Honor feels\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>THE COURT: If it\u2019s an alibi, it\u2019s very important.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-4\">MR. MARSHALL: To the best of my knowledge, Dr. Thompson was not subpoenaed to the first trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">R. at 28-30 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">Further discussion concerning Hegwood\u2019s delay in bringing the Thompson matter to the Court\u2019s attention prompted this attempted resolution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-7\">MR. HEGWOOD: Your Honor, I feel as if it\u2019s not necessary to subpoena this witness if the Government attorney will stipulate the authenticity [of the school records].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-8\">THE COURT: On your way out you can ask Mr. Froelich if he will or not. That\u2019s between you and him. Or you can ask Mr. Marshall to perform that service for you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-26\">MR. MARSHALL: As I told the Court, I did make that offer to Mr. Froelich, and he indicated he would not stipulate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-27\">THE COURT: Let him make it to him in person and see if he will agree to it. R. at 32-33.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1024-28\">Despite counsel\u2019s advice set forth above, Hegwood announced in open court before the jury that the defense was ready.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> R. at 36. The government then proceeded with its case-in-ehief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-29\">On February 1, the government rested. R. at 316. Hegwood then sought to introduce into evidence the school records admitted during the first trial. He stated, however, that if the government refused to stipulate to their introduction, \u201cthe defense moves for a continuance in order to have that person who can attest to these records come and give testimony.\u201d R. at 319. After the Court and the parties discussed precisely what the school Records reflected,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>the defendant again moved for a continuance. R. at 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">Subsequently, the Court had one more crucial exchange with Mr. Marshall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-6\">THE COURT: I am not going to make you contact the custodian of records. You did what you thought \u2014 you followed instructions last Friday. If he wants to contact them, he can do so. If you want to help him get those persons by phone tonight, you may do so, and I would ask that you try to help him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-7\">MR. MARSHALL: Yes, sir, I will be happy to do that. But, if I can get them here, then you are saying that you will pay them their witness fee, whatever?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-8\">THE COURT: I will have the Clerk issue a subpoena, and, <em>... if you will give me an affidavit that their testimony is essential to the trial of the ease.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-9\">MR. MARSHALL: <em>I cannot give Your Honor that kind of affidavit.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-10\">THE COURT: If the defendant will give me an affidavit to that effect, I will authorize the expenditure of their expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1025-11\">R. at 332-33 (emphasis added). The record is conspicuously barren of any responsive representation ever having been made by Hegwood or his counsel that Thompson would give testimony that was essential or even helpful to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-12\">In an effort to accommodate the defendant\u2019s demands, the Court agreed to recess on Tuesday so that the defense could attempt to arrange for Dr. Thompson\u2019s voluntary appearance the next day. R. at 325-37. However, Marshall reported on Wednesday that he had been unable to reach the professor by phone. R. at 341-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-13\">Nonetheless, Hegwood announced that he was ready to go forward. R. at 343. The defendant recalled a government witness and twice more moved for a continuance. R. at 351, 355. Hegwood then recalled two other government witnesses. During the examination of the second, Hegwood once again moved for a continuance, this time in order to take the jury to the bank. R. at 369. After the completion of the testimony of these witnesses, Hegwood moved for a continuance until 12:00 to see whether any of his witnesses had arrived. R. at 373. He then requested that the roll book be introduced in evidence, which prompted this colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-16\">MR. HEGWOOD: I canceled the subpoena on the grounds that the director of records could not testify to the instructor\u2019s roll book.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-17\">THE COURT: Well, the point is they are not under subpoena any more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-18\">MR. HEGWOOD: I would like to introduce into evidence the instructor\u2019s roll book from Jackson State University.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-19\">THE COURT: We have been through that. I have already ruled on that, haven\u2019t I, Mr. Hegwood?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-20\">MR. HEGWOOD: Judge, I\u2019m asking you for a continuance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-21\">THE COURT: I ruled on that yesterday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-22\">MR. HEGWOOD: In the event these people may show up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-23\">THE COURT: I ruled on that yesterday afternoon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-24\">MR. HEGWOOD: The defense is not going to rest, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-25\">THE COURT: Call your next witness, then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-26\">MR. HEGWOOD: Well, my witnesses are not here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-27\">THE COURT: Well, do you have any other witnesses to call who are here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-28\">MR. HEGWOOD: No, I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-29\">THE COURT: Very well, do you have any other evidence to offer, then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-30\">MR. HEGWOOD: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-31\">THE COURT: All right, offer it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-32\">MR. HEGWOOD: The defendant offers into evidence the roll book of Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>Julian Thompson, professor at Jackson State University, which will show that the defendant\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-4\">MR. FROELICH: Excuse me, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-5\">THE COURT: Just a minute. I am not going to go into that. I have looked at the exhibit. It doesn\u2019t show what you say it shows. I have ruled on it yesterday afternoon, and I declined to admit it into evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-6\">MR. HEGWOOD: Give it to the jury. Let them decide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-7\">THE COURT: That\u2019s not a matter for the jury to decide. It is for the Court to decide what is relevant evidence and what is admissible evidence and what is not admissible evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-8\">MR. HEGWOOD: The defense moves for a continuance to go to the hospital to have an operation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1026-9\">R. at 375-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-10\">After considerable discussion and agreement by the government, Judge Henderson ordered that the untranscribed notes of Mrs. Kelley\u2019s testimony at the first trial be read before the jury. R. at 410-21. The school records were also allowed in evidence. R. at 422. With that, the defendant rested. The jury returned a verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-11\">\n<em>II. Rule 17(b)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-12\">Rule 17(b), F.R.Crim.P. reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-13\">(b) Defendants Unable to Pay. The court shall order at any time that a subpoena be issued for service on a named witness upon an <em>ex parte </em>application of a defendant upon a satisfactory showing that the defendant is financially unable to pay the fees of the witness and that the presence of the witness is necessary to an adequate defense. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1026-14\">A motion made pursuant to this rule must, as a threshold matter, state facts that show the relevancy and the necessity of the requested witness\u2019 testimony. <em>United States v. Abshire, </em>5 Cir. 1972, 471 F.2d 116, 119; <em>United States v. Romano, </em>5 Cir., 1973, 482 F.2d 1183, 1195, <em>cert. denied, </em>1974, 414 U.S. 1129, 94 S.Ct. 866, 38 L.Ed.2d 753. This requirement makes total sense in view of the plain language of the rule and the fact that Rule 17 is clearly not a discovery device. <em>See United States v. Schembari, </em>4 Cir., 1973, 484 F.2d 931, 936.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-17\">The decision to grant or deny a Rule 17(b) motion is vested in the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>E. g., United States v. Hathcock, </em>5 Cir., 1971, 441 F.2d 197, 199. In making its decision, the court may consider \u2014 in addition to necessity and relevance \u2014 materiality, competency and the timeliness of the request. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moudy, </em>5 Cir., 1972, 462 F.2d 694, 698. <em>Moudy </em>teaches that the trial court is justified in preventing abuse of process when a defendant seeks a subpoena merely to delay the proceedings. <em>Moudy </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-18\">Last minute tactics designed to bring the trial process to a halt are not to be countenanced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1026-19\"><em>Id. </em>at 698. <em>See also Hathcock, supra, </em>441 F.2d at 200; <em>United States v. Collins, </em>7 Cir., 1970, 435 F.2d 698, <em>cert. denied, </em>1971, 401 U.S. 957, 91 S.Ct. 983, 28 L.Ed.2d 241; <em>cf. United States v. Nichols, </em>9 Cir., 1976, 534 F.2d 202; <em>United States v. Stoker, </em>10 Cir., 1975, 522 F.2d 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-20\">Equally well established in this Circuit is the principle that the trial court\u2019s discretion to decide whether to issue a Rule 17(b) subpoena is not absolute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-21\">The breadth of the discretion to be exercised by the trial court under Rule 17(b) is considerably narrowed by two constitutional rights of the defendant: (1) the Sixth Amendment right \u201cto have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor\u201d; and (2) the Fifth Amendment right to protection against unreasonable discrimination which means that, as between those financially able and those financially unable to pay the fees of the witness, there should be no more discrimination than is necessary to protect against abuse of process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1027-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number><em>Welsh v. United States, </em>5 Cir., 1968, 404 F.2d 414, 417 (footnotes deleted). <em>Welsh </em>further establishes that once the defendant asserts facts which, if true, would be relevant to any issue, the motion for a subpoena <em>must </em>be granted unless the assertions are facially incredible or unless the government can show that they are untrue or that the request is frivolous. <em>Welsh, supra; United States v. Hathcock, supra, </em>441 F.2d at 199. Such facts having been stated, the burden of showing lack of truth, frivolousness or abuse of process falls on the government. <em>Id. </em>at 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">Applying these principles to the case before us in light of the facts set forth in Part I, we are firmly convinced that Judge Henderson did not abuse the discretion reposed in him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">First, by his own admission, Hegwood knew for six weeks prior to January 31 that the trial date had been set. Second, it is clear that he knew how to request Rule 17(b) subpoenas when he really desired to do so. Third, Thompson resided in Mississippi and the trial was proceeding in Atlanta. Location of the witness and the time problems involved in summoning him are very practical considerations for a trial judge to assess.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">Fourth, and most important, neither Hegwood nor his counsel ever made any representation to the Court that Professor Thompson\u2019s testimony would have been helpful, much less that it was necessary to an adequate defense. Indeed, they could not have done so, since neither Hegwood nor Marshall ever spoke with him. The strongest \u2014 and we use that adjective charitably \u2014 representation made by appellant was, \u201cI feel as if Dr. Thompson could shed some light as to the fact that I was indeed in his class on the date of the alleged bank robbery . . ..\u201d R. at 28. Any light that Thompson could have shed dims almost to the point of blackout in view of the fact that Thompson was not subpoenaed for the first trial and no formal request for his presence was made until the Eleventh Hour at the second, even though the defense of alibi was the critical one at both trials. Under these circumstances, the Trial Judge was entitled to conclude that Hegwood\u2019s hollow assertions about Thompson were nothing more than desperation tactics aimed at postponing the stroke of the clock at Midnight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-10\">Concededly, Judge Henderson acknowledged that an alibi witness\u2019s testimony would be relevant and material. However, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s holding in similar circumstances is precisely on point here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1027-11\">The appellant\u2019s allegations ... are . lacking in particular facts concerning the claimed alibi; they are the broadest of generalities and do not constitute a sufficient averment of facts to satisfy the requirements of Rule 17(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkJn\"><em>United States v. Rigdon, </em>6 Cir., 1972, 459 F.2d 379, 380, <em>cert. denied, </em>1973, 409 U.S. 1116, 93 S.Ct. 917, 34 L.Ed.2d 700. <em>See also United States v. Conder, </em>6 Cir., 1970, 423 F.2d 904, 909, <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 958, 91 S.Ct. 357, 27 L.Ed.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-12\">The appellant argues that the <em>Welsh </em>rule made it incumbent upon the government to show that the evidence sought was unbelievable, untrue or that the request was frivolous. Brief of Appellant at 17. This argument, however, turns Rule 17(b) on its head. Mr. Marshall on at least three occasions unequivocally stated that he did not know what testimony Thompson could give, and Hegwood never articulated one fact which would even come close to meeting the threshold necessity requirement. The idea that a defendant, on the day of trial, has to do no more than offer \u201ca feeling\u201d that a witness could \u201cshed some light\u201d on a possible alibi, which offer would then trigger a governmental burden to counter such an allegation, is patently absurd.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-13\">We do not mean to undercut in any manner <em>Welsh\u2019s </em>liberal construction of Rule 17(b). Indeed, we reaffirm the wisdom of the principles announced in <em>Welsh.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-14\">However, we hold that under the extreme, aggravating circumstances of this case, detailed at length in Part I, Judge Henderson properly exercised his discretion in refusing to subpoena Thompson. The appellant\u2019s vacillation with regard to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>Kelley testimony and the school records, and the Court\u2019s generous response to that vacillation, is but one of many examples of the fairness afforded Hegwood in connection with his tardy and feeble attempts to establish an alibi. Moreover, the entire record before us overwhelmingly establishes the District Judge\u2019s unending patience and unfaltering efforts to give this appellant a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">\n<em>III. Continuance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">The denial of a motion for a continuance is similarly a matter within the discretion of the trial judge. <em>E. g., Welsh, supra; Abshire, supra. </em>For reasons apparent from what we have already stated, Judge Henderson\u2019s denial of Hegwood\u2019s motion^) did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1021-25\">. The only facts related are those pertinent to the two issues raised on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">. The witnesses to be subpoenaed were (i) Mrs. Mildred Kelley, Director of Records, Jackson State University; (ii) Custodian of Records, South Chicago Hospital, Chicago; and (iii) Dr. Bemadine Pietrasek, DePaul University, Chicago.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1022-13\">. The witness subpoenaed pursuant to this request was Marvin Cooper of Jackson, Mississippi. R. at 577-79.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1024-9\">. After the jury was selected, this additional colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-10\">THE COURT: Gentlemen, do you have your witnesses here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-11\">MR. FROELICH: Your Honor, I don\u2019t have all of them, but I have a group of them out in the hall. I have about four or five.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-12\">THE COURT: How about you, Mr. Hegwood?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-13\">MR. HEGWOOD: Defense is ready, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1024-14\">R. at 39.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1024-15\">. MR. HEGWOOD: Your Honor, the records depict that I was in a classroom on the date in question, on the date of the alleged\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-16\">THE COURT: Where does it say that? Where does it show that?</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-17\">MR. HEGWOOD: Let me show it to you, Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-18\">THE COURT: If I were you, I would have gotten the professor here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-19\">MR. HEGWOOD: That\u2019s what I wanted to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-20\">THE COURT: You have had six weeks to do it, and you haven\u2019t done it. It shows that you were enrolled\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-21\">MR. HEGWOOD: Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-22\">THE COURT: \u2014 in a class on one Thursday in Black History 362. It doesn\u2019t show\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-23\">MR. HEGWOOD: The dates \u2014 turn a couple more pages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-24\">THE COURT: Here\u2019s a catalog.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-25\">MR. HEGWOOD: It\u2019s depicted in the catalog what date the class started and what date it ended and what date the final examination was, and the grade I received was an incomplete, and I could not have received an incomplete had I not taken the final examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-30\">THE COURT: I thought you said your grade was \u201cincomplete\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-31\">MR. HEGWOOD: The grade was \u201cincomplete\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-32\">THE COURT: Evidently, if you had an incomplete, you must not have taken the final exam.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-33\">MR. HEGWOOD: No. I took the final examination. I did not take: the i midterm</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-34\">THE COURT: Well, this document itself does not reveal that you were in class at Jackson State University, State College, on August the 8th, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-35\">MR. HEGWOOD: Judge, I didn\u2019t show you this.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-36\">THE COURT: It simply does not reflect that. I don\u2019t care what the catalog says.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-37\">MR. HEGWOOD: See, here\u2019s the date for the last final examination. All right, Friday, August 9th. Now, if that instructor had been here, that instructor could have even brought my examination here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-38\">THE COURT: Well, you just said you didn\u2019t take the examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-39\">MR. HEGWOOD: I didn\u2019t take the midterm, Your Honor. <em>I took the final examination, and it was given on August 9th.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-40\">THE COURT: If you want to get on the stand and testify to that, you may do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-41\">THE COURT: . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-42\">Just looking at that document alone, it would not be admissible, because it has no probative value, and you had the opportunity to subpoena these witnesses, and in one instance you canceled the subpoena, and in the other instance you failed to subpoena the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>As I have said, I can\u2019t now continue the case for you to get those witnesses in, so I will have to decline to admit that particular record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-33\">R. at 321-24 (emphasis added). In connection with Hegwood\u2019s statement in italics above, it is noteworthy that the robbery occurred on August 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1026-15\">.
