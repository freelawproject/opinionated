Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 415:18-a, 419:5-a and 420:5-a (1976). Chapter 57 requires the \u201cissuers\u201d of group health insurance policies to provide coverage for the treatment of mental illnesses and emotional disorders.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ERISA does not require this. Administrators of various health and welfare funds which provide benefits chiefly through the purchase of group health insurance,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> brought this action against Francis E. Whaland, Commissioner of Insurance for the State of New Hampshire, seeking a declaration that Chapter 57 is unconstitutional and an in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>junction restraining its enforcement. The fund administrators\u2019 principal contention is that ERISA preempts the provisions of Chapter 57, to the extent that that chapter applies to employee benefit plans.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Alternatively, they assert that the New Hampshire statutory scheme is an undue burden on interstate commerce and violates the due process and equal protection clauses of the United States Constitution. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. After an evidentiary hearing relating primarily to the issue of irreparable harm, the district court, the Honorable Hugh H. Bownes presiding, held that ERISA did not preempt state regulation of group insurance policies, and that Chapter 57 did not contravene any provision of the Constitution. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">\n<em>ERISA.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">As the preamble to the Act indicates,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ERISA is the result of a congressional en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>deavor to curb the funding and disclosure abuses of employee pension and welfare benefit plans by establishing minimum federal standards. Title I of ERISA, composed of five main subparts, provides the substantive regulatory provisions governing two basic types of employee benefit plans. Those two types are <em>pension </em>plans, which provide for retirement or deferred income,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and <em>welfare </em>benefit plans, which provide medical, health, sickness, accident, and other non-pension benefits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Part one of Title 1<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> deals with the reporting and disclosure requirements for both types of plans. The basic purposes of these requirements are to inform employees of their rights, and to assist the Secretary of Labor in determining the financial soundness of the plan. <em>See </em>Brummond, <em>Federal Preemption of State Insurance Regulation Under ERISA, </em>62 Iowa L.Rev. 57, 61-62 (1976). Thus, the fund administrators are required to provide each participant and each beneficiary with a summary description of their plan drafted in language understandable by the average plan participant <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and to make available a copy of the plan\u2019s annual report.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A copy of the information provided to participants and beneficiaries, as well as other data, must be furnished to the Secretary of Labor.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Parts two<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and three<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of Title I are limited in that they apply only to pension benefit plans. Part two creates minimum vesting standards and participation requirements, while part three provides funding requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Part four<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> of the Title sets forth the fiduciary standards for the management of employee pension and welfare benefit plans. These standards provide in part that the plan be in writing,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the assets be held in trust<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> exclusively for the benefit of employees,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and that the plan investments be diversified.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> A \u201cprudent man\u201d standard is established for fund administrators, and prohibited financial transactions are listed.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Finally, part five<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> contains the administrative and enforcement provisions which apply to both employee pension plans and welfare benefit plans. It creates broad criminal and civil penalties<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and sets forth general guidelines governing claims procedures.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Part five also gives the Secretary of Labor broad investigative powers<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and authority to promulgate regulations.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">\n<em>The \u201cFunds\u201d.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">The funds administered by plaintiffs are employee welfare benefit plans within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>meaning of \u00a7 3 of ERISA.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> All of the funds, with the exception of New Hampshire Employer\u2019s Benefit Trust, are \u201cTaftHartley Trusts\u201d in that they are also regulated by \u00a7 302 of the Labor Management Relations Act.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Also with the exception of New Hampshire Employer\u2019s Benefit Trust, which is voluntarily operated by employees, the funds are the products of collective bargaining agreements that require employers to contribute at a specified level. While the level of contributions is specified by the collective bargaining agreements, benefits are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Each year the fund administrators meet with local unions to determine the types of coverage desired by the members. The fund administrators must obtain, at the least possible cost, the coverage chosen. To fulfill this obligation the fund administrators, with the aid of insurance consultants, put together packages upon which they request sealed bids from insurance companies. Although the funds are self-insurers on a few benefits, approximately 90 per cent of the benefits are provided through group insurance policies. However, for all practical purposes, under the group insurance policies the funds are self-insurers who retain the insurance companies to provide the administrative service of processing claims.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Because the premiums are experience rated the amount of claims for the year is projected; if the actual amount of claims is higher than the projection, the premium is adjusted upward; if the actual amount of claims is lower than the projection, the premium is adjusted downward. So in the long run, the funds reimburse the insurance company for all claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">A. <em>The Preemption Issue.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">The preemption issue is raised by \u00a7 514 of ERISA<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> which provides that all state laws that \u201crelate to\u201d employee benefit plans are superseded.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> This sweeping language is modified by a saving clause which reaffirms the authority of the states to regulate insurance.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> However, the saving clause is further limited in that no plan will be \u201cdeemed\u201d to be an insurance company, insurer or engaged in the business of insurance for the purpose of any state insurance law.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">Plaintiffs contend that \u00a7 514 preempts any <em>direct or indirect </em>regulation of employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>ee benefit plans by the state.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> They urge that Chapter <em>57 </em>clearly \u201crelates\u201d to employee benefit plans and therefore the provisions of ERISA \u201csupersede\u201d Chapter <em>57 </em>as it applies to them. On the other hand the Commissioner urges that no direct conflict between ERISA and Chapter <em>57 </em>exists, and that the saving clause specifically preserves the efficacy of state regulation of insurance. The Commissioner finds support for his position in the McCarran-Ferguson Act<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> which reflects a congressional policy to allow the states to regulate the business of insurance.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">B. <em>The New Hampshire Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">In resolving the preemption issue, it is first necessary to determine the scope of the New Hampshire statute. Chapter 57 applies to \u201ceach insurer that issues or renews any policy of group or blanket accident or health insurance\u201d and \u201ccertificate holders of such insurance.\u201d The issue is whether employee welfare funds are insurers under the statute. In the event they are, we would have no difficulty finding explicit preemption by ERISA notwithstanding the saving clause.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">In determining the scope of Chapter 57 we are without the aid of a definitive New Hampshire state court interpretation. The state attorney general, without conceding its direct non-applicability to employee benefit plans, indicates that \u201cChapter 57 is not a disclosure law, and it does not purport to regulate benefit plans.\u201d The plaintiffs, on the other hand, assert that they are not \u201cself-insurers,\u201d despite the fact that their insurance premiums are experience rated. Without further clarification we find that Chapter 57 was codified as an insurance law and specifically relates to insurers who issue certificates of insurance. Under a group insurance policy, a plan, as such, is really the \u201cinsured\u201d and it does not issue certificates of insurance to its members. Under these circumstances we find there is no intention under Chapter 57 to directly regulate employee welfare plans as insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-13\">This resolution, however, does not end our analysis. Plaintiffs further contend that Chapter 57 impermissibly regulates employee benefit plans by indirectly regulating the content of the group insurance policies which the funds purchase, and that ERISA preempts any indirect state regulation of employee benefit plans. The State of New Hampshire responds that ERISA was not intended to preempt any state law unless that law directly conflicts with or duplicates the regulatory provisions of ERI-SA.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-14\">C. <em>Legislative History of \u00a7 514(a).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-15\">We turn first to the state\u2019s argument. New Hampshire contends that Congress\u2019 use of the word \u201csupersede\u201d in \u00a7 514(a) indicates an intention to avoid regulatory vacuums created by displacing state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>regulation only in areas not principally covered by ERISA.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> We disagree. The legislative history manifests that Congress intended to preempt all state laws that <em>relate </em>to employee benefit plans and not just state laws which purport to regulate an area expressly covered by ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">The original versions of ERISA, both in the House and Senate, limited the scope of preemption to areas expressly covered by the bill. The House version listed the specific areas of federal regulation; the Senate version preempted all state laws which were related to the \u201csubject matter\u201d regulated by the bill.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> However, during conference the language limiting preemption was replaced by the present sweeping preemption language. The conference committee report and the floor debates explain that the reason for the change was to avoid \u201cthe possibility of endless litigation over the validity of State action that might impinge on Federal regulation . . . and potentially conflicting State laws hastily contrived to deal with some particular aspect of private welfare or pension benefit plans not clearly connected to the Federal regulatory scheme.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Congress, therefore, clearly rejected a concept of preemption limited to conflicting or duplicate state law, in favor of applying the principle in its \u201cbroadest sense.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-14\">Thus, we agree with plaintiffs that Chapter 57 is a state law which indirectly relates to employee benefit plans and is subject to preemption. However, we cannot agree that preemption necessarily follows. Chapter 57 is also a state law regulating insurance and is expressly exempted from preemption by \u00a7 514(b)(2)(A).<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Any possible conflict between the state\u2019s regulation of insurance and the regulatory provisions of ERISA must be resolved by the application of the \u201cdeemer\u201d clause, \u00a7 514(b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-15\">D. <em>The \u201cDeemer\u201d Clause.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-16\">The deemer clause simply provides that a state may not deem an employee benefit plan to be an insurance company, insurer, or in the business of insurance for the purposes of its insurance laws. Consequently, a state may not regulate an employee benefit plan simply because the plan serves as self-insurer on all of its benefits. Thus, the deemer provision prevents a state from subjecting a plan, as a business of insurance, to the state\u2019s general insurance laws or enacting special legislation regulating plans as a \u201cunique variety of insurance.\u201d <em>Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Barnes, </em>425 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>F.Supp. 1294, 1300 (N.D.Cal.1977). However, on its face the deemer provision does not prohibit a state from indirectly affecting plans by regulating the contents of group insurance policies purchased by the plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">We are unable to accept plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the deemer provision forbids the states from indirectly affecting employee benefit plans by regulating group insurance. In order to accept plaintiffs\u2019 construction, we would have to construe \u00a7 514 without its saving clause pertaining to state regulation of insurance. This we cannot do; we must interpret the statute as written. Congress was fully aware of the functions and scope of employee benefit plans<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> and, nonetheless, exempted state laws regulating insurance from preemption. We also find that plaintiffs\u2019 suggested construction is not required by the definition of \u201cState\u201d as any state agency which \u201cpurports to regulate, directly or indirectly, the terms and conditions of employee benefit plans covered by this title.\u201d ERISA \u00a7 514(c)(2). Such a construction would completely emasculate the saving clause. It is our duty when interpreting an act of Congress to construe it in such a manner as to give effect to all its parts and to avoid a construction which would render a provision surplusage. <em>See, e.g., McDonald v. Thompson, </em>305 U.S. 263, 59 S.Ct. 176, 83 L.Ed. 164 (1938); <em>Wilderness Society v. Morton, </em>156 U.S.App.D.C. 121, 479 F.2d 842 (1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>411 U.S. 917, 93 S.Ct. 1550, 36 L.Ed.2d 309 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation would greatly diminish the state\u2019s primacy in regulating insurance. It would nullify all state insurance laws concerning group insurance when the group policy is issued to an employee benefit plan. We do not find, absent a clear statement of intent, that Congress meant to so restrict a state\u2019s authority to regulate insurance. <em>Cf. United States v. Bass, </em>404 U.S. 336, 350, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">Our interpretation of the deemer provision comports with the national policy of state primacy in the regulation of insurance announced by Congress in the McCarranFerguson Act<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Under that Act, the only congressional enactment which may \u201cinvalidate, impair, or supersede\u201d any state insurance law is an act which \u201cspecifically relates to the business of insurance . . .\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> This national policy is twice reaffirmed by ERISA in \u00a7 514: first with the saving clause, and again with subsection (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">We conclude that ERISA does not preempt application of state law to group insurance policies when such policies are purchased by employee benefit plans. The argument that the plans would be detrimentally affected and might face bankruptcy or extinction cannot change the plain meaning of ERISA. Assuming such detrimental consequences exist, we note that Congress fully intended to appraise the implementation of the Act and to provide remedial legislation where necessary.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> In any event such arguments are not best directed to the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">\n<em>Other Issues.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">We briefly review the appellants\u2019 remaining arguments. The fund administrators challenge the application of Chapter 67 to employee welfare funds claiming it to be preempted by the National Labor Relations Act and in contravention of the Constitution of the United States. We find no merit to these claims and, as did the district court, we dispose of them summarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Plaintiffs argue that Chapter 57, since it indirectly affects employee welfare funds, is preempted by general provisions of federal labor law. As we have indicated, Chapter 57 does not relate to employee benefit plans and is not intended to affect labor relations or disputes. The record demonstrates that benefits under any insurance plan are not part of the terms or conditions of collective bargaining agreements. Similarly, it has been held that state regulation of pension plans is not preempted by federal labor law. <em>White Motor Corp. v. Malone, </em>545 F.2d 599 (8th Cir. 1976). State regulations of group insurance policies purchased by employee benefit plans are peripheral to any federal labor law other than ERISA.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">Plaintiffs additionally assert that Chapter 57 is an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. This claim is partially refuted by the fact that Congress fully intended in passing ERISA to retain regulation of insurance within the sphere of the state. There is no proof of any undue burden on commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">In <em>State Board of Ins. v. Todd Shipyards Corp., </em>370 U.S. 451, 82 S.Ct. 1380, 8 L.Ed.2d 620 (1962), the Supreme Court held: \u201cThe power of Congress to grant protection to interstate commerce against state regulation or taxation [citations omitted], <em>or to withhold it </em>[citations omitted] is so complete that its ideas of policy should prevail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 456, 82 S.Ct. at 1384 (emphasis added and footnote omitted). The Court further noted that with the McCarran-Ferguson Act Congress \u201cprovided that the regulations and taxation of insurance should be left to the States, without restriction by reason of the Commerce Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452, 82 S.Ct. at 1381.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">Plaintiffs also challenge Chapter 57 on due process grounds. The district court found that New Hampshire law does not subject the fund administrators to any criminal penalty for noncompliance with Chapter 57. On this basis it determined that plaintiffs had no legal basis to attack the New Hampshire Act for vagueness. We agree. \u201cThe essential purpose of the \u2018void for vagueness\u2019 doctrine is to warn individuals of the criminal consequences of their conduct.\u201d <em>Jordan v. De George, </em>341 U.S. 223, 230, 71 S.Ct. 703, 707, 95 L.Ed. 886 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">With regard to plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection argument, the district court found that, since they were not insurance companies, the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the New Hampshire Act as being in violation of the equal protection clause of the Constitution. We are hesitant to exclude plaintiffs\u2019 challenge on a finding of lack of standing. As Judge Stevens (now Mr. Justice Stevens) observed in <em>CotovskyKaplan Physical Therapy Ass\u2019n, Ltd. v. United States, </em>507 F.2d 1363 (7th Cir. 1975): \u201cThe test is not whether these plaintiffs are regulated by the statute but whether the interests asserted by them arguably fall within the zone of interests so regulated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1366.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>However, we need not decide the standing issue. Even assuming standing, we summarily hold that plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the statute denies equal protection since it discriminatorily favors Blue Cross-Blue Shield, to be without merit. <em>See Travelers Ins. Co. v. Blue Cross, </em>481 F.2d 80, 86 (3d Cir. 1973).<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">\n<em>The judgment is affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b146-13\">. <em>Each insurer that issues or renews any policy </em>of group or blanket accident or health insurance providing benefits for medical or hospital expenses, shall provide to each group, or to the portion of each group comprised of certificate holders of such insurance who are residents of this state and whose principal place of employment is in this state, coverage for expenses arising from the treatment of mental illnesses and emotional disorders.

The importance of the preemption issue is highlighted by the participation of the ERISA Industry Committee (ERIC) and the State of Minnesota as amicus curiae. The State of Minnesota recently enacted a comprehensive health insurance law which requires certain minimum health-care benefits. See Minnesota Comprehensive Health Insurance Act, Minn. Stat.Ann. Ch. 62E (West Supp.1977). The State of Minnesota stresses the overall importance of the continued efficacy of state insurance laws, as recognized by \u00a7 514(b)(2)(B) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C \u00a7 1144(b)(2)(B), and as required by the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1011-15. ERIC, a nonprofit association of 80 major corporations who maintain group health plans covering nearly 7 million employees, joins the plaintiff administrators in urging that ERISA preempts state laws which directly or indirectly \u201crelate\u201d to employee welfare plans. Such a result is required, they believe, to avoid the substantial, adverse effects of concurrent federal and multiple state regulation of welfare benefit plans. The ERIC brief concludes with this comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">In the final analysis, the victims of a fragmented scheme of Federal and multi-state regulation of benefit plans are likely to be employees, themselves \u2014 the very persons intended to be benefited by plan regulation. Faced with mounting costs, unwieldy administration and vexatious litigation, at least some employers will undoubtedly terminate or curtail their employee welfare benefit plans; others, considering the adoption of such plans, will abandon the idea. Such a result would not only be directly contrary to the best interest of employees but also frustrate Congressional intent in adopting ERISA as a mechanism for encouraging the growth of employee benefit plans.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b147-7\">.
