Count I charged that the defendant used a deadly weapon to assault Victor Provost, a Bureau of Indian Affairs employee, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 and \u00a7 1114. Counts II and III charged that the defendant assaulted Duane Yellow Hawk and William Jumping Eagle, respectively, with a dangerous weapon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153 and South Dakota Compiled Laws \u00a7 22-18-11. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on Count I and not guilty on Counts II and III. The defendant has appealed his conviction, asserting that (1) the prosecution improperly used out of court statements of a government witness; (2) an illegal search led to discovery of the weapon in question; (3) the admission of exculpatory statements made by the defendant prior to the time he was given proper constitutional warnings constituted error; (4) the trial court wrongfully refused to allow further interrogation of prospective jurors on voir dire; and (5) the trial court erred in instructing the jury upon all elements of the offense in question. We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-12\">On February 8, 1976, at around 4:30 A.M. near Manderson, South Dakota, on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, a number of shots were fired at a Bureau of Indian Affairs patrol car in which Officer Victor Provost was seated. Two of the bullets struck the right rear panel of the vehicle. At the time of the incident, Provost was talking to two off-duty officers, Duane Yellow Hawk and William Jumping Eagle, in a private vehicle parked alongside the patrol car. None of the individuals was injured. All of them agreed that the shots appeared to have been rifle shots.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-13\">About two hours after the shooting, Agents Price and Wood of the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrived at the scene and began their investigation. The officers determined that the shots came from the northwest, and approximately 100 yards northwest of the vehicle two empty .30-cali-ber expended shell casings were discovered. The agents also noticed a number of footprints and car tracks near the area, most of which led in a northerly direction toward the Manderson housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-14\">As the officers began to conduct a general inspection of the Manderson housing area, Agent Price was informed of the discovery of three one-dollar bills near house number 129. A decision was made to interview the occupants of house 129, Henry and Agnes Black Elk. After approaching the house and identifying themselves, the officers were admitted by Henry Black Elk. They informed the Black Elks that they were looking for a man with a rifle. Henry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Black Elk told Agent Price that the defendant was in the back of the house. The two FBI agents then went toward the back of the house where they encountered Charles Long Soldier. Long Soldier, accompanied by Agent Wood, went into the living room and Agent Price asked Agnes Black Elk where the defendant hid the rifle. She pointed to a mattress in the back bedroom, and under the mattress Agent Price found a .30-caliber rifle. Price went to the living room and asked the defendant if he had ever seen the rifle and if he owned a rifle. The defendant answered no to both questions. He was then arrested, advised of his rights, and taken to the tribal jail in Pine Ridge. Agents Price and Wood remained at the Black Elk residence to interview members of the Black Elk family. Statements allegedly given to Agent Price by Henry Black Elk at this time and repeated in Black Elk\u2019s testimony before the grand jury are the basis of the defendant\u2019s first contention on appeal, that the trial judge erred in allowing improper impeachment of Black Elk as to these statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">We consider the two most meritorious contentions on appeal to be: (1) whether out of court statements allegedly made by the government witness Black Elk were properly admitted; and (2) whether the trial court erred in his instructions regarding the elements of the offense charged.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-3\">\n<em>Out of Court Statements of Black Elk.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">Henry Black Elk was called as a witness by the government. He testified as to the events which took place at his home in the early morning hours of February 8, 1976. He recalled with specific clarity that the defendant, whom he did not know at the time, had come to his home at 5:30 A.M. accompanied by Pat White Hawk, a man Black Elk knew. The defendant asked to come in and warm up. Black Elk stated that the defendant had a 30-30 rifle with him and was intoxicated. A short time later Black Elk observed police officers approaching his house. He testified that when they knocked on the door Long Soldier went into a back room with the rifle. Black Elk acknowledged that before the police officers came to the door he and the defendant had a conversation. On direct examination he stated that they talked about Indian history and \u201cstuff\u201d and drank wine. When asked whether Long Soldier had stated \u201cwhere he had been prior to coming to your house,\u201d Black Elk said: \u201cHe never mentioned anything; but I did talk with him on that Indian history and stuff.\u201d Later in his testimony Black Elk was again asked about this conversation and government counsel said: \u201c[Y]ou talked about some pow wows . . . did you have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>any other conversation at that time with Long Soldier?\u201d Black Elk responded: \u201cNo, we didn\u2019t.\u201d Thereafter government\u2019s counsel asked Black Elk:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-4\">Q. All right, Mr. Black Elk, did you tell Mr. Price the following \u2014 or in essence the following: That you sat at the table with Long Soldier\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-5\">MR. ARCHULETA: Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-6\">MR. BULLIS: \u2014 and that Long Soldier said in Lakota \u201cI used this gun to shoot into them pigs five times\u201d? Did you make that statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-7\">THE WITNESS: That I don\u2019t remember; but that agent sitting there promised distinctly that he will not take me to court, and I could prove it; but now he\u2019s got me in here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-8\">Q. Did you make that statement to Mr. Price at that time? Did you tell Mr. Price that that\u2019s what Mr. Long Soldier had told you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-9\">A. If I did tell him, I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-10\">Q. All right. Let me ask you: Did you state this to the FBI? Did you tell the FBI agent that Long Soldier showed you a shell from the gun which was a .30-caliber shell? Long Soldier boasted \u201cWe\u2019re AIMs. Nobody can get us. I\u2019m waiting for the goons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-11\">Did you tell that to Mr. Price?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-12\">A. That I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-13\">Thereafter the following questions were asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-14\">Q. (Mr. Bull\u00eds continuing) Mr. Black Elk, I\u2019m also going to ask you: Do you recall testifying before a Federal grand jury on March 18th, 1976?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-15\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-16\">Q. Your answer was \u201cYes\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-17\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-18\">Q. Do you remember your testimony at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-19\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-20\">Q. All right. Will you tell us what your testimony was at that grand jury proceedings?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-21\">A. My testimony was that Mr. Long Soldier came in my house with a gun and they apprehended him, and I told the grand jury \u2014 I said \u201cI\u2019m scared \u2014 I\u2019m scared of the AIMs and for my family. Under the Fifth Amendment I cannot testify any more,\u201d I said, \u201cbecause my family will be under what I mean harassment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-22\">Q. All right. Was there anything else that you testified to at that grand jury proceedings?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-23\">A. That I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-24\">Q. You don\u2019t remember?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-25\">A. Huh-uh. That\u2019s been a long time ago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-26\">Q. Well, Mr. Black Elk, I\u2019m going to ask you whether or not the following question was asked of you and whether you gave the following answer:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-27\">Question: \u201cLet me just go back to the time you talked with this man you didn\u2019t know and ask you in a conversation if he didn\u2019t say to you, T used this gun to shoot into them pigs five times?\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-28\">Answer: \u201cAt the time he was intoxicated, which he did say.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-29\">Did you give \u2014 was that question asked and that answer given?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-30\">A. That was asked and that\u2019s the way I answered. I was intoxicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-31\">Q. Are you saying, Mr. Black Elk, that you were intoxicated at the time you testified before the grand jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-32\">A. No. At the time they asked me questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-33\">Q. Well, I\u2019m asking you if you gave this answer before the grand jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-34\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-35\">Prior to the examination before the jury the defense had moved to suppress Black Elk\u2019s statements to Price and the grand jury on the ground that Black Elk\u2019s testimony was not inconsistent with his prior statements. The trial court ruled that Agent Price could not take the stand to rebut Black Elk, relying upon <em>United States v. Allsup, </em>485 F.2d 287 (8th Cir. 1973). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>court ruled, however, that Black Elk could be interrogated concerning his recollection of what Long Soldier had told him and that the grand jury testimony would be admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Rule 801(d)(1)(A) of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-6\">(d) Statements which are not hearsay. A statement is not hearsay if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-7\">(1) Prior statement by witness. The declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is (A) inconsistent with his testimony, and was given under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding, or in a deposition .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">It is well established that testimony before a grand jury constitutes \u201cother proceedings\u201d within the rule.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The question we face is whether proper foundation for the use of the grand jury statement was established by testimony inconsistent with it and harmful to the government\u2019s case. The record shows that Black Elk affirmatively denied that Long Soldier had made any statement to him concerning the events in question. We find Black Elk\u2019s denial that Long Soldier had admitted culpability inconsistent with his prior statements.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Cf. United States v. Rivera, </em>513 F.2d 519 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 948, 96 S.Ct. 367, 46 L.Ed.2d 284 (1975). There exists a substantive difference between a witness\u2019 failure to recall an incriminating statement made by the defendant and an affirmative denial that a defendant made an admission of guilt to him. There is more than a subtle distinction here. In the first instance there is nothing harmful in evidence and any attempt to \u201cimpeach\u201d becomes subterfuge. The out of court statement then assumes paramount importance as substantive evidence. <em>See United States v. Dunmore, </em>446 F.2d 1214, 1221 (8th Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 1041, 92 S.Ct. 126, 30 L.Ed.2d 734 (1972). However, where a witness affirmatively denies that the defendant made an admission of guilt to him, there is at least an exculpatory inference that something did not take place as alleged and impeachment should be allowed. It should also be noted that Black Elk\u2019s testimony as a whole was of vital importance to the government\u2019s case. We are not presented with a situation in which the government called this witness solely for the purpose of introducing otherwise inadmissible evidence under the guise of impeachment. <em>Cf. United States v. Morlang, </em>531 F.2d 183, 189 (4th Cir. 1975).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-13\">Under the circumstances, the use of Black Elk\u2019s alleged statement to Agent Price was likewise proper impeachment of Black Elk\u2019s trial testimony. Furthermore, the statement contained substantially the same information which Black Elk told to the grand jury, and therefore the effect was cumulative and could not be considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>reversible error. <em>See United States v. Mosley, </em>555 F.2d 191, 193 (8th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>551 F.2d 233, 235 (8th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">\n<em>Jury Instructions.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The defendant was charged under Count I of the indictment with using a deadly or dangerous weapon to willfully and forcibly assault Victor Provost in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When the trial court instructed the jury he read the indictment in full, but when he read the text of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111, he included only paragraph one of the statute. He then set out the essential elements of the crime as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">There are two essential elements required to be proved in order to establish the offense charged in Count One of the Indictment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-7\">First: the act or acts of forcibly assaulting, resisting, opposing, impeding, intimidating or interfering with an officer of the Indian Field Service of the United States while said officer was engaged in the performance of his official duties; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-8\">Second: the doing of such acts wilfully.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">The government concedes that the trial court erred in failing to include the use of a dangerous weapon as an essential element of the crime. However, we find no prejudicial error when the charge to the jury as a whole is considered.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">Before instructing the jury as to the essential elements of the crime under \u00a7 111 the trial court read the indictment containing each count. Count I was read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-15\">On or about the 8th day of February, 1976, near Manderson, in the District of South Dakota, Charles Long Soldier did use a deadly or dangerous weapon to willfully and unlawfully forcibly assault, resist, oppose, impede, intimidate and interfere with Victor Provost, an employee or officer of the Indian Field Service of the United States, to-wit: Bureau of Indian Affairs, while Victor Provost was engaged in and on account of the performance of his official duties, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 111 and Section 1114.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-16\">Immediately following the instruction containing the essential elements of Count I (which omitted the language concerning use of a firearm) the court instructed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-17\">The mere fact that the jury may find from the evidence in the case that the accused was in possession of a rifle at the time and place alleged in the Indictment does not constitute an offense against the laws of the United States. If you do not find beyond a reasonable doubt from the evidence in the case that the Defendant did wilfully and unlawfully forcibly assault, resist, oppose, impede, intimidate or interfere with Victor Provost, an employee or officer of the Indian Field Service of the United States, while Victor Provost was engaged in and on account of the performance of his official duties, <em>all as charged in Count One of the Indictment, . . </em>then it is immaterial that the Defendant may have had in his possession a rifle. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Further instruction to the jury was generally given and can be considered applicable to all three counts. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-4\">So, a person who has the apparent present ability to inflict bodily harm or injury upon another person, by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon, and wilfully as by intentionally flourishing or pointing a loaded pistol or gun at another person, may be <em>found guilty of forcibly assaulting </em>the other person with a deadly or dangerous weapon. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">There exists an additional factor here. In the present case, the undisputed evidence indicated that the assault against Officer Provost was committed by the use of a rifle. The defendant does not controvert these facts. His defense, which the jury rejected, was that he did not commit the assault which occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">In <em>United States v. Rouse, </em>452 F.2d 311 (5th Cir. 1971), the court upheld a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 despite the trial court\u2019s failure to include the use of a deadly weapon as an essential element of the crime. The court held that the charge, taken as a whole, had indicated that use of a deadly weapon was necessary in light of the fact that all evidence in the case dealt with an assault by the use of a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Under the circumstances presented here, we consider the omission of an essential element of the charge in the questioned instruction as harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b677-6\">. We elect to give plenary discussion to only two of the issues raised since we feel the record undeniably requires us to reject the other grounds raised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">(1) The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the rifle allegedly used in the assault on the basis of Long Soldier\u2019s lack of standing to challenge the search and seizure made in Black Elk\u2019s home. We assume defendant\u2019s standing arguendo but find the search was proper on the basis of the proven consent of third parties, Mr. and Mrs. Black Elk, whose home was searched. <em>Cf. United States v. Matlock, </em>415 U.S. 164, 94 S.Ct. 988, 39 L.Ed.2d 242 (1974); <em>Maxwell v. Stephens, </em>348 F.2d 325, 336 (8th Cir. 1965).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-8\">(2) Defendant\u2019s statements concerning the rifle made at the time he was confronted by the investigating officers were admissible under the rationale of <em>Oregon v. Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 97 S.Ct. 711, 50 L.Ed.2d 714 (1977), where the Supreme Co\u00fart held that, absent a custodial arrest, interrogation of a suspect does not require <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Defendant relies on <em>Orozco v. Texas, </em>394 U.S. 324, 89 S.Ct. 1095, 22 L.Ed.2d 311 (1969), where the Court held inadmissible statements elicited when the defendant was questioned in his bedroom by arresting officers. However, in <em>Orozco, </em>a police officer testified that from the moment the defendant gave the officers his name he was under arrest. In the present case, although the defendant was under suspicion, the officers testified that when he was initially questioned his freedom had not been restrained and no intent had been formed to place him under arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-11\">(3) The record indicates that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to allow defendant\u2019s counsel to make further inquiry of the prospective jurors concerning racial bias. <em>See United States v. Crow Dog, </em>532 F.2d 1182, 1198 (8th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 929, 97 S.Ct. 1547, 51 L.Ed.2d 772 (1977). The record is replete with specific questioning by the court concerning possible prejudice. Under the circumstances we find no abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion in this regard.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b679-9\">. <em>See United States v.

The common law rule prior to adoption of the Federal Rules of Evidence required that, before impeaching his own witness by use of prior inconsistent statements, a party show that the testimony at trial surprised the party as well as substantially harmed the party\u2019s case. <em>See United States v. Allsup, </em>485 F.2d 287 (8th Cir. 1973). However, in view of Fed.R.Evid. 607, which provides that either party may impeach any witness, surprise is no longer a viable requirement. <em>See </em>4 J. Weinstein &amp; M. Berger, Weinstein\u2019s Evidence 801-7 (1976). <em>See also United States v. Jordano, </em>521 F.2d 695, 697 (2d Cir. 1975) and <em>United States v.

We conclude that, since Black Elk\u2019s testimony was sufficiently harmful to the government\u2019s case, impeachment was proper regardless of whether surprise was established.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b679-15\">. The use of Black Elk\u2019s grand jury testimony did not result in a denial of the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation. Black Elk admitted making the statement before the grand jury and was available for cross-examination during his testimony at trial. <em>See California v.

In that case, the Second Circuit reversed a conviction for possession of stolen mail where the trial court failed to instruct that the fact that the mail was, in fact, stolen was an essential element of the crime. In <em>Singleton, </em>however, the court recognized that the instructions taken as a whole were sufficient to instruct the jury that the mail must be stolen to support the charge. The reversal on appeal was based on the fact that the trial court indicated to the jury during instructions that the mail was stolen. The court held that such a \u201cdirected verdict\u201d as to one element of the crime was reversible error. <em>Id. </em>at 206.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
