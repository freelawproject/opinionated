The district court dismissed the employee\u2019s complaint seeking in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>junctive and declaratory relief after the submission of affidavits and a brief hearing. Treating the district court\u2019s disposition as an award of summary judgment for the government, we reverse for the reasons discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Apac\">A. <em>Generally</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">From August 13, 1973, until his involuntary termination on July 10, 1975, our appellant, Stanley C. Mazaleski, was a Reserve Commissioned Officer in the United States Public Health Service (Service or PHS). Hired as a scientist, and possessing a Ph.D. degree, appellant was assigned to the position of criteria manager in the Criteria Development Branch of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> where his duties included the performance of certain chemical analyses and the preparation of recommendations for NIOSH safeguards to protect industrial workers exposed to carcinogenic chemicals.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">From the outset appellant had difficulty completing his duties to the satisfaction of his superiors. The reasons offered by the parties to explain this problem differ dramatically. Appellant claims that the malfeasance of NIOSH management, and of his immediate supervisor in particular, prevented him from conscientiously performing his duties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Service, on the other hand, proffers a portrait of appellant that generally depicts him as uncooperative, dilatory and professionally ineffective. <em>See </em>Appellees\u2019 Brief at 2-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-16\">The confrontation, which had been brewing for some time,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> finally erupted on June 3. 1974 when appellant filed an informal grievance against his supervisor,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> apparently in response to the latter\u2019s threat to have him fired. A few days thereafter, the supervisor wrote a memorandum \u201cfor the record\u201d detailing what he considered to be appellant\u2019s very poor job performance and occasionally irascible demeanor. At the direction of NIOSH management, he also submitted a special Commissioned Officers\u2019 Efficiency and Progress Report on appellant (Progress Report), which appellant considered \u201cextremely derogatory.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s Brief at 3. Appellant claims that he was never even apprised of the contents of his supervisor\u2019s memorandum, <em>id., </em>although the PHS maintains that a copy was sent to him.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He apparently did see the contents of the special Progress Report, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>On August 1, 1974, appellee Treusdell, Director of PHS\u2019s Commissioned Personnel Operations Division (CPOD), appointed a senior commissioned officer of the Service to investigate appellant\u2019s charges and to make written findings and recommendations. Six weeks later, the investigating officer concluded his inquiry and recommended: (1) that all charges be dismissed as unsupported by the facts; (2) that communications between NIOSH supervisors and employees be improved; (3) that the special Progress Report submitted by the supervisor be withdrawn as \u201ctotally inappropriate\u201d; <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (4) that appellant be transferred to new duties, if possible; and (5) that appellant should not be prejudiced in any way for having filed the grievance. The investigating officer also concluded that appellant\u2019s difficulties within NIOSH did not justify his dismissal at that time. Appellees\u2019 App. at 16-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">The Service claims that appellant, through his counsel, rejected these recommendations. Appellees\u2019 Brief at 4. Even the most cursory reading of his counsel\u2019s response, however, shows that, although he offered further suggestions, he was generally satisfied with all of them. See Appellees\u2019 App. at 12, 20-21. Nevertheless, since NIOSH management could not accommodate appellant\u2019s desire to continue his present work in another branch, the grievance was eventually sent up to the Assistant Secretary for Health, who approved the recommendations of the investigator on December 15. Appellant was notified of this final disposition three weeks later. He was provided a copy of the Assistant Secretary\u2019s decision and offered, but did not accept, an opportunity to discuss its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">During the lengthy processing of his grievance, appellant\u2019s relations with his superiors continued to deteriorate. Soon after filing his grievance, appellant began what was to become a lengthy correspondence with various congressmen in which he criticized NIOSH management. Copies of at least some of these letters were returned to the agency for explanation. Then, on November 25,1974, while final resolution of the grievance was still pending, appellant\u2019s supervisor formally requested that appellant\u2019s reserve commission be terminated for unsatisfactory performance.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> One intermediate official concurred, but apparently Treusdell, the personnel director, took no action on it. Appellant was not informed that his supervisor had made this termination request until nearly two months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">The new year, 1975, was to prove no better, even though NIOSH had arranged for appellant to have a new supervisor. In January, appellant\u2019s criticism that NIOSH was needlessly allowing workers to be exposed to cancer risks appeared in a <em>New York Times </em>article.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In February, appellant became involved in the equal opportunity complaint of a fellow employee and soon thereafter charged NIOSH with taking reprisals against him for that involvement. A second request for involuntary termination of appellant\u2019s commission quickly followed, this time from the new supervisor, who submitted new charges and even more extensive supporting documentation of unsatisfactory job performance. Appellant immediately countered by filing misconduct charges against the new supervisor and another NIOSH official, which were ultimately rejected. Appellees\u2019 App. at 69-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>B. <em>The Involuntary Separation Proceeding</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ah-\">NIOSH, it appears, soon concluded that it had suffered long enough. In March Treusdell notified appellant that an Involuntary Separation Board (Board) would be convened to consider nine specific charges previously made against him in the termination requests of his two supervisors. Appellant was given copies of these requests and all supporting documentation, notified of the charges against him, and informed of his right to reply in writing. <em>See id. </em>at 54-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">After appellant\u2019s request that the Board delay its inquiry until his EEO complaint could be processed<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> was denied, he submitted written responses to the charges and asked that he be accorded certain due process rights.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This request was also denied, and appellant and his counsel were not permitted to attend the meetings of the Board. On May 2 appellant was notified by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management that, in accordance with the Board\u2019s recommendation, his commission would be terminated on June 6. The letter of notification informed him of his right to appeal<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but did not state the specific reasons for the termination decision as required by PHS personnel regulations. Appellant did appeal his termination but was informed by the Assistant Secretary for Health<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that, upon careful review of the Board\u2019s findings and recommendation and appellant\u2019s rebuttals to the charges, he considered the Service\u2019s action justified and that no further administrative review was available. The Assistant Secretary further stated that appellant\u2019s request to personally present his appeal had been denied, because he had not affirmatively stated any reason why he should be continued on active duty.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">C. <em>District Court Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">Appellant filed this suit in June, 1975, immediately prior to being informed of the agency\u2019s final decision. He asked for declaratory and injunctive relief on the grounds that the administrative procedures followed in terminating his commission violated his due process rights and that the termination itself was in retaliation for his exercise of the constitutional right of free speech. Appellant immediately filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to restrain the Service from terminating his commission, which was denied for failure to exhaust administrative remedies since the agency\u2019s final decision was still pending. After appellant was notified of the Assistant Secretary\u2019s decision and finally given a copy of the Board\u2019s specific findings, which should have accompanied the termination notice handed-down more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>than a month before, he renewed his motion for a TRO. He then withdrew it when the Service represented that he would not be terminated until he had an opportunity to contest these specific findings. Appellant subsequently declined the agency\u2019s offer to reopen the administrative proceedings, however, apparently because the agency would not allow him to present his case through an attorney to someone other than the Assistant Secretary for Health. <em>See </em>Appellees\u2019 App. at 71; Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief at 4. Appellant\u2019s third motion for a TRO was granted, but a week later, after holding a hearing, the district court dismissed his suit for failure to state a claim over which the court had jurisdiction.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> With appellant\u2019s tortuous odyssey within the Service ended for the time being, this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">II. RESOLUTION OF THE MERITS</p>\n<p id=\"ARW\">A. <em>The Motion to Dismiss</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ask\">Appellant preliminarily contends that the district court applied an incorrect standard in granting the Service\u2019s motion to dismiss. He argues that his complaint was immune from dismissal because he had alleged facts which, if proven true, would provide a basis for judicial relief,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> relying chiefly on <em>Scheuer v. Rhodes, </em>416 U.S. 232, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974), one of many cases emphasizing the liberal eonstruction to be accorded pleadings under the federal rules.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> His argument is miscast, however. Although the district court stated that it was dismissing appellant\u2019s suit for failure to state a claim over which it had jurisdiction, Appellant\u2019s App., Doc. G at 3, its decision should properly be characterized as a summary judgment inasmuch as both parties had presented affidavits and other materials \u201coutside the pleading\u201d, these were expressly considered by the court, and it is clear from the memorandum accompanying the court\u2019s Order that an intended, albeit unarticulated, ground for dismissal was Rule 12(b)(6), for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>See Richardson v. Rivers, </em>118 U.S.App.D.C. 333, 335 F.2d 996, 998 (1964). A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is treated as a motion for summary judgment, if \u201cmatters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court . . ,.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b). Therefore, although the district court\u2019s ruling was not perhaps congruent with the most orderly procedure, we will treat it as an award of summary judgment to appellees <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> for which the applicable standard of review is whether there existed any genuine issue of material fact and, if not, whether the appellees were entitled to their judgment as a matter of law. <em>See id. </em>56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>B. <em>The Due Process Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"AL3\">In his due process claim appellant only contests the legal conclusions of the district court, since the material facts related to this issue are not in dispute. The PHS personnel regulations governing reserve commissioned officers provide limited procedural protections. Under these regulations appellant was entitled to notice of any termination proceedings and the specific charges made against him, an opportunity to rebut those charges in writing, consideration of the charges and rebuttals by a Board comprised of three senior PHS officers who had not considered the case previously, notification of the specific grounds for his termination, and review of the decision by an appropriate agency official in light of the Board\u2019s report and the officer\u2019s written appeal. The question which we must now decide is whether the due process clause of our Constitution\u2019s fifth amendment entitles him to any greater procedural protection.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Just a few years ago the Supreme Court expansively broadened the scope of procedural due process protection<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> in a well-known series of cases.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>E. g., Perry v. Sindermann, </em>408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972); <em>Board of Regents </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972); <em>Bell v. Burson, </em>402 U.S. 535, 91 S.Ct. 1586, 29 L.Ed.2d 90 (1971); <em>Wisconsin v. Constantineau, </em>400 U.S. 433, 91 S.Ct. 507, 27 L.Ed.2d 515 (1971); <em>Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970). Nevertheless, as a threshold requirement the plaintiff in a public employee dismissal case must show that he has either a legitimate entitlement with respect to his job, which would be protected as property under the fifth or fourteenth amendments, or that his dismissal deprives him of a liberty interest protected, by those constitutional provisions. <em>See Board of Regents v. Roth, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 569-71, 92 S.Ct. 2701. Only if the court first finds that a \u201cliberty\u201d or \u201cproperty\u201d interest is affected will it go on to a balancing of interests analysis to determine what level of procedural protection is appropriate. <em>E. g., Fusari v. Steinberg, </em>419 U.S. 379, 389, 95 S.Ct. 533, 42 L.Ed.2d 521 (1975); <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 570-71 &amp; n. 8, 92 S.Ct. 2701; <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">Appellant\u2019s principal due process claim<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> is based on the theory that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>termination by the Service \u201con the grounds of marginal and substandard performance\u201d deprived him of liberty because it \u201cseriously damage[d] his reputation and standing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>within the scientific community and [impaired] his ability to obtain appropriate employment elsewhere.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 15. The seriousness of this claim cannot be gainsaid. Although the term \u201cliberty\u201d in the Constitution\u2019s due process clauses has never been precisely defined, the Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> that \u201c[i]n a Constitution for a free people, there can be no doubt that the meaning of \u2018liberty\u2019 must be broad indeed.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 572, 92 S.Ct. at 2707. Exactly how broad its meaning should be, however, remains a matter of considerable debate.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Soon after its decision in <em>Goldberg v. Kelly, supra, </em>which first triggered an explosion of due process cases in the federal courts, the Supreme Court accorded \u201cliberty\u201d its broadest interpretation when in <em>Wisconsin v. Constantineau, supra,</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it declared that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-6\">[w]here a person\u2019s good name, reputation, honor, or integrity is at stake because of what the government is doing to him, notice and an opportunity to be heard are essential.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">400 U.S. at 437, 91 S.Ct. at 510. The corollary of this much-quoted pronouncement\u2014 that any governmental attack on one\u2019s reputation constitutes a deprivation of liberty sufficient to require procedural due process protection \u2014 raised the possibility, quickly seized upon by numerous lower courts,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> of a wholesale judicialization of government personnel decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-13\">The Supreme Court further clarified the relation of reputation to liberty in <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, supra, </em>in explaining why a state college\u2019s refusal to renew a nontenured teacher\u2019s employment contract did not implicate any cognizable interest in liberty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aoi\">The State, in declining to rehire [him], did not make any charge against him that might seriously damage his standing and associations in his community. It did not base the nonrenewal of his contract on a charge, for example, that he had been guilty of dishonesty, or immorality. Had it done so, this would be a different case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQcM\"><em>* </em>* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-14\">Similarly, there is no suggestion that the State, in declining to re-employ [him], imposed on him a stigma or other disability that foreclosed his freedom to take advantage of other employment opportunities. The State, for example, did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>invoke any regulations to bar [him] from all other public employment in state universities. Had it done so, this, again, would be a different case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">408 U.S. at 573-74, 92 S.Ct. at 2707. Subsequent lower court decisions have interpreted the guidelines articulated in <em>Roth </em>to require that an employee claiming an infringement of liberty show that the government\u2019s action was likely to either seriously harm his standing in the community or foreclose his future opportunities for reemployment. <em>See, e. g., Weathers v. West Yuma County School District, </em>530 F.2d 1335, 1338-39 (10th Cir. 1976); <em>Sims v. Fox, </em>505 F.2d 857, 863 (5th Cir. 1974) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 1011, 95 S.Ct. 2415, 44 L.Ed.2d 678 (1975); <em>Lipp v. Board of Education, </em>470 F.2d 802, 805 (7th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Our concern in this appeal, however, is necessarily limited to the second of <em>Roth\u2019s </em>two \u201ctests\u201d. In one of its most recent decisions delimiting the scope of the liberty clause of the fourteenth amendment, the Supreme Court has seriously undermined if not altogether obliterated the protection previously accorded one\u2019s general reputation in the community irrespective of any related interest in employment. <em>Paul v. Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 701, 706, 710-11, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976). <em>Compare id. </em>at 731-33, 96 S.Ct. 1155 (Brennan, J., dissenting). Even without the constraint imposed by <em>Paul, </em>however, it could not seriously be argued that the circumstances of appellant\u2019s termination might damage his standing within his community in any sense envisioned by <em>Roth </em>and its progeny.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Sensing the weakness of his general reputation injury, appellant bases his due process challenge mainly on the probable foreclosure of his reemployment opportunities. He argues that \u201c[a]s long as the charges made against an employee can reach those who are interested in his professional reputation, the employee is entitled to due process protections.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief at 13. If this were an accurate statement of the law, and we do not believe it is, it would nonetheless not apply to appellant unless the reasons for his termination are in fact made public. <em>Bishop v. Wood, </em>426 U.S. 341, 348, 96 S.Ct. 2074, 48 L.Ed.2d 684 (1976). <em>Accord Sims v. Fox, supra </em>at 863; <em>Shirck v. Thomas, </em>486 F.2d 691, 693 (7th Cir. 1973), <em>vacated and remanded on other grounds, </em>408 U.S. 940, 92 S.Ct. 2848, 33 L.Ed.2d 764 (1972). <em>But cf. Goss v. Lopez, </em>419 U.S. 565, 575 &amp; n. 7, 95 S.Ct. 729, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975). Of course, where the government publicly disseminates information concerning its adverse personnel actions, or where it simply makes certain information available to prospective employers, a court must proceed to determine whether the information disclosed is of such a derogatory nature as to infringe a liberty interest of the employee. <em>See, e. g., Velger v. Cawley, </em>525 F.2d 334 (2d Cir. 1975), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. Codd v. Velger, </em>429 U.S. 624, 97 S.Ct. 882, 51 L.Ed.2d 92 (1977) (personnel files available to public and private employers upon request); <em>Greenhill v. Bailey, </em>519 F.2d 5 (8th Cir. 1975) (information suggesting medical student\u2019s unfitness available to all accredited medical schools); <em>Wellner v. Minnesota State Junior College Board, </em>487 F.2d 153 (8th Cir. 1973) (unfavorable information in permanent file to which future employers would likely have access). In this case, however, the parties dispute whether or not the reasons for appellant\u2019s termination will remain confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">The Service invites our attention to an internal rule of HEW applicable to the record system<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> which covers the files of ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>verse actions or involuntary terminations with respect to PHS commissioned officers, and any related correspondence. That rule specifically provides that this information shall be kept in a locked metal cabinet and not made public.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Appellees\u2019 App. at 79. This might end the matter, if it were not for the fact that appellant refers us to a rule applicable to another system which permits \u201climited information [to be] provided prospective employers upon inquiry\u201d contained in \u201cOfficial Personnel Folders\u201d and \u201cService Record Cards (summarizing personnel actions).\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>In view of this apparent inconsistency and the lack of any further explanation by the parties, we cannot now conclude that the reasons for appellant\u2019s termination will remain confidential. Assuming for the sake of argument that they will not, we turn to the question of whether they were of such a nature as to infringe his liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Appellant\u2019s termination does not disqualify him from engaging \u201cin any of the common occupations of life . . . ,\u201d <em>Meyer v. Nebraska, </em>262 U.S. 390, 399, 43 S.Ct. 625, 626, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923), nor does it effectively deprive him of a future possibility to pursue his chosen profession as a scientist, <em>see, e. g., In re Ruffalo, </em>390 U.S. 544, 550, 88 S.Ct. 1222, 20 L.Ed.2d 117 (1968) (disbarment), whether in government, <em>see Board of Regents v. Roth, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 573-74, 92 S.Ct. 2701, or even in his chosen geographical area, <em>see Christhilf v. Annapolis Emergency Hospital Assn., </em>496 F.2d 174, 178 (4th Cir. 1974). If it did, we might readily conclude that the action deprived him of liberty. The barrier of which appellant complains is a practical not legal one, however. He argues rather that he has been deprived of liberty since disclosure of the reasons for his termination to prospective employers would <em>\u201cimpair </em>his ability to find other employment in his chosen field.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief at 10 (emphasis added). To infringe one\u2019s liberty, the effect of government action on future employment must extend beyond a disadvantage or impediment; it must \u201cforeclos[e] his freedom to take advantage of other employment opportunities.\u201d <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 573, 92 S.Ct. at 2707. In <em>Roth, </em>the Supreme Court cautioned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-8\">[m]ere proof, for example, that his record of nonretention in one job, taken alone, might make him somewhat less attractive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>to some other employers would hardly establish the kind of foreclosure of opportunities amounting to a deprivation of \u201cliberty\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 574 n. 13, 92 S.Ct. at 2708. The personnel action in <em>Roth, </em>of course, had not been accompanied by any reasons whatsoever, whereas in the instant case the adverse action was taken expressly for reasons of unsatisfactory job performance and insubordination. The disclosure of these reasons might well interfere with his opportunities for subsequent employment. We do not believe, however, that they are of such a serious and derogatory nature as to require procedural due process protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Appellant was not terminated for dishonesty,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> for having committed a serious felony,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> for manifest racism,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> for serious mental illness,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> or for lack of \u201cintellectual ability, as distinguished from his performance . . .\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Whereas dismissals for these reasons have been held to affect liberty, dismissals for reasons similar to those given in appellant\u2019s case have generally been deemed not to touch a liberty interest. <em>See, e. g., Lake Michigan College Federation of Teachers v. Lake Michigan Community College, </em>518 F.2d 1091, 1097 (6th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>427 U.S. 904, 96 S.Ct. 3189, 49 L.Ed.2d 1197 (1976) (disruptive conduct); <em>Abeyta v. Taos, </em>499 F.2d 323, 327 (10th Cir. 1974) (charges of improper and substandard job performance); <em>Blair v. Board of Regents, </em>496 F.2d 322, 324 (6th Cir. 1974) (nonrenewal based on ground that teacher\u2019s professional relationships with students failed to meet minimum standards); <em>Adams v. Walker, </em>492 F.2d 1003, 1008-09 (7th Cir. 1974) (unelaborated charge of \u201cincompetence, neglect of duty and malfeasance in office\u201d to satisfy state constitutional provision); <em>Jeffries v. Turkey Run Consolidated School District, </em>492 F.2d 1, 2 n. 1 (7th Cir. 1974) (teacher \u201cexhibited highly unethical conduct\u201d in openly contradicting a fellow teacher\u2019s directives to her students); <em>Shirck </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra </em>at 692 (unsatisfactory performance); <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>474 F.2d 928 (7th Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>411 U.S. 972, 93 S.Ct. 2148, 36 L.Ed.2d 695 (1973) (allegations of certain deficiencies in a teacher\u2019s professional conduct); <em>Russell v.

Indeed, a general rule that informing an employee of job-related reasons for termination created a right to a hearing, in circumstances where there was no constitutional requirement for the state to do anything, would be self-defeating; the state would merely opt to give no reasons and the employee would lose the benefit of knowing what might profit him in the future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-5\"><em>Russell v. Hodges, supra </em>at 217. <em>See also McNeill v. Butz, </em>480 F.2d 314, 319 n. 1 (4th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">C. <em>First Amendment Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">Appellant\u2019s inability to establish a property interest in his government employment or an infringement of liberty does not affect his argument that it was improper to dismiss his claim that his termination was based on constitutionally protected criticisms of NIOSH policy and personnel. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Brief at 22. In <em>Perry v. Sindermann, supra, </em>the Supreme Court emphasized that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-8\">[f]or at least a quarter-century, this Court has made clear that even though a person has no \u201cright\u201d to a valuable governmental benefit and even though the government may deny him the benefit for any number of reasons, there are some reasons upon which the government may not rely. It may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interests \u2014 especially, his interest in freedom of speech. For if the government could deny a benefit to a person because of his constitutionally protected speech or associations, his exercise of those freedoms would in effect be penalized and inhibited. This would allow the government to \u201cproduce a result which [it] could not command directly.\u201d <em>Speiser v. Randall, </em>357 U.S. 513, 526, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 1342, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460. Such interference with constitutional rights is impermissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">408 U.S. at 597, 92 S.Ct. at 2697.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-12\">This principle has often proved more difficult to apply than to justify, however, because the actual grounds for the dismissal of a government employee may not be readily ascertainable, and almost always are vigorously contested by the litigants. Some test is necessary, then, to diagnose the essential causative factor underlying what is frequently a complex decision, cloaked in subjectivity, for the fact that the government may have considered an employee\u2019s protected speech or conduct in reaching an adverse personnel decision does not necessarily render that decision constitutionally infirm. <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977). According to <em>Doyle </em>the test should be one which \u201cprotects against the invasion of constitutional rights without commanding undesirable consequences not necessary to the assurance of those rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 576. The test developed by the Supreme Court in that case to meet this criterion requires not only that a plaintiff assume the initial burden of showing that his conduct was constitutionally protected and that it was a \u201csubstantial\u201d or \u201cmotivating\u201d factor in the government\u2019s adverse action, but also that, if plaintiff has carried his burden, the government may show by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision had the protected conduct never occurred. <em>Id. </em>The touchstone for decision, therefore, is the employee\u2019s job performance considered in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-13\">Unlike <em>Doyle, </em>however, the first amendment claim in the case <em>sub judice </em>was disposed of by summary judgment. The district court held that appellant\u2019s claim was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>\u201cwithout merit since there is no indication whatsoever in the record . . . that plaintiff\u2019s statements in this regard were even considered by the defendants at the various stages of review in the process of termination.\u201d Appellant\u2019s App., Doc. G at 3. We think it clear that the court\u2019s disposition, in substance, amounted to an anticipatory consideration of the merits of appellant\u2019s proof that his protected activities were a \u201cmotivating\u201d factor in the Service\u2019s decision to terminate his commission, or, even, of the Service\u2019s proof that it would have reached the same result in the absence of appellant\u2019s criticisms.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The principles governing the award of summary judgment are well-established. The proper judicial role \u201cis limited to ascertaining whether any factual issue pertinent to the controversy exists; <em>it does not extend to resolution of any such issue.\u201d Nyhus v. Travel Management Corp., </em>151 U.S.App.D.C. 269, 466 F.2d 440, 442 (1972) (emphasis added). <em>See Sartor v. Arkansas Natural Gas Corp., </em>321 U.S. 620, 627, 64 S.Ct. 724, 88 L.Ed. 967 (1944). An award of summary judgment is authorized only if \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and . . . the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Of course appellant\u2019s assertion that the Service\u2019s decision may have been based on his constitutionally protected activities cannot by itself immunize his action from the adverse award of summary judgment. The failure of an opposing party to \u201cset forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial\u201d justifies an otherwise appropriate summary judgment, <em>id. </em>56(e), unless he shows that at present he cannot \u201cpresent by affidavit facts essential to justify his opposition . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>56(f). After appellee Treusdell had filed his affidavit categorically denying that the Service\u2019s action had been in retaliation for appellant\u2019s criticisms and specifically documenting the Service\u2019s bona fide performance-related grounds for his termination, Record Doc. 9, appellant filed his own affidavit that offered nothing in rebuttal which, if proven true, could possibly constitute a first amendment violation. Indeed all he alleged in his affidavit was that he had written several letters to congressmen concerning what he considered to be problems at NIOSH. Record Doc. 10. Without more than the <em>post hoc ergo propter hoc </em>allegations of his complaint and affidavit, we might well conclude that the denial of appellant\u2019s first amendment claim by summary judgment was appropriate. However, appellant also filed the affidavit of a PHS Supervisory Public Health Advisor who was then serving as the Chief of Program Policy for the National Health Service Corps. Record Doc. 12. This experienced official, himself a member of the Service, offered the following averment in his detailed affidavit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-10\">[I]n retrospect, it is difficult to determine just how the situation between [appellant] and NIOSH had deteriorated to the relationship I encountered in June of 1974. It is even more difficult to discern the reasons why both CPOD and NIOSH management resisted and avoided my attempts at informal resolution, while at the same time professing informality to be the desired style. It was almost as though they wished to establish a lengthy file and encourage [appellant\u2019s] frustration with subsequent predictable results.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-11\">In the past year, [appellant\u2019s] situation has been an almost classic example of management\u2019s reaction to an internal critic .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-12\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-13\">What happens to [appellant] will not go unnoticed by other scientists in NIOSH and the Public Health Service. If his proposed involuntary separation under these circumstances is allowed to stand, then this intimidation will have a chilling effect on others who take their Oath of Office and the \u201cCode of Ethics for Government Service\u201d seriously.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-14\">Record Doc. 12, Lauderbaugh Aff. at 5-6. This was sufficient to crystallize a genuine issue of material fact for which a trial is necessary. <em>See Ring v. Schlesinger, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>164 U.S.App.D.C. at 29-30, 502 F.2d at 489-90; <em>Hess v. Schlesinger, </em>159 U.S.App.D.C. 51, 486 F.2d 1311, 1313 (1973); <em>Bloomgarden v. Coyer, </em>156 U.S.App.D.C. 109, 479 F.2d 201, 206-7 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Appellant here necessarily labored under difficult circumstances in opposing the Service\u2019s motion. His termination was not an <em>overt </em>retaliation for engaging in protected activities, if it was a retaliation at all. Compare <em>Perry v. Sindermann, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 595 &amp; n. 1, 92 S.Ct. 2694; <em>Ring v. Schlesinger, supra, </em>164 U.S.App.D.C. at 22, 502 F.2d at 482. His only likely avenue of success lay in making credibility an issue, for resolution of the first amendment issue essentially required a determination of state of mind. When motivation is involved and credibility becomes of critical importance, or when essential facts are solely within the control of the moving party, summary judgment generally is inappropriate.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-6\">We believe that summary procedures should be used sparingly where motive and intent play leading roles, the proof is largely in the hands of the alleged conspirators, and hostile witnesses thicken the plot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-7\"><em>Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., </em>368 U.S. 464, 473, 82 S.Ct. 486, 491, 7 L.Ed.2d 458 (1962). <em>See, e. g., Croley v. Matson Navigation Co., </em>434 F.2d 73, 77 (5th Cir. 1970); <em>Cellini v. Moss, </em>232 F.2d 371, 373, 98 U.S.App.D.C. 114 (1956); 10 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2730, at 583-84 (1973). Were it otherwise, an employing agency would have an even greater incentive to cloak its personnel decisions with a shroud of silence, in some cases perhaps artfully disguising the impermissible basis for its action by assiduously refraining from any reference to, much less criticism of, its employee\u2019s constitutionally protected activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-10\">Viewing the record in this case, as we must, in the light most favorable to appellant, the party against whom summary judgment was awarded, <em>see Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting System, supra, </em>368 U.S. at 473, 82 S.Ct. 486; Weiss v. <em>Kay Jewelry Stores, Inc., </em>152 U.S.App.D.C. 350, 470 F.2d 1259, 1262 (1972), we are constrained to conclude that there is indeed a genuine factual dispute as to whether or not appellant\u2019s termination was motivated by impermissible considerations and that, accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of the first amendment claim by summary judgment was error. Passing only on the procedure used here and not on the merits of appellant\u2019s claim, we vacate the summary judgment with respect to that claim and remand for trial, once appellant has again exhausted his administrative remedy to which we subsequently conclude he is entitled, where the issue must be resolved in accordance with the test specified by the Supreme Court in <em>Doyle, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b791-11\">D. <em>The Procedural Noncompliance Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b791-12\">In his final assertion of error, appellant argues that evidence in the record indicating two distinct failures by the Service to comply with its own regulations belies the district court\u2019s holding that the agency had followed its prescribed procedures. The issue here is essentially legal, since procedural irregularities are indeed clearly established by the record as appellant maintains.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>The essence of appellant\u2019s first argument is that the regulations entitled him to review of the Service\u2019s termination decision by the Surgeon General rather than by the Assistant Secretary for Health. We sympathize with appellant\u2019s confusion. Section I of Sub-Chapter CC 23.7 provides specifically for review by the Surgeon General. See Appellant\u2019s App., Doc. A at 4. On August 6, 1974, however, the Surgeon General\u2019s authority to terminate reserve commissions was transferred to the Assistant Secretary for Health.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The Service\u2019s failure to revise expeditiously its personnel regulations to reflect this redelegation, and its failure to otherwise inform appellant of the proper reviewing official, while perhaps regrettable, are not in and of themselves evidence of arbitrary departure from established administrative practices. Appellant did obtain timely review of the termination decision by the authorized official; he has not alleged that this official lacked impartiality, at least at this stage of the proceedings; and he has not otherwise shown that he was prejudiced in any real sense by the Service\u2019s failure to inform him of its administrative reorganization.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Appellant\u2019s second claim of material noncompliance with PHS regulations attacks the substance rather than the form of review. He alleges that the meaningful review to which he was entitled under the regulations was vitiated by the Service\u2019s failure to notify him, as required, of the specific grounds for his termination. Subsection H(2) of Sub-Chapter CC 23.7 clearly provides that, when the Director, CPOD, has decided to terminate an officer\u2019s reserve commission after considering the Board\u2019s report and recommendation, the officer must be notified of the \u201cspecific basis for the action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Appellant received his termination notice by letter dated May 2, 1975, however it failed to give any indication whatsoever of the <em>specific basis </em>for his termination. Appellant was informed only that he had the right to an administrative appeal and that the Director, Office of Personnel Management,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> had reviewed the Board\u2019s findings and recommendation fully and had directed that appellant\u2019s commission be terminated effective June 6, 1975. <em>Id. </em>Doc. B. Only on June 6, after he had filed suit in the district court and sought a TRO, was he finally provided any specification of the actual grounds for the Service\u2019s action in the form of the Board\u2019s memorandum report to the Director, CPOD. The Service argues that its \u201cinadvertent\u201d failure to provide appellant with the requisite notice was fully rectified by this corrective action and its concurrent proposal, which appellant declined, to reopen the administrative proceedings and to retain appellant at PHS in leave-with-pay status until he had had an opportunity to contest the specific grounds for his termination. Appellees\u2019 Brief at 12. While we do not find that appellant\u2019s refusal to accept this offer waived his right to contest his dismissal, we do find this offer most significant to our determination of the appropriate remedy to which he is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Appellant did receive timely notice of the nine specific charges against him and copies of the supporting documentation submitted to the Board. He was able to rebut the specifics of those charges in writing and to appeal the Director\u2019s final determination. Even so, the Service\u2019s failure to inform him of the specific grounds of the termination decision, though merely an oversight, cannot be excused as a de minim-is or harmless violation of its own regulations.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Appellant could not be expected to prosecute his appeal effectively without knowledge of the precise grounds specified by the Service. Of course, he could have recapitulated his previous rebuttals to each of the nine charges considered by the Board, but since not every charge was actually considered by the Board some of his effort would have been misdirected. More significantly, the final determination within the Service is to be made by the Director, CPOD, not by the Board, and we find nothing in the regulations which makes the Board\u2019s findings binding on the Director. As we read these regulations, the notice due a reserve officer facing termination should specify the grounds upon which the Director based his decision and not simply the findings upon which the Board based its recommendation. The Director may be able to satisfy this requirement by expressly adopting the Board\u2019s findings, but in this case he only stated that he had fully reviewed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Appellant may have been prejudiced in yet another way. A request for review of a termination decision must, under section I of the regulations, be made in writing and give reasons why the officer should be continued on active duty. Appellant failed to give any such reasons in his appeal request, and the Assistant Secretary for Health notified him on June 4, 1975, that he could \u201cnot, at a later date, correct that error\u201d and that his request for a personal appearance had been denied \u201cfor this reason\u201d. Appellant\u2019s App., Doc. C. This preemptory denial of appellant\u2019s fervid and oft-repeated request to state his case in person cannot be reconciled with the fact that the Service\u2019s nonfeasance was at least partially responsible for appellant\u2019s omission<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The clear implication of the Assistant Secretary\u2019s statement is that appellant would have been permitted to appear personally had he stated reasons. Whether or not such an appearance would have proved beneficial to appellant, it should not have been denied to him because the Service had failed to provide him the notice required by its own regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">Where, as here, a government employee has no procedural due process rights apart from those which the agency has chosen to create by its own regulations, scrupulous compliance with those regulations is required to avoid any injustice. <em>See Vitarelli v. Seaton, </em>359 U.S. 535, 539-40, 79 S.Ct. 968, 3 L.Ed.2d 1012 (1959). <em>See also Morton v. Ruiz, </em>415 U.S. 199, 235, 94 S.Ct. 1055, 39 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">Having decided that appellant was wronged, we must now settle upon a suitable remedy. We note that on the effective date of his termination appellant was offered but declined the opportunity to remain in the Service until he had been able to contest the specific basis for his termination. In <em>Gratehouse v. United States, </em>512 F.2d 1104, 206 Ct.Cl. 288 (1975), the one case we have found directly addressing the legal consequences of such a refusal in roughly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>similar circumstances,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> the Court of Claims applied a test which we consider applicable to this case as well.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-4\">The consequences of a refusal to accept an agency\u2019s offer to remedy a possible, though disputed, procedural error will depend on the timing and nature of the offer. We have many times held that an agency has the inherent power to reconsider and change a decision if it does so within a reasonable period of time. Recently, in fact, we applied this rule specifically to the [Civil Service Commission]. <em>Bookman v. United States, </em>453 F.2d 1263, 197 Ct.Cl. 108 (1972). In <em>Book-man </em>we noted . . . that \u201creconsideration is often the sole means of correcting errors of procedure or substance.\u201d We stated further:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-6\">* * * this court will sustain the reconsidered decision of an agency, as long as the administrative action is conducted within a short and reasonable period, [citation omitted]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-8\">What is a short and reasonable time period will vary with each case, but absent unusual circumstances, the time period would be measured in weeks, not years. A correction of an error within a reasonable time period will have retroactive effect, or, in other words, will preclude any cause of action based on the original error.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-12\">Where reasonable time for reconsideration has expired, there is no longer an opportunity to correct the procedural error retroactively.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 1109. <em>See American Trucking Assns. v. Frisco Transp. Co., </em>358 U.S. 133, 144-45, 79 S.Ct. 170, 177, 3 L.Ed.2d 172 (1958) (\u201c[T]he presence of authority in administrative officers and tribunals to correct such errors [due to inadvertence or mistake] has long been recognized \u2014 probably so well recognized that little discussion has ensued in the reported cases.\u201d) <em>See generally </em>2 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 18.09, at 606 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-14\">We cannot say that the Service\u2019s offer to appellant came so late as to justify his refusal. In fact, the offer to reopen the administrative proceedings came rather early: on the effective date of appellant\u2019s termination,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> when it appears the Service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>was first informed of its error.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Furthermore, it provided for the retention of appellant in pay-with-leave status during the time necessary to contest the specific grounds; his acceptance would not have forced him into the dilemma of risking success upon reconsideration by the agency at the cost of waiving any right to recover back pay.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> We also cannot fault the substance of the Service\u2019s offer. It was not mere \u201cconfetti throwing\u201d by the government, <em>see Vitarelli v. Seaton, supra, </em>359 U.S. at 549, 79 S.Ct. 968 (Frankfurter, J., concurring and dissenting), or an unavailing post hoc rationalization, see <em>Van Bourg v. Nitze, </em>128 U.S.App.D.C. 301, 388 F.2d 557, 565 (1976). If appellant had accepted the offer, he would have received the one procedural safeguard to which he was still entitled and would have been given as good an opportunity to make Ms appeal as he would have had had the error never occurred.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">In view of the confusion which inevitably resulted from the Service\u2019s generally poor handling of this termination proceeding, we believe that the only appropriate remedy for this particular breach is to order the administrative proceedings reopened for a reasonable period, as the Service first offered, to allow appellant to contest the specific grounds for his termination before the Assistant Secretary for Health,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> in accordance with the procedures established in Sub-Chapter CC 23.7 and existing at the time of appellant\u2019s termination. We are constrained to make one addition, however. Since the clear implication by negative inference of the Assistant Secretary\u2019s letter of June 4, 1975, was that appellant would have been allowed to appear personally to state his case on appeal had he offered any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>reasons justifying his retention,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> we consider that fairness requires that appellant be accorded this opportunity in the likely event he now does assert such reasons.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Finally, we conclude that reinstatement before a decision on the merits of appellant\u2019s appeal is not justified by the circumstances, and we do not require that the Service reinstate appellant in pay-with-leave status during the pendency of the reopened proceedings as it initially offered. The decision of the district court is therefore reversed and the case remanded for entry of partial summary judgment on appellant\u2019s procedural noncompliance claim consistent with the views set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Our legitimate role in a case such as this is necessarily a limited one. We must apply the Constitution, while carefully avoiding the temptation to act as ombudsmen for public employer-employee relations. \u201cThe federal court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the multitude of personnel decisions that are made daily by public \\agencies.\u201d <em>Bishop v. Wood, supra, </em>426 U.S. at 349, 96 S.Ct. at 2080. Nevertheless, those decisions must be reached consistent with any procedural safeguards created by the employer and the salutary proscriptions of our Constitution.

These presidential commissions are issued by the Secretary of HEW, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 209(c), who has been delegated the President\u2019s authority to terminate the commissions of reserve officers without their consent and to prescribe regulations governing such terminations. Exec. Order No. 11,140, 3 C.F.R. 177 (1964-1965 Comp.), <em>reprinted in </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 202 app. at 9533 (1970); <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 209(a)(2), 216(a) (1970). Furthermore, as members of a \u201cuniformed service,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 201(p), all PHS commissioned officers, whether regular or reserve, are appointed \u201cwithout regard to the civil-service laws,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 204, and consequently are specifically exempted from civil-service protection. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101(1) (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">In light of the foregoing statutory provisions, PHS argues that the status of its reserve commissioned officers is analogous to that of probationary federal civil-service employees and \u201cprobationary\u201d reserve commissioned officers in the armed forces, Appellees\u2019 Brief at 16, whose procedural rights according to well-settled law may be severely restricted. <em>See Sampson v. Murray, </em>415 U.S. 61, 94 S.Ct. 937, 39 L.Ed.2d 166 (1974); <em>Vitarelli v. Seaton, </em>359 U.S. 535, 79 S.Ct. 968, 3 L.Ed.2d 1012 (1959); <em>Ring v. Schlesinger, </em>164 U.S.App.D.C. 19, 502 F.2d 479 (1974); <em>cf. Cafeteria Workers, supra, </em>367 U.S. at 896, 81 S.Ct. 1743. We find this analogy persuasive, at least insofar as the particular statute delimiting the employment relationship in each case specifically negates a reasonable bilateral prospect of continued employment which might otherwise give rise to a legitimate claim of entitlement requiring procedural due process protection. Section 209(a)(2) of title 42, providing that PHS reserve commissions \u201cshall be for an indefinite period and may be terminated at any time, as the President may direct\u201d, is clearly analogous to those sections of title 10 which state that reserve commissioned officers in the armed forces with less than three years of service \u201cmay be discharged at the pleasure of the President.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1162(a), 1163(a) (1970). In both instances, the legal effect of the statutes is the same; each clearly specifies that an officer within its terms has no vested right, and consequently no entitlement to continued employment. <em>See Sims v. Fox, </em>505 F.2d 857, 861 (5th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 1011, 95 S.Ct. 2415, 44 L.Ed.2d 678 (1975) (\u201cOne who may be discharged \u2018at the pleasure\u2019 of another; i. e., arbitrarily, for no cause whatsoever, simply has no property right to continued employment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Although the genesis of a property interest clearly cannot be found in the statute governing appellant\u2019s employment, nor we presume in any contract, PHS\u2019s personnel regulations, themselves, could create a protected interest if they reflect a <em>de facto </em>policy that a reserve officer would only be terminated for \u201ccause\u201d. Both <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, supra, </em>and <em>Perry v. Sindermann, supra, </em>recognize that a property right may arise from informal \u201cunderstandings\u201d or policies. 408 U.S. at 577-78, 92 S.Ct. 2701; <em>id. </em>at 600-02, 92 S.Ct. 2694; <em>see Thomas v. Ward, </em>529 F.2d 916, 919 (4th Cir. 1975). The question thus becomes whether the provisions of PHS\u2019s Personnel Manual generally, and section C(2) in particular, could reasonably be viewed as having created a legitimate claim of entitlement to continued employment absent \u201csufficient cause,\u201d when by statute the appointing official, whether the President or his delegatee, could have terminated an officer\u2019s reserve commission without his consent, and, by implication, without any cause whatsoever. Section C(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-9\">While the maintenance of high performance standards is essential, insistence on these standards will be combined with consideration of the officer. Continuing efforts will be made to assign officers where they can best demonstrate their capabilities. <em>Ineffective performance in one assignment can be, but will not necessarily be, a basis for termination. </em>An officer who is ineffective in one assignment will, where practicable, be given an opportunity to demonstrate improved performance in another assignment. <em>Termination will be considered only after the officer fails to respond to positive efforts to provide him with an opportunity to demonstrate his capabilities.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-10\"><em>Personnel Manual, supra </em>note 7, at \u00a7 C(2). A \u201cboot strap\u201d argument which demonstrated that this provision of the PHS regulations impliedly creates a property interest and at the same time challenged the constitutional sufficiency of the procedural protection provided for that interest by the regulations could not be dismissed on its face. <em>Compare Arnett v. Kennedy, </em>416 U.S. 134, 94 S.Ct. 1633, 40 L.Ed.2d 15 (1974) (in which a majority of the Court appear to have accepted such an argument) <em>with id. </em>at 163, 94 S.Ct. 1633 (where the plurality of three Justices rejected it). <em>But see Ring v. Schlesinger, supra, </em>164 U.S.App.D.C. at 25-27, 502 F.2d at 485-87 (applying the <em>Arnett </em>plurality\u2019s dictum). We need not determine its effect in this case, however, because we do not find that the PHS personnel regulations gave rise to an implied promise that a reserve commissioned officer would only be terminated for \u201ccause\u201d. The first italicized sentence in section C(2), quoted above, sufficiently negates any objective expectancy that arguably might have been created by the second considered alone. Also see <em>Bishop v. Wood, </em>426 U.S. 341, 96 S.Ct. 2074, 48 L.Ed.2d 684 (1976); <em>Sims v.

Appellant might well have argued that his termination for the reasons asserted would have as adverse an impact on his later professional opportunities as would the student\u2019s suspension for misconduct on their futures. Nevertheless, we believe that the holding in <em>Goss </em>is a limited one, circumscribed by the peculiar interests of high school students in the educational process, and should not be further extended to the public employment area generally. This restricted reading of <em>Goss </em>is, we believe, consistent with subsequent decisions in the Supreme Court and the courts of appeals. <em>See Paul v.

Appellant\u2019s oversight must also be considered in the context of what had become a perceptibly poisoned relationship between him and his employing agency, for which the latter, again, was not altogether free of responsibility. See text at notes 7, 12, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b794-9\">. In <em>Gratehouse </em>a career government employee of the Department of HUD sought reinstatement and back pay because of an alleged procedural error by the Civil Service Commission\u2019s Board of Appeals and Review (BAR). The employee had unsuccessfully sought to withdraw his resignation immediately prior to its effective date. When unsuccessful he appealed to the CSC alleging for the first time that his resignation was involuntary. The CSC Appeals Examining Office (AEO) recommended that he be reinstated, but only on the ground that there had been a procedural deficiency in the agency\u2019s denial of the withdrawal. HUD appealed that decision to the BAR which reversed the AEO but apparently without realizing that the employee had made a claim of involuntariness. Approximately two years later, after commencement of proceedings before the district court, the CSC finally offered plaintiff a hearing on his duress claim. However, the CSC insisted that the hearing have retroactive effect and preclude the recovery of any back pay in the event BAR ultimately decided against the plaintiff. Plaintiff refused the CSC\u2019s offer. <em>Gratehouse v. United States, supra </em>at 1107-09.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b794-10\">. As in <em>Gratehouse, </em>we are not confronted with the question of whether res judicata effect should be accorded an agency\u2019s challenged decisi\u00f3n with its concomitant considerations of the desirability of finality. <em>See, e. g., CAB v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>367 U.S. 316, 321, 81 S.Ct. 1611, 6 L.Ed.2d 869 (1961). All we face is the inadvertent omission by an agency to communicate all the notice that was due its employee under prescribed regulations. Thus, properly we believe, the consequences of appellant\u2019s refusal must depend here, as in <em>Gratehouse, </em>simply on the timing and nature of the Service\u2019s offer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b794-16\">.

Thus, plaintiff was entirely justified in refusing the offer, once it was ascertained that any decision arising out of that hearing was to have retroactive effect.

Upon receiving the termination letter of May 2, 1975, appellant must have realized that it failed to state the specific basis for the action as required. Appellant had been given a copy of the applicable procedures, yet he made no attempt to inform the Service of its oversight. Under other circumstances we might consider that the Assistant Secretary\u2019s letter, stating that appellant could not correct his own error in not stating reasons, led him to conclude that correction and reconsideration were unavailable, but here appellant received the Assistant Secretary\u2019s decision more than a month after the Service\u2019s termination notice and after he had already come into court.

The President has, in turn, delegated to the Secretary of HEW his authority to terminate reserve commissions and to prescribe regulations governing such terminations. Exec.

While Reserve Officers could thus be said to serve \u201cat the pleasure\u201d of the President, Maj. Op. at - of 183 U.S.App.D.C., at 709 of 562 F.2d, n. 23, the Executive Order makes clear that it is the President\u2019s \u201cpleasure\u201d that such offices be terminated only in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the Secretary of HEW. And it is, of course, well settled that an agency\u2019s own regulations are binding upon it,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that regulations, as well as statutes, may give rise to a \u201cproperty interest\u201d in employment. <em>See, e. g., Perry v. Sindermann, </em>408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972); and <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, supra. </em>Indeed, as the majority points out, Maj. Op. at - of 183 U.S.App.D.C., at 709 of 562 F.2d, n. 23, both <em>Roth </em>and <em>Perry </em>make clear that even <em>informal </em>\u201crules and understandings\u201d may give rise to such an interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-15\">Accordingly, in order to determine whether Reserve Commissioned Officers of the PHS have a property interest in their employment, we must look to the PHS\u2019 personnel regulations, found at 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.1 <em>et seq. </em>and in the PHS \u201cCommissioned Corps Personnel Manual.\u201d These regulations permit the \u201cinvoluntary separation\u201d of a Reserve Commissioned Officer in only three situations: 1) where the officer\u2019s performance is \u201cmarginal or substandard\u201d; <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 2) where the officer has failed to be promoted within a specified period of time;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 3) where the officer has been found guilty of one of a specified list of offenses (such as \u201cwillful disobedience,\u201d \u201cnegligence,\u201d \u201cexcessive use of drugs or intoxicating liquors,\u201d or the like).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It seems self-evident that separation in any of these three situations would constitute separation for \u201ccause.\u201d And since this is the <em>only </em>kind of separation contemplated by the regulations, I conclude that Reserve Officers do have a protected \u201cproperty interest\u201d in their employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-16\">The majority\u2019s arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. The majority quotes one paragraph from the \u201cCommissioned Corps Personnel Manual\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and then concludes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>apparently solely on the basis of that paragraph\u2019s alleged ambiguity, that \u201cthe PHS personnel regulations [do not give] rise to an implied promise that a reserve commissioned officer would only be terminated for \u2018cause\u2019.\u201d Maj. Op. at-of 183 U.S.App.D.C., at 710 of 562 F.2d, n. 23. However, when the paragraph in question is read in context, this conclusion is insupportable. This paragraph is contained within a section of the Personnel Manual entitled \u201cPersonnel INSTRUCTION 6 \u2014 Involuntary Termination of Reserve Corps Officers\u2019 Commissions <em>for Marginal or Sub-Standard Performance </em>\u201d (emphasis added). Section A.l of this Instruction defines its \u201cpurpose and scope\u201d: \u201cThis instruction states the policy and procedures under which the commissions of Reserve Corps officers will be terminated, without their consent, <em>because of marginal or substandard performance. </em>\u201d Section C. of the Instruction is entitled \u201cpolicy\u201d. Subsection C.l. states flatly that \u201c[l]ess than satisfactory performance will require termination of appointment.\u201d Subsection C.2. \u2014 the passage upon which the majority relies \u2014 merely indicates that this harsh <em>per se </em>rule should be tempered somewhat. This paragraph indicates that even where an individual\u2019s performance <em>has </em>been unsatisfactory, he need not necessarily be separated from the Service, at least in the first instance. The paragraph clearly does <em>not </em>suggest that an individual whose performance <em>has </em>been satisfactory may nonetheless be dismissed. Thus, \u00a7 C.2. is fully consistent with the rest of \u201cPersonnel Instruction 6\u201d and with the other regulations governing the tenure of Reserve Commissioned Officers. Taken together, these regulations indicate that it is the policy of the PHS to dismiss such officers only for \u201ccause\u201d; moreover, even where \u201ccause\u201d is present, dismissal will not be automatic.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-11\">Having determined that appellant could only be dismissed for cause and that he was therefore entitled to the protections of due process, \u201cthe question remains what process is due.\u201d <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 2600, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972). Specifically, we must decide whether the procedures set forth in the PHS regulations satisfy the minimum requirements of the due process clause.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> I conclude that they do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-12\">Under these regulations, an officer whose performance is considered \u201cmarginal or sub-standard\u201d is entitled to notice of the fact that the Service is considering his dismissal and of the specific charges against him; he is then entitled to submit, in writing, his response to those charges. The charges, and the officer\u2019s response to them, are reviewed by an \u201cInvoluntary Separation Board,\u201d which then recommends to the Director of the Commissioned Personnel Operations Division whether the officer should be dismissed. The Director makes the \u201cfinal determination;\u201d if he decides that the officer should be dismissed, the officer is entitled to notice of the \u201cspecific basis\u201d for this action. The officer may then request, in writing, that the Surgeon General (later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>changed to the Assistant Secretary for Health) review this \u201cfinal determination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">In <em>Arnett v. Kennedy, </em>416 U.S. 134, 94 S.Ct. 1633, 40 L.Ed.2d 15 (1974), the Supreme Court upheld the discharge of a non-probationary federal employee. The employee in <em>Kennedy </em>was entitled to pre-termination procedures similar to those described above. In addition, however, the employee in <em>Kennedy </em>was entitled to a post-termination trial-type, evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Six justices in <em>Kennedy </em>agreed that the employee in that case did have a \u201cproperty interest\u201d in his job; those six justices also agreed that \u201cat some time\u201d before such an individual is \u201cfinally deprived of his property interests,\u201d he is entitled to \u201csome kind of hearing.\u201d 416 U.S. at 178, 94 S.Ct. 1633 (White, J., concurring and dissenting). Three of those justices concluded that this requirement was satisfied by a <em>post </em>-termination evidentiary hearing coupled with notice and an opportunity to present written responses to charges prior to termination; the other three of those justices, however, would have required an evidentiary hearing <em>prior </em>to the employee\u2019s termination. In other words, of the six justices in <em>Kennedy </em>who agreed that due process was implicated by the employee\u2019s dismissal, all agreed that that employee was entitled to a trial-type evidentiary hearing, \u201cat some time.\u201d They differed primarily about <em>when </em>such a hearing was required to be held.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-12\">While the guidance provided by the five separate opinions in <em>Kennedy </em>may not be \u201caltogether pellucid,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> I conclude that appellant here was entitled to a trial-type, evidentiary hearing \u201cat some <em>time\u201d </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>either before or after his termination.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Since the PHS regulations make no provision for such a hearing, they do not, in my view, satisfy the minimum requirements of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-13\">As the Supreme Court has recently observed, one factor to be considered in determining what process is actually \u201cdue\u201d in any given case is \u201cthe nature of the relevant inquiry.\u201d <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 343, 96 S.Ct. 893, 907, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976). We must consider, in other words, the extent to which the more limited sort of hearing provided by the PHS regulation poses a \u201crisk of an erroneous deprivation\u201d of appellant\u2019s interests, and \u201cthe probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 335, 96 S.Ct. at 903.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In my view, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>\u201cnature of the . . . inquiry\u201d in the present case makes an evidentiary hearing essential. At issue here is the <em>quality </em>of an individual employee\u2019s performance. Evaluations of the quality of someone\u2019s work are necessarily highly subjective. While such evaluations can, of course, be reduced to writing, testimonial evidence is likely to prove far more reliable; without the possibility of considering demeanor and credibility, the decisionmaker may lack any rational basis for resolving conflicts in opinion. Moreover, where, as here, the employee argues that the ostensible basis for his dismissal (i. e., inadequate performance) is merely a cover, and that he is \u201creally\u201d being dismissed for other, illegitimate reasons (/. e., his exercise of his First Amendment rights), cross-examination of the employee\u2019s superiors may offer the only means by which he could possibly prove his case. <em>Compare </em>Maj. Op. at---of 183 U.S.App.D.C., at 716-717 of 562 F.2d.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">Requiring an evidentiary hearing for employees in Mazaleski\u2019s position should not impose an undue burden on the government, especially if such hearings are provided after the employee\u2019s termination. Indeed, as our judgment in this case makes clear, providing an evidentiary hearing at the administrative level might actually save the government both time and money \u2014 obviously, if appellant had had the opportunity to raise his claims of improper dismissal in a trial-type evidentiary hearing at the administrative level, it is unlikely that he would have been entitled to a trial <em>de novo </em>of those claims in the district court. Accordingly, on remand I would direct the district court to remand this case to the agency, so that it could accord him the evidentiary hearing to which he is entitled under the due process clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-12\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b800-13\">MANUAL: Personnel</p>\n<p id=\"b800-14\">Chapter Series CC \u2014 Commissioned Corps Personnel Manual</p>\n<p id=\"b800-15\">Part 2 \u2014 Commissioned Corps Personnel Administration</p>\n<p id=\"b800-16\">DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND WELFARE</p>\n<p id=\"b800-17\">Public Health Service</p>\n<p id=\"b800-18\">Chapter CC23 \u2014 Staffing</p>\n<p id=\"b800-19\">Sub-Chapter CC23.7 \u2014 Separation</p>\n<p id=\"b800-20\">Personnel INSTRUCTION 6 \u2014 Involuntary Termination of Reserve Corps Officers\u2019 Commissions for Marginal or Sub-Standard Performance</p>\n<p id=\"b800-21\">\n<em>Section A. Purpose and Scope</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b800-22\">1. This Instruction states the policy and procedures under which the commissions of Reserve Corps officers will be terminated, without their consent, because of marginal or sub-standard performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-23\">2. The provisions of this Instruction apply only to Reserve Corps officers with less than 20 years of service. Officers with 20 or more years of service will be considered for involuntary retirement because of substandard performance under the provisions of Personnel Instruction 3, Sub-Chapter CC23.7.</p>\n<p id=\"A-0\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>\n<em>Section B. Authority</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Personnel Instruction 12, Chapter CC33, CCPM, delegates to the Surgeon General and Director, Commissioned Personnel Operations Division, the authority to terminate the commissions of Reserve Corps officers at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">\n<em>Section C. Policy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">1. High performance requirements for all personnel of the Service are essential. Each officer is expected to accomplish his duties effectively and fulfill his responsibility in the conduct of Service programs. Less than satisfactory performance will require termination of appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">2. While the maintenance of high performance standards is essential, insistence on these standards will be combined with consideration of the officer. Continuing efforts will be made to assign officers where they can best demonstrate their capabilities. Ineffective performance in one assignment can be, but will not necessarily be, a basis for termination. An officer who is ineffective in one assignment will, where practicable, be given an opportunity to demonstrate improved performance in another assignment. Termination will be considered only after the officer fails to respond to positive efforts to provide him with an opportunity to demonstrate his capabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">When an officer\u2019s performance is less than satisfactory, the immediate supervisor will be responsible for\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">a. discussing the performance with the officer in person,</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">b. determining the reasons for the unsatisfactory performance, and</p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">c. doing everything possible to assist the officer to improve his performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-13\">Discussion with the officer should not be delayed until an Efficiency and Progress Report is due. It should be held at any time appropriate and sufficiently in advance to give the officer an opportunity to improve his performance before the report is due. The supervisor will then discuss his evaluation of the officer when rating him at the time the regular annual Efficiency and Progress Report is due.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-15\">4. Accurate appraisal and reporting of an officer\u2019s performance is a basic requirement. It is imperative both to the officer and to the Service that reports be candid and objective since they are the basis for personnel actions involving assignment and promotion. While underrating the officer may affect his career, over-rating is of dubious benefit to him since it may lead to assignment and promotion with responsibilities for which he is not, in fact, qualified, thus resulting in adverse action.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-16\">\n<em>Section D. Sub-Standard Performance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b801-17\">1. Sub-standard performance which requires consideration for termination includes any one of the following or similar conditions:</p>\n<p id=\"b801-18\">a. Downward trend in overall performance resulting in an unacceptable record or a consistent record of sub-standard service.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-19\">b. Failure to keep pace or progress with contemporaries (Example: Repeated failure to be recommended for promotion or assimilation into Regular Corps.)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-20\">c. Failure to discharge properly assignments commensurate with his grade and experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-21\">d. Attitudes or characteristics indicating inability or unwillingness to expend effort or to function in typical work situations commensurate with officer\u2019s grade.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-22\">\n<em>Section E. Initiating Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b801-23\">1. Operating programs will be primarily responsible for initiating action when an officer\u2019s performance is considered inadequate. Recommendations for termination of commission will be made to the Director, Commissioned Personnel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>Operations Division by the appropriate Agency Head, giving specific reason(s) and shall include all pertinent supporting facts, including but not limited to the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">a. Summary of all past and current discussions with the officer and his superiors concerning the officer\u2019s performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">b. Statement regarding action to place officer in suitable assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">c. Current evaluation by superiors of the officer\u2019s performance in his present assignment, including whether the responsibilities are or are not in line with the grade held.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">2.. Officers whose performance is considered inadequate will also be identified by the Commissioned Personnel Operations Division for possible consideration for termination based on (a) review of officer\u2019s Efficiency and Progress Reports, and (b) recommendations of Promotion Boards when the officer fails to be recommended for promotion or assimilation into the Regular Corps.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">When identified by the Commissioned Personnel Operations Division, the case will be referred to the appropriate Agency Head for review and report of findings and recommendations. Such referral will not necessarily be to precipitate adverse action but to determine what other course of action, if any, can be taken. No officer will be considered for termination until all the facts to make such a determination are obtained and reviewed. The Agency\u2019s review and any discussions with the officer will be made with this understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">Report and recommendation of the Agencies will give specific reasons and be supported with reports listed in paragraph 1 of this Section. These reports will be submitted whether or not the Agency recommends termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">\n<em>Section F. Review and Board Referral</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">1. Recommendations submitted by the Agencies will be reviewed by the Director, Commissioned Personnel Operations Division. If the facts indicate that termination should be considered, the case will be referred to an Involuntary Separation Board (see Section G). The Director, Commissioned Personnel Operations Division, will notify the officer, through channels, giving specific reason(s) for the referral. At this time, the officer may\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b802-13\">a. Enter into the record any pertinent facts or statement on his behalf for consideration by the Board; or</p>\n<p id=\"b802-14\">b. Resign.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-15\">\n<em>Section G. Board Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b802-16\">1. Involuntary Separation Boards will be appointed and convened by the Director, Commissioned Personnel Operations' Division, as the need occurs. Such Boards will consist of at least three senior officers, if possible, of the same profession or category as the officer being considered for separation. No board member will be part of the administrative line which considered the case in the review by the Agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-17\">2. Board recommendations will be based on the material in the records submitted to them for review and any other material which each Board may find necessary to add to the record to supplement or clarify previous notations in the record. Upon conclusion of its review, the Board will submit a report to the Director, Commissioned Personnel Operations Division, stating the issues, the findings of fact, and recommendations to\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b802-18\">a. terminate the officer\u2019s commission, or</p>\n<p id=\"b802-19\">b. continue officer on active duty (with or without reassignment, including demotion if officer is holding temporary grade).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-20\">\n<em>Section H. Action Following Board Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b802-21\">1. Upon receipt and consideration of the Board\u2019s report and recommendation, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>Director, Commissioned Personnel Operations Division, will make the final determination and notify the officer of the decision. Notice to the officer will be transmitted to the Agency Head for delivery to the officer by an appropriate official who will obtain and forward to the Director, Commissioned Personnel Operations Division, the officer\u2019s written acknowledgement of its receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">2. If the decision is to terminate the officer\u2019s commission, notice to the officer will include the specific basis for the action, and the date of termination (as determined between the Commissioned Personnel Operations Division and the program). To the extent possible and justified by the circumstances, the date of termination will be determined to give the officer a reasonable period within which to formulate plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">\n<em>Section I. Review by the Surgeon General</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">1. An officer may request a review by the Surgeon General of the decision to terminate his commission. Request must be made within 10 days from the date the officer receives notice of the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">2. Request for review will be made in writing giving reasons as to why he should be continued on active duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">3. The Surgeon General\u2019s decision will be final.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND WELFARE T.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">PRS-CC 162 8/14/69</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b797-9\">. <em>See, e. g., Accardi v.

The paragraph quoted by the majority is found at \u00a7 C.2. of Personnel Instruction 6. <em>See </em>n. 2 <em>supra. </em>This paragraph reads in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-19\">While the maintenance of high performance standards is essential, insistence on these standards will be combined with consideration of the officer. Continuing efforts will be made to assign officers where they can best demonstrate their capabilities. Ineffective performance in one assignment can be, but will not necessarily be, a basis for termination.

As noted <em>supra, </em>the majority has held, and I agree, that the PHS has failed to abide by the procedures set forth in its own regulations; this failure would require reversal here, whether or not those regulations satisfy the requirements of due process. In my view, however, we must nonetheless reach the constitutional issue, in order to determine the appropriate remedy in this case; in other words, we must decide what procedures are required by due process, so that we may specify what \u201cprocess\u201d is \u201cdue\u201d appellant on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Moreover, as the majority appears to concede, Maj. Op. at-of 183 U.S.App.D.C., at 710 of 526 F.2d, n. 23, the fact that appellant\u2019s \u201cproperty interest\u201d in his job was, in effect, created by the PHS regulations does not mean that those same regulations necessarily circumscribe the procedural protections to which appellant is entitled before he may be deprived of that \u201cproperty interest.\u201d <em>See Arnett v. Kennedy, </em>416 U.S. 134, 94 S.Ct. 1633, 40 L.Ed.2d 15 (1974). \u201cWhile the State may define what is and what is not property, once having defined those rights the Constitution defines due process, and as I understand it six members of the Court are in agreement on this fundamental proposition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 185, 94 S.Ct. at 1660 (White, J., concurring and dissenting). <em>Cf. Ring v. Schlesinger, </em>164 U.S.App.D.C. 19, 502 F.2d 479 (1974), in which a panel of this court appears to adopt, at least in dicta, the position explicitly rejected by the majority in <em>Kennedy.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b799-7\">. The remaining three justices, in an opinion by Justice Rehnquist, concluded that whatever property interest Kennedy had in his employment \u201cwas itself conditioned by the procedural limitations which had accompanied the grant of that interest.\u201d 416 U.S. at 155, 94 S.Ct. at 1645.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b799-8\">.

While, in light of <em>Kennedy, </em>the government may provide such a \u201cfull hearing\u201d <em>following </em>an employee\u2019s termination, it may not, of course, dispense with the more limited <em>pre </em>-termination procedures provided for by both the PHS regulations at issue here and by the statute at issue in <em>Kennedy. A </em>post-termination trial-type evidentiary hearing is required <em>in addition to, </em>not instead of, pre-termination notice and opportunity to respond to charges. <em>See Kennedy v. Robb, </em>547 F.2d 408 (8th Cir. 1976), <em>pet. for cert. filed, </em>45 U.S.L.W. 3622 (February 26, 1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b799-15\">. The <em>Eldridge </em>opinion cites two other factors that should be considered in determining \u201cthe specific dictates of due process\u201d in a given case: 1) \u201cthe private interest that will be affected by the official action;\u201d and 2) \u201cthe Government\u2019s interest, including the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\u201d 424 U.S. at 335, 96 S.Ct. at 903. As the Court\u2019s discussion in <em>Eldridge </em>makes clear, these two factors are primarily relevant in determining \u201cwhat process is due prior to the initial termination of benefits, pending review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 333, 96 S.Ct. at 902 (emphasis added). They may be less helpful in determining whether particular procedural protections are required at <em>all, </em>either before or after the initial termination of benefits. The issue in <em>Eldridge </em>was whether a recipient of Social Security disability benefits was entitled to an evidentiary hearing prior to the termination of such benefits. Since the relevant Social Security regulations provided for a <em>post </em>-termination evidentiary hearing, the issue of whether due process required such a hearing \u201cat some time\u201d did not arise in that case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b800-8\">. The Court in <em>Eldridge </em>concluded that \u201cthe nature of the relevant inquiry\u201d in a Social Security disability case made a pre-termination, trial-type hearing less necessary than in a welfare case. The Court noted that the decision to discontinue Social Security benefits depended primarily upon \u201ca medical assessment of the worker\u2019s physical or mental condition . . . 424 U.S. at 343, 96 S.Ct. at 907. \u201cThis is a more sharply focused and easily documented decision than the typical determination of welfare entitlement. In the latter case, a wide variety of information may be deemed relevant, and issues of witness credibility and veracity often are critical to the decisionmaking process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 343-44, 96 S.Ct. at 907. The decision to dismiss an employee for \u201cmarginal or sub-standard\u201d performance obviously has far more in common with this description of a welfare termination decision, than with a decision regarding the termination of disability benefits, which \u201cwill turn, in most cases, upon \u2018routine, standard, and unbiased medical reports by physician specialists.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 344, 96 S.Ct. at 907 (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
