Stated in full, the question is whether deficiencies properly subjected to interest charges<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> arose in plaintiff\u2019s 1958 and 1959 federal income tax returns when, in 1961, plaintiff changed from claiming a foreign tax credit<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to claiming foreign taxes paid as a deduction<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from its taxable income for 1958 and 1959 in order to obtain maximum benefit of a net operating loss carryback<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>arising in 1961. In essence, however, the issue becomes whether plaintiff\u2019s \u201c1961 choice\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to change from crediting to deducting foreign taxes paid by it <em>relates back </em>to the filing dates of plaintiff\u2019s 1958 and 1959 federal tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s 1961 choice, if it relates back, gives rise to deficiencies in plaintiff\u2019s 1958 and 1959 returns on which the Internal Revenue Service (IRS or Service) properly assessed interest from the due dates of those returns to December 1961 pursuant to Internal Revenue Code of 1954, \u00a7 6601(e). Plaintiff, however, claims that the 1961 change does not relate back because it was \u201ccaused by\u201d a net operating loss occurring in 1961. Defendant argues that the 1961 choice does relate back and that the impact of the 1961 loss carryback is irrelevant to the assessment of interest on plaintiff\u2019s 1958 and 1959 tax liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-6\">Upon consideration of the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment and the stipulated facts, and having heard oral argument, we hold for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-7\">On General Dynamics\u2019 1958 and 1959 federal income tax returns, it claimed foreign taxes paid as a credit against its federal tax liability. IRC \u00a7 901. Subsequently, a net operating loss carryback from 1961 eliminated all plaintiff\u2019s federal tax liability for 1958 and 1959, without regard to credits for foreign taxes paid by plaintiff. Because of the limitations imposed by IRC \u00a7 904(d),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> plaintiff was not able to carry unused foreign tax credits from 1958 and 1959 to other taxable years. After 1961 and during the audit for 1958 and 1959, plaintiff therefore timely chose to claim the foreign taxes paid by it as deductions under \u00a7 164,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> rather than as credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-13\">The effect of General Dynamics\u2019 choice to deduct rather than credit was to reduce the portions of the 1961 loss carryback absorbed by plaintiff\u2019s taxable income for 1958 and 1959, and thus to increase the amount of the loss available to be carried to other taxable years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-14\">If General Dynamics had originally claimed the foreign taxes paid as deductions rather than credits, the effect would have been to increase plaintiff\u2019s federal tax liability (before taking into account the 1961 loss carryback) by the amounts of $1,161,820.03 for 1958 and $1,795,903.61 for 1959. After audit by the IRS, interest was assessed and paid by taxpayer upon these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>amounts,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> from the due dates of the 1958 and 1959 returns to December 31, 1961, the date when the loss carryback arose. For 1958, interest assessed (and paid) was $207,-383.62; for 1959, the amount was $431,-349.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-4\">The IRS does not assert a right to the deficiencies <em>per se </em>in plaintiff\u2019s 1958 and 1959 federal tax liability found when the foreign taxes paid were taken as deductions. The deficiencies were properly and completely eliminated by the application of the 1961 loss carryback to plaintiff\u2019s 1958 and 1959 tax liability. At issue is whether interest was properly assessed. Plaintiff, after paying the interest assessments, filed for a refund with the IRS. The Service denied plaintiff\u2019s claim for refund; General Dynamics then timely brought this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-5\">Plaintiff claims that since there were no deficiencies in its 1958 and 1959 federal tax returns <em>prior </em>to the existence of the 1961 net operating loss carryback, it should not have to pay interest on deficiencies arising <em>after </em>the 1961 carryback because the deficiencies were both caused and eliminated by the carryback. In short, plaintiff says because it never owed the deficiencies, it should not have to pay interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-6\">To support this position, plaintiff argues that \u00a7 6601, the interest provision, is merely a codification of <em>Manning v. Seeley Tube &amp; Box Co., </em>338 U.S. 561, 70 S.Ct. 386, 94 L.Ed. 346 (1950). <em>Seeley, </em>contends plaintiff, allows the collection of interest only on deficiencies that arise <em>before </em>a subsequent loss carryback comes into existence, and controls the instant case. In addition, plaintiff points to two revenue rulings and case law of this court as authority for its theory that the 1961 choice does not relate back to the filing dates of its 1958 and 1959 tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-7\">Defendant, in opposition, argues that General Dynamics\u2019 1961 choice relates back and, therefore, that interest was properly collected. The IRS takes the position that only plaintiff\u2019s final choice (to deduct foreign taxes) is determinative of tax liability. To hold otherwise, urges defendant, allows plaintiff to shield money owed the Government behind a combination of the foreign tax credit and loss carryback provisions. For support of its position, the Government also looks to <em>Seeley, supra, </em>and to the language and history of the applicable code sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-10\">We hold for defendant. The statutes prohibit the type of \u201cdouble coverage\u201d plaintiff seeks. Under relevant code sections and the theory of <em>Seeley, </em>plaintiff\u2019s 1961 decision relates back to the filing dates of its 1958 and 1959 returns. Plaintiff properly owes the interest in question in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-11\">Plaintiff begins with an analysis of <em>Manning v. Seeley Tube &amp; Box Co., supra.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> Seeley, </em>claims plaintiff, sanctions the collection of interest only on deficiencies present in a taxpayer\u2019s return <em>before </em>the existence of a loss carryback that eliminates the deficiencies. Since \u00a7 6601 is a codification of <em>Seeley, </em>plaintiff continues, interest was improperly assessed in the instant case because the deficiencies arose <em>after </em>the loss carryback came into existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-12\">In <em>Seeley, </em>taxpayer filed a return claiming a deduction to which it was not entitled and, therefore, understated its tax liability. After the deficiency in tax for the original year had been assessed and collected (together with interest), a net operating loss arose. The loss, carried back to the year of the defective return, eliminated taxpayer\u2019s liability regardless of the improperly claimed deduction. Under the 1939 Code, taxpayer took the position that as a consequence of the carryback, there was no deficiency in tax for the year of the defective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>return; there was nothing on which interest could be assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-4\">The Supreme Court, however, decided for the Government:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1279-5\">. As of a certain date the taxpayer has a duty to file a return for the previous fiscal year and pay the amount of the tax actually due for that year. . (footnote omitted)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1279-6\">. From the date the original return was to be filed until the date the deficiency was actually assessed, the taxpayer had a positive obligation to the United States: a duty to pay its tax. See <em>Rodgers v. United States, </em>332 U.S. 371, 374, 68 S.Ct. 5, 7, 92 L.Ed. 3 (1947); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Childs, </em>266 U.S. 304, 309-10 [45 S.Ct. 110, 111, 69 L.Ed. 299] (1924); <em>Billings v. United States, </em>232 U.S. 261, 285-87, 34 S.Ct. 421, 425-426, 58 L.Ed. 596 (1914). For that period the taxpayer, by its failure to pay the taxes owed, had the use of funds which rightfully should have been in the possession of the United States. The fact that the statute permits the taxpayer subsequently to avoid the payment of that debt in no way indicates that the taxpayer is to derive the benefits of the funds for the intervening period. In the absence of a clear legislative expression to the contrary, the question of who properly should possess the right of use of the money owed the Government for the period it is owed must be answered in favor of the Government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1279-7\"><em>Manning v. Seeley Tube &amp; Box Co., supra, </em>338 U.S. at 565-66, 70 S.Ct. at 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-8\">According to plaintiffs interpretation, <em>Seeley </em>allows the assessment of interest on deficiencies only when the original return filed by the taxpayer is defective. For only then, plaintiff takes <em>Seeley </em>to mean, does the taxpayer have the use of money properly belonging to the Government. In the instant case, to follow plaintiff\u2019s line of reasoning, <em>Seeley </em>does not apply because the taxpayer\u2019s original return was not defective. As it was not defective, plaintiff never had use of money belonging to the defendant and should not be assessed interest charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-11\">The \u201cwatershed\u201d fact for plaintiff then, is that in <em>Seeley, </em>the taxpayer\u2019s original return was defective, while in the case at bar, plaintiff\u2019s return was correct. Because the original return was correct, plaintiff argues its subsequent change in election does not relate back to the filing dates of its 1958 and 1959 returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-12\">Plaintiff, to a point, is correct. <em>Seeley </em>does stand for the proposition that a taxpayer cannot avoid interest charges on deficiencies existing in a defective return by the application of a subsequent net operating loss carryback. However, in our opinion, <em>Seeley </em>also stands for the general proposition, codified in \u00a7 6601(e), that for interest purposes, the tax for a year is computed without consideration to a net operating loss carried back to that year. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Seeley:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1279-13\"><em>. </em>As of a certain date the taxpayer has a duty to file a return for the previous fiscal year and pay the amount of the tax actually due for that year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A44\"><em>Seeley, supra, </em>338 U.S. at 565, 70 S.Ct. at 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-14\">Applied to the instant case, we interpret the Supreme Court\u2019s language as meaning that the filing dates of plaintiff\u2019s 1958 and 1959 returns are determinative of plaintiff\u2019s tax liability for those years. The subsequent change in plaintiff\u2019s returns relates back to these dates. Following plaintiff\u2019s change from claiming the foreign tax credit to claiming a deduction for foreign taxes paid, plaintiff\u2019s tax liability should be calculated as if the foreign tax credit had never been invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-15\">We find additional support for this position in the relevant code sections. First, we examine the foreign tax credit and deduction sections. The statutory and legislative history of \u00a7 901 (foreign tax credit) make it clear that plaintiff is entitled to the benefits of either the foreign tax credit or the deduction, but not both.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In addition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>\u00a7 164(b)(6)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is to the same effect. Section 164(b)(6) allows the deduction of foreign taxes paid only if the taxpayer does not, \u201cto any extent,\u201d choose the benefits of the foreign tax credit, \u00a7 901.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-4\">In this case, plaintiff had the benefit of the foreign tax credit for three years. From the 1958 and 1959 filing dates, plaintiff had the use of money that, had plaintiff originally claimed the foreign taxes as deductions, properly belonged to the Government. The benefit derived from this use may be valued by the amount of interest the IRS assessed plaintiff \u2014 the subject of this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-5\">After plaintiff elected to amend its return to reflect the use of the foreign tax deduction, it gained the benefit of the deduction in addition to the benefit it had already received through the application of the foreign tax credit. Deducting the foreign taxes paid allowed plaintiff to reduce its taxable income for 1958 and 1959. This reduction also resulted in a concomitant reduction in the amount of the 1961 net operating loss needed to eliminate plaintiff\u2019s taxable income for those two years. More of the 1961 loss was then available to be carried to other years (pursuant to \u00a7 172) to reduce plaintiff\u2019s taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-6\">In order to prevent this double benefit, disallowed by \u00a7\u00a7 901 and 164(b)(6), we must eliminate the benefits plaintiff received from its three-year use of the foreign tax credit. For, as was discussed <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 164(b)(6) allows the deduction of foreign taxes only if the taxpayer does not, \u201cto any extent\u201d choose the benefits of the foreign tax credit. In this case, eliminating plaintiff\u2019s benefits under the foreign tax credit is achieved by having plaintiff\u2019s 1961 choice to deduct the foreign taxes relate back to the filing dates of the 1958 and 1959 returns. It is only by giving <em>retroactive effect </em>to plaintiff\u2019s ultimate decision to deduct (rather than credit) the foreign taxes that we can abide by the Congressional directive set forth in \u00a7 164(b)(6).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1280-10\">To hold otherwise would allow a taxpayer, hypothetically, the free use of money properly owed the Government. It would, in effect, grant a taxpayer license to \u201crelate back\u201d in order to obtain special benefits for itself, and yet deny the Government the logical corollary also to \u201crelate back\u201d with respect to tax consequences. It would allow a taxpayer, in a sense, to work a species of the age-old \u201cshell game\u201d on the Government. In year one, a taxpayer could \u201ccover\u201d money by means of the foreign tax credit. Then, in year three, taxpayer could replace the foreign tax credit with the loss carryback. And, finally, operating underneath the \u201cshell\u201d of the loss carryback, taxpayer could change from credit to deduction of foreign taxes, thereby extending the application of the loss carryback to other years, while retaining three years\u2019 free use of the money hidden beneath the foreign tax credit shell.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-11\">This would violate the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Seeley </em>decision by giving plaintiff the use of money \u201cwhich rightfully should have been in the possession of the United States,\u201d <em>Seeley, supra, </em>338 U.S. at 566. It would also violate \u00a7\u00a7 901 and 164 of the Internal Revenue Code by improperly allowing plaintiff the benefit both of the foreign tax credit and the foreign tax deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-12\">Second, we look to the Code section under which interest was assessed in this case, \u00a7 6601. This section also refutes plaintiff\u2019s reading of <em>Seeley </em>and supports our position. The general rule of \u00a7 6601 is that interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>runs from the \u201clast date prescribed for payment.\u201d IRC \u00a7 6601(a). Subsection (c) of \u00a7 6601 provides that \u201cthe last date prescribed for payment of the tax\u201d is determined under chapter 62. Section 6151 of chapter 62 points out that the last date for payment is the \u201ctime and place fixed for filing the return.\u201d <em>See also </em>IRC \u00a7 6072.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-5\">In plaintiffs case, the \u201clast date[s] prescribed for payment\u201d were the filing dates of its 1958 and 1959 returns \u2014 \u201cthe time .' fixed for filing the return[s]\u201d as specified by \u00a7 6151. It is from these two dates, then, that plaintiff\u2019s tax liability is calculated. Because of this, we are again led to the conclusion that plaintiff\u2019s 1961 change altering its 1958 and 1959 returns must relate back to the filing dates of the returns for 1958 and 1959. To read \u00a7 6601 <em>et a1. </em>differently would do violence to the plain meaning of those sections. <em>Bergen v. United States, </em>Ct.Cl. No. 356-74 (April 20, 1977) Slip Op., n.3; <em>Selman v. United States, </em>204 Ct.Cl. 675, 680, 498 F.2d 1354, 1356 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-6\">The final Code provision appropriate for examination is \u00a7 6211, which defines \u201cdeficiency.\u201d As one might expect, the statutory language provides, generally, that a deficiency is the amount by which the tax imposed by the applicable subtitle exceeds the amount shown as the tax by the taxpayer upon his return. IRC \u00a7 6211(a). However, the regulations speak more specifically to the problem now before the court. Reg. \u00a7 301.6211-l(a) (1962) defines deficiency as including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1281-7\">Additional tax shown on an \u201camended return,\u201d so-called, filed after the due date of the return .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1281-10\">Applying this language to the instant case, we think that plaintiff\u2019s 1961 choice created deficiencies in its 1958 and 1959 returns. First, plaintiff filed a document which <em>amended </em>its returns. This amendment caused additional taxes to show on those returns. Such additional taxes are deficiencies in plaintiff\u2019s 1958 and 1959 returns within the meaning of the Code and Regulation \u00a7 301.6211-l(a) (1962). Therefore, in order to make plaintiff\u2019s returns properly reflect these deficiencies, plaintiff\u2019s 1961 choice must relate back to the filing dates of its 1958 and 1959 returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-12\">Section 6211, then, like \u00a7\u00a7 901, 164, and 6601, supports the court\u2019s position \u2014 that plaintiff\u2019s 1961 choice relates back to the filing dates of plaintiff\u2019s 1958 and 1959 returns. Plaintiff\u2019s total tax liability (including interest) must, as a result, be calculated as if the foreign tax credit had never been invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-13\">Plaintiff, in addition to its <em>Seeley </em>-based argument, also claims that there is \u201cclear authority for the proposition that \u00a7 6601(e) does not apply to a deficiency created by a carryback.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s authority consists of two Revenue Rulings, neither of which is controlling in this case. The first, Rev.Rule. 66-317, 1966-2 C.B. 510, involved the elimination of a taxpayer\u2019s use of the investment credit (IRC \u00a7 38) by a subsequent loss carryback. The Service ruled that \u00a7 6601(e) did not apply to the portion of the 1963 tax originally offset by the investment credit. Taxpayer was not required to pay interest for the period running from the due date of the return to the end of the loss year on that portion of its tax liability eliminated by the loss carry-back deduction because that portion of its tax liability was properly offset by the investment credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-14\">Contrary to plaintiff\u2019s statement, Revenue Ruling 66-317 did not involve a \u201cdeficiency created by a carryback.\u201d No deficiency ever existed. Taxpayer, prior to the application of the loss carryback, had properly claimed the investment credit. Following the application of the carryback, the investment credit was no longer available.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-15\">On this ground alone, we could deny the application of Revenue Ruling 66-317; it simply does not stand for the proposition for which plaintiff needs support. But there is an additional reason why it does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-16\">If the instant case concerned only the issue of whether plaintiff should pay interest on the amount of tax liability originally offset by the application of the foreign tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>credit, then the ruling might apply. For in that situation, plaintiff, like the taxpayer in Rev.Rul. 66-317, never owed taxes to the Government. But in the instant case, plaintiff, because its 1961 choice relates back, is not claiming the foreign tax credit; it is seeking to deduct foreign taxes from its taxable income. When the foreign taxes are taken as deductions, deficiencies exist in plaintiff\u2019s 1958 and 1959 returns. For these deficiencies plaintiff owes interest, and because of the deficiencies, Rev.Rul. 66-317 does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s second Revenue Ruling, Rev. Rui. 71-534,1971-2 C.B. 414, is also inapplicable. In that Ruling, taxpayer chose (and did not change that choice) to credit foreign taxes paid for 1966. In 1969, a net operating loss occurred, and the loss was carried back to 1966, eliminating all taxable income and tax liability for that year. Taxpayer then filed a refund claim for 1964, carrying back the unused portion of the foreign tax credits from 1966. The question was whether interest on the overpayment for 1964 began to run from the end of 1966, or from the end of 1969. Resolution of the issue involved an interpretation of two apparently conflicting subsections of \u00a7 6611.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Ruling (pro-Government) held that overpayment interest ran from the end of 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-5\">Thus plaintiff now says that when the Government has to pay interest the <em>latest </em>date is used, but when the taxpayer may owe interest, the Government conveniently shifts its position to the <em>earlier </em>date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-6\">However, the situation in the instant case is governed by a different Code section \u2014 \u00a7 6601(e) \u2014 which states that a net operating loss carryback that reduces the amount of tax owed by a taxpayer shall \u201cnot affect the computation of interest.\u201d To put the matter simply, Revenue Ruling 71-534 involved a Code section which specifically allows a loss carryback to affect the computation of interest while the case at bar involves a section which specifically does not. For this reason, Revenue Ruling 71-534 does not apply to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-10\">As a final defense against relating back, plaintiff argues that the law of this court, as embodied in <em>E.I. DuPont DeNemours &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>137 Ct.Cl. 191, 147 F.Supp. 486 (1957), prevents the retroactive application of its 1961 choice. Again plaintiff\u2019s reliance is misplaced. <em>DuPont </em>involved the construction of the excess profits tax provisions of the Code which specifically allowed for a deferral of payment. Unlike <em>DuPont, </em>this case does not involve a statute which allows a taxpayer to defer its tax liability or to postpone its obligations to pay its tax until a final decision as to the method of tax treatment is made. Neither \u00a7 901(a) nor \u00a7 6601(e) even hints that a taxpayer can defer its tax obligations by changing from crediting to deducting foreign taxes. In fact, as discussed <em>supra, </em>these sections and \u00a7 164(b)(6) lead the court to the conclusion that plaintiff\u2019s tax liability is to be calculated as of the filing dates of its 1958 and 1959 1958 and 1959 returns, based only on plaintiff\u2019s <em>final </em>decision to deduct the foreign taxes and not based on plaintiff\u2019s interim, intermediate steps en route.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-11\">In summary, plaintiff\u2019s reliance on <em>Seeley </em>and Revenue Rulings 66-137 and 71-534 is misplaced. The fact that the deficiencies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>were supposedly \u201ccaused by\u201d the 1961 net operating loss does not prevent plaintiff\u2019s 1961 choice to deduct foreign taxes from relating back to the filing dates of plaintiff\u2019s 1958 and 1959 federal income tax returns. In fact, <em>Seeley, </em>the foreign tax credit and deduction sections and the interest provisions of the Code require that plaintiff\u2019s 1961 choice relate back.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-5\">Accordingly, upon consideration of the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment and the stipulated facts, and having heard oral argument, we hold for defendant.
