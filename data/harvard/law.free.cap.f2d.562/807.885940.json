This petition for review, brought by a large independent producer of motor oil additives, raises two problems: the proper forum for review of these EPA regulations, and the intended scope of the statutory terms \u201cfuel or fuel additive.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finding that this court has exclusive original jurisdiction to review these regulations, we hold that they exceed the statutory mandate of Section 211 insofar as they apply to motor oil and motor oil additives.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-17\">I. THE STATUTORY, REGULATORY, AND FACTUAL SETTING</p>\n<p id=\"b882-18\">With respect to the environmental impact of automobiles, the Clean Air Act of 1963,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as amended by the Motor Vehicle Air Pollution Control Act of 1965,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> originally directed its regulatory efforts toward controlling pollutants emitted from the tailpipes of motor vehicles. With the passage in 1967 of the Air Quality Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> however, the Act also began to devote some attention to the \u201cfuel\u201d used in the engines of motor vehicles that might contribute to those emissions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the 1967 revisions, then codified in Section 210 of the Act, contemplated only the registration of and limited reporting on those fuels, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> replaced Section 210 with a new</p>\n<p id=\"b883-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>section, 211, which expanded the reporting requirements and allowed the EPA, on the basis of the information filed and other data, to restrict the sale of environmentally dangerous \u201cfuels and fuel additives.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In its current form, Section 211, in relevant part, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-4\">(a) The Administrator may by regulation designate any fuel or fuel additive and, after such date or dates as may be prescribed by him, no manufacturer or processor of any such fuel or additive may sell, offer for sale, or introduce into commerce such fuel or additive unless the Administrator has registered such fuel or additive in accordance with subsection (b) of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-5\">(b) (1) For the purpose of registration of fuels and fuel additives, the Administrator shall require\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-6\">(A) the manufacturer of any fuel to notify him as to the commercial identifying name and manufacturer of any additive contained in such fuel; the range of concentration of any additive in the fuel; and the purpose-in-use of any such additive; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-7\">(B) the manufacturer of any additive to notify him as to the chemical composition of such additive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-8\">(2) For the purpose of registration of fuels and fuel additives, the Administrator may also require the manufacturer of any fuel or fuel additive\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-9\">(A) to conduct tests to determine potential public health effects of such fuel or additive (including, but not limited to, carcinogenic, teratogenic, or mutagenic effects), and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-10\">(B) to furnish the description of any analytical technique that can be used to detect and measure any additive in such fuel, the recommended range of concentration of such additive, and the recommended purpose-in-use of such additive, and such other information as is reasonable and necessary to determine the emissions resulting from the use of the fuel or additive contained in such fuel, the effect of such fuel or additive on the emission control performance of any vehicle or vehicle engine, or the extent to which such emissions affect the public health or welfare.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-13\">Tests under subparagraph (A) shall be conducted in conformity with test procedures and protocols established by the Administrator. The result of such tests shall not be considered confidential.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-14\">(3) Upon compliance with the provision of this subsection, including assurances that the Administrator will receive changes in the information required, the Administrator shall register such fuel or fuel additive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-15\">(c) (1) The Administrator may, from time to time on the basis of information obtained under subsection (b) of this section or other information available to him, by regulation, control or prohibit the manufacture, introduction into commerce, offering for sale, or sale of any fuel or fuel additive for use in a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine (A) if any emission products of such fuel or fuel additive will endanger the public health or welfare, or (B) if emission products of such fuel or fuel additive will impair to a significant degree the performance of any emission control device or system which is in general use, or which the Administrator finds has been developed to a point where in a reasonable time it would be in general use were such regulation to be promulgated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-16\">(d) Any person who violates subsection (a) of this section or the regulations prescribed under subsection (c) of this section or who fails to furnish any information required by the Administrator under subsection (b) of this section shall forfeit and pay to the United States a civil penalty of $10,000 for each and every day of the continuance of such violation, which shall accrue to the United States and be recovered in a civil suit in the name of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>the United States, brought in the district where such person has his principal office or in any district in which he does business. The Administrator may, upon application therefor, remit or mitigate any forfeiture provided for in this subsection and he shall have authority to determine the facts upon all such applications. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857f-6c (1970 and Supp. V).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">In part, the statutory trend, reflected in the passage of Section 211, toward regulation of materials burned in motor vehicle engines, is a necessary corollary to the Act\u2019s original focus on purification of tailpipe emissions. Tests have demonstrated the need to control certain substances that are burned in automobile engines in order to curtail their corrosive effects on the catalytic devices otherwise found most effective in purifying emissions at the tailpipe stage. <em>See generally International Harvester Co. v. Ruckelshaus, </em>155 U.S.App.D.C. 411, 478 F.2d 615, 624-28 (1973). In addition, this statutory development reflects the increasing sophistication of scientific research into the comparative levels and types of pollutants generated by the combustion of different materials in motor vehicle engines.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">Although the administrative definitions of \u201cfuel\u201d under both the 1967 and 1970 revisions to the Act consistently have characterized that term broadly as \u201cany material which is capable of releasing energy or power by combustion or other physical reaction,\u201d 35 Fed.Reg. 9282 (1970), <em>repromulgated in </em>36 Fed.Reg. 22,419 (1971), <em>amended in </em>40 Fed.Reg. 52,009 (1975), <em>codified in </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 79.2(c) (1976), the regulations promulgated under the 1967 amendments, 35 Fed.Reg. 9282, 9284 (1970), and initially re-promulgated under the 1970 amendments, 36 Fed.Reg. 22,419, 22,421 (1971), only required the registration of additives to \u201cfuels commonly or commercially known or sold as gasoline.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Apparently spurred by the accumulating scientific data concerning the potentially harmful effects of pollutants and corrosives caused by the combustion of motor lubricants and lubricant additives that inevitably enter the propulsion systems of motor vehicles,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> EPA in 1974 proposed new regulations, 39 Fed.Reg. 8929 (1974), which expanded the materials subject to the registration and reporting requirements under the Act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> These new regulations reached additives to \u201cmoto\u00a1r vehicle engine oil,\u201d such as those produced by petitioner. <em>Id. </em>at 8931.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>The regulations required producers of such additives, if they wished to sell them on or after May 7, 1976, to file registration forms at least 90 days prior to selling them, or 30 days prior to selling any new additive developed after May 7, 1976. The forms required the manufacturer to provide available information concerning the chemical composition of the additive (and methods of determining it), the chemical structure of each compound in the additive, an analytical technique for detecting the presence and measuring the concentration of the additive in a designated \u201cfuel,\u201d the recommended uses of the additive, the mechanisms of action of the additive in the engine, the emission products- and toxicity thereof of the additive, and the effects of the additive on emission control devices. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 79.21, 79.31 (1976).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\">Not surprisingly, members of the motor oil and motor oil additive industry, including petitioner, reacted unfavorably to the new regulations, arguing that they, in conjunction with the older, but until then not fully utilized, broad definition of \u201cfuel,\u201d reached products over which the EPA had no statutory authority.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Nonetheless, EPA chose to stand by \u201cthis broad definition of fuel,\u201d arguing that it coincided with a congressional intent \u201cto grant authority encompassing all materials which might affect the emission products of combustion and thus the public health and welfare.\u201d 40 Fed.Red. 52,009 (1975). Because some lubricants and additives to them that are used in motor vehicle engines, although introduced into the combustion chamber for <em>lubrication </em>purposes, are burned and thus \u201cmight affect the emission products,\u201d EPA argued that they fall within Section 211\u2019s registration mandate. <em>Id. </em>Consequently, on November 7, 1975, EPA promulgated the regulations challenged here, which required petitioner, by February 7, 1976, to provide EPA with the specified information about the over 200 lubricant additives it desired to market on or after May 7, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">Having unsuccessfully opposed the inclusion of motor oil additives in the proposed regulations, petitioner, on December 8, 1975, filed this petition to review the regulations under Section 307(b)(1) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857h-5(b)(l) (Supp. V 1975), which gives this court exclusive jurisdiction to review EPA actions \u201cin promulgating any control or prohibition under section [211, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7] 1857f-6c . . .\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">Approximately a month after filing this action, petitioner also filed a \u201cparallel\u201d complaint and motion for preliminary injunction in the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Although petitioner understandably felt compelled to file initially with this court under Section 307(b)(1) in order to meet that provision\u2019s 30-day filing period, it consistently has argued that original jurisdiction to review the particular regulation at issue here, dealing solely with the registration and reporting requirements of subsections (a) and (b) of 211, lies with the federal district courts under Section 10(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702 (1970), and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 (1970). Petitioner bases this position on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>fact that the Section 307(b)(1) review procedure, in relevant part, applies only to \u201cany <em>control or prohibition </em>under [section 211].\u201d (Emphasis added). Because subsection (c) is the only part of Section 211 that explicitly grants EPA the power to \u201ccontrol or prohibit\u201d the sale of fuel and fuel additives, and because that subsection was added to the Act by the 1970 amendments at the same time as Section 307(b)(1) was added but three years after the precursors of subsections (a) and (b) were enacted, petitioner argues that Congress intended Section 307(b)(1) review in this court to apply only to regulations promulgated under subsection (c) of the Act. Furthermore, prior to the 1970 amendments, the Act annexed no explicit review procedure to the registration and reporting requirements, leading petitioner to argue that then, as now, the Administrative Procedure Act and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 (1970) provided the review mechanism for regulations under those provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Accepting this argument, the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio denied EPA\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and granted petitioner\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the regulations pending review. <em>Lubrizol Corp. v. Train, </em>No. C76-7 (N.D.Ohio, Feb. 3, 1976). On appeal,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, finding that exclusive jurisdiction lay with this court to review the motor oil additive registration regulations. <em>The Lubrizol Corp. v. Train, </em>547 F.2d 310 (6th Cir. 1976).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Judge Celebrezze\u2019s opinion for the Sixth Circuit noted that Congress, in formulating the 1970 amendments, evinced considerable doubt both as to the usefulness of the Act\u2019s simple registration and reporting requirements and as to the reviewability in <em>any </em>court of regulations promulgated under those requirements. He concluded that Congress intended the 1970 revisions to overhaul completely both the Act\u2019s provision on fuel and fuel additives and its procedure for review of administrative actions undertaken pursuant to that and other provisions in the Act. Thus, so it was said, petitioner\u2019s reliance on the pre-1970 shape of the Act was not only based on a tenuous view of the Act\u2019s implied review procedures but was also misplaced in light of the complete restructuring in 1970 of the Act\u2019s approach to fuel and fuel additives. The opinion went on to note that Congress, in its effort to bolster the regulation of fuels and additives, treated the registration and reporting requirements, which previously had served only the \u201camorphous function\u201d of \u201cinsuring] full access to the technical information needed to evaluate the possible health hazard\u201d of registered materials, as \u201can important step in [Section 211\u2019s] national program to regulate [the sale of] fuel and fuel additives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314-15. Once viewed as a crucial part of a \u201cnational program,\u201d Judge Celebrezze pointed out, Section 211(a) clearly comes within the legislative intent underlying the unilateral review procedure in Section 307(b)(1). That provision, the legislative history reveals, gave exclusive review jurisdiction to this court in order to assure dispatch and uniformity in handling challenges to those EPA regulations under the Act \u201cwhich are national in scope.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 315. Finding further that the challenge pursued by petitioners raised no issues that a district court with superior factfinding ability might be more capable of resolving, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s opinion concluded that exclusive review in this court was required by Section 307(b)(1), its legislative history, and the policy of uniformity in national matters motivating it. <em>Id. </em>at 315-19. <em>See </em>Dupler &amp; Vinnik, <em>Federal Environmental Litigation in 1976: The Clean Air Act, </em>1 Harv.Envt\u2019l L.Rev. 5, 24 (1976) for commentary on Judge Celebrezze\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>II. SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\">The Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision that Section 307(b)(1), giving this court exclusive original jurisdiction to review certain EPA actions, provides the appropriate mechanism for challenges to EPA\u2019s motor oil additive registration requirement involved the same issues of law litigated by the same parties now before this court in this direct review proceeding. Accordingly, it raises the preliminary question of whether we must accord that decision <em>res judicata </em>or, at least, collateral estoppel effect on the jurisdictional issue involved in the present action. Because we find Judge Celebrezze\u2019s opinion persuasive, however, we need not decide whether the conditions necessary to such effects are present.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Although we embrace the Sixth Circuit\u2019s opinion, we emphasize several factors that make review under Section 307(b)(1) espedaily appropriate. First, although subsection (c) alone of the parts of Section 211 explicitly gives EPA the power to control or prohibit commerce in fuels and fuel additives, registration and reporting under subsections (a) and (b) are, also by explicit reference in subsection (c), necessary preconditions to the exercise of the powers granted EPA under subsection (c).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Because the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) are integral parts of the controls and prohibitions to which subsection (c) explicitly refers, the reference in Section 307(l)(b) to controls and prohibitions \u201cunder section 1857f-6c of this title,\u201d that is, under <em>all </em>of Section 211, was not imprecise drafting but a recognition of the fact that the entire section, in all three of its subparts, embodies a unitary process of imposing controls or prohibitions that deserves a unitary review procedure.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>Moreover, as Judge Celebrezze noted, by requiring a seller of additives to register and report on certain information at the risk of severe fines for noncompliance, <em>see </em>\u00a7 211(d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857f-6c(d) (Supp. V 1975), subsections (a) and (b), and the EPA regulations implementing them, act as a \u201ccontrol\u201d on the product. 547 F.2d at 316 n. 24. Similarly, by denying manufacturers the ability to sell unregistered products covered by the Act, subsection (a), and EPA regulations implementing it, act as a \u201cprohibition\u201d on the sale of unregistered products. Thus, subsections (a) and (b) are not only integral parts of the controls and prohibitions mentioned in subsection (c), but they also embody \u2014 and authorize the EPA to carry out \u2014 independent controls and prohibitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">Finally, the weakness of petitioner\u2019s jurisdictional contention is manifest in the irrational parsing, for purposes of review, to which it would subject the reporting requirement of Section 211(b). The 1970 amendments not only added Sections 211(c) and 307(b)(1) to the Act but also added a third paragraph to the reporting requirement which was then recodified in Section 211(b). <em>See </em>Clean Air Act \u00a7 211(b)(2), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857f-6c(b)(2) (1970). Under petitioner\u2019s logic, an EPA regulation based upon the older parts of Section 211, for example the one requiring notification of the concentration of the additive in a fuel, <em>see </em>\u00a7 211(b)(1)(A), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857f-6c(b)(l)(A) (1970); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 79.11(c) (1976), would be reviewable in the district courts under the Administrative Procedure Act standard, but a regulation, <em>see, e. g., </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 79.21(c) (1976), under the newer statutory provision, Section 211(b)(2)(B), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857f-6c(b)(2)(B) 1970, requiring information as to the analytical technique used to determine that concentration would be reviewable exclusively in this court under Section 307(b)(1). As Judge Celebrezze reasoned with respect to the less disruptive separation for review purposes of Sections 211(a)-(b) from Section 211(c), this dissection of Section 211(b) \u201cwould undermine the policies [of national uniformity and administrative dispatch that] Congress sought to achieve by enacting Section 307(b)(1).\u201d 547 F.2d at 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">The case that petitioner primarily relies upon by analogy to support the opposite conclusion actually accords with Judge Celebrezze\u2019s decision. In <em>Natural Resources Defense Council v. Train, </em>171 U.S.App.D.C. 151, 519 F.2d 287 (1975), the appellant challenged the failure of EPA to include several allegedly toxic pollutants on a list of such substances that Section 307(a) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1317(a) (Supp. V 1975), requires EPA to publish. Under Sections 307(a)(2) and 307(a)(6) of FWPCA, EPA, within es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>tablished time periods after such listing, must propose and effectuate effluent standards or prohibitions governing the listed substance. Section 509(b)(1) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1369(b)(1) (Supp. V 1975), then gives all federal courts of appeals jurisdiction to review any action \u201cin promulgating any effluent standard, [or] prohibition</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Petitioner in the present case attempts to rely on the decision in <em>NRDC v. Train </em>because it held that Section 509(b)(1) did not give this court, but instead allowed district court, jurisdiction to review EPA\u2019s refusal to list a substance and thus, ultimately, its refusal to issue effluent standards regarding it. Nonetheless, Judge Robb, writing for the court in the ease, noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7o\">when the Administrator <em>has </em>listed a substance and thereafter promulgated standards or prohibitions for that substance <em>the listing and the promulgation of standards are interwoven </em>; any challenge to the Administrator\u2019s action must then be in a court of appeals under Section 509 which provides for review of the Administrator\u2019s action \u201cin promulgating any effluent standard [or] prohibition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 290-91 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">This hypothetical case put by Judge Robb obviously adheres much more closely to the facts of the present case than do the actual facts of <em>NRDC v. Train. </em>Here, EPA <em>has </em>required registration of certain substances, which action, because it is \u201cinterwoven\u201d with the process of imposing controls and prohibitions as to such substances, should come within the review procedure established for those controls and prohibitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">In sum, petitioner has failed to persuade us that we should not accept Judge Celebrezze\u2019s analysis in <em>The Lubrizol Corp. v. Train, supra, </em>concluding that the District of Columbia Circuit is the appropriate forum for reviewing EPA\u2019s regulation that includes motor oil additives within its definition of \u201cfuel and fuel additives.\u201d Accordingly, we turn to the question of the validity of that regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">III. THE VALIDITY OF THE EPA REGULATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">Section 211 authorizes the registration of \u201cany fuel or fuel additive.\u201d Petitioner assails the EPA regulation, 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 79.-31(a) (1976), that purports to find authority in Section 211 for a requirement that motor oil additives be registered. Because petitioner does not deny that its products are \u201cadditives,\u201d its challenge goes to EPA\u2019s characterization of motor oil as a \u201cfuel\u201d within the meaning of Section 211. Although the regulations never make that characterization explicit, they imply it in Section 79.31(a)\u2019s application to \u201cadditives produced or sold for use in . motor vehicle engine oil.\u201d Moreover, the comments announcing the promulgation of the regulations justify the \u201cdesignation of engine oils for registration\u201d because such oils fall within EPA\u2019s admittedly \u201cbroad definition\u201d in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 79.2(c) of \u201cfuel\u201d as any material capable of releasing energy. 40 Fed.Reg. 52,009 (1975). Consequently, although this court need not develop a detailed definition of \u201cfuel\u201d under the Clean Air Act, it must conceive of that definition distinctly enough to determine if motor oil falls within it. If it does not, the regulations are \u201cin excess of statutory . authority . . .\u201d and invalid. Administrative Procedure Act, \u00a7 10(e)(2)(c), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(C) (1970).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>This litigation has identified three general approaches to such a definition. The first, of course, is reflected in the \u201cbroad\u201d definition in Section 79-2(c) of the EPA regulations. Its primary focus is on the capability of a substance to produce energy by chemical or physical reaction and, as such, it encompasses virtually all known organic and many inorganic substances. Perhaps because of the potentially absurd implications of this first approach, see note 13 <em>supra, </em>EPA actually has relied in this litigation and in promulgating the regulations in question on a second \u2014 and policy-oriented \u2014 definitional tack. This approach identifies Section 211\u2019s purpose in regulating \u201cfuels and fuel additives\u201d as being the prevention of toxic and corrosive motor vehicle emissions, and then seeks to define anything as a fuel or additive if it might create such emissions.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This definition includes at least any substance that is burned in the combustion chamber of the gasoline and diesel engines used in most motor vehicles currently in service.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">The third definitional approach, advocated by petitioner, looks to an assertedly common sense understanding of the word \u201cfuel\u201d as the substances used to <em>propel </em>motor vehicles \u2014 chiefly gasoline, but also diesel fuel and perhaps other substances. This approach is exemplified by the definition of \u201cfuel\u201d in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 918 (1971), as \u201c[a] material . <em>used to </em>produce heat or power by burning.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">Generally, courts accord statutory language its common sense meaning unless the statute, or its legislative history, require some other reading. <em>E. g., Addison </em>v. <em>Holly Hill Co., </em>322 U.S. 607, 618, 64 S.Ct. 1215, 1221, 88 L.Ed. 1488 (1944) (\u201cAfter all, legislation when not expressed in technical terms is addressed to the common run of men and is therefore to be understood according to the sense of the thing, as the ordinary man has a right to rely on ordinary words addressed to him.\u201d),<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>Williams </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number><em>v. W.M.A. Transit Co., </em>153 U.S.App.D.C. 183, 472 F.2d 1258, 1265 (1972). Nothing in the language of Section 211 suggests a congressional intent to address any persons other than \u201cthe common run of men\u201d in using the term \u201cfuel.\u201d Hence, we must turn to the legislative history of Section 211 in search of possible justifications for reading the term more broadly than it ordinarily would be read.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\">The legislative record surrounding Section 211 contains only one explicit reference to motor oils and none to motor oil additives. In the one reference to engine oil, Representative Satterfield of Virginia was questioning Dr. John T. Middleton of the National Air Pollution Control Administration before the Subcommittee on Public Health and Welfare of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, which was considering the 1970 amendments. Having established that \u201c[tjhere are many factors that contribute to\u201d emissions and that \u201cfuel is only one of the factors,\u201d Congressman Satterfield continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-5\">It is my understanding, . . . that you get emissions from gasoline engines in several places. There is your fuel system, where the volitability of your fuel might create emissions, you have them in your internal parts of your engine, in the crank case, and then you have them in the exhaust. I understand this can be affected not only by the contents of the fuel itself, but more importantly the parameters of the engine and what occurs within an individual engine; is this correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-7\">DR. MIDDLETON: Yes, it is very true, the nature of the combustion chamber, the additives used in fuels, their impact upon the collection of debris in the engine and the oil to facilitate the valves operating properly and let us not overlook the way in which people drive their cars and particularly the way garages maintain, or not, their cars.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">The parties, <em>see </em>Brief for Petitioner at 28-29; Brief for Respondent at 30, seem to agree that Dr. Middleton\u2019s statement is ambiguous: It may attribute emissions to the lubricating oil itself or it may link them to the effect of fuel additives (and perhaps the nature of the combustion chamber) <em>on </em>that oil (as well as on the engine debris). Two things are clear from this exchange, however: Some members of Congress were aware first that motor oils (but apparently not motor oil additives) \u2014 \u201cin the crank case\u201d or in the engine \u2014 may have a more or less direct impact on emissions, and second, that several other distinct \u201cfactors\u201d also have such an impact, including not only \u201cfuel\u201d and \u201cthe additives used in fuel,\u201d but also \u201cthe parameters of the engine,\u201d the \u201cdebris in the engine,\u201d \u201cthe way in which people drive\u201d and \u201cthe way garages maintain . . . cars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">Although the parties have expended considerable effort in argument as to whether motor oil and its additives <em>do </em>have negative effects on emissions and, if so, whether Congress knew of those effects, <em>see </em>Brief for Petitioner at 27-29; Brief for Respondent at 15-28; Reply Brief for Petitioner at 20-24, the more important question seems to us to be whether, in drafting Section 211, the legislators intended to reach <em>ail </em>of the factors, including motor oil and its additives, that they knew <em>might </em>have such an effect. The discussion between Representa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>tive Satterfield and Dr. Middleton suggests that some members of Congress, at least, distinguished \u201cfuel\u201d and \u201cfuel additives\u201d from several other factors, including motor oils, that might contribute to emissions. That these same members of Congress did not object to the confinement of Section 211 to \u201cany fuel or fuel additive\u201d suggests that they did not expect that section to reach many potential causes of pollution, including motor oils and motor oil additives.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">The Satterfield-Middleton exchange accordingly reveals the weakness of EPA\u2019s policy approach to the definition of \u201cfuel.\u201d In light of the various \u201cfactors\u201d identified during that exchange, that approach, by granting the agency authority to reach any potential contributor to emissions \u2014 or at least any that was known to Congress in 1970 \u2014 would allow it to regulate the design of (and materials used in building) engines, substances likely to find their way into engine debris (for example, the materials used to construct gas station pumps and gasoline tanks) as well as methods of auto maintenance and driving techniques.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Clearly, Congress did not intend, by its use of the term \u201cfuel,\u201d to authorize EPA to regulate those emissions factors, despite the consistency of such regulation with the Act\u2019s purposes. Without more proof than inheres in the statutory language and purposes, therefore, neither can we see any basis for extending the term \u201cfuel\u201d to cover motor oil and motor oil additives.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">The other references to fuel in the legislative history of Section 211 do not provide the necessary proof that \u201cfuel\u201d means more in the Clean Air Act than it does in common parlance. Instead, those references show a marked tendency of the legislators debating the provision to use \u201cfuel\u201d and \u201cgasoline\u201d interchangeably. <em>E. g., </em>116 Cong.Ree. 19,-206-07 (1970) (remarks of Rep. Springer); <em>id. </em>at 19,207 (remarks of Rep. Reid); <em>id. </em>at 19,210 (remarks of Rep. Rogers); <em>id. </em>at 19,-231 (remarks of Rep. Satterfield).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">Because these identifications of fuel with* gasoline occurred in discussions of the proper regulatory approach to lead in gasoline, they are not conclusive as to the full mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>ing of \u201cfuel.\u201d They do indicate, however, Congress\u2019 major concern in passing the section, and, as a general matter, such evidence from the legislative history is due considerable weight in statutory interpretation. Thus, in a closely analogous situation arising under Section 202 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857\u00cd-1 (1970 and Supp. V 1975), a panel of this court held that the statutory phrase \u201clight duty vehicle\u201d meant \u201cpassenger cars,\u201d because legislators debating that provision had freely substituted the two phrases. <em>International Harvester Co. </em>v. <em>Ruckelshaus, </em>155 U.S.App.D.C. 411, 478 F.2d 615, 639 (1973). As Judge Leventhal noted, \u201c[t]his kind of legislative intent must be given priority, in interpreting this law, over any presumption of continuance of prior administrative definitions of this term or to the policy of upholding reasonable interpretations of statutes by administrative agencies in the absence of other discernable legislative intent,\u201d <em>id. </em>(footnotes and citations omitted), and, we would add, such legislative history also deserves priority over the canons of construction advocating dependence on the broad purposes of an act and favoring expansive interpretation of remedial legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\">In short, EPA has not persuaded us that Congress meant anything more than it said in Section 211, that is to say, EPA may require the registration of, and ultimately may regulate commerce in, those motor vehide <em>propellants </em>and additives to them that may contribute to harmful tailpipe emissions. What EPA <em>has </em>shown is that studies completed in the years since Congress enacted Section 211 indicate that <em>lubricants </em>and additives to them may have effects on emissions similar to those of propellants and propellant additives, and that those effects are potentially harmful enough, as a <em>policy matter, </em>to warrant regulation of such lubricants and additives similar to that imposed on propellants by Section 211.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Yet that showing by itself is not sufficient to prompt us to substitute the agency\u2019s albeit well meaning interpretation for the clear language that Congress wrote into the statute. <em>Accord, Mobil Oil Corp. v. FPC, </em>149 U.S.App.D.C. 310, 463 F.2d 256, 263, <em>cert. denied, </em>406 U.S. 976, 92 S.Ct. 2409, 32 L.Ed.2d 676, <em>reh. denied, </em>409 U.S. 902, 93 S.Ct. 100, 34 L.Ed.2d 165 (1972). In a period of seemingly growing popular conviction that government agencies too often transgress the statutorily imposed boundaries of their authority,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> courts, in reviewing administrative action, must be alert to confine that action within those boundaries. Having amassed a body of data on the potentially harmful effects on air quality of motor oils and additives, and being in a position to urge with some force the consistency of requiring their registration with the purposes of the Act, EPA remains free to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>present to <em>Congress </em>its arguably persuasive case for an amendment to Section 211. But for <em>this Court </em>to countenance what, on the record before us, is essentially an amendment by regulation would constitute an unwarranted judicial intrusion upon the legislative sphere wholly at odds with the democratic processes of lawmaking contemplated by the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Accordingly, we invalidate the regulations in Part 79 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations insofar as they apply to motor oil and motor oil additives.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b882-12\">.

Unlike \u00a7 211, which uses the term \u201cfuel\u201d in a step-by-step process leading to the unitary goal of controlling or prohibiting trade in fuels that have dangerous effects on emissions, \u00a7 202 applies the phrase \u201clight duty vehicles\u201d to several distinct processes of developing, implementing, and suspending increasingly strict emissions standards for different years. Furthermore, \u00a7 307(b)(1) explicitly makes some of \u00a7 202\u2019s processes reviewable by this court and it explicitly removes some of them from this court\u2019s original review jurisdiction. Hence, the dicta in <em>International Harvester </em>suggesting that there is concurrent jurisdiction to review the definition of \u201clight duty vehicles\u201d in \u00a7 202 reflects the multiple regulatory processes of which that phrase is a premise, in contrast to the unitary regulatory process of which the phrase \u201cfuel or fuel additive\u201d in \u00a7 211 is a premise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b889-8\">.

In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number><em>Sierra Club, supra, </em>the interpretation of \u00a7 110(a)(2) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-5(a)(2) (1970), in light of the Act\u2019s broad purpose, expressed in \u00a7 101(b), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857(b)(1) (1970), was prompted by the fact that \u00a7 110(a)(2) otherwise would \u201cbe in conflict with the congressional purpose expressed in the act\u201d and with the \u201cclear understanding\u201d of the legislative history of the Act. 540 F.2d at 1124. Although in the present case, \u00a7 211, if restricted to propellants, might not <em>fully </em>achieve the Act\u2019s purposes, neither would it <em>conf\u00edict </em>with those purposes or with the Act\u2019s legislative history.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b890-5\">. <em>See, e. g., </em>40 Fed.Reg. 52,009 (1975), arguing that Section 211 evidences a congressional intent \u201cto grant authority encompassing all materials which might affect the emission products of combustion and thus the public health and welfare.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b890-6\">.

Neither of the parties contend that \u00a7 211 uses \u201cfuel\u201d in a \u201ctechnical\u201d manner. Even if \u00a7 211 did so, however, it would not encourage us to deviate from the \u201ccommon sense\u201d approach to that term\u2019s definition, because its technical meaning coincides with its common sense meaning. The Supreme Court has identified those people who are familiar with \u201cthe field,\u201d or \u201cthe art or science\u201d being regulated, as proper sources for the meaning of words that the legislative history indicates are used technically by the statute. <em>NLRB v. Highland Park Manufacturing Co., </em>341 U.S. 322, 326, 71 S.Ct. 758, 95 L.Ed. 969 (1951). (Frankfurter, J\u201e dissenting); <em>Corning Glass Works v. Brennan, </em>417 U.S. 188, 201-02, 94 S.Ct. 2223, 41 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974). As noted above, the reaction by members of the fuel and motor oil industries to the EPA regulations in question uniformly condemned both the broad, capability-based definition of fuel and the policy-oriented justification for requiring registration of motor oil and its additives. These sources advanced a variety of alternative definitions, all of which, however, fell within the \u201ccommon sense\u201d approach referred to above. <em>See </em>Appendix to the Briefs at 209-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">EPA officials also potentially qualify as persons familiar with the \u201cfield\u201d in question here. In this case, however, their defense of the regulations has not drawn on that familiarity or on their technical expertise, but instead has focused on their understanding of the intent and purpose of Congress in drafting \u00a7 211. <em>See, e. g., </em>40 Fed.Reg. 52,009 (1975); Brief for Respondent at 15-41. As such, the agency\u2019s definition of \u201cfuel\u201d carries little impact as an indicium of the term\u2019s \u201ctechnical meaning\u201d and is due less of the deference that courts traditionally accord an administrator when the issues in question have a technical or industrial rather than legal hue. <em>Texas Gas Transmission Corp. v. Shell Oil Co., </em>363 U.S. 263, 270, 80 S.Ct. 1122, 4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>L.Ed.2d-1208 (1960); <em>Wilderness Soc\u2019y </em>v. <em>Morton, </em>156 U.S.App.D.C. 121, 479 F.2d 842, 864-66, <em>cert denied, </em>411 U.S. 917, 93 S.Ct. 1550, 36 L.Ed.2d 309 (1973); K. Davis, Administrative Law Text \u00a7 30.06, at 552-53 (3d ed. 1972). Because this petition presents a question of statutory interpretation over which the Courts have \u201cprimary responsibility,\u201d <em>Zuber v. Allen, </em>396 U.S. 168, 193, 90 S.Ct. 314, 24 L.Ed.2d 345 (1969), because the statutory language in question is not facially ambiguous, <em>see Shea v. Vialpando, </em>416 U.S. 251, 262 n.11, 94 S.Ct. 1746, 40 L.Ed.2d 120 (1974), and because Congress cannot be charged with acquiescence in the recent administrative application of \u00a7 211 to motor oil and motor oil additives, <em>see </em>note 9 <em>supra </em>and accompanying text, the justification for judicial deference to administrative action appears especially weak in this case. <em>See Wilderness Soc'y v. Morton, supra </em>at 866-70; <em>National Petroleum Refiners Ass\u2019n v. FTC, </em>157 U.S.App.D.C. 83, 482 F.2d 672, 695 (1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U.S. 951, 94 S.Ct. 1475, 39 L.Ed.2d 567 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b892-5\">. In its brief and in oral argument, EPA has put considerable emphasis on a passage in the Senate Conferees\u2019 Summary of the Provisions of the Conference Agreement stating that \u201cthe concept of a control or prohibition should be taken to include requiring design changes in motor vehicles, as well as fuel handling equipment . <em>Reprinted in </em>Sen. Comm, on Public Works, A Legislative History of the Clean Air Amendments of 1970, at 135 (1974). Although it could be read more broadly, this statement appears only to allow EPA, <em>in regulating the contents of fuel, </em>for example gasoline lead, to require that fuel tanks in automobiles and fuel pumps in service stations be fitted specially, for example to prevent the use of leaded gasoline in those automobiles. Such a requirement, however, would affect motor vehicle design only as a necessary offshoot of the regulation of fuel content, and would not regulate that design because of any impact on emissions that it has independently of the fuel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b892-6\">. The Satterfield-Middleton dialogue thus reveals why, in this case, the legislative policy behind \u00a7 211 is not an accurate indicator of the reach of the provision\u2019s relatively narrow language. More general support for that conclusion is found in the Supreme Court\u2019s approach to statutory construction in light of statutory policy. Although the Supreme Court advocates consideration of legislative purpose when there is some reason to mistrust the common sense understanding of the statutory language, it cautions against relying on policy in the event that the \u201ccommonly accepted meaning\u201d is clear and the presumption in favor of its use is not rebutted by the statute or its legislative history. <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 198-99, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976); <em>see Mobil Oil Corp. v. FPC, </em>149 U.S.App.D.C. 310, 463 F.2d 256, 263, <em>cert. denied, </em>406 U.S. 976, 92 S.Ct. 2409, 32 L.Ed.2d 676, <em>reh. denied, </em>409 U.S. 902, 93 S.Ct. 100, 34 L.Ed.2d 165 (1972). The cases cited by EPA accord with this principle. <em>E. g., United States v. Southwestern Cable Co., </em>392 U.S. 157, 173-75, 177-78, 88 S.Ct. 1994, 20 L.Ed.2d 1001 (1968) (FCC may regulate \u201ccommunity antenna television\u201d systems that fall within the purpose but not so clearly within the language of the Communications Act, because the Act accords that agency broad and amorphous powers over the entire communications field); <em>United States v.

Some evidence of motor oil\u2019s impact on emissions was available to members of Congress during their consideration of Section 211 and the 1970 amendments. See the discussion of the Satterfield-Middleton dialogue <em>supra. </em>Nonetheless, the bulk of the systematic research data on that effect, as well as <em>all </em>of the data on the effect of motor oil additives, arose after Congress passed the amendment in late 1970. Thus, of the eight studies cited by EPA in promulgating these regulations, 40 C.F.R. 52,009 (1975), and in its Brief, at pp. 24-28, only one was completed early enough to have an impact on the legislation, <em>see C. </em>Begeman &amp; J. Colucci, <em>supra </em>note 10, and it dealt solely with pollutants produced when motor oil is burned and did not presage the findings, emphasized in most later studies, that motor oil <em>additives </em>could corrode catalytic converters.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Even EPA waited three and a half years after \u00a7 211 became law before it decided, on the basis of \u201cevidence in the literature [showing] that lubricant composition and additive materials influence exhaust composition,\u201d to institute a registration program for motor oil additives. 40 Fed.Reg. 52,009 (1975); <em>see </em>30 Fed.Reg. 8924 (1974). <em>See also </em>note 12 <em>supra </em>and accompanying text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b893-9\">. The most tangible evidence of this conviction is the current legislative effort to give one house of Congress power to veto any regulation promulgated by a federal agency. <em>E. g., </em>H.R. 1487, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. \u00a7\u00a7 601-08 (1977).
