Code (2002, 2008 Supp.), \u00a7 3-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>708(b) of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cC.L.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The alleged threat was contained in an e-mail message that appellant sent to a State website in March 2008. The court sentenced appellant to a suspended term of six months\u2019 incarceration and imposed a fine of $500.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">This appeal followed. Appellant poses four questions, which we have rephrased slightly and reordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">1. Did the circuit court err in failing to grant appellant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, based on the insufficiency of the evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">2. Did the trial court err in failing to propound appellant\u2019s requested jury instructions 9 through 13, all of which state relevant federal and state constitutional provisions relating to one\u2019s freedom of speech and to petition the government for a redress of grievances?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">3. Did the cumulative effect of the trial judge\u2019s jury instructions create reversible error, i.e., primarily instructing the jury that Governor O\u2019Malley need not be present for the State to prove the case, no intent was required, nor was it necessary for the State to show that the e-mail in question was a real threat, and, for refusing to instruct the jurors that they are to narrowly construe the statute and that a threat must be distinguished from constitutionally protected speech?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-9\">4. Did the trial court err in granting the State\u2019s motion in limine, preventing defense counsel from arguing to the jury at opening and closing that the alleged threat was protected by the free speech clause of First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>For the reasons set forth below, we shall vacate the conviction and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Prior to jury selection, the State moved for a protective order with respect to records that appellant subpoenaed from the Maryland State Police regarding the executive protection detail assigned to Governor O\u2019Malley.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s counsel explained that he sought the information to establish that injuring the Governor \u201c[ijs an impossibility with the way the Governor is protected.\u201d The court granted the protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">In addition, the State moved \u201cto prevent the Defendant from arguing to the jury that the speech that constitutes the threat in this case, or the alleged threat, is protected by the First Amendment.\u201d The court also granted that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Appellant subpoenaed Governor O\u2019Malley \u201cor his designee\u201d for the trial. A notice attached to the subpoena stated: \u201cIn the event you do not wish to appear for trial personally as a witness, the attached Subpoena authorizes you to designate another person to appear on your behalf with information, calendars, and notes which would show your basic itinerary for the dates noted.\u201d The Governor did not appear at appellant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">At trial, the State called one witness, Maryland State Police Sergeant Adam Stachurski, who was assigned to the Homeland Security Intelligence Division. Stachurski testified that, shortly after 7:30 a.m. on March 18, 2008, appellant sent an email from his home computer to a State website maintained by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>the Office of the Governor. The website solicited feedback in the following format:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-4\">Contact Governor O\u2019Malley</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqb\">We\u2019d like to hear from you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">Whether you\u2019re a citizen of Maryland or just visiting our great state, your comments and suggestions are welcome. Please use the form provided below to tell us what you think. Your feedback is valuable\u2014it gives the Governor and his staff useful information that helps improve our service to all Marylanders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">Be sure to include your E-mail address so a response may be provided. You should receive an electronic acknowledgement [sic] shortly after sharing your comments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">Thanks for taking the time to contact the Governor\u2019s Office of Maryland. Come again!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">-Martin O\u2019Malley, <em>Governor</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">The website included fields for personal information about the individual composing the message. Select fields required that all characters be capitalized. The content of the message was limited to 4000 characters. As explained on the website, longer communications were to be sent to the Governor\u2019s Office via postal mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">The commentator\u2019s name was requested in four categories (prefix, first, last, and suffix). Appellant typed his name as \u201cFUCK Walter Carl Abbott YOU.\u201d He provided his actual address and phone number in the appropriate fields. Under the category for \u201cOrganization Name,\u201d appellant typed \u201cFUCKING SOLD OUT AMERICAN,\u201d and he identified his relationship to this organization as \u201cpresident.\u201d He did not fill out the request for \u201cmy correspondence topic\u201d or \u201csubject.\u201d The text of his electronic message was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-11\">O\u2019Malley, getting ready to lose my wife after 24 years of marri[a]ge. 3rd construction co. &amp; 2nd house I am going to lose because of no good fucking government like you and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>pieces of shit like you. If i[sic] ever get close enough to yoy [sic], I will rap [sic] my hands around your throat and strangle the life from you. This will solve many problems for true AMERICAN\u2019S [sic]. Maybe you can send your MEXICAN army after me, you no good AMERICAN SELL OUT PIECE OF SHIT. I HOPE YOU DROP DEAD BEFORE I GET TO YOU, I WOULD HATE TO TO [sic] LOSE MY LIFE BECAUSE OF A PIECE OF SHIT LIKE YOU. FUCK YOU TRULY WALTER C. ABBOTT JR.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">The parties stipulated that the Governor\u2019s office received the e-mail. Upon receipt, the Governor\u2019s Office forwarded the e-mail to the Maryland State Police. Stachurski immediately began to investigate appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Stachurski arrived at appellant\u2019s residence at approximately 11:50 a.m. on March 18, 2008, the same day that appellant sent the e-mail. According to Stachurski, appellant \u201cwelcomed us and brought us into his house.\u201d He continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">We sat down at his table, explained if he knew why (inaudible), he put is head down and said yes and at that time I handed him a copy of the e-mail as I read it to him to see if he was familiar with the e-mail.... He was visibly shaken and said yes, he sent it out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Stachurski added: \u201c[H]e said as soon as he hit the button he knew he wanted to take it back at that point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">On cross-examination, Stachurski indicated that he did not know whether Governor O\u2019Malley actually read or received the e-mail. He agreed that appellant was \u201ccooperative,\u201d and never tried to hide that he sent the e-mail. Moreover, he indicated that Abbott told him that he sent the e-mail because \u201csending this message would receive a response\u201d; Abbott \u201cregretted sending the e-mail\u201d; and he indicated that \u201che meant no harm.\u201d According to Stachurski, appellant did not show \u201canger but he showed some discern [sic] towards illegal immigration issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">Appellant moved for judgment of acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s case. He argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>[W]hen someone threatens a Judge ... there\u2019s no, absolutely no political purpose in making that threat. But when you send a threat to a website invited by the Governor\u2019s people himself, that invites public comment and you couple that alleged threat with some political statements on immigration, I don\u2019t like what you\u2019re doing and if I could ever, if I could ever get close enough to you, which is a condition, I would choke the life from you. The First Amendment ... The Maryland Declaration of Rights, Article 40, all talks about a person\u2019s right to freedom of speech.... [W]hen the threat is made in the context of a political statement, every place cited by <em>Pendergast, Watts, Ma[i]sonet, Barcl[e]y, </em>every case that did not sustain the conviction [had similar] factors ... One, the victims, when they sustained the conviction, the victim, alleged victim, was there to testify they got the letter, they got the threat and felt threatened and number two, there was absolutely no political purpose made with the alleged threat....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Appellant\u2019s counsel added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">[T]here\u2019s no requirement that Governor O\u2019Malley testify but there\u2019s another thing missing from the State. It was sent to a Governor\u2019s website.... There\u2019s no testimony that Governor O\u2019Malley even received the threat. That certainly should be a condition of a conviction ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">In appellant\u2019s supporting memorandum, he argued that his e-mail was \u201cnothing more than \u2018political hyperbole\u2019 \u201d about illegal immigration. Abbott\u2019s attorney pointed to the trooper\u2019s testimony that appellant said he was just trying to gain the Governor\u2019s attention. Appellant also noted that \u201cthere has been absolutely no testimony in evidence Governor O\u2019Malley even knows this e-mail was sent,\u201d nor did the State prove that appellant \u201cwas even aware that his response to a government web site, inviting comments in the first place, would ever be read by the Governor.\u201d Further, the defense argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">It is abundantly clear ... that if the letter was ambiguous, meaning one person could think the letter a threat and another interpretation could be that Mr. Abbott was making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>a political statement, the Court should grant Defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal. Moreover, any reasonable person, even considering the evidence in a light most favorable to the State, would conclude that Mr. Abbott\u2019s email was nothing more than \u201cpolitical hyperbole,\u201d protected by one\u2019s inherent right to free and unfettered political expression. Since there is no real ambiguity and it is clear Mr. Abbott was, in-fact, making a political statement ... this Court should grant his motion for judgment of acquittal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The court denied appellant\u2019s motion. Appellant then testified in his own defense. After discussing his family, employment. history, and the construction company that he founded, appellant addressed the e-mail in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Appellant stated that Stachurski and four other officers arrived at his house on the morning that he posted his e-mail. He recalled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">The first thing they told me when they come in, they showed me the picture of me, showed me my criminal record, you have no criminal record so, you know, and they started talking to me and asked me about it.... [TJhey had said, well, you\u2019re not being arrested. We, we don\u2019t take this as a [v\u2019Jiable threat ... I said, I, I never meant it to be as a threat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Appellant also testified about an earlier e-mail that he received from Delegate Patrick L. McDonough on February 12, 2008, concerning House Bill 885 and House Bill 1232.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> According to Delegate McDonough\u2019s e-mail, which was introduced into evidence, House Bill 885 \u201cprohibits Maryland towns and cities from passing \u2018sanctuary\u2019 laws,\u201d while House Bill 1232 \u201cwill allow citizens to file a complaint against an elected or public official based on the premise that the official is violating the Federal Immigration Act. The complaint could eventually result in removal from office.\u201d Further, the e-mail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>explained that this Bill \u201cprovides an opportunity for everyone to visit Annapolis and express their concerns about the entire illegal immigration problem.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">In regard to Delegate McDonough\u2019s e-mail, appellant stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\">It\u2019s about a citizen\u2019s alert important date for Tuesday, March 11th, 2008 at 1:00 pm for a dear fellow citizens, go to Annapolis to help support House Bill 885, House Bill 1232 and several bills that Delegate [Ronald A.] George and Delegate McDono[u]gh were trying to have passed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Appellant explained that he subsequently testified before the House Judiciary Committee in Annapolis, on March 11, 2008. In describing the \u201cgeneral nature\u201d of his testimony, appellant said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-8\">[W]e\u2019re getting overrun by everybody losing their jobs and, in construction and everything. It\u2019s, I mean, it\u2019s out there in plain sight and it\u2019s getting harder and harder to pay bills with, and them not passing these bills that would have made it harder on illegals to come here and just take our jobs from us.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">Abbott denied that he tried to seek out the Governor when he was in Annapolis on March 11, 2008. Claiming it was \u201cthe first time [he\u2019d] ever been to Annapolis,\u201d appellant denied knowledge of the Governor\u2019s places of work and residence. The following testimony is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Well, at that time, how did you feel about Governor O\u2019Malley?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-11\">[APPELLANT]: I thought that he was, he\u2019s in charge of this State that maybe he could step up and be a hero to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>people and put a stop to all the illegals coming here and taking our jobs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">In addition, appellant described a sign posted on the front fence of his house, protesting the presence of illegal immigrants. A photograph of the sign, admitted into evidence, said: \u201cDEPort ILLEGAL\u2019S, IM*Prison BUSH!, BY Order oF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!!!\u201d Noting that he never intended to imprison President Bush, appellant explained: \u201c1 don\u2019t have any powers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">With respect to the e-mail in issue, appellant was asked when he \u201cfirst decide[d] to e-mail the Governor?\u201d He responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">When I went up on that blog, on the Governor\u2019s blog, I was looking for his telephone number.... And when I called they were still closed, it was around 7:30. It said, I believe it said they opened up at 8:00. So I didn\u2019t have any work that day so I was just sitting there and 1 read that blog and it asked me how I feel and I put down how I felt because I felt maybe that would get his attention and maybe I would get to talk to him about the issues at hand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: ... [D]id you intend to threaten the Governor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-9\">[APPELLANT]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Did you think you could go down to Annapolis and put your hands around him and choke him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-11\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-12\">[APPELLANT]: No way.... How could you even get close enough to him, if you want to touch the Governor you would, you know, his staff would be all over you. It was just a statement, trying to get an answer from him. Just like the sign on the fence said, it didn\u2019t say anything about O\u2019Malley. It had nothing to do with him. I was hoping to talk to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Governor of the State that I live in to hopefully ... hear my story and maybe he could do something about it instead of not doing anything about it and hurting the people of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Appellant indicated that he signed his name, put his address on the e-mail, as well as his telephone number, \u201cand at the end it said call me.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The following colloquy is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A93\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: ... Did you believe that the Governor would actually read his web postings?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq7\">[APPELLANT]: Well, I was hoping he would. When I called back to his office, when they finally opened up and talked to his secretary, I tried to see if I could get to talk to him and he just told me, you\u2019re just one person. You know, we get three hundred calls a day. He said, he\u2019s not going to talk to you. I said, well, I\u2019ve spoken to thousands of Marylanders and gotten their opinions and so shouldn\u2019t that count as more than one person?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Let me ask you, hypothetically, if they were going to give you an appointment with the Governor, what were you planning on doing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">[APPELLANT]: I would like to talk to him about the situation and how this is hurting so many businesses in the State of Maryland. I mean, it\u2019s, in 2005 its [sic] facts that three hundred and thirty-eight billion dollars [are] wasted on illegals in this country and that\u2019s not counting jobs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>they\u2019re taken from the Maryland people from whatever State they\u2019re from.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: ... [I]f the Governor disagreed with you or didn\u2019t see it your way, were you going to get up from your chair and strangle the man?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqi\">[APPELLANT]: No, then I would have had to decide whether I was just moving out of the State of Maryland or just move out of this country.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: So did you ever intend to seek out the Governor and strangle him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">[APPELLANT]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Or choke him? LAPPELLANT]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Have you ever choked anyone else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-10\">[APPELLANT]: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">On cross-examination, appellant was asked if he knew why the State Trooper came to his house. He answered, \u201cSure,\u201d acknowledging that \u201cit was because [he] sent an e-mail ...\u201d The following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-12\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: And you told them that you shouldn\u2019t have done it, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-13\">[APPELLANT]: No, I told them I regret sending it but you never get an answer in any way from anybody on the situations at hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-14\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: You regretted sending it because you knew it was wrong to threaten the Governor, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-15\">[APPELLANT]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-16\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: You didn\u2019t? That\u2019s not why you regretted it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-17\">[APPELLANT]: No, I did not regret it because of saying Pm threatening the Governor. It\u2019s, I was wishing he would take it for what it was when I put my phone number and everything on there, address, and maybe the man would have called me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>[THE PROSECUTOR]: So you didn\u2019t regret sending this, this e-mail to the Governor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">[APPELLANT]: Oh, yes, I do. I do regret sending it now. [THE PROSECUTOR]: Right, because ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">[APPELLANT]: Because of all the trouble it[\u2019]s caused. [THE PROSECUTOR]: Right, because it\u2019s against the law, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">[APPELLANT]: I thought it was only against the law to threaten the President of the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Well, if it\u2019s against the law to threaten the Governor, you knew this was a threat against the Governor, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-9\">\u2756 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-10\">[APPELLANT]: I\u2019m just telling you, I\u2019m a construction worker. I have a tenth grade education. I don\u2019t keep up on all the laws and everything. I\u2019m not going to law school</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">The prosecutor also asked appellant if he had lost a house. Appellant claimed he had. With regard to his current home, appellant said: \u201cI\u2019m making it month to month now....\u201d But, he conceded that, when he wrote the e-mail, his \u201chouse was not in default.\u201d The following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-12\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Okay. Were you getting ready to lose your wife of twenty-four years at the time you sent this e-mail?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-13\">[APPELLANT]: I would hope not but the pressures and everything that was putting on us, it seems that way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4B\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Okay. You don\u2019t have any problems with immigrants, it\u2019s illegal immigrants that you object to, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-14\">[APPELLANT]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-15\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Because you think that everybody, no matter how noble their purpose, should obey the law, isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>[APPELLANT]: How noble their purpose? If they weren\u2019t here in the first place and our Governor wasn\u2019t giving away jobs to them and giving away two and a half million dollars to support them taking the American jobs from them, then nobody would be feeling this way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-4\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: You think everybody should obey the law, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">[APPELLANT]: Yes, yes, 1 do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Appellant\u2019s wife, Linda Abbott, and his mother-in-law, Gloria Harris, testified as character witnesses. Both testified to appellant\u2019s reputation for honesty and nonviolence.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">At the close of evidence, appellant renewed his motion for acquittal, arguing that there was no \u201cevidence where the jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that he intended this threat.\u201d The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\">A person may not knowingly and willfully make a threat to take the life of or cause physical injury to a State official. We don\u2019t get into intent. We get into did he knowingly and intentionally make the threat and certainly there\u2019s a threat to cause physical injury to a State Official.... So the Motion for judgment of acquittal is denied....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">Thereafter, the court instructed the jury and counsel presented closing arguments. As noted, the jury convicted appellant of a violation of C.L. \u00a7 8\u2014708(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">Additional facts will be included in our discussion of the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-13\">Appellant first argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction because, \u201con its face, the alleged threat was nothing more than a political statement and therefore protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and ... similar provisions in the Mai\u2019yland Declaration of Rights.\u201d Noting that his statements \u201cwere not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>mailed to the Governor\u2019s home,\u201d appellant points out that his e-mail was sent \u201cin response to an invite at a politically-sponsored website.\u201d Moreover, he insists that his remarks \u201cwere entirely predicated upon his views on the illegal immigration issue\u201d and his e-mail \u201cwas <em>only </em>made for a political purpose.\u201d Claiming the content was \u201can obvious statement against the government\u2019s position on immigration issues,\u201d appellant posits: \u201cIt cannot be realistically argued or even suggested that [appellant\u2019s] letter was anything but political bantering, or, in the language used by the Supreme Court ...' the statement is allowing the citizen\u2019s inherent right to freedom of speech and expression: \u2018political hyperbole.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Furthermore, appellant complains that the State did not present evidence that Governor O\u2019Malley was \u201cever aware\u201d of Mr. Abbott\u2019s email, or that the Governor \u201cexperienced any type of fear upon reading the letter.\u201d He also maintains that the content of the communication was \u201cconditional and therefore not a \u2018real\u2019 threat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The State counters that the evidence was legally sufficient to prove that \u201cAbbott knowingly and willingly made a threat to cause physical injury or death to Governor O\u2019Malley,\u201d in violation of C.L. \u00a7 3\u2014708(b). Noting that it is undisputed that on March 18, 2008, Abbott composed and sent the e-mail from his home computer to an official website of the State, addressed to Governor O\u2019Malley, the State insists that appellant\u2019s \u201cattempt to characterize the e-mail message as political hyperbole falls short.\u201d In its view, the message does not \u201ccontain politically protected speech,\u201d because the e-mail\u2019s \u201creferences to \u2018true AMERICAN\u2019S\u2019 and \u2018your MEXICAN army\u2019 and \u2018AMERICAN SELL OUT PIECE OF SHIT\u2019 are ambiguous at best,\u201d and the e-mail \u201csays nothing about immigration or illegal immigration.\u201d Rather, the State claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akg\">[T]he e-mail conveyed a message that a reasonable person receiving the message could interpret as a serious expression of an intent to harm. It communicated an intent to inflict harm by choking Governor O\u2019Malley and strangling the life out of him. It communicated a desire that the Governor die.... The message was unequivocal in its threat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>to harm the Governor. It was not ambiguous or capable of being viewed as anything but a threat to cause physical injury or death to the Governor. Further, the fact that the e-mail message expressed a condition, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cif I ever get close enough to you,\u201d does not mean that the message did not convey a \u201ctrue threat.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Moreover, the State maintains that appellant acted willfully, as required under the statute, because he \u201cintended to send the threatening e-mail to the Governor.\u201d According to the State, \u201c[wjhether Abbott actually intended to harm the Governor is irrelevant,\u201d because C.L. \u00a7 3-708 \u201crequires only that Abbott intended to make a threat against a State official, and his own testimony confirms that he did have that intent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The standard of review for the sufficiency of evidence is well settled. We must determine \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (emphasis in original); <em>see Rivers v. State, </em>393 Md. 569, 580, 903 A.2d 908 (2006); <em>Moye v. State, </em>369 Md. 2, 12, 796 A.2d 821 (2002). Notably, appellate review of the sufficiency of evidence does not involve \u201ca review of the record that would amount to a retrial of the case.\u201d <em>Winder v. State, </em>362 Md. 275, 325, 765 A.2d 97 (2001); <em>see Brawn v. State, </em>182 Md.App. 138, 156, 957 A.2d 654 (2008). As a reviewing court, \u201c[w]e do not re-weigh the evidence, but \u2018we do determine whether the verdict was supported by sufficient evidence, direct or circumstantial, which could convince a rational trier of fact of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offenses charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>374 Md. 527, 534, 823 A.2d 664 (2003) (quoting <em>White v.

In performing this role, the jury has the power to decide which testimony to accept and which to reject. In this regard, it may believe part of a particular witness\u2019s testimony, but disbelieve other parts of that witness\u2019s testimony. Moreover, it is the exclusive function of the jury to draw reasonable inferences from proven facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><em>Smith v.

Nevertheless, this precept does not license an appellate court to indulge in rank speculation. \u201c \u2018If upon all of the evidence, the defendant\u2019s guilt is left to conjecture or surmise, and has no solid factual foundation, there can be no conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown, supra, </em>182 Md.App. at 173, 957 A.2d 654 (quoting <em>Taylor v.

(1957, 1992 Repl.Vol., 1993 Supp.), Art. 27 \u00a7 561A, which was enacted in 1989. The only substantive alteration to C.L. \u00a7 3-708 was to extend the provision to include \u201clocal officials.\u201d <em>See </em>C.L. \u00a7 3-708(a)(2) and (b). Article 27, \u00a7 561A \u201cwas patterned on a substantially similar provision in .18 U.S.C. \u00a7 87.1(a), which prohibits throats to take the life of or inflict bodily harm upon the President of the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Pendergast v.

It said, <em>id. </em>at 707, 89 S.Ct. 1399:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">Certainly the statute under which petitioner was convicted is constitutional on its face.

The Court admonished:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">[W]e conclude that because section 561 A criminalizes pure speech and thereby implicates the free speech protections of the First Amendment and of Article 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, Maryland courts, in ruling on a motion for judgment of acquittal, must narrowly construe the statute and determine whether the speech is a true threat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 148, 636 A.2d 18. Nevertheless, the Court concluded that \u201cthe evidence was sufficient to establish that the language in appellant\u2019s .. . letter was a true threat to inflict bodily harm\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 561A. <em>Id. </em>at 149, 636 A.2d 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">In reaching its decision, the Court cited, <em>inter alia, United States v. Maisonet, </em>484 F.2d 1356 (4th Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U.S. 933, 94 S.Ct. 1447, 39 L.Ed.2d 491 (1974). <em>See </em>99 Md.App. at 147, 636 A.2d 18. We pause to review <em>Maisonet.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">Raul Maisonet sent a letter to the judge who had convicted him of possession of a weapon by a convicted felon. In the letter, sent to the judge\u2019s home, Maisonet wrote that if he ever got out of prison \u201cand nothing happen to me while I am in here, you will never be able to be prejudice and racist against another Puerto Rican like me.\u201d 484 F.2d at 1357. Maisonet was subsequently charged under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 876, which criminalizes \u201cmailing a letter \u2018containing . .. any threat to injure the person of the addressee.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1357. At trial, Maisonet testified that he merely \u201cintended to seek the judge\u2019s removal from office.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although Maisonet had \u201ccomplained to congressmen and civic organizations about the judge,\u201d he \u201cwas unable to show in these communications any specific request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>for an investigation of the judge or for his removal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>His conviction followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">On appeal, Maisonet contended that the court erred by-failing to grant a judgment of acquittal, \u201cbecause the government failed to introduce extrinsic evidence to show that he intended a threat to injure the judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Fourth Circuit recognized that the issue of whether the letter constituted a threat \u201cmust be determined in the light of the context in which it was written.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1358. But, it was not persuaded by Maisonet\u2019s position. <em>Id. </em>The Fourth Circuit determined that \u201cthe context in which Maisonet privately wrote the judge does not compel the conclusion that his letter must be interpreted only as a crude, extravagant boast that he would have the judge removed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1359. It reasoned, <em>id. </em>at 1358:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">If there is substantial evidence that tends to show beyond a reasonable doubt that an ordinary, reasonable recipient who is familiar with the context of the letter would interpret it as a threat of injury, the court should submit the case to the jury. Maisonet\u2019s letter itself and the following facts establish that the government\u2019s proof was sufficient to enable the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the letter constituted a threat and Maisonet intended it as such: Maisonet had been sentenced to prison by the judge to whom he addressed the letter; he considered the sentence to be illegal; he charged that the judge was motivated by prejudice and racism; he addressed the letter to the judge\u2019s home; and he said nothing in the letter about having the judge investigated or about seeking his removal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">Nor did Maisonet\u2019s defense that he was exercising first amendment rights require a judgment of acquittal at the conclusion of all the evidence.... Although he proved that he wrote congressmen and civic organizations, he was unable to show that he demanded either an investigation or the removal of the judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">The <em>Pendergast </em>Court also cited <em>United States v. Barcley, </em>452 F.2d 930 (8th Cir.1971), another case involving a conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 876. <em>See </em>99 Md.App. at 146-47, 636 A.2d 18. In Barcley, the conviction was predicated on a letter Barcley wrote to his attorney stating, in part: \u201c[A]s soon as I can get this case situated around in the position I want you are the first S.O.B. that will go, [the prosecutor] will [be] next.\u201d 452 F.2d at 932. Reversing the conviction, the Eighth Circuit noted that there are \u201ca number of innocuous interpretations which are equally plausible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 933. It stated: \u201cWhere a communication contains language which is equally susceptible of two interpretations, one threatening, and the other nonthroatening, the government carries the burden of presenting evidence serving to remove that ambiguity. Absent such proof, the trial court must direct a verdict of acquittal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). In the court\u2019s view, the letter was \u201cthe kind of letter a court appointed attorney might expect to receive from a dissatisfied client. ... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 933-34. The Eighth Circuit reasoned, <em>id. </em>at 934:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">Barcley\u2019s letter, much like the communication in <em>Watts, </em>is worded in the rowdy dowdy argot of the streets, but it does not clearly convey a threat of injury. Considering the context in which it was written, the principles enunciated in <em>Watts </em>strongly suggest that the government must offer something more than the equivocal language present here to establish the communication of a threat. In this case, neither Barcley\u2019s attorney nor [the prosecutor] testified that he experienced fear upon reading the letter.[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-6\"><em>Roberts, supra, </em>915 F.2d 889, is also informative. There, the defendant mailed a letter to Supreme Court Justice San<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>dra Day O\u2019Connor, which said: \u201cTo O\u2019Connor: Since the court insists upon violating my kids\u2019 rights to life (survive), you are all now notified that either Brennan/] Stevens [ ] or Kennedyc 3 is to die.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 890. When the defendant was interviewed, he indicated that he wrote the letter because of his view on abortion. <em>Id. </em>The defendant \u201cstated that he had \u2018a love in his heart\u2019 for all the Justices of the Supreme Court, [and] he found no conflict between that love and his desire to kill.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, the Fourth Circuit found the evidence sufficient to support the defendant\u2019s conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 115(a)(1)(B) (\u201cWhoever\u2014threatens to assault, kidnap, or murder ... a United States judge ... with intent to impede, intimidate, or interfere with such official, ... while engaged in the performance of official duties, or with intent to retaliate against such [judge] shall be punished ...\u201d) <em>Id. </em>at 890-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">More recently, in <em>United States v. Fullmer, </em>584 F.3d 132, 153-58 (3d Cir.2009), the Third Circuit upheld the convictions of an animal cruelty activist under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 43(a) (Animal Enterprise Protection Act). In that case, the defendant coordinated protests against targeted companies and individuals. <em>Id. </em>at 148. At one demonstration, held in front of a targeted individual\u2019s home, the defendant threatened to burn down the house, claiming that the police could not protect the homeowner. <em>Id. </em>at 157. In defense, the defendant claimed that her actions were protected by the First Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 137, 153-56, 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The court noted that the targeted individual \u201clived in fear\u201d that he would be physically assaulted. <em>Id. </em>at 157. According to the court, \u201chis fear of the protestors acting on their threats was reasonable,\u201d and the defendant \u201ccould reasonably foresee that [he] would interpret her words as a serious expression of intent to harm [him] and his family.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Concluding that the defendant\u2019s action constituted a true threat, the court cited <em>Watts </em>and reasoned, <em>id. </em>(emphasis in original):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">Under the <em>Watts </em>framework, this act, viewed in context with [her] other conduct, constitutes a true threat and is sufficient to remove her protest activity from First Amendment protection/3 We find it hard to see how threatening to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>burn down someone\u2019s house is \u201cpolitical hyperbole\u201d such that it might be protected by the First Amendment in the first place. However, even assuming that it has some underlying political value, viewed in the totality of the circumstances, this constituted a \u201ctrue threat.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-5\"><em>Kosma, supra, </em>951 F.2d at 553, is also noteworthy. There, the defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 871 of threatening President Reagan in a series of letters and mailgrams sent over a three-year period. <em>Id. </em>at 550-52. Kosma\u2019s first letter to President Reagan, postmarked March 2, 1988, invited the President to Philadelphia, stating, in part, <em>id. </em>at 550:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW_\">We are going to give you a 21 Gun-Salute. 21 guns are going to put bullets thru your heart &amp; brains. You are a Disgrace to the Air-Force. You are a Disgrace to Teddy Roosevelt. You are a disgrace to John F. Kennedy.... You are In Contempt of EVERYTHING that I represent, and standby, and believe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Another letter addressed to President Reagan, but sent to a presidential assistant, stated, <em>id. </em>at 551: \u201c[Y]ou are officially sentenced to death, by potassium-cyanide gas pellets. The impeachment is too lienient [sic] for you.\u201d Other communications sent to the presidential assistant referred to President Reagan\u2019s \u201cOfficial Death Sentence,\u201d with dates and locations. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">On appeal, Kosma argued that \u201chis letters to the President, though crude, offensive and inane, do not constitute \u2018true threats,\u2019 because they represent protected political speech under the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 553. The Third Circuit observed, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-8\">[The defendant] contends that the letters were merely his unique way of commenting on President Reagan\u2019s fitness for office and his Administration\u2019s policies.11 At the outset, we recognize that the First Amendment was meant to encompass not only learned political discourse but also vituperative verbal and written attacks on the President and other high government officials. <em>See Osborne v. Ohio, </em>495 U.S. 103, [148, 110 S.Ct. 1691, 109 L.Ed.2d 98] (1990) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>(Brennan, J., dissenting) (\u201cWhen speech is eloquent and the ideas expressed lofty, it is easy to find restrictions on them invalid. But were the First Amendment limited to such discourse, our freedom would be sterile indeed.\u201d); <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 270, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964) (\u201cdebate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust and wide-open, and ... may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">In affirming the conviction, the court distinguished Kosma\u2019s statements from those at issue in <em>Watts, </em>noting that \u201cthere was no overtly political context for Kosma\u2019s letters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 554. In this regard, it observed that \u201cKosma mailed his letters unsolicited to the President,\u201d and the \u201ccontent of his letters reveals an interest in political advocacy which is questionable at best.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, \u201cKosma\u2019s threats, though ostensibly phrased as \u2018invitations,\u2019 were not as conditional as those in <em>Watts, </em>which were dependent on the defendant\u2019s induction into the armed forces\u2014a condition which the defendant stated would never happen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In contrast, Kosma\u2019s threat included precise information, such as dates and locations, for his assassination.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\"><em>United States v. Callahan, </em>702 F.2d 964 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 840, 104 S.Ct. 133, 78 L.Ed.2d 128 (1983), also provides guidance. Callahan wrote a letter to the Director of the Secret Service that stated, in part, <em>id. </em>at 965:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">\u201cIt is essential that Reagan and Bush are assassinated on Inauguration Day in front of the television cameras.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">If you can arrange for me to get into the act, I will be willing to accept the responsibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-9\">I don\u2019t want anymore Protestant Scum in the White House. The separation of Church and State is a sacrosanct privilege to me and all Christians.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">After Callahan was convicted under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 871, he appealed, arguing that the statements in his letter did not constitute a \u201ctrue threat.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Eleventh Circuit disagreed, noting that the letter specified a time, date, and place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>of the threatened assassination and, even though \u201cthe carrying out of the threat might have been conditional upon Secret Service aid and agreement, the threat itself was not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 966. In determining that Callahan\u2019s statements constituted a \u201ctrue threat\u201d, the Eleventh Circuit stated, <em>id. </em>at 965: \u201cThe question is whether there was sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intentionally made the statement under such circumstances that a reasonable person would construe them as a serious expression of an intention to inflict bodily harm upon or to take the life of the persons named in the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The cases discussed above inescapably lead us to conclude that the evidence presented below, when construed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, was more than sufficient to find that appellant willfully and knowingly made a true threat to injure the Governor, in violation of C.L. \u00a7 3-708. We are satisfied that, in today\u2019s world, an e-mail constitutes a \u201cthreat in any written form,\u201d as required by C.L. \u00a7 3-708.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Moreover, appellant also admitted that he personally transmitted the e-mail to the Governor\u2019s office, \u201choping\u201d that the Governor would read it. Appellant\u2019s testimony established that he clearly intended to communicate to the Governor, allegedly for the purpose of getting the Governor\u2019s attention, because \u201cyou never get an answer any way from anybody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">To be sure, it was for the trier of fact to determine whether the content of the e-mail constituted a true threat to harm the Governor, rather than politically protected speech that merely voiced opposition to illegal immigration. In this regard, we are mindful that, before appellant sent the e-mail, he went to Annapolis to voice his opinion about illegal immigrants, and also posted a sign on his property about President Bush. But, a jury construing the e-mail could readily conclude that the oblique references in the e-mail to the Governor\u2019s \u201cMEXICAN army\u201d and \u201ctrue AMERICAN\u2019S\u201d did not convert the e-mail to a political statement. Rather, a reasonable person receiving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>the e-mail could have interpreted it as a serious expression of an intent to harm the Governor.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">We also recognize that appellant\u2019s threat was conditioned on physical proximity to the Governor, in order for appellant to have the ability to \u201c[w]rap [his] hands around [the Governor\u2019s] throat....\u201d Elected officials often make public appearances. Clearly, the contingency did not, as a matter of law, preclude a jury from finding that the communication amounted to a true threat. <em>Howell, supra, </em>719 F.2d at 1260 (hospital patient\u2019s statement that, if released, he would kill the President was a true threat); <em>Callahan, supra, </em>702 F.2d at 965 (letter to the Secret Service offering to kill the President if the Secret Service made proper arrangements at the President\u2019s inauguration constituted a true threat).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Appellant complains that the court erred by failing to propound certain jury instructions that he requested, both in writing and orally at trial, pertaining to his constitutional right to political expression and the requirement that the communication must be a true threat. Before reviewing the parties\u2019 legal contentions in more detail, we pause to review what transpired below.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Appellant proposed the following five written instructions, among others:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-9\">UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION, AMENDMENT 1: Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech, or, the right of the people to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. This law is made applicable to the State of Maryland, by virtue of the 14th Amendment of the United State Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-10\">MARYLAND DECLARATION OF RIGHTS, ARTICLE 10: That freedom of speech and debate ... ought not to be impeached in any Court of Judicature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>MARYLAND DECLARATION OF RIGHTS, ARTICLE 13: That every man hath a right to petition the Legislature for the redress of grievances in a peaceable and orderly manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">MARYLAND DECLARATION OF RIGHTS, ARTICLE 23: In the trial of all criminal cases, the Jury shall be the Judges of Law, as well as fact....

I\u2019m just going to read the parts of the statute that are applicable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: ... [G]iven the state of the evidence and counsel\u2019s opening statement, I would appreciate it and request that you also mention when you\u2019re discussing the statute, that the State does not have a burden of proving either that he intended to carry out the threat or had the ability to carry out the threat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">[THE COURT]: Okay. All right and [appellant\u2019s counsel], let me take a look at your [requested jury instructions]. Okay. Your missing witness instruction, you want to say anything about it? I understand it.

How did they have any more power than you had?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Well, it\u2019s the State\u2019s burden to prove the case.

Now, let me tell you what that is legally. A person may not knowingly and willfully make a threat to take the life of or cause physical injury to a State official. The Governor of the State of Maryland is a State official. There is no requirement that the State prove that the Defendant intended to carry out the threat when it was made or even had the ability to carry out the conduct threatened. Nor is there any requirement that the State official felt threatened. The essence of this offense is the making of the threat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">The court did not define the element of \u201ca threat\u201d or otherwise provide guidance to the jury as to how it should determine whether the communication constituted a threat. In particular, the court did not specify that an individual may only be convicted of a violation of C.L. \u00a7 3\u2014708(b) if the content of the communication constituted \u201ca true threat.\u201d Nor did the court inform the jury that the statute does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>criminalize statements of political expression, and that it is the jury\u2019s responsibility to distinguish political hyperbole from a true threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">After the court delivered its jury instructions, appellant\u2019s counsel asked the court to \u201cmake it clear [to the jurors] that they have to find it to be a real threat.\u201d The following colloquy is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">[THE COURT]: Real threat, okay. What else? [APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: I\u2019m going to object to your instruction relating to whether or not the testimony of the State official is required. I think that\u2019s the wrong law. It\u2019s not required, nobody\u2019s saying it is but....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">[THE COURT]: No, I didn\u2019t say his testimony was required. I said nor is there any requirement that the State official felt threatened. That\u2019s what I said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Well, I make an objection to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: I would also take exception to your Honor not giving the ... missing witness instruction as requested.... I would also ask the Court to instruct the jury ... that they, quote they are to narrowly construe the statute and determine whether the speech is a true threat as stated in <em>Pendergast, [supra, </em>99 Md.App. 141, 686 A.2d 18,] and it is the law of the State.... And, finally, and, again, I\u2019m quoting from <em>Pendergast v. State, </em>again, I would ask the Court to instruct the jury that the statute such as the one we have today that he, that Mr. Abbott\u2019s charged with, which makes ... criminal a form of (inaudible) speech <em>must be interpreted within, with the commands of the First Amendment clearly in mind. What is a threat must be distinguished from what is constitutionally protected speech.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-10\">[THE COURT]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-11\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: I would ask the Judge, your Honor, to give that instruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>[THE COURT]: Well, I don\u2019t intend to supplement any of the instructions by what you\u2019ve asked for, quite frankly. If this were a civil case, this, this would be a case where a Judge would grant Motion for judgment, in my view. It\u2019s a criminal case so that can\u2019t happen but in this case, the statements made are, in my view, by definition, a threat. As a matter of law, they are. In my view, that statement made that is a threat violates the statute, as a matter of law. But, since this is a criminal case, the Court has no ability to grant a Motion to find as a matter of law that the crime is made out. Whether the threat is a real threat or not, I have no ability, nor does any other human being that I know of, have the ability to delve into a Defendant\u2019s mind to know whether the Defendant is, whether it\u2019s a quote unquote real as you say. It\u2019s, in my view, the violation of this statute is the making of a threat of bodily harm to a State official and whether the maker intended to carry out the threat or had the ability to carry out the threat or whether the State official felt threatened or didn\u2019t feel threatened, none of those factors affect the wrong that this statute is addressed to protect against ... (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred by refusing to propound his proposed jury instructions (instructions nine through thirteen), which \u201cmerely stated what the law is regarding the First Amendment [to the United States Constitution] and the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\u201d In his view, the court \u201cdenied [him] the right and ability to frame his email to Gov. O\u2019Malley\u2014in response to Gov. O\u2019Malley\u2019s solicitation of opinions\u2014as \u2018political hyperbole.\u2019 \u201d Further, he disputes the court\u2019s \u201crationale\u201d for its ruling, i.e., \u201cthat the statute was found to be constitutional, so there is no right to raise the constitutional issue.\u201d Noting that the trial court instructed the jury that the State did not have to show that the \u201cState official felt threatened,\u201d appellant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">Coupled with the other court\u2019s instructions, i.e., the State did not have to \u201cprove that [appellant] intended to carry out the threat, <em>refusal to give an instruction that it at least had to be a, \u201creal threat\u201d, ... </em>rendered it impossible for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Defendant to receive a fair trial. (Citations omitted) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">The State counters that the trial court properly denied appellant\u2019s instructions nine through thirteen because they \u201cwere simply not proper jury instructions.\u201d In the State\u2019s view, these proposed instructions were \u201cincomplete quotations from various constitutional provisions and not a correct statement of the law that is applicable to this case.\u201d Further, it posits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-5\">Merely reading them to the jury without more would have given the jury no guidance as to how to apply the provisions to the evidence at issue in deciding whether there had been a violation of the statute. If anything, reading them to the jury would very likely have led to jury confusion and possibly misapplication of the law to the facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Moreover, the State argues that appellant waived his claim that the court improperly refused to \u201cinstruct the jury that the threat must be a \u2018real threat\u2019 and that the jury must narrowly construe the statute and distinguish a threat from constitutionally protected speech ...,\u201d because he did not include these requests in the proposed written instructions he submitted before trial. While recognizing that appellant \u201ctook exception to the court not giving these instructions,\u201d the State insists that the \u201cexception was not sufficient.\u201d Citing <em>Bowman v. State, </em>337 Md. 65, 69, 650 A.2d 954 (1994), the State explains that appellant failed to offer \u201cspecific additional instructions to the court for consideration that would explain how the jury should determine whether the e-mail communication constituted a \u2018real threat\u2019 or \u2018true threat,\u2019 as opposed to \u2018constitutionally protected speech.\u2019 \u201d The State elaborates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao4\">A jury, left without specific instruction as to what was meant by a \u201creal threat,\u201d could easily conclude that a \u201creal threat\u201d to strangle the Governor must be one in which the maker intended to strangle the Governor, which is clearly contrary to applicable law. Because Abbott did not clearly articulate the instruction that he wanted the court to give, he waived this claim. (Citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>Preliminarily, we find no merit in the State\u2019s waiver claim. From the inception of the trial, continuing through the jury instructions, defense counsel underscored that the linchpin of appellant\u2019s defense was that the e-mail constituted political hyperbole, and was therefore outside the ambit of C.L. \u00a7 8-708(b). At the outset of trial, for example, the State moved in limine to bar appellant from arguing in opening statement that the e-mail was protected by the First Amendment. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: ... Your Honor, we\u2019re not and don\u2019t intend to argue the constitutionality of the statute. The statute on its face is constitutional, however ... <em>one\u2019s rights to freedom of speech and political expression [are] a defense in a case like this when his threat was preceded by statements abemt his views on the illegal immigration and things of that nature. </em>So by preceding his alleged threat with those comments that are political in nature ... a statute such as this one which makes a criminal form of speech must be interpreted within the commands of the First Amendment clearly in mind. <em>What is a threat, must be distinguished from ivhat is constitutionally protected </em>speech.... <em>[Ajny statement ... made or potentially made to be an alleged, threat has to be considered in the context of ivhat is said and in this case he preceded his comments with the illegal immigration issue </em>so <em>it\u2019s a real defense for the jury to consider, not a,rguing constitutionality of the statute.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">[THE COURT]: Okay. [Counsel for the State?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: ... There\u2019s no question that the Defendant has a right to communicate with a public official. When that communication steps, steps outside of a certain boundary and becomes a threat, it is no longer constitutionally protected. The case law is clear as to that. <em>So the question in this case is only is the language in the communication a threat? That\u2019s the sole issue for the jury to decide with regard to this. If it is, </em>... <em>they don\u2019t have to answer any question about constitutionality, that\u2019s been answered for us. If they decide it's not a threat, then it\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number><em>not guilty under the very words of the statute. </em>So to allow the defense to make a First Amendment argument would put the State in the position of having to engage the jury in a discussion of First Amendment jurisprudence which I think all the cases recognize isn\u2019t appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-5\">[THE COURT]: Okay. <em>Well, I agree with [the State]. I think the jmy decides in this case whether the communication ... was a threat or not.... They don\u2019t decide whether it\u2019s, whether he has a constitutional right to make a threat, because he doesn\u2019t. </em>The statute is clear in Maryland, that you don\u2019t have a right to make a threat to a public official. Now, you can\u2019t argue that the Constitution overrides that statute and <em>the issue in this case is simply did Mr. Abbott make a threat to, in this case, Governor O\u2019Malley. </em>The jury will decide he either did or he didn\u2019t. If he did, then that makes out the crime.... <em>I\u2019m not going to allow an argument to be made </em>... <em>to the jury, that it is </em>... <em>constitutionally protected to make such a threat, </em>because quite frankly, contrary to what we talked about in chambers, I don\u2019t think the <em>Watts </em>case says that at all. I don\u2019t think it says that if you make a threat but you do it in the context of a political statement, ... that takes away from it being a threat.... The facts [of this case] are not similar [to the facts of <em>Watts </em>] as I understand them to be[,] so the Motion in liminae [sic] filed by the State is granted. You cannot argue to the jury -without first coming up and getting permission from the Court the constitutionality of the right.... <em>[Y]ou can\u2019t argue that the First Amendment allows it. </em>The jury doesn\u2019t decide, we don\u2019t get into a constitutional debate with the jury or have them debate what is the Constitution. They follow the law as I state it to them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: But I really don\u2019t understand the extent of the Motion in liminae [sic].

My question is, <em>are you advising or ordering me not to say that Mr. Abbott has the right of political expression?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-6\">[THE COURT]: <em>Everybody has the 'right of political expression.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: That\u2019s what I thought.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-8\">[THE COURT]: <em>But he doesn\u2019t have the right to threaten the State official.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: But, what Pm saying is, are you telling me that T can\u2019t argue this particular alleged ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7u\">[THE COURT]: <em>You can argue that this 'wasn\u2019t a threat of a public official. You can argue that Mr. Abbott didn\u2019t threaten a public official. You can argue that these words do not constitute a threat.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: I mean, my question is that the words that he said are taken in light of another statement preceding that which is his right to political expression.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-11\">[THE COURT]: No, it isn\u2019t. You don\u2019t have a right to say and I don\u2019t think <em>Walts </em>says you have a right to say politically I really disagree with everything that the Governor says about any issue. As a matter of fact, I find it disgusting.... I find it outrageous, his position in regard to whatever and because of that Pm going to choke the life out of him if I get a chance. Pm saying it doesn\u2019t make any difference that you say because I disagree with his politics or I disagree with his political, with his position on any particular political issue. The law doesn\u2019t permit that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASNz\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: ... [F]or the record[, I] would just note an exception because <em>I think what the Court\u2019s doing is preventing me from arguing a factual defense and that is his rights to free and unfettered political expression.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>[THE COURT]: He doesn\u2019t have a right to free and unfettered political expression if that, if that political expression includes the right to threaten] to do somebody bodily harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: But you\u2019re saying that\u2019s not a jury question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">[THE COURT]: <em>It\u2019s not a jury question.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. I\u2019ll just note my exception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">The State conceded early on that the \u201csole issue\u201d for the jury to decide was whether the communication constituted a threat. In other colloquies during trial, the defense reiterated its position that the disputed communication was not a \u201creal\u201d threat. On this record, it is evident that the court did not decline to propound the requested instruction as to a true threat because the language of appellant\u2019s proposed instruction was deficient. To the contrary, it declined to so instruct because it saw no merit in appellant\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">We find no support for the suggestion that the court need not give an instruction merely because it is poorly or inadequately worded. The responsibility of a judge to instruct the jury in a criminal trial is governed by Maryland Rule 4-325(c), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-11\">The court may, and at the request of any party shall, instruct the jury as to the applicable law and the extent to which the instructions are binding. The court may give its instructions orally or, with the consent of the parties, in writing instead of orally. The court need not grant a requested instruction if the matter is fairly covered by instructions actually given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-12\"><em>See also Roach v. State, </em>358 Md. 418, 427, 749 A.2d 787 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-13\">In <em>Clark v. State, </em>80 Md.App. 405, 414, 564 A.2d 90 (1989), the defendant\u2019s requested jury instructions were not technically correct statements of the law. Nevertheless, this Court held that appellant was entitled to a correct jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 414-15, 564 A.2d 90.

To hold otherwise would be to place on the parties the responsibility for determining what the law is, a responsibility which is properly entrusted to the court. <em>See Gooch v. State, </em>34 Md.App. 331, 367 A.2d 90 (1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>280 Md. 735 (1977); <em>Braxton v.

Rule 4-325(c) \u201crequires the court to \u2018instruct the jury as to the applicable law\u2019 when requested to do so by a party; it does not specify that the court must instruct the jury as to the applicable law only upon request of a party by means of a proposed instruction which correctly states the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414, 564 A.2d 90. The Court reasoned, <em>id. </em>(emphasis in original):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\">Moreover, to interpret [Md. Rule 4-325(c) ] as requiring a party desiring an instruction to submit a suggested one which contains a correct statement of the law could lead to anomalous and absurd results. Consider the following scenario. The evidence in a case would support the giving of an instruction on a subject of some importance in the case and which both parties agree should be given. Unfortunately, neither of the proposed instructions submitted by the parties is a technically correct statement of the law on the subject. Under the State\u2019s argument, notwithstanding the importance of the issue, hence, the desirability of instructing the jury on it, and the fact that both parties requested an instruction on the point, the court would not have to give <em>any </em>instruction. Such a result is untenable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">In <em>Privette v. State, </em>320 Md. 738, 747, 580 A.2d 188 (1990), the Court recognized that the trial judge \u201ccannot be faulted for failing to give the precise instruction requested by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>defendants\u201d because \u201c[i]t is a mish-mash of garbled verbiage, more apt to confuse than to inform.\u201d Nevertheless, it determined that the appellant\u2019s failure to submit a more fully developed jury instruction did not relieve the trial court of its responsibility to craft an appropriate instruction as to the applicable law. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals concluded that the failure to instruct the jury as to the applicable law required a new trial.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Generally, on review, we \u201c \u2018must determine whether the requested instruction was a correct statement of the law; whether it was applicable under the facts of the case <em>[i.e., </em>whether the evidence was sufficient to generate the desired instruction]; and whether it was fairly covered in the instructions actually given.\u2019 \u201d <em>Janey v. State, </em>166 Md.App. 645, 654, 891 A.2d 355 (emphasis and brackets in original) (quoting <em>Gunning v.

On the other hand, the instructions must be read in context. \u201cThe charge to the jury must be considered as a whole and the Court will not condemn a charge because of the way in which it is expressed or because an isolated part of it does not seem to do justice to one side or the other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number><em>Fleming v. State, </em>373 Md. 426, 433, 818 A.2d 1117 (2003), is also pertinent. There, the Court explained: \u201cThe jury instructions must be read together, and if, taken as a whole, they correctly state the law, are not misleading, and cover adequately the issues raised by the evidence, the defendant has not been prejudiced and reversal is inappropriate.\u201d <em>See also Roary v.

They were either incomplete quotations of constitutional provisions that had no application to this case; deficient because they did not include any guidance to the jury as to how to apply the provisions in the context of the evidence; or they were legally incorrect. Moreover, to the extent that the provisions had any bearing on the case, the court, in its discretion, was not required to inform the jury of the source of appellant\u2019s rights. <em>Cf. Thompson v. State, </em>393 Md. 291, 311, 901 A.2d 208 (2006) (explaining that we review for abuse of discretion a trial judge\u2019s decision whether to give a particular jury instruction). The question remains, however, whether appellant was entitled to the requested jury instruction concerning a \u201ctrue threat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\"> \u201cThe main purpose of a jury instruction is to aid the jury in clearly understanding the case, to provide guidance for the jury\u2019s deliberations, and to help the jury arrive at a correct verdict.\u201d <em>Chambers v. State, </em>337 Md. 44, 48, 650 A.2d 727 (1994). Whether the requested instruction is applicable to the particular facts is a question of law. <em>Roach, </em>358 Md. at 428, 749 A.2d 787. This \u201cturns on whether there is any evidence in the case that supports the instruction.\u201d <em>Dishman, v. State, </em>352 Md. 279, 292, 721 A.2d 699 (1998); <em>see Riggins v.

State, </em>319 Md. 540, 550, 573 A.2d 1317 (1990)). The threshold is not high, however. A criminal defendant is entitled to an accurate jury instruction so long as the defendant \u201c \u2018produced that minimum threshold of evidence necessary to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case that would allow a jury to rationally conclude that the evidence supports the application of the legal theory desired.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cantine v.

State, </em>384 Md. 631, 650, 866 A.2d 129 (2005). Put another way, a requested instruction must be given if there is \u201csome evidence\u201d that supports the defense theory. Notably, the State did not argue that appellant failed to meet the minimum threshold to pursue his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">As we have indicated, C.L. \u00a7 3-708, like its federal counterpart, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 871, \u201cmakes criminal a form of pure speech,\u201d and therefore it \u201cmust be interpreted with the commands of the First Amendment clearly in mind.\u201d <em>Watts, supra, </em>394 U.S. at 707, 89 S.Ct. 1399 (referring to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 871).

But, the court\u2019s instruction was incomplete. The court never instructed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>jury as to the meaning of \u201ca threat.\u201d Nor did it provide any guidance to the jury as to how to determine whether the communication amounted to a threat, or instruct that only a \u201ctrue threat\u201d violates the statute. Therefore, its instruction was erroneous. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">A review of the pattern federal jury instructions with respect to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 871 (threats against the President) highlights the deficiencies in the circuit court\u2019s instruction. We quote, in part, from MFJI \u00a7 31-4 as to the \u201cSecond Element\u2014Threat.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">The second element the government must establish beyond a reasonable doubt is that the words communicated by the defendant were in fact a threat, as I will define that term for you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">A threat is a serious statement expressing an intention to inflict bodily injury (or kill or kidnap) at once or in the future, as distinguished from idle or careless talk, exaggeration, or something said in a joking manner. A statement is a threat if it was made under such circumstances that a reasonable person hearing or reading the statement would understand it as a serious expression of intent to inflict bodily injury (or a reasonable person making the statement would foresee that the recipient would understand it as a serious expression of intent to inflict bodily injury).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">To determine whether or not the defendant \u201cthreatened\u201d the President, you should consider the circumstances under which the statement was made, including its context with respect to surrounding conversation, the language the defendant used, and the reaction of those who heard or read the statement. You may also consider the defendant\u2019s political loyalties, but I remind you that the even the crudest, most offensive methods of stating political opposition to the President are not threats as I have defined that term for you....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number><em>Dysart, supra, 705 </em>F.2d 1247, is also instructive in analyzing the adequacy of the circuit court\u2019s instruction. On April 9, 1981, Dysart mailed a letter to President Reagan that stated, in part: \u201cI am going to fly to Washington and am going to assassinate you on May <em>5, </em>1981.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1249. Four days later, Dysart mailed another letter to President Reagan, apologizing for his previous letter. <em>Id. </em>He claimed in the second letter that he \u201cwould never want to do anything that would cause harm or slight to befall you.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The letters were opened by a United State Postal Service employee. <em>Id. </em>at 1248,1248 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">On appeal, Dysart argued that \u201cthe trial court erred in failing to charge that for conviction under \u00a7 871, it must be shown that Dysart intended the letter to be taken as a threat, even if he had no intention of carrying out the threat.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1256. The Tenth Circuit disagreed, noting: \u201cA conviction under \u00a7 871 does not require proof that the defendant actually intended to carry out the threat.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Of particular significance here, Dysart also complained that the jury instructions did not make clear that he could not be convicted unless the communication constituted a true threat. The court quoted with approval the trial court\u2019s jury instructions, which stand in marked contrast to the instructions delivered in this case. <em>Id. </em>at 1256. They provided, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-7\">In a prosecution for threats against the President, it is not necessary to show that the defendant intended to carry out the threat, nor is it necessary to prove that the defendant actually had the apparent ability to carry out the threat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-8\">The question is whether those who hear or read the threat reasonably consider that an actual threat has been made. It is the making of the threat, not the intention to carry it out, that violates the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-9\"><em>The </em>term \u201cthreat\u201d <em>means an avowed present determination or intent to injure presently or in the future. A </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number><em>statement may constitute a threat even though it is subject to a possible contingency in the maker\u2019s control. The prosecution must establish a \u201ctrue threat\u2019\u2019 which means a serious threat as distingtoished from words as mere political argument, talk or jest.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-5\"><em>In determining whether words were uttered as a threat, the context in which they were spoken must be considered. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The Tenth Circuit was \u201cpersuaded that the \u2018true threat\u2019 requirement of <em>Watts, supra, </em>was satisfied by the instruction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It also said: \u201cDysart\u2019s complaint that the instructions did not avoid the risk of conviction for a crude jest or expression of political hostility is clearly untenable in light of the explicit guidance on that point found in the instructions.\u201d <em>Id. See also United States v. Smith, </em>670 F.2d 921, 923 n. 2 (10th Cir.1982) (involving a conviction under 18 \u00cdI.S.C. \u00a7 871 for mailing a threatening letter to President Carter; the trial court gave the following jury instruction, in part: \u201cThe prosecution must establish a \u2018true threat,\u2019 which means a serious threat as distinguished from words uttered as mere political argument, idle talk or jest. In determining whether words were uttered as a threat the context in which they were spoken must be considered.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">In <em>Maisonet, </em>the Fourth Circuit made the following observations about the jury instructions, 484 F.2d at 1359:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-8\">[The district judge] charged the jury that the government was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the letter contained a threat to injure the judge and that Maisonet intended it to be such a threat. He instructed that every person has the right to communicate with any public official calling attention to improper or unlawful conduct on the official\u2019s part and that the language used may be \u201cvehement, caustic, unpleasantly sharp, vituperative, abusive, or inexact\u201d without violating the law. He cautioned that every person has the right to seek by proper means the removal of any public official, and finally, he told the jury that a threat to seek an official\u2019s removal, regardless of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>whether the person has reasonable grounds to believe that the official acted improperly, is not a violation of the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The court\u2019s instructions in this case did not resemble those in <em>Dysart, Smith, </em>or <em>Maisonet. </em>Appellant took exception to the jury instructions, claiming that the court did not \u201cmake it clear that [the jurors] have to find it to be a real threat.\u201d Although the court explained to the jury that appellant had to \u201cknowingly and willfully make a threat to take the life of or cause physical injury to a State official,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he essence of this offense is the making of the threat,\u201d the court never informed the jury that only a true threat falls within the statute, and that political vitriol may fall outside its ambit.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">We conclude that the court erred because it did not define the term \u201cthreat\u201d or instruct the jury about how it was to determine whether the e-mail communication constituted a threat. In this regard, the court should have instructed the jury as to the requirement of a true threat, which is distinguished from constitutionally protected speech. Accordingly, we shall vacate appellant\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">JUDGMENT VACATED.

At trial, appellant denied that he used certain \u201ccuss words\u201d in the email. He claimed that the e-mail had been altered, because it contained words he did not type and would never say. For example, he claimed: \"I didn\u2019t type fuck Walter Carl Abbott you. Didn\u2019t type that.\u201d But, he admitted that he called the Governor \"a no good piece of shit American sellout.\u201d He added: \"I wrote most of this stuff but like I said there was things added in.... These are not the exact words, these are not my exact words.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">For the purpose of this appeal, these assertions are not pertinent.

In his proposed jury instructions, appellant only included this introductory portion of Article 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. This requested instruction is not a correct statement of the law. The Court of Appeals has said: \u201cImplicit in the decisions of this Court limiting the jury's judicial role to the 'law of the crime' is a recognition that all other legal issues are for the judge alone to decide.\u201d <em>Stevenson v. State, </em>289 Md. 167, 179, 423 A.2d 558 (1980). In <em>State v. Adams, </em>406 Md. 240, 256-58, 958 A.2d 295 (2008), the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-9\">By its terms, <em>Stevenson </em>purported to express the limitations on ihe power of the jury implicit in earlier Maryland appellate decisions. <em>See, e.g., Lewis v.

State, </em>42 Md. 563, 570 (1875). \u201cRather, the <em>Stevenson </em>court is clear that it did not make new law, but rather it merely clarified what has always been the law in Maryland.\u201d <em>Jenkins v. Smith, </em>38 F.Supp.2d 417, 421 (D.Md.1999), <em>aff'd, Jenkins v. Hutchinson, </em>221 F.3d 679, 684 (4th Cir.2000).1 1 The <em>Stevenson </em>Court pointed out that \u201cthis Court has consistently interpreted this constitutional provision as restraining the jury's law deciding power to this limited, albeit important, area.\u201d <em>Stevenson, </em>289 Md. at 178, 423 A.2d at 564. The majority opinion highlighted, as an example, a then recent decision applying the long established principle that the jury serves only as a judge of the \u201claw of the crime.\u201d <em>See Lewis v.

Appellant proposed the following jury instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-11\">You have heard testimony about Governor Martin O'Malley, being the victim of ihe alleged threatening e-mail. Governor O'Malley was not called as a witness in this case. If a witness could have given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>important testimony on an issue in this case, such as whether or not he felt threatened by Mr. Abbott\u2019s e-mail, and if the witness was peculiarly within the power of the State to produce, but was not called as a witness by the State and the absence of that witness was not sufficiently accounted for or explained then you may decide that the testimony of that witness would have been unfavorable to the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">In his brief, appellant included in his questions presented the contention that the trial court failed to propound a missing witness instruction. But, he failed to discuss this issue elsewhere in his brief. In <em>Oak Crest Village, Inc. v. Murphy, </em>379 Md. 229, 241, 841 A.2d 816 (2004), the Court said: \"An appellant is required to articulate and adequately argue all issues the appellant desires the appellate court to consider in the appellant\u2019s initial brief.\u201d <em>DiPino v. Davis, </em>354 Md. 18, 729 A.2d 354 (1999), is also instructive. There, the Court explained, <em>id. </em>at 56, 729 A.2d 354:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-9\">It is true that, if a point germane to the appeal is not adequately raised in a party\u2019s brief, the court may, and ordinarily should, decline to address it. <em>Health Serv. Cost Rev. v. Lutheran Hosp., </em>298 Md. 651, 664, 472 A.2d 55, 61 (1984). Apart from the fact that Maryland Rule 8-504(a)(5) requires the brief to contain argument, it would normally be unfair to the other party for the court to rule adversely to that party on an issue that was not properly presented and on which the party therefore had no adequate opportunity to respond.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">Accordingly, we decline to address the matter-of a missing witness instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b664-7\">. We recognize that appellant's proposed text was not helpful to the judge. But, the State also failed to provide the court with any guidance as to the elements of the offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b667-9\">. MFJI \u00a7 31-2 sets forth all the elements of the offense. It states, in part: \"Second [element], that the words were in fact a threat;''</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b670-8\">. On remand, the court should look for guidance to the instructions contained in MFJI.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">In light of our disposition, we need not address appellant's claim that the court improperly restricted the opening and closing arguments of defense counsel. Nevertheless, defense counsel did, in fact, argue to the jury that appellant's e-mail was merely \"a political statement,\" and that he had \"a right\u201d to express his views. In the context of this case, however, the argument of counsel was not an adequate substitute for a full explanation by the court of the elements of the offense. The court's failure to fully instruct the jury deprived appellant of the judicial imprimatur of his defense\u2014that, if the jury concluded that the e-mail was, in fact, a political statement, then it was not a true threat. This is not to suggest that the jury necessarily would have agreed with appellant\u2019s defense. But, that is not the test.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
