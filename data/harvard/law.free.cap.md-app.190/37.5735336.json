The information collected during the investigation formed the basis for an affidavit by Detectives George Davis and Mark Rutkowski (\u201cdetectives\u201d or \u201caffiants\u201d) in support of applications for an arrest warrant for Faulkner and five search warrants: two for vehicles used by Faulkner, one for a business owned and operated by him, and two for residential dwellings linked to him. The affidavit set forth the following relevant facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">In early July 2007, Detectives Davis and Rutkowski began investigating suspected narcotics trafficking in certain areas of Baltimore City by a person they knew only as \u201cPoops.\u201d A police registered confidential informant (\u201cCl\u201d) gave the detectives information that \u201cPoops\u201d was selling bulk quantities of cocaine out of Jaffes Package Goods and Groceries (\u201cJaffes\u201d), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>a store he owned and operated at 1616 E. Oliver Street. The Cl also informed them that \u201cPoops\u201d was using a green 1994 Mitsubishi Galant with a cream colored left fender (\u201cMitsubishi\u201d) to transport the cocaine to various distribution points.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">To verify the information from the Cl, the detectives began surveillance of Jaffes. They saw a Mitsubishi matching the description provided by the Cl parked in front of Jaffes; and then saw a black male approximately 5' 8\" to 5' 10\" tall and between 185 and 200 pounds exit the store and enter the vehicle. A check of the vehicle\u2019s license plate number revealed that Faulkner was the Mitsubishi\u2019s owner and that his registered address was 485 E. 28th Street, in Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The detectives met -with the Cl and showed him a photograph of Faulkner obtained from the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration. The Cl \u201cimmediately and without hesitation\u201d identified the person in the photograph as \u201cPoops.\u201d The Cl said he did not know any personal information about \u201cPoops,\u201d but he could engage in a controlled purchase of narcotics from him. The detectives decided to consider the idea after further investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">By entering Faulkner\u2019s name into various law enforcement databases, the detectives confirmed Faulkner\u2019s registered home address of 435 E. 28th Street. They also uncovered a second address linked to Faulkner: 5722 Plainfield Avenue, Apartment F (\u201cthe Plainfield Apartment\u201d). They learned that on October 3, 2005, Faulkner had opened a Baltimore Gas and Electric account, which still was active, for the Plainfield Apartment. Police set up surveillance of the E. 28th Street address and the Plainfield Apartment. More than ten times in the month of July 2007, they witnessed Faulkner drive to the Plainfield Apartment in the evening between 11:00 p.m. and midnight. They concluded from these observations that Faulkner was using the Plainfield Apartment as a residence without identifying it as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">After another meeting with the Cl, police decided to move forward with a controlled buy of cocaine from Faulkner. During the third week of July 2007, the Cl contacted Faulkner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>to arrange a time and a location in Baltimore City for the purchase. (The precise location is not revealed in the record, presumably to protect the Cl\u2019s identity.) With police in place to observe the transaction, the Cl went to the agreed meeting point. Faulkner arrived in the Mitsubishi. He was accompanied by a black female in her late 20s or early 80s. The Cl made a successful purchase of cocaine from Faulkner, who then drove directly to Jaffes.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">Over the following weeks, police on \u201cmany occasions\u201d observed Faulkner drive to the Plainfield Apartment after closing Jaffes. Sometimes Faulkner would leave Jaffes in the Mitsubishi. Other times, a black female with physical characteristics similar to those of the woman present at the controlled buy would arrive in a silver 1997 Audi (\u201cAudi\u201d), exit the vehicle, and re-enter on the passenger side to allow Faulkner to drive the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">On one occasion, police followed the Audi to a parking area on Guilford Avenue, under the Jones Falls Expressway. Faulkner exited the vehicle carrying a dark plastic bag and entered the passenger side of a waiting Ford automobile operated by a black male. Faulkner spent several minutes in the Ford in \u201canimated conversation\u201d with the driver. When he exited the Ford, he no longer was carrying the plastic bag but instead was holding U.S. currency, which he placed in his pants pocket. He and the unidentified black female then drove to Jaffes. Based on the affiants\u2019 experience and training, they believed the interaction they had witnessed beneath the Jones Falls Expressway was an illegal drug transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">During the fourth week of July 2007, under police supervision, the Cl made a second controlled purchase of cocaine from Faulkner. This time, Faulkner arrived alone at the meeting place (again undisclosed), in the Mitsubishi. After completing the sale, he drove to Jaffes.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">A criminal background check of Faulkner revealed that he was arrested in 2004 on the charge of murder in the first degree \u201cwith a disposition of Criminal Jeopardy and a charge of Handgun: Use in Committing a Crime resulting in Probation Before Judgment.\u201d The affiants also noted that their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>supervisor had discovered two properly documented handguns during a bar inspection of Jaffes in early 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The affidavit concluded with the detectives stating their belief that Faulkner was using his person as well as Jaffes, his \u201cobserved address\u201d at Plainfield Avenue, the Mitsubishi, and the Audi \u201cfor the illegal ... storage, transportation and concealment of controlled dangerous substances, related paraphernalia and suspected proceeds from [narcotics] sales\u201d; and that documentation of the drug trafficking would be found at Faulkner\u2019s registered address, on E. 28th Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The affidavit was accompanied by statements of \u201cexpertise\u201d for both affiants. The statement prepared by Detective Rutkowski included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">As a result of the extensive knowledge gained by training, conversations, and the actual experience executing [narcotics-related] warrant[s][and] arrests, your Affiant can make certain statements relating to methods ... narcotics trafficking. <em>Individuals involved in the narcotic[s] trade often use numerous different addresses to facilitate and aide in the furtherance of their illegal activity. </em>Official documents and various personal documents and identification can verify this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">(Emphasis added.) Detective Rutkowski\u2019s statement went on to list the various types of evidence often recovered from addresses used by narcotics traffickers, including narcotics, objects used for processing and storing narcotics, U.S. currency, documents, and firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">On August 2, 2007, a judge in the District Court for Baltimore City, after reviewing the applications and attached documents submitted by the detectives, issued an arrest warrant for Faulkner and search warrants for Jaffes, the Plain-field Apartment, the E. 28th Street address, and the Mitsubishi and Audi automobiles. The warrants were executed on August 4, 2007. In the Plainfield Apartment, the detectives found four clear plastic bags containing what was later confirmed to be cocaine with street values ranging from approximately $800 to $2,000; several firearms, including one with an obliterated serial number; ammunition; U.S. currency stored <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>in a shoe box; a digital scale with suspected cocaine residue; and other items associated with the processing and packaging of cocaine. In addition, they recovered various documents listing Faulkner\u2019s name in association with that address.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">The detectives also seized property from Jaffes, the E. 28th Street address, the Mitsubishi, and Faulkner himself.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Only the search of the Plainfield Apartment uncovered narcotics and weapons, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Faulkner was charged with several crimes, including possession with intent to distribute cocaine and possession of a firearm during a drug trafficking crime. He moved to suppress the evidence recovered from the Plainfield Apartment as the product of an invalidly issued warrant. At a suppression hearing on June 8, 2009, the court granted Faulkner\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">In so ruling, the motion judge reasoned that there was nothing in the affidavit linking Faulkner\u2019s narcotics trafficking activities to the Plainfield Apartment, and therefore the warrant for that location was not issued upon probable cause. In particular, he commented that there is nothing unusual about a person\u2019s returning to his home at night. The judge observed: \u201cThere\u2019s just nothing to show the [Plainfield Apartment] was used for drug dealing, other than we can infer. Which the law says we can\u2019t do.\u201d Further, the motion judge found the affidavit so lacking in probable cause to search the Plainfield Apartment that the police could not have relied upon it in good faith. Accordingly, the court ordered the evidence seized from that location suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">We shall provide additional facts as pertinent to our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ADt\">\n<em>\u201cSubstantial Basis\u201d Test</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>ment, <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961), states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.<footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The task of a judicial officer presented with a warrant application \u201cis to reach a practical and common-sense decision, given all of the circumstances set forth in the affidavit, as to whether there exists a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular search.\u201d <em>Greenstreet v. State, </em>392 Md. 652, 668, 898 A.2d 961 (2006) (citing <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238-39, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983)); <em>see Patterson v. State, </em>401 Md. 76, 91, 930 A.2d 348 (2007) (\u201cProbable cause has been defined by this Court as \u2018a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Malcolm v. State, </em>314 Md. 221, 227, 550 A.2d 670 (1988)))<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">When evidence has been recovered in a warrant-authorized search, it is not the task of a court ruling on a motion to suppress, or an appellate court reviewing the suppression decision on appeal, to conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of the issuing judge\u2019s probable cause decision. <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>178 Md.App. 156, 163, 941 A.2d 517 (2008). Rather, those courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>are to determine whether the issuing judge had a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d for finding probable cause to conduct the search. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe substantial basis standard involves something less than finding the existence of probable cause, and is less demanding than even the familiar \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 standard by which appellate courts review judicial fact finding in a trial setting.\u201d <em>State v. Coley, </em>145 Md.App. 502, 521, 805 A.2d 1186 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted) (citations omitted). Moreover, reviewing courts must assess affidavits for search warrants in \u201ca eommonsense and realistic fashion,\u201d keeping in mind that they \u201care normally drafted by nonlawyers in the midst and haste of a criminal investigation.\u201d <em>United States v. Ventresca, </em>380 U.S. 102, 108, 85 S.Ct. 741, 13 L.Ed.2d 684 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">In <em>Illinois v. Gates, supra, </em>the Supreme Court explained that this deferential \u201csubstantial basis\u201d standard of review is a function of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s strong preference for searches carried out pursuant to warrants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">[A]fter-the-fact scrutiny by courts of the sufficiency of an affidavit should not take the form of <em>de novo </em>review. A magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause should be paid great deference by reviewing courts. A grudging or negative attitude by reviewing courts toward warrants is inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment\u2019s strong preference for searches conducted pursuant to a warrant; courts should not invalidate warrants by interpreting affidavits in a hyper-technical, rather than a eommonsense, manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">462 U.S. at 236, 103 S.Ct. 2317 (internal quotation marks omitted) (citations omitted). Indeed, the <em>Gates </em>Court further observed that over-scrutiny of affidavits prepared by police officers in support of warrant applications might cause them to eschew the warrant process altogether, thus increasing the perception of unlawful and intrusive police conduct. Acknowledging the difficulty in some cases of determining whether an affidavit demonstrates probable cause, the Court reasoned that the preference for warrants dictates that their validity be upheld in \u201c \u2018doubtful or marginal cases.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237 n. 10, 103 S.Ct. 2317 (quoting <em>Ventresca, </em>380 U.S. at 109, 85 S.Ct. 741). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number><em>See also Holmes v. State, </em>368 Md. 506, 521, 796 A.2d 90 (2002); <em>Ferguson v. State, </em>157 Md.App. 580, 593, 853 A.2d 784 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The transcript of the suppression hearing in the case at bar reveals that the motion judge was making his own <em>de novo </em>decision as to whether there was probable cause to believe there would be evidence of drug dealing in the Plain-field Apartment. \u201cThe court\u2019s responsibility, however, was not to assess to its satisfaction the existence of probable cause, but, rather, to determine if the issuing magistrate\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Coley, </em>145 Md.App. at 521, 805 A.2d 1186. Thus, the motion court erred in deciding the issue of probable cause <em>de novo. </em>If there indeed was a substantial basis for the issuing judge\u2019s finding of probable cause, the court\u2019s error was not harmless. Therefore, we must decide the \u201csubstantial basis\u201d question ourselves, giving preference to the validity of the warrant to the extent that this is a close case.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The State argues that the affidavit\u2019s descriptions of Faulkner\u2019s sale of illegal narcotics, his travel from Jaffes to the Plainfield Apartment in the same vehicles he used for narcotics transactions, and the surveillance and utility records linking Faulkner to the Plainfield Apartment furnished a substantial basis for the issuing judge to find probable cause to believe narcotics and weapons were being kept at the Plain-field Apartment. The State implicitly acknowledges that the affidavit contains no factual assertions directly linking Faulkner\u2019s criminal activity to the Plainfield Apartment. It maintains, however, that the totality of the circumstances establish a \u201ccommon sense nexus\u201d between Faulkner\u2019s narcotics trafficking activities and that apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Before we can assess whether the warrant application furnished a substantial basis for the issuing judge to find probable cause to search the Plainfield Apartment, we must decide whether the detectives\u2019 statements of expertise properly were before the issuing judge as part of the warrant application. The motion judge made several comments to the effect that the statements of expertise could not be considered by the issuing judge, as they were not given under oath <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>(although it is unclear from the record whether that played a part in the suppression court\u2019s ruling). The statements of expertise, although part of the warrant application, were not contained within the document labeled \u201caffidavit.\u201d Each page of the statements was initialed by the issuing judge, however, so it is clear he reviewed and considered them as part of the warrant application.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">Under the \u201cfour corners\u201d rule, an issuing judge\u2019s decision as to whether probable cause exists for a search warrant for a particular location must be made solely from the contents of the affidavit submitted in support of the warrant request. <em>Collins v. State, </em>17 Md.App. 876, 381, 302 A.2d 693 (1973); <em>Brooks v. State, </em>18 Md.App. 151, 154, 282 A.2d 516 (1971); <em>see </em>Md.Code (2008 Repl.Vol., 2009 Supp.), Criminal Procedure Article, \u00a7 1-203(a)(2)(i) (\u201cAn application for a search warrant shall be: 1. in writing; 2. signed and sworn to by the applicant; and 3. accompanied by an affidavit that: A. sets forth the basis for probable cause as described in paragraph (1) of this subsection; and B. contains facts within the personal knowledge of the affiant that there is probable cause.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">In this case, for each requested warrant, the issuing judge was given an application consisting of a multi-page affidavit, signed by the detectives; exhibits; and a typed, unsigned statement of expertise for each detective, setting forth his background, experience, and areas of knowledge respecting drug trafficking. At most, the detectives\u2019 failure to label their statements of expertise as part of the affidavit or to include language in the affidavit incorporating the statements of expertise was a technical oversight. The detectives and the issuing judge understood them to be sworn statements contained within the warrant application. Indeed, the detectives referred to themselves in the statements as \u201caffiants.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">In our view, given that the detectives presented the issuing judge with a sworn \u201capplication for search and seizure\u201d war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>rant to which the statements of expertise, like the affidavit, were attached, and that the judge considered the statements as if they were part of the affidavit, it would exalt hypertechnicality over common sense to review the issuing judge\u2019s decision as if it had been made without the statements. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 286, 103 S.Ct. 2317.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">We return to the central question in this appeal: Did the issuing judge have a substantial basis for finding probable cause to search the Plainfield Apartment for narcotics and weapons? The controlling Maryland case on this issue is <em>Holmes v. State, supra, </em>368 Md. 506, 796 A.2d 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">In <em>Holmes, </em>the Court upheld search warrants for narcotics for two houses on the same street in Baltimore City: one for Holmes\u2019s house and the other for a house owned by the parents of Brian Coveil, Holmes\u2019s confederate in crime. The police had observed Holmes entering and leaving both houses shortly before he and Covell walked to a nearby corner and engaged in hand-to-hand drug sales to one or two men; and they included that information in the warrant applications for the houses.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The <em>Holmes </em>Court declined to hold, as some courts have held, that, for a search warrant to issue for a suspect\u2019s home, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>there must be direct, <em>ie., </em>not inferential, evidence linking the criminal acts to the home. <em>See, e.g., Yancey v. State, </em>345 Ark. 103, 44 S.W.3d 315 (2001) (invalidating warrants to search defendants\u2019 homes for drugs after they were seen by a wildlife officer watering 18 marijuana plants in a remote wooded area five to six miles from where they lived; court concluded that one could not rationally infer from the facts in the affidavit that the homes were being used in any criminal enterprise). The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-5\">Direct evidence that contraband exists in the home is not required for [the] search warrant [to issue]; rather, probable cause may be inferred from the type of crime, the nature of the items sought, the opportunity for concealment, and reasonable inferences about where the defendant may hide the incriminating items.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-6\"><em>Holmes, supra, </em>368 Md. at 522, 796 A.2d 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">On the opposite end of the spectrum, the <em>Holmes </em>Court likewise rejected the idea that evidence of a person\u2019s mere status as a drug dealer, that is, that he is known to deal drugs, can support a reasonable inference that he will have the tools or fruits of drug dealing in his home, so as to support a finding of probable cause to search his home. <em>See State v. Coley, </em>145 Md.App. at 527 n. 18, 805 A.2d 1186 (interpreting <em>Holmes </em>as having \u201cexplicitly rejected [the] notion\u201d that \u201cthere is probable cause to believe that drug dealers will keep drugs and records of the drug trade in their homes\u201d and instead \u201crequiring] some nexus be established, even in the absence of direct evidence, between the nature of the items sought and the place where they are to be seized.\u201d). <em>Accord United States v. Frazier, </em>423 F.3d 526, 533 (6th Cir.2005) (distinguishing cases in which police informants actually witnessed drug dealing activities by a suspect from those in which they merely alleged the suspect\u2019s status as a known drug dealer; and observing that \u201cthe allegation that the defendant is a drug dealer, without more, is insufficient to tie the alleged criminal activity to the defendant\u2019s residence\u201d). <em>See also United States v. Schultz, </em>14 F.3d 1093, 1097 (6th Cir.1994) (reasoning that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>officer\u2019s training and experience can be considered in determining probable cause but cannot \u201csubstitute for the lack of [an] evidentiary nexus\u201d between the place to be searched and any criminal activity); <em>State v. Thein, </em>138 Wash.2d 133, 977 P.2d 582 (1999) (holding that general assertions in a warrant application affidavit that the suspect was a drug dealer and drug dealers commonly store narcotics and related evidence where they live were not sufficient to establish probable cause).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The <em>Holmes </em>Court adopted a middle ground that probable cause to search a suspect\u2019s home can be found when there is a nexus between the suspect\u2019s criminal actions and his home sufficient to support a reasonable inference that the tools or fruits of the crime probably will be found at his home. It reasoned by analogy to <em>Mills v. State, </em>278 Md. 262, 363 A.2d 491 (1976), and <em>State v. Ward, </em>350 Md. 372, 712 A.2d 534 (1998), which involved search warrants for weapons in the defendants\u2019 homes. The defendants in those two cases were arrested away from their homes for crimes in which particular weapons were used, and were not in possession of the weapons when arrested. In upholding the warrants, the Court in both cases employed what it later characterized in <em>Holmes </em>as \u201cpure deductive reasoning\u201d to draw a reasonable inference that the weapons would be found in the homes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">[A] particular kind of weapon was used in the crime; there was evidence linking the defendant to the crime; the weapon was of a kind likely to be kept, and not disposed of, by the defendant; when arrested shortly after the crime, the defendant was not in direct possession of the weapon; <em>ergo, </em>it was likely to be found in a place accessible to him\u2014his home or car.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">368 Md. at 521, 796 A.2d 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">The <em>Holmes </em>Court likened this \u201cdeductive approach, based on reasonable factual assumptions,\u201d <em>id., </em>to the approach other courts have employed to find a nexus between a suspect\u2019s illegal drug activity and the probability that evidence of that activity will be found in his home. Applying the logic to the facts before it, the <em>Holmes </em>Court concluded that the issuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>judge reasonably could infer from the circumstances, including that Holmes was seen selling drugs soon after he had entered and exited his house, at a location near his house, that evidence of drug trafficking probably would be found in his home. Accordingly, there was a substantial basis for the issuing court\u2019s probable cause determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Likewise, in <em>Coley, supra, </em>145 Md.App. 502, 805 A.2d 1186, this Court held that there was a substantial basis for the issuing judge\u2019s probable cause finding respecting Coley\u2019s house. There, police officers began surveilling Coley after a confidential informant told them that Coley was dealing drugs and that he lived alone at a particular address. The police had the informant call Coley, in his house, and arrange a controlled buy. Coley told the informant to meet him at a particular location. The police then watched Coley leave his house, drive his car to the location, which was near his house, and sell drugs to the informant. In a second controlled buy, Coley drove to a meeting point, picked up the informant, and drove back to his (Coley\u2019s) house. Coley went in the house alone and then came out and made contact with the informant, to whom he sold drugs. Relying upon <em>Holmes, </em>we held that, considered together, the controlled buys, the information from the informant about Coley, and Coley\u2019s record of drug trafficking crimes constituted a sufficient nexus between Coley\u2019s alleged criminal acts and his house to create probable cause that the tools or fruits of his crimes would be found there; and therefore there was a substantial basis for the issuing judge\u2019s probable cause belief that evidence of drug trafficking would be found in Coley\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">In <em>Holmes </em>and <em>Coley, </em>there was a close-in-time and location nexus between the defendants, their residences, and the actual drug sales that made quite reasonable the inferences that the residences were being used to store drugs. Although there was no evidence in either case of drugs having been seen in the houses, or of drug sales having taken place in the houses, the Court of Appeals and this Court concluded that evidence of that sort was not required to establish probable cause and that the evidence connecting the suspect\u2019s observed illegal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>drug activities to his house was a sufficient nexus for an inference that the tools and fruits of the drug activities would be present at the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">It was not necessary in either <em>Holmes </em>or <em>Coley </em>to demarcate the outer boundaries of nexus evidence that will allow a reasonable inference that tools or fruits of a crime likely will be found in a suspect\u2019s home. Indeed, the <em>Holmes </em>Court commented that it was not addressing whether an \u201cisolated drug transaction, especially if it were to occur some considerable distance from the home,\u201d could establish probable cause to search the suspect\u2019s home. 368 Md. at 523, 796 A.2d 90. (Likewise, in <em>Coley, </em>we declined to \u201c \u2018determine whether an isolated drug transaction ... will suffice\u2019 \u201d to obtain a warrant for the home. 145 Md.App. at 531 n. 19, 805 A.2d 1186 (quoting <em>Holmes, </em>368 Md. at 523, 796 A.2d 90).) The <em>Holmes </em>Court further commented that \u201cthe mere observation, documentation, or suspicion of a defendant\u2019s participation in criminal activity <em>will not necessarily suffice, by itself, </em>to establish probable cause that inculpatory evidence will be found in the home.\u201d 368 Md. at 523, 796 A.2d 90 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">In <em>Holmes, </em>the Court recognized that, in some jurisdictions, courts have upheld the validity of search warrants for suspects\u2019 houses based solely upon evidence that the suspect has engaged in drug dealing activity, when the nexus between that activity and' his house are not as close in time or location as it was in the facts before it. The Court explained these decisions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-7\">The reasoning, supported by both experience and logic, is that, if a person is dealing in drugs, he or she is likely to have a stash of the product, along with records and other evidence incidental to the business, that those items have to be kept somewhere, that if not found on the person of the defendant, they are likely to be found in a place that is readily accessible to the defendant but not accessible to others, and that the defendant\u2019s home is such a place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXC\">368 Md. at 521-22, 796 A.2d 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">The line of cases to which the <em>Holmes </em>Court was referring is typified by <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>989 F.2d 1252 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>(D.C.Cir.1993).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There, undercover officers purchased narcotics from Thomas on the street. Their affidavit for a search warrant for Thomas\u2019s home did not allege that any criminal activity had occurred there but generally asserted that drug dealers often keep evidence of their trade in their homes. (The opinion does not state whether the affidavit provided information on the location of the sale relative to Thomas\u2019s home.) The court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">rO]bservations of illegal activity occurring away from the suspect\u2019s residence!] can support a finding of probable cause to issue a search warrant for the residence, if there is a reasonable basis to infer from the nature of the illegal activity observed, that relevant evidence will be found in the residence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1255. Although not expressly stated, the theory behind the Thomas court\u2019s holding was that a suspect\u2019s participation in drug dealing crimes, by its nature, will support a finding of probable cause to search his home because it is reasonable to believe that people actively selling drugs keep evidence of their trade in their homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Similarly, in <em>United States v. Pitts, </em>6 F.3d 1366 (9th Cir. 1993), an affidavit prepared by an FBI Special Agent attesting to facts evidencing that Pitts was selling drugs, including that he had delivered cocaine to an acquaintance, was used to obtain a warrant to search Pitts\u2019s home. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the denial of Pitts\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence as the product of an illegal search. The court explained its ruling as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">We require only a reasonable nexus between the activities supporting probable cause and the locations to be searched. A reasonable nexus does not require direct evidence that the items listed as the objects of the search are on the premises to be searched. The magistrate must only con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>elude that it would be reasonable to seek the evidence in the place indicated in the affidavit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1369 (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The <em>Pitts </em>court noted that \u201c[a] magistrate may draw reasonable inferences about where evidence is likely to be kept, based on the nature of the evidence and the type of offense,\u201d and that \u201cin the case of drug dealers, evidence is likely to be found where the dealers live.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation mark omitted) (citations omitted). Accordingly, the affidavit setting forth facts demonstrating that Pitts had been observed selling drugs was adequate to support a finding of probable cause to search Pitts\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Precedent from the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is mostly consistent with the position espoused in <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Pitts. </em>Recently, in <em>United States v. Williams, </em>548 F.3d 311 (4th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>-\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1922, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2009), the court remarked that it had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-10\">consistently determined that there was probable cause to support ... warrants to search suspects\u2019 residences and even temporary abodes on the basis of (1) evidence of the suspects\u2019 involvement in drug trafficking combined with (2) the reasonable suspicion (whether explicitly articulated by the applying officer or implicitly arrived at by the magistrate judge) that drug traffickers store drug-related evidence in their homes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 319. Although, ultimately, the <em>Williams </em>court decided the validity of the search warrants at issue solely under the good-faith exception (discussed <em>infra), </em>it cited several of its decisions upholding warrants under this principle.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Decisions from other jurisdictions holding that a suspect\u2019s participation in drug trafficking, generally, will support a reasonable inference that he is keeping evidence of the crime in his home include <em>United States v. Hodge, </em>246 F.3d 301, 306 (3d Cir.2001) (stating that it was reasonable to infer that suspect caught on the street would keep evidence in his home where \u201cfacts combine to suggest that [he] was an experienced and repeat drug dealer\u201d); <em>United States v.

Reddrick, </em>90 F.3d 1276, 1281 (7th Cir.1996))); <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>785 F.2d 399 (2d Cir.1986) (holding that probable cause existed to search drug dealer\u2019s apartment despite lack of evidence that suspect had ever used the apartment); <em>State v.

Faulkner was seen driving from Jaffes to the Plainfield Apartment late at night ten times during July 2007.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-10\">\u2022 In the experience of Detective Rutkowski, \u201c[\u00a1Individuals involved in the narcotic[s] trade often use numerous different addresses to facilitate and aide in the furtherance of their illegal activity.\u201d The detectives believed that, although some records tied Faulkner to the Plainfield Apartment, he was using that apartment instead of his home address on E. 28th Street, to make less obvious what he was doing there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-11\">\u2022 Faulkner was using two particular vehicles (either the Mitsubishi or the Audi) to drive from the store to the Plainfield Apartment and to drive from the Plainfield Apartment to the store.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-12\">\u2022 Faulkner was using these same vehicles to transport himself to and from the locations at which he was selling drugs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>The nexus question here is whether the issuing judge, as a neutral magistrate, \u201creasonably could infer from these observations that drugs and other evidence of controlled dangerous substance violations was likely to be found at [the suspect\u2019s] home.\u201d <em>Holmes, </em>368 Md. at 519, 796 A.2d 90. Applying the same deductive reasoning the Court applied in <em>Holmes, </em>we answer that question affirmatively. The evidence showed that Faulkner actively was engaging in drug selling in Baltimore City, in bulk quantities, and that the nature of those crimes required him to have locations for processing narcotics for sale and for storing the narcotics, records of drug sales, and the profits from the drug sales. Within Baltimore City, Faulkner had a place of business (Jaffes) and two homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Although the E. 28th Street house was his registered address, Faulkner\u2019s most consistent contact was with the Plain-field Apartment. His pattern of travel took him from Jaffes to drug transactions, back to Jaffes, and then to the Plainfield Apartment. He used the same vehicles to drive to the drug transactions, to Jaffes, and to the Plainfield Apartment. Drug sales by Faulkner were witnessed at various locations in Baltimore City but not at Jaffes, the Plainfield Address, or the E. 28th Street address. An experienced detective opined that people selling drugs in Baltimore City often maintain and use more than one address to facilitate their drug dealing activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Faulkner\u2019s frequent travel to the Plainfield Apartment, while not unusual in isolation, must be viewed in the context of all the circumstances. As Faulkner acknowledges, it was reasonable to believe that he was storing his illegal drugs and other items related to the drug trade at Jaffes. That does not mean, however, that it was <em>not </em>reasonable to believe that evidence of Faulkner\u2019s drug dealing would be found at the Plainfield Apartment, as well. Indeed, Faulkner\u2019s pattern of contact with the Plainfield Apartment made it just as likely that he was using that location to store contraband than it was likely that he was using Jaffes lor that purpose, and made it less likely that he was using the E. 28th Street address for that purpose. (Indeed, the warrant obtained for the E. 28th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Street address did not allege that narcotics probably would be found at that home. Rather, the search warrant for that address was issued upon belief that records of Faulkner\u2019s drug trade, not contraband, would be found at that official home.)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">To be sure, the linkage between the Plainfield Apartment and Faulkner\u2019s drug selling activities is not as close in location or time as the linkages between the defendants\u2019 drug selling activities and their houses in <em>Holmes </em>and <em>Coley. </em>The nexus is there, however, and is bolstered by the significant fact that Faulkner was using two \u201chomes\u201d at one time, in the same City, and was having substantial contact with the home that was not registered as his home address. Even if this case were a \u201cclose call\u201d on probable cause, however, our task is not to decide probable cause but instead to decide whether there was a substantial basis for the issuing court\u2019s probable cause finding; and in doing so, we are to resolve a marginal case with preference to the warrant. We hold that the issuing judge had a substantial basis for finding probable cause to search the Plainfield Apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\n<em>Good Faith Exception</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Notwithstanding our determination that there was a substantial basis for issuing a search warrant for the Plainfield Apartment, we hold, alternatively, that the evidence was admissible under the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule, and therefore should not have been suppressed even if the warrant were invalid. We described that exception in <em>Coley:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\"><em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984), and its companion case, <em>Massachusetts v. Sheppard, </em>468 U.S. 981, 104 S.Ct. 3424, 82 L.Ed.2d 737 (1984), established the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule. Under the good faith doctrine, \u201cevidence seized under a warrant subsequently determined to be invalid may be admissible if the executing officers acted in objective good faith with reasonable reliance on the warrant.\u201d <em>McDonald v. State, </em>347 Md. 452, 467, 701 A.2d 675 (1997), <em>cert. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number><em>denied, </em>522 U.S. 1151, 118 S.Ct. 1178, 140 L.Ed.2d 182 (1998). <em>Leon </em>set out four sets of circumstances under which suppression remains the appropriate remedy: (1) when the judicial officer issuing the warrant was misled by an affidavit that \u201cthe affiant knew was false or would have known was false except for his reckless disregard of the truth;\u201d (2) when the magistrate \u201cwholly abandoned his judicial role;\u201d (3) when \u201ca warrant [is] based on an affidavit \u2018so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable;\u2019 \u201d or (4) when the warrant is facially deficient <em>{e.g., </em>failing to particularize the place to be searched). <em>Minor v. State, </em>334 Md. 707, 713, 641 A.2d 214 (1994).<footnotemark>[9]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">145 Md.App. at 523 n. 13, 805 A.2d 1186 (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">In the case at bar, the suppression court found that the warrant fell within the third circumstance outlined in <em>Leon, i.e., </em>the affidavit was \u201cso lacking in indicia of probable cause\u201d that the detectives could not have reasonably relied on its validity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">How do I find good faith by the Police when there\u2019s just nothing\u2014I mean, if you take that logic, it would mean that in every case, every guy who has another business\u2014and I think that\u2019s what distinguishes this case. He\u2019s got another business, which may be legitimate, or maybe dealing drugs or both, but if a guy is dealing drugs out of his business, or dealing drugs out of his car, that the officer in good faith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>can rely on a search warrant to go into the home.... Why can the officer rely here in good faith, aside from the fact the judge signed it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The application of the third \u201cexemption\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to the good faith exception under <em>Leon </em>requires an objective assessment of a police officer\u2019s good faith reliance on the warrant:</p>\n<p id=\"Ak\">The objective test requires that \u201cofficers, exercising professional judgment, could have reasonably believed that the averments of their affidavit related to a present and continuing violation of law, not remote from the date of their affidavit, and that the evidence sought would be likely found at [the place identified in the affidavit].\u201d <em>Connelly [v. State, </em>322 Md. 719, 735, 589 A.2d 958 (1991)]. The affidavit \u201ccannot be so \u2018bare bones\u2019 in nature as to suggest that the issuing judge acted as a \u2018rubber stamp\u2019 in approving the application for the warrant.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Wilhelm, </em>80 F.3d 116, 121 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">A mistake in the probable cause determination is obvious if \u201ca reasonably well trained officer would have known that the search was illegal despite the magistrate\u2019s authorization.\u201d <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 922 n. 23, 104 S.Ct. at 3420 n. 23, 82 L.Ed.2d at 698 n. 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\"><em>Patterson, supra, </em>401 Md. at 106-07, 930 A.2d 348 (first alteration in original). Whether the good faith exception applies is a question of law. <em>Id. </em>at 104, 930 A.2d 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">In <em>Jenkins </em>we commented upon the \u201cgrowing problem\u201d of defendants attempting to \u201csqueeze every warrant application that lacks a substantial basis into <em>[Leon\u2019s </em>third] exemption.\u201d 178 Md.App. at 204, 941 A.2d 517. Recounting the examples of \u201cbare bones\u201d affidavits given by the Supreme Court in <em>Leon, </em>we noted that this exemption was intended to apply to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>the \u201cextreme circumstance\u201d in which the affidavit consists \u201cpurely [of | conclusory statements] ... backed up by no further supporting data.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 202, 941 A.2d 517. We suggested as a means to distinguish \u201cbetween a bad warrant, on the one hand, and a warrant so transparently vacuous that no officer could conceivably rely upon it, on the other hand,\u201d looking to whether the affidavit \u201c \u2018provided sufficient evidence to create disagreement among thoughtful and competent judges as to the existence of probable cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 205, 941 A.2d 517 (quoting <em>Patterson, </em>401 Md. at 109, 930 A.2d 348). We reasoned that, when a series of judges cannot agree on the existence of probable cause, as was the case in <em>Jenkins, </em>and also is true here, the warrant cannot be so obviously inadequate that a police officer could not objectively rely upon it in good faith. Indeed, if trained legal minds cannot reach a consensus on the validity of a warrant, a reasonable police officer (presumably less exposed to the vagaries of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence) should not be expected to readily identify its invalidity.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">The rarity of <em>Leon's </em>third exemption is made clear when one considers that, even in <em>Frazier, Schultz, </em>and <em>Yancey (cited </em>supra), in which the warrants were held invalid for failing to establish probable cause, the courts nonetheless refused to apply the third exemption (or any exemption) and ruled the evidence admitted under the good faith exception. Of particular note, the <em>Yancey </em>court recognized that, \u201cbecause we have a split of authority in that some courts ... justify a search of the dealer\u2019s residence when facts infer reasonable cause to believe a person is a drug dealer, we cannot say that the reasonably well-trained police officer was not acting in good faith [by relying on the warrant].\u201d 44 S.W.3d at 326. <em>See also Schultz, supra, </em>14 F.3d at 1098 (\u201c[Although we have held that [the olficer\u2019s]\u2019training and experience\u2019 were not sufficient to establish a nexus of probable cause between that crime and the safe deposit boxes, the connection was not so remote as to trip on the \u2018so lacking\u2019 hurdle.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">As was the case in its analysis of the substantial basis question, the motion court here appeared to conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>because the direct evidence linked Faulkner\u2019s drug dealing only to the automobiles he drove, and to Jaffes to the extent that he traveled there between drug deals, the detectives could not have in good faith relied upon a warrant to search the Plainfield Apartment. This analysis is flawed for the reasons we already have discussed. After observing Faulkner and collecting information on him for approximately one month, during which time he participated in several narcotics transactions and moved between two primary locations\u2014his store and the Plainfield Apartment\u2014the detectives reasonably could believe that narcotics and related evidence of drug sales would be found at the Plainfield Apartment even without having observed Faulkner dealing drugs directly from that location. Consequently, the motion court erred by not ruling the evidence at issue admissible under the <em>Leon </em>good faith exception to the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">ORDER REVERSED.
