Formally, the question presented is whether the circuit court erred in approving a voluntary dismissal of the appeal from the Commission by the appellees, Marley Cooling Tower Co. (Marley), the employer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The employee and initial appellee in the circuit court was James M. Darby, deceased, whose successor is the appellant here, James F. Darby, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Jaimes M. Darby.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The underlying question of substance presented is whether Darby, without having appealed from the Commission decision, had an interest in Marley\u2019s maintaining its appeal so that Darby might obtain a partial reversal of the Commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Darby, a forty-one year old carpenter, suffered an injury on December 5, 2005, during the course of his employment with Marley. He was struck on the head by a 24' by 12\" by 6\" aluminum board used as a temporary work surface, which was dropped by a co-worker. After having been taken for medical, attention on the day of the accident, he returned to work for a \u201clight duty\u201d assignment. The treatment at Concentra Medical Center showed tenderness at the C2 through C7 vertebra. A trapezius bilateral test was positive for pain, and x-rays showed a straightening and loss of the anterior cervical lordosis, which is suggestive of muscle spasm. The following day he went to the emergency room at Johns Hopkins Bayview medical facilities. Then, on December 20, he again went to the emergency room for pain related to the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Darby filed a claim with the Commission on December 22, 2005, seeking temporary total disability (TTD) from December 6, 2005, and thereafter. The Commission\u2019s hearing was on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>April 10, 2006. By its order of April 20, 2006, the Commission ruled in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-4\">\u201cThe Commission finds on the issues presented that the claimant sustained an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment on December 5, 2005, that the disability of the claimant is the result of the accidental injury. The Commission denies the claim for temporary total disability from December 6, 2005 to date and continuing. The Commission further finds that the employer and insurer shall pay causally related medical expenses in accordance with the Medical Fee Guide of this Commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Marley timely appealed from that order, alleging that the Commission \u201cerroneously found that the Claimant sustained an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment [and erroneously] ordered the Employer and Insurer pay the causally related medical bills[.]\u201d Although Marley had not been ordered to pay any compensation, its aggrievement with the Commission\u2019s order was its liability for future medical expenses. Marley elected a jury trial. Consistent with Maryland Rule 7-204(a), Darby responded by stating his intent to participate in the appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Darby also elected a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">While the appeal from the Commission was pending, the parties agreed on a lump sum settlement. Darby, however, died on August 3, 2007, without having signed the settlement agreement, and consequently, without the Commission\u2019s having approved the settlement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Marley advised Darby\u2019s counsel that it objected to having the personal representative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>of Darby\u2019s estate sign the settlement agreement. Thereafter, inasmuch as Marley\u2019s principal concern prompting its appeal had been its continued exposure for medical expenses, a concern that was mooted by Darby\u2019s death,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Marley moved voluntarily to dismiss its appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Following the submission of dueling memoranda by the parties, in the form of letters to the court clerk, the court (Souder, J.) dismissed Marley\u2019s petition, without prejudice. Within ten days, Darby moved \u201cfor reconsideration,\u201d including a request for a hearing on his motion. Marley opposed the motion. By order filed November 6, 2008, the court (Fader, J.) denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Darby timely noted an appeal to this Court from that order. The appellant presents the following questions for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-6\">\u201c1. Did The Circuit Court Err in Dismissing the Appeal Without the Appellant\u2019s Consent When the Appellant Had an Absolute Right to Have its Issues Heard Without the Necessity of Filing a Cross-Appeal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-7\">\u201c2. Did The Circuit Court Err in Rendering a Decision That was Dispositive of the Appellant\u2019s Claim for Tem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>porary Total Disability Benefits Without a Hearing in Violation of Maryland Rule of Procedure 2-311(f)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-4\">\u201c3. Did The Circuit Court Err by Failing to Give the Appellant a \u2018Meaningful\u2019 Opportunity to be Heard prior to Depriving it of Property in Violation of the Appellant\u2019s Due Process rights under the United States Constitution?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Appeals of Commission orders are authorized by Maryland Code (1991, 2008 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-737 of the Labor and Employment Article (LE). It reads in pertinent part: \u201cAn employer, covered employee, dependent of a covered employee, or any other interested person <em>aggrieved </em>by a decision of the Commission ... may appeal from the decision of the Commission provided the appeal is filed within 30 days after the date of the mailing of the Commission\u2019s order[.]\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">In his argument, Darby points out that, because a jury trial was prayed for the appeal, it is <em>de novo. </em>He cites <em>Esteps Elec. &amp; Petrolemm Co. v. Sager, </em>67 Md.App. 649, 659, 508 A.2d 1032, 1037 (1986), where this Court stated that \u201cthe standard of review of the decision of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission shall be by way of trial de novo.... [Pjarties are free to adduce evidence additional to that produced before the Commission!?]\u201d From this he concludes that he had \u201can absolute right to have [his] issues heard [in the circuit court] without the necessity of filing a cross-appeal.\u201d (Bold type altered). This proposition flows, submits Darby, from the nature of a <em>de novo </em>appeal from the Commission. He relies on a sentence in <em>Griggs v. C &amp; H Mechanical Corp., </em>169 Md.App. 556, 564, 905 A.2d 402, 407 (2006), where this Court said that \u201cthe <em>de novo </em>nature of the action means that the circuit court must consider all of the issues that were raised in the Commission proceedings.\u201d In other words, Darby contends that Marley\u2019s petition, directed to its aggrievement over liability for medical expenses, brought before the circuit court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>without any cross-appeal by Darby, the Commission\u2019s rejection of compensation for Darby for TTD, over which Marley was not aggrieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">The final step in Darby\u2019s argument is that Marley\u2019s appeal could not be dismissed without his consent, because a unilateral dismissal would violate the policy underlying Maryland Rule 2-506(b). See n. 7, <em>supra</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Darby concludes that the circuit court abused its discretion in approving Marley\u2019s voluntary dismissal of its appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">In contrast, Marley relies on Rule 7-203(b), part of the Chapter that governs action for judicial review of an order or action of an administrative agency. <em>See </em>Rule 7-201 (a). Rule 7-203(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-6\">\u201cIf one party files a timely petition [for appeal], any other person may file a petition within ten days after the date the agency mailed notice of the filing of the first petition, or within the period set forth in section (a), whichever is later.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A70\">Under a strict application of this rule, Darby would have to have cross-appealed in order to obtain a reversal of the Commission\u2019s denial of TTD benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Marley, however, seems partially to agree with Darby as to the applicability of the <em>Griggs </em>case, <em>supra. </em>In its brief, Marley states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-8\">\u201cThe Appellee does not dispute that, in the event the instant case proceeded to trial in the circuit court, the Appellant could litigate any issues decided by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission in its Order of April 20, 2006, without filing its own cross-appeal. <em>See Griggs v. C &amp; H Mechanical Corp., </em>169 Md.App. 556, 905 A.2d 402 (2006). However, neither this concession nor the <em>Griggs </em>case stand for the proposition that the Appellant has an independent right to proceed to trial on the Appellee\u2019s Petition for Judicial Review if the Appellee dismisses its appeal and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>Appellant did not file a cross-appeal or Petition for Judicial Review of its own.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The appellee\u2019s position seems to be that, because the continued viability of Darby\u2019s claim for disability benefits rested totally on Marley\u2019s appeal, that claim was extinguished when Marley exercised its unilateral right voluntarily to dismiss its appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">We do not fully agree with either party\u2019s position. Each argument illustrates the unfortunately too common fallacy of failing to limit the language in a judicial opinion, in this instance, <em>Griggs, </em>to the context in which that language was employed. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">In <em>Griggs, </em>the appeal to the circuit court was taken by the employer. It was aggrieved by the Commission\u2019s failure to hold that, and indeed, even expressly to decide, whether the claim was time barred by the claimant\u2019s not having filed a claim application with the Commission within two years from the date of the accident. The Commission awarded the claimant TTD by an order dated May 25, 2004, in which the Commission held that the claimant had given adequate notice of the accident to the employer. The employer requested a rehearing, specifically pointing out that there had been no decision on the \u201climitations\u201d issue. By order of June 17, 2004, the Commission simply denied that motion, without explanation. The employer appealed to a circuit court, stating that it sought review of the June 17, 2004 order. The claimant moved to dismiss that appeal, contending that it was filed more than thirty days after the May 25 order and that the June 17 order did not grant or deny any benefit. It is against that background, and in the context quoted below, that the opinion in <em>Griggs </em>contains the language relied upon by Darby in the matter before us.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-8\">\u201cGriggs posits that the citation of the June 17 order in the Petition for Judicial Review means that the May 25 order was not challenged. We disagree---- Griggs understood that the Commission\u2019s failure to address the limitations issue was the stated basis for both the motion for rehearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>and the Petition for Judicial Review. <em>Cf. Kim v. Comptroller of the Treas., </em>350 Md. 527, 539-40, 714 A.2d 176[, 181] (1998) (recognizing that pleading identifying administrative decision from which relief is sought may be held to substantially comply with content requirement of Md. Rule 7-202(c)). Moreover, the <em>de novo </em>nature of the action means that the circuit court must consider all of the issues that were raised in the Commission proceedings. Because the content and nature of the Petition for Judicial Review were sufficient, we hold that the circuit court correctly denied Griggs\u2019s motion to dismiss.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-4\"><em>Griggs, </em>169 Md.App. at 564, 905 A.2d at 407. <em>Griggs </em>does not hold that an appeal pursuant to LE \u00a7 9-737, for possible reversal of a Commission decision, raises issues with respect to which the appellant is not aggrieved and makes available for reversal on appeal the Commission decision on issues with respect to which the adversary might be aggrieved, but did not cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">If an appeal from the Commission, noted by a party who is aggrieved by a part of the Commission\u2019s decision, generated the type of omnibus review for which Darby contends, then there would be no need for the \u201cmidnight appeal\u201d provision of Rule 7-203(b). There would be no need for a party, who is aggrieved by some but not all of the decisions by the Commission, to have the opportunity to defer a decision on whether to appeal depending upon whether the adversary notes an appeal. Under Darby\u2019s conception of a <em>de novo </em>appeal, the decision whether to note an appeal would be made by the adversary\u2019s appeal and there would be no need to consider a cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">As Larson recognizes, \u201c[t]he question of standing to appeal sometimes presents issues in compensation cases no different from those in appeal generally[.]\u201d 8 Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 130.08[1], at 130-89 (1998). The applicability of Larson\u2019s general statement to Rule 7-203(b) is demonstrated by the history of that rule. It was adopted by the Court of Appeals by an order filed December 8, 1992, as part of the 121st Report of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>and Procedure. The Reporter\u2019s Note to Rule 7-203 advises that \u201cSection (b) provides for a petition by another party, by analogy to the cross-appeals in Title 8.\u201d Md. Register, Vol. 19, Issue 26 of Wed., Dec. 23,1992, at 2278.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Title 8 of the Maryland Rules \u201capplies to appellate review in the Court of Appeals and the Court of Special Appeals.\u201d Rule 1\u2014101(h). Judge James R. Eyler, writing for this Court in <em>Archers Glen Partners, Inc. v. Garner, </em>176 Md.App. 292, 933 A.2d 405 (2007), <em>aff'd, </em>405 Md. 43, 949 A.2d 639 (2008), explained the scope of review in appeals from circuit courts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-6\">\u201cGenerally, a party in a proceeding in circuit court must file a timely notice of appeal to seek appellate review of the circuit court\u2019s judgment. When a party loses on an issue in circuit court but receives a favorable judgment on another ground, the party, as appellee, and without noting a cross appeal, may contend that the judgment be affirmed on the ground on which it lost at circuit court. See <em>Automobile Trade Ass\u2019n of Maryland v. Harold Folk Enterprises, Inc., </em>301 Md. 642, 648-49, 484 A.2d 612[, 615] (1984). In the case before us, the circuit court\u2019s decision was to remand for further findings. Appellee\u2019s argument on appeal, that the evidence is legally insufficient to sustain the Planning Board\u2019s conclusion with respect to the growth limitation, does not constitute a ground for affirmance. Thus, a cross appeal was necessary to raise that issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 326 n. 1, 933 A.2d at 425 n. 1. Although Darby cites this footnote as supporting his position, it does not. Darby did not receive a favorable decision from the Commission on the issue of whether to award TTD benefits. He does not contend that the Commission\u2019s decision denying TTD should be affirmed. Consequently, to achieve that affirmative relief, a cross-appeal was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">Darby next argues that the circuit court should have honored his request for a hearing on his opposition to Marley\u2019s voluntary dismissal. Even if we assume that Darby was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>entitled to a hearing, the error is harmless. We have ruled as a matter of law that Darby had no legally protected interest in the continuation of the appeal noted by Marley from the Commission\u2019s decisions on those issues with respect to which Marley was aggrieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Darby\u2019s remaining argument asserts that he has been deprived of procedural due process. The United States Supreme Court, however, has stated that \u201c[o]nly after finding the deprivation of a protected interest do we look to see if the State\u2019s procedures comport with due process.\u201d <em>American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, </em>526 U.S. 40, 59, 119 S.Ct. 977, 989, 148 L.Ed.2d 130 (1999). As we held in Part II, <em>supra, </em>under Maryland law Darby had no protected interest in the continuation by Marley of its appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b760-7\">.
