Saville (\u201cSaville\u201d), brought suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against appellants, Scapa Dryer Fabrics (\u201cScapa\u201d) and The Wallace &amp; Gale Asbestos Settlement Trust (\u201cW &amp; G\u201d), and against three other parties, alleging that his exposure to their asbestos-containing products caused his mesothelioma and carcinoma. Appellee settled with the three other parties and proceeded to trial against appellants. Appellants brought cross-claims against the settling defendants (the \u201cCross-Defendants\u201d) and alleged that they were joint tort-feasors. After a trial of appellee\u2019s claims and appellants\u2019 cross-claims, a jury found the appellants liable and found the Cross-Defendants not liable. Scapa moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (\u201cJNOV\u201d) or a new trial on appellee\u2019s original claims and on its own cross-claims, while W &amp; G moved for JNOV only on its cross-claims. The trial court denied these motions, and appellants filed timely notices of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">QUESTIONS PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Scapa presents five questions for our review, which we have separated and rephrased for clarity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">I. Did the trial court err when it denied appellant\u2019s motion for judgment or for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on appellee\u2019s claims against appellant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-9\">II. Did the trial court err when it denied appellant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on appellant\u2019s cross-claims against the Cross-Defendants?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-10\">III. Did the trial court err when it did not reduce the judgment for appellee to account for payments appellee received from certain bankruptcy settlement trusts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>IV. Did the trial court err by excluding deposition testimony of appellee\u2019s co-worker on the issue of alternate exposure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">V. Did the trial court err by admitting evidence of appellant\u2019s knowledge of asbestos hazards post-dating appellee\u2019s exposure to appellant\u2019s products?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">W &amp; G joins in Question II, with regard to its own cross-claims, and incorporates by reference Scapa\u2019s arguments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">From 1964 to 1978, appellee worked at the Westvaco Pulp and Paper Mill (the \u201cWestvaco Mill\u201d) in Luke, Maryland. During the relevant time period, appellee was a \u201cbroke hustler\u201d responsible for cleaning dryer felts. Dryer felts are massive fabric sheets, approximately twenty feet wide and over one hundred feet long, which were installed at various positions on several large machines in the mill. The felts move around large metal drums at high speed and provide a permeable surface upon which to dry slurry, which becomes paper. Appellant worked on machines number eight and nine and cleaned any felt that needed to be cleaned.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">Scapa supplied the Westvaco Mill with dryer felts, some of which contained asbestos and were in use for approximately 13 months between 1968 and 1970, on the machine where appellee was stationed. Those dryer felts were composed of approximately 64.7% chrysotile asbestos, encased in tightly woven material and coated with resin. Appellee introduced expert testimony from Dr. James Millette, Ph.D., an environ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>mental scientist specializing in particle contamination, who opined that the felts released respirable asbestos dust when appellee and his co-workers cleaned them by scraping them and blowing them with air hoses. Appellee maintained that he inhaled that dust and provided expert medical testimony from Jerrold Abraham, M.D., and Steven Zimmet, M.D., that the dust was a substantial contributing factor to appellee\u2019s later-diagnosed mesothelioma and lung cancer. Appellee also introduced the expert testimony of Dr. Barry Castleman, Sc.D., who opined that manufacturers of products containing asbestos had reason to know of the material\u2019s hazards by the 1950\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Scapa\u2019s products were not the only sources of asbestos in appellee\u2019s work environment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellee worked near turbines that were fed by steam-pipes fitted with asbestos insulation. Asbestos was also present in gaskets, cement, turbines, and boilers, among other elements of appellee\u2019s work environment. In particular, appellee\u2019s testimony and responses to requests for admissions stated that he was exposed to respirable asbestos caused by products and agents of W &amp; G, the Westinghouse Electric Corporation (\u201cWestinghouse\u201d), Asten-Johnson, Inc. (\u201cAsten\u201d), and Albany International Corp. (\u201cAlbany\u201d), and that none of these corporations provided any warnings that their products posed health risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Appellee brought suit against multiple parties, including the aforementioned corporations, in 2002. At that time, W &amp; G was in bankruptcy proceedings and was not made a defendant. Judgment from the first trial of this case was vacated by an unpublished opinion of this Court in <em>Scapa Dryer Felts, Inc. v. Saville, </em>165 Md.App. 748 <em>(2005)(\u201cSaville </em>I\u201d). Upon remand, W &amp; G had emerged from bankruptcy and Scapa brought W &amp; G into the instant suit by a third party complaint, in 2006. Saville then filed an amendment by interlineation, adding direct claims against W &amp; G. The trial court consolidated all of these claims. At some point before trial, appellee entered settlement agreements with Westinghouse, Asten, and Albany <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>(collectively, the \u201cCross-Defendants\u201d). Appellants subsequently brought cross-claims for contribution against those three Cross-Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">At trial, the court made two evidentiary rulings (of many) that are at issue in this appeal. First, the trial court excluded testimony of one of appellee\u2019s coworkers, Mr. Howard Shoemaker (\u201cShoemaker\u201d), which had been taken at a video deposition in 2003 and used in the course of <em>Saville I. </em>Shoemaker\u2019s testimony described thermal insulation work and the consequent dust that surrounded appellee. Shoemaker testified that the insulated pipes were in the ceiling, floors, and walls, and that appellee did not wear a dust mask and received no warnings about the dust. Saville sought to introduce Shoemaker\u2019s testimony, and W &amp; G moved, <em>in limine, </em>to exclude it. Although Scapa initially objected to the Shoemaker testimony, Scapa later sought its introduction to bolster Scapa\u2019s \u201calternate exposure\u201d defense. The trial court heard the parties\u2019 arguments on the matter and granted W &amp; G\u2019s motion to exclude the testimony, holding that it was procedurally inadmissible under the framework of Maryland Rule 2-419.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Second, the court allowed appellee to introduce documents that post-dated appellee\u2019s exposure and tended to show that Scapa was aware of the dangers of asbestos. The evidence included miscellaneous documentary evidence from 1976, 1977, and 1982, all tending to show that Scapa was aware of the dangers of asbestos in its various forms (the \u201cPost-Exposure Evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Because of the unique circumstances of this case, appellants were put in an unusual situation vis-a-vis the Cross-Defendants. Appellee\u2019s theory of causation was that each asbestos exposure was a substantial contributing factor to his injuries, so that the appellants and Cross-Defendants\u2019 fates were intertwined, to a certain extent. It appears that neither Scapa nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>W &amp; G wanted to hold the Cross-Defendants liable <em>per se, </em>fearing that this would necessarily imply that the appellants, themselves, were also liable. Thus, Scapa proposed that the court hold a bench trial on its cross-claims <em>only if </em>Scapa were to be found liable. The court refused to parse the trial as requested and, citing the mandates of Rule 2-325, put all issues before the jury, including the Cross-Defendants\u2019 liability. At this point, appellants and appellee entered into an agreement whereby Scapa agreed to curtail its evidence against the Cross-Defendants and neither party would move for judgment on the cross-claims, ensuring that the question of cross-liability would reach the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">The end result of the foregoing was a rather unusual trial on the cross-claims with no one to defend them, during which appellants simply read evidence into the record. Much of this evidence was drawn from Saville\u2019s testimony, responses to requests for admissions, and answers to interrogatories, and all tended to show that appellee was exposed to asbestos from the Cross-Defendants\u2019 products. At the close of evidence on the cross-claims, which was the close of all evidence, the following exchange took place regarding the parties\u2019 various motions and renewals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">[SCAPA]: Judge, we wanted to renew our motion\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">[SCAPA]:\u2014motion and the testimony of our witnesses we believe shows that we should prevail, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">THE COURT: All right, [sic] I\u2019ll deny the motion for both parties for the same\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-9\">[W &amp; G]: And renew mine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-10\">THE COURT: Wallace &amp; Gale motions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-11\">[SCAPA]: And we also have what we filed originally in the court\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-12\">THE COURT: Yes, for the same reasons on the same grounds and you\u2019ll reserve all those arguments for post-trial motions and anything else you may raise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-13\">The jury deliberated and returned a verdict against appellants, finding that their products were \u201ca substantial contrib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>uting factor in causing an asbestos related disease or illness to [appellee] Carl Saville[.]\u201d The jury further found that both appellants negligently failed to warn appellee and that Scapa was strictly liable for failure to warn, awarding damages of $1,718,000.00. Conversely, the jury found that none of the Cross-Defendants substantially contributed to appellee\u2019s injuries.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Scapa moved for JNOV or for new trial on appellee\u2019s claims against Scapa and on its own cross-claims against the Cross-Defendants, while W &amp; G filed a similar motion only on its cross-claims. In its motion for JNOV, Scapa also requested that the verdict be reduced to account for settlements from certain non-party trusts that Scapa believed represented joint tort-feasors under the Maryland Uniform Contribution Among Joint Tort-Feasors Act (\u201cUCATA\u201d), Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 3-1401 et seq. of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.\u201d). All of these motions were denied, but on appellee\u2019s motion to amend judgment, the trial court accounted for settlement payments from the Manville, Celotex, and H.K. Porter settlement trusts, entering a final judgment against appellants in the amount of $1,684,415.00. Appellants filed timely notices of appeal and the case is now before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Scapa argues that the trial court erred when it denied Scapa\u2019s motions for judgment and for JNOV on appellee\u2019s claims. A motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is evaluated the same way as a motion for judgment at close of the evidence. <em>Owens-Illinois v. Armstrong, </em>87 Md.App. 699, 716-17, 591 A.2d 544 (1991), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part and remanded on other grounds, </em>326 Md. 107, 604 A.2d 47 (1992); <em>Weathersby v. Kentucky Fried Chicken Nat\u2019l Mgmt. Co., </em>86 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Md.App. 533, 552, 587 A.2d 569 (1991), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>326 Md. 663, 607 A.2d 8 (1992). We will therefore combine our analysis of Scapa\u2019s arguments that the trial court erred with respect to its motions for judgment and for JNOV.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">We review the trial court\u2019s decision to allow or deny judgment or JNOV to determine whether it was legally correct. <em>Houghton v. Forrest, </em>183 Md.App. 15, 26, 959 A.2d 816 (2008), <em>cert. granted, </em>407 Md. 529, 967 A.2d 182 (2009) (citing <em>Shabazz v. Bob Evans Farms, Inc., </em>163 Md.App. 602, 643, 881 A.2d 1212 (2005)). Judgment as a matter of law is appropriate if all evidence and inferences permit only one consideration. <em>Smith v. Miller, </em>7.1 Md.App. 273, 278, 525 A.2d 245 (1987). If there is any competent evidence, however slight, leading to support the plaintiffs right to recover, the case should be submitted to the jury. <em>Belleson v. Klohr, </em>257 Md. 642, 646, 264 A.2d 274 (1970) (citation omitted). In making this determination, we assume the truth of all credible evidence and all inferences of fact reasonably deducible from it tending to sustain the non-movant\u2019s contentions. <em>Franklin v. Gupta, </em>81 Md.App. 345, 354, 567 A.2d 524 (1990) (citing <em>Impala Platinum v. Impala Sales, </em>283 Md. 296, 389 A.2d 887 (1978); <em>McGarr v. Boy Scouts of America, </em>74 Md.App. 127, 536 A.2d 728 (1988)). \u201cIf, however, the evidence as a whole does not rise above speculation, hypothesis, and conjecture, and does not lead to the jury\u2019s conclusion with reasonable certainty, then the denial of appellants\u2019 motions for judgment or JNOV was error.\u201d <em>Bartholomee v. Casey, </em>103 Md.App. 34, 51, 651 A.2d 908 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Scapa argues that the trial court should have granted judgment or JNOV in its favor because appellee did not prove causation. The parties do not dispute that the appropriate theory of causation is the \u201csubstantial contributing factor\u201d theory, which is satisfied by the \u201cfrequency, regularity, proximity\u201d test of exposure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">Whether the exposure of any given bystander to any particular supplier\u2019s product will be legally sufficient to permit a finding of substantial-factor causation is fact specific to each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>case. The finding involves the interrelationship between the use of a defendant\u2019s product at the workplace and the activities of the-plaintiff at the workplace. This requires an understanding of the physical characteristics of the workplace and of the relationship between the activities of the direct users of the product and the bystander plaintiff. Within that context, the factors to be evaluated include the nature of the product, the frequency of its use, the proximity, in distance and in time, of a plaintiff to the use of a product, and the regularity of the exposure of that plaintiff to the use of that product.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><em>Eagle-Picher Indus., Inc. v. Balbos, </em>326 Md. 179, 210, 604 A.2d 445 (1992) (internal citations omitted). Exposure can be demonstrated circumstantially. <em>Id. </em>at 210, 604 A.2d 445 (citing <em>Roehling v. Nat\u2019l Gypsum Co. Gold Bond Bldg. Prods., </em>786 F.2d 1225, 1228 (4th Cir.1986) (\u201cThe evidence, circumstantial as it may be, need only establish that [plaintiff] was in the same vicinity as witnesses who can identify the products causing the asbestos dust that all people in that area, not just the product handlers, inhaled.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Scapa puts forth four arguments in support of its primary contention that appellee failed to prove causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">First, Scapa devotes a significant portion of its brief to describing Scapa\u2019s \u201cunique product\u201d and the ways in which its physical characteristics, combined with the excessive moisture and ventilation in the paper mill environment and the fact that felt integrity was paramount, made it \u201cexceedingly unlikely\u201d that a mill worker would ever be exposed to asbestos from Scapa\u2019s dryer felts. Although these facts are not referenced in Scapa\u2019s argument section, we presume that Scapa brought them to our attention in order to argue a sort of reverse <em>res ipsa loquitur, </em>i.e., that the jury could not have found rationally that Scapa\u2019s product exposed appellee to asbestos. However, appellee provided competent expert testimony that Scapa\u2019s product, as used by appellee, would discharge respirable asbestos.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Second, Scapa argues that the jury could only speculate that appellee actually scraped Scapa\u2019s product because 1) it was impossible to tell whether a particular felt was Scapa\u2019s or contained asbestos and 2) because Scapa\u2019s felts ran only on the second position of machine nine, whereas appellee worked \u201cmostly\u201d at the first position of that machine and never directly testified that he worked at the second position. While Scapa is correct that there is no <em>direct </em>evidence that appellee worked with a Scapa dryer felt containing asbestos, there is more than enough <em>circumstantial </em>evidence to conclude that appellee performed a significant amount of work on Scapa\u2019s product.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">The evidence showed that appellee worked on a machine (nine) running one of Scapa\u2019s asbestos-containing felts for more than a year. During that time, he and his coworkers cleaned the felts with an air hose daily, and they scraped the felts clean once or twice each week. Both of these activities created substantial amounts of dust that blanketed appellee. Although the evidence proved that, at any given time, an unknown number of felts ran at separate positions on the machine, the evidence also showed that this number could have been no more than a handful. And though appellant spent <em>most </em>of his time on a position where the Scapa felt was known not to have run, that still left up to half of his time divided among the remaining felts, one of which was known to be Scapa\u2019s asbestos-containing felt. Taken together, this evidence proved that appellee was significantly exposed to Scapa\u2019s product, which is all that the law requires in order to uphold the trial court\u2019s denial of judgment or JNOV.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Third, Scapa argues that appellee proved no more exposure than plaintiffs in two cases where judgments or JNOY\u2019s were affirmed, <em>Anchor Packing v. Grimshaw, </em>115 Md.App. 134, 692 A.2d 5 (1997), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom., Porter Hayden Co. v. Bullinger, </em>350 Md. 452, 713 A.2d 962 (1998), and <em>Reiter v. ACandS, Inc., </em>179 Md.App. 645, 665, 947 A.2d 570 (2008), <em>cert. granted, Reiter v. Pneumo Abex, </em>405 Md. 506, 954 A.2d 467 (2008). <em>Grimshaw </em>upheld a judgment in favor of the defendant where there was \u201cno evidence that [plaintiff] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>worked in the same area as [defendant\u2019s workers] except in the warehouse, and that was for at .most an hour.\u201d 115 Md.App. at 207, 692 A.2d 5. Viewed in a light most favorable to appellee, the evidence in this case establishes much more than a single hour of exposure, so that the <em>Grimskaw </em>decision does not control. We summarized the exposure evidence in <em>Reiter, </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-5\">While Square D crane brakes may have been used in the tin mill, there was no testimony that Square D was the exclusive supplier of crane brakes in that mill. Indeed, there were approximately a dozen different manufacturers\u2019 crane brake assemblies used in the various Sparrows Point facilities. Further, and as explained <em>supra, </em>the tin mill was made up of several other mills, covering an area of approximately 480 acres. The most that can be shown is that there is some probability that a Square D brake assembly was located somewhere in the tin mill at the same time that Mr. Reiter was also in the mill. To infer from that information that Mr. Reiter was exposed to Square D brake linings that were expelling respirable asbestos fibers with the proximity, regularity, and frequency required by <em>Balbos </em>would be speculation, at best.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">179 Md.App. at 665, 947 A.2d 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Unlike <em>Reiter, </em>the evidence in this case conclusively established that plaintiff worked in close proximity to Scapa\u2019s asbestos-containing felt for a significant period of time, leaving him covered in dust. Although the evidence in this case is, as in <em>Reiter, </em>circumstantial and, by its nature, establishes only \u201csome probability,\u201d the evidence here establishes a much higher probability that appellee was exposed to asbestos than did the evidence in <em>Reiter. </em>This is all that is needed to bring the issue before the jury. <em>Cf. McClenny v. Przyborowski, </em>182 Md. 95, 98, 32 A.2d 365 (1943) (no failure of proof where circumstantial evidence proves a reasonable probability, and not a mere possibility). For these reasons, <em>Reiter </em>fails to control the disposition of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Finally, Scapa argues that the evidence against the Cross-Defendants proved that appellee had more exposure to the Cross-Defendants\u2019 products than to Scapa\u2019s products, and that the jury\u2019s verdict is therefore inconsistent and warrants a JNOV.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v. Garrett, </em>343 Md. 500, 521-22, 682 A.2d 1143 (1996):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-5\">Our first order of business is to reiterate longstanding Maryland law that it is not the province of an appellate court to express an opinion regarding the weight of the evidence when reviewing judgment on a jury verdict. Even if a jury verdict is \u201cinconsistent\u201d in the sense that certain findings of fact cannot logically be reconciled with each other, we will normally not reverse a jury\u2019s verdict either in a civil or a criminal case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">(internal citations omitted). We nevertheless note that Scapa argues that evidence, drawn from Saville\u2019s testimony and responses to requests for admissions, \u201cconclusively established\u201d that he was exposed to more asbestos from the Cross-Defendants\u2019 products than from Scapa\u2019s. This rests in part on an incorrect interpretation of Rule 2-424(d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A-l\">The <em>Garrett </em>decision informs our opinion on this issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">We also note that we are mystified by [appellant\u2019s insistence that plaintiffs made \u201cbinding\u201d admissions as to the liability of cross-defendants during argument. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsels could not \u201cbind\u201d the jury, nor parties whom , they did not represent, to liability simply because they argued to the jury that they had introduced sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>evidence to hold certain cross-defendants liable. [Appellant\u2019s position is illogical; the jury was clearly capable of disagreeing with the plaintiffs\u2019 assessment of the weight of the evidence in the case, and apparently did so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">343 Md. at 523, 682 A.2d 1143. <em>Garrett </em>addresses an alleged admission of liability, while in the present case we have merely statements of fact. Nevertheless, it would be contrary to logic and the obvious purpose of that rule if one party\u2019s admissions were binding upon another party.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Saville\u2019s testimony and responses to requests for admissions were the primary evidence introduced against the Cross-Defendants. The record reveals scant other evidence establishing liability on the part of the Cross-Defendants. The jury was not bound to accept that evidence as conclusive of liability, and therefore did not contradict itself when it found appellants liable and the Cross-Defendants not liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The evidence in this case, taken in a light most favorable to appellee, does not lead to the inexorable conclusion that Scapa was not liable and therefore gives us no reason to overturn the trial court\u2019s decision to deny Scapa\u2019s motions for judgment or JNOV.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">Appellants argue, jointly, that the trial court erred when it denied their motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on their cross-claims. Appellee argues that appellants did not meet the JNOV prerequisites of Maryland Rule 2-532 because they had not moved for judgment at any point during trial. To rebut this procedural argument, appellants contend, first, that the parties\u2019 mutual agreement to refrain from moving for judgment did not act as a waiver of their respective rights to move for JNOV. Second, appellants maintain that the trial court reserved their motions for post-trial proceedings. Appellee counters that the trial court only reserved <em>renewals </em>of motions for judgment already made and that, without having moved for judgment, appellants had nothing to renew that could support a motion for JNOV.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Maryland Rule 2-532 states that, \u201c[i]n a jury trial, a party may move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict <em>only if </em>that party made a motion for judgment at the close of all the evidence and only on the grounds advanced in support of the earlier motion.\u201d Md. Rule 2-532(a) (emphasis added). The Court of Appeals addressed Rule 2-532 at some length in <em>GMC v. Seay, </em>388 Md. 341, 879 A.2d 1049 (2005), holding that the \u201cmandatory and unambiguous\u201d language of Rule 2-532(a) precluded a defendant who failed to renew his motion for judgment from moving for JNOV. <em>Id. </em>at 355-56, 879 A.2d 1049. The Court elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\">Historically, our motion for JNOV was never meant to be simply a guide to follow but rather to set forth a precise and unambiguous requirement for the trial court. We abide by the plain language of Md. Rule 1-201 (a), which, in part, states that, \u201cthese rules shall be construed to secure simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration, and elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay. When a rule, by the word \u2018shall\u2019 or otherwise, mandates or prohibits conduct, the consequences of noncompliance are those prescribed by these rules or by statute.\u201d As we have said time and time again, the Maryland rules are \u201cprecise rubrics,\u201d which are to be strictly followed. Maryland case law is well settled on this issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-5\"><em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted). Citing federal case law on Rule 50 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a progenitor of Maryland Rule 2-532, the Court explained, <em>id. </em>at 358, 879 A.2d 1049:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">The requirement that a party must renew the motion for judgment at the close of all the evidence serves two fundamental purposes. First, renewal of the motion enables the trial court to examine the sufficiency of all the evidence before submitting the question to the jury. And second, it alerts the opposing party to any defect in its case, thereby affording it an opportunity to cure any such defect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The Court of Appeals considered and rejected several exceptions to Federal Rule 50 established by federal case law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>including the Seventh Circuit\u2019s ruling in <em>Szmaj v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co.,. </em>291 F.3d 955 (7th Cir.2002). The <em>Szmaj </em>court held that where a trial court has reserved ruling on a motion for judgment, the moving party need not renew its motion in order to file for JNOV. <em>Seay, </em>388 Md. at 358 n. 16, 361 n. 17, 879 A.2d 1049. Continuing, the court broadly rejected the exceptions found in federal case-law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">We are not inclined to depart from our state court jurisprudence of strict compliance with the procedural requirements of Rules 2-519 and 2-532 in favor of the more flexible interpretation of Federal <em>Rule 50 </em>as recognized by a number of federal circuits. Even if we were, however, GM still would not prevail.... [Tjhere was no indication from the trial judge that GM need not renew its motion at the close of all the evidence as mandated by the federal exceptions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 360-361, 879 A.2d 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The Court of Appeals\u2019 <em>Seay </em>opinion mandates \u201cstrict compliance\u201d with Rule 2-532. Even if appellants were able to navigate around that mandate, they would have to demonstrate to our satisfaction that the rule\u2019s two \u201cfundamental purposes\u201d were met by other means. The record before us does not support that contention. The stipulated agreement placed on the record by counsel merely stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">The parties are going to stipulate that [the Cross-Defendants] go on the verdict forms as potential shares. There will be no judgment from the pleadings on them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-9\">Scapa will put into evidence with respect to those\u2014we are going to truncate what we are going to offer to Your Honor. And it will be verified interrogatories about them and some documents, but that we won\u2019t need to get into the issue of all these other coworker depositions ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">The agreement never mentioned an intent or request to reserve the right to move for JNOV without first moving for judgment, as required by Rule 2-532. The agreement appears to eliminate the trial court\u2019s role in evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence on the cross-claims before submit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>ting the questions to the jury. While it may have put the Cross-Defendants on notice as to what evidence would be introduced, the fact that no discussion of that evidence ever occurred on the record may just as well suggest that the Cross-Defendants considered it legally insufficient, but were willing to have the jury deny the cross-claims. That, in fact, is what happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">No motion for judgment was ever made as to the cross-claims and therefore counsel\u2019s request, at the conclusion of the evidence, to renew its motions cannot include such a motion. The trial judge\u2019s concurrence to \u201creserve all those arguments for post-trial motions and anything else you may raise\u201d cannot be a reference to the cross-claims, either. Thus, we are left with a rather vague stipulation that fails to meet the procedural requirements for presentation of a motion for JNOV.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">For all of these reasons, we are not willing to disturb the trial court\u2019s denial of that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Scapa argues that the trial court erred when it did not reduce the judgment for appellee to account for payments appellee received from certain bankruptcy settlement trusts. The Uniform Contribution Among Joint Tort-Feasors Act reduces a judgment against a defendant if another \u201cjoint tortfeasor\u201d is released by settlement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-9\">A release by the injured person of one joint tort-feasor, whether before or after judgment ... reduces the claim against the other tort-feasors in the amount of the consideration paid for the release or in any amount or proportion by which the release provides that the total claim shall be reduced, if greater than the consideration paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">C.J. \u00a7 3-1404. The amount recoverable from the non-settling defendant plus the amount recoverable from the settling defendant cannot exceed the plaintiff\u2019s verdict. <em>Hollingsworth, &amp; Vose Co. v. Connor, </em>136 Md.App. 91, 139, 764 A.2d 318 (2000) (citing <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Armstrong, </em>326 Md. 107, 126, 604 A.2d 47 (1992); <em>Martinez v. Lopez, </em>300 Md. 91, 476 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>197 (1984)). \u201cAppellant, as the party moving for a reduction of the verdict in accordance with UCATA \u00a7 3-1404, bears the burden of proving the joint tortfeasor status of the settling parties.\u201d <em>Hashmi v. Bennett, </em>188 Md.App. 434, 443, 982 A.2d 818 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The central question in cases such as this is, \u201cwhat constitutes a joint tort-feasor?\u201d The UCATA defines joint tortfeasors as \u201ctwo or more persons jointly or severally liable in tort for the same injury to person or property, whether or not judgment has been recovered against all or some of them.\u201d C.J. \u00a7 3-1401(c). When a tort-feasor\u2019s liability is adjudicated in court or admitted in a settlement agreement, the court\u2019s inquiry ceases and judgment is reduced to account for the settlement. <em>Collier v. Eagle-Picher Indus., Inc., </em>86 Md.App. 38, 57, 585 A.2d 256 (1991). However, it is sometimes the case\u2014as it is here\u2014that the settling party is neither directly involved in the action nor admittedly a joint tort-feasor. In these circumstances, a settling party is not considered a joint tort-feasor merely because he or she enters a settlement and pays money. <em>See Jacobs v. Flynn, </em>131 Md.App. 342, 375, 749 A.2d 174 (2000) (citing <em>Garrett, </em>343 Md. at 532, 682 A.2d 1143). As Maryland courts have long noted, UCATA does not specify the test of liability, but something short of an actual judgment will suffice. <em>Swigert v. Welk, </em>213 Md. 613, 619, 133 A.2d 428 (1957). Maryland courts have held that joint tort-feasor status may be established, for example, by default judgment or by \u201cjudicial determination\u201d of joint tort-feasor status. <em>Jacobs, </em>131 Md.App. at 375, 749 A.2d 174; <em>Hashmi, </em>at 445, 982 A.2d 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Scapa argues that asbestos settlement trusts taking advantage of the protections offered by Federal Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(g), should be considered joint tortfeasors in asbestos cases whose plaintiff has received distributions from said trusts. Section 524 empowers a federal court to provide special injunctive protections for a trust that, among other requirements, assumes the liabilities of a debtor that was a named defendant in actions seeking recovery for damages allegedly caused by asbestos-containing products and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>pays those claims and demands. 11 USCS \u00a7 524(g)(2)(B)(i)(I, IV). Scapa argues that because its liability was founded upon substantial factor causation, any payment to appellee \u201cfor damages allegedly caused by asbestos-containing products\u201d would necessarily constitute payment by a joint tort-feasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">Scapa presents an interesting theory, and there is some support in case law for this proposition, but there is no evidence on the record that can support its application to this case. The burden was on Scapa to prove joint tort-feasor status of any claimed bankruptcy settlement trusts, and this was not done. Scapa claimed that appellee received payments from Eagle Picher Industries Personal Trust, the Combustion Engineering 524(g) Personal Injury Trust, and the Halliburton bankruptcy trust. However, Scapa did not introduce evidence of their distribution procedures, nor is there any evidence on the record that appellee actually received the payments alleged. The judgment in this case was reduced to account for three bankruptcy settlements, upon <em>appellee\u2019s </em>motion to amend the judgment, but the judge had no evidentiary basis upon which to grant appellant\u2019s motion to reduce the judgment for the bankruptcy trust payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Scapa argues that the trial court erred by excluding deposition testimony of appellee\u2019s co-worker, Shoemaker, on the issue of alternate exposure. The trial transcript shows that the court based its decision on W &amp; G\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude the evidence, which argued that the deposition was not allowed by Maryland Rule 2-419. Scapa argues that the deposition was properly admissible under either section 2-419(a)(3) or section 2-419(c). Because the trial court\u2019s decision was predicated on a pure conclusion of law, we review it <em>de novo. State Sec. Check Cashing, Inc. v. Am. Gen. Fin. Servs. (DE), </em>409 Md. 81, 111, 972 A.2d 882 (2009) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Maryland Rule 2-419(a)(3) provides that, in certain circumstances in which a deponent is unavailable to testify at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>trial, previous deposition testimony may be used \u201cagainst any other party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or who had due notice thereof[.]\u201d Despite the fact that W &amp; G was not a party until more than three years after Shoemaker was deposed, Scapa argues that they received \u201cdue notice\u201d under Rule 2-419(a)(3). Scapa maintains that \u201cdue notice\u201d does not necessarily mean advance notice of the deposition\u2019s <em>occurrence, </em>but that it could also be satisfied by notice of the deposition\u2019s <em>introduction at trial. </em>This interpretation violates the commonsense interpretation of the rule that the \u201cdue notice\u201d requirement of Rule 2-419(a)(3) refers to the notice requirements of Maryland Rule 2-412 (or a similar provision in foreign jurisdiction). The original deposition having been taken in a proceeding in Maryland, \u201cdue notice\u201d under Rule 2-119(a)(3) in this case meant \u201cnotice of deposition upon oral examination at least ten days before the date of the deposition or a notice of deposition upon written questions[,]\u201d per Rule 2-412(a). Any other reading of Rule 2-419(a)(3) would defeat its purpose of ensuring that a party\u2019s interests were represented at a deposition, or else waived by failure to appear and develop the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Appellant next argues that Shoemaker\u2019s testimony is admissible under 2-419(c) because parties present at the deposition were W &amp; G\u2019s \u201cpredecessors in interest.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A \u201cpredecessor in interest\u201d in Rule 2-419(c) is \u201cany party with a similar motive to develop the testimony.\u201d <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Zenobia, </em>325 Md. 420, 440-41, 601 A.2d 633 (1992). \u201cDeposition testimony is admissible if some other party, present at the deposition, had the same opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony as the party against whom the deposition is offered.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Although W &amp; G acknowledged that other \u201cinsulation-contractor defendants\u201d were present, there is nothing to support Scapa\u2019s contention that there was an identity of interest among them. In <em>Zenobia, </em>the Court of Appeals held that manufacturers of asbestos products from a prior action were predecessors in interest to the suppliers and installers defending the <em>Zenobia </em>suit. The Court based its decision on the fact that the admissible testimony was restricted to the \u201cstate of the art,\u201d which, when proved, <em>automatically </em>attached strict liability to <em>all </em>\u201cresellers,\u201d including manufacturers (the predecessors in interest) and assemblers (the <em>Zenobia </em>defendants). <em>Id. </em>at 442, 60.1 A.2d 633 (citing Prosser and Keeton, <em>Torts </em>\u00a7 99, at 697 (5th ed.1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">In the instant case, the Shoemaker testimony detailed the particular circumstances of appellee\u2019s exposure to different products in varying circumstances, not industry standards that necessarily applied equally to each asbestos manufacturer or distributor. The character and means of exposure to each product varied and therefore the potential testimony carried dramatically different liability implications for each party implicated by it. In contrast to <em>Zenobia, </em>each defendant present at the deposition in <em>Saville I </em>had every incentive to blame its co-defendants, to its own exclusion, including the absent W &amp; G.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">W &amp; G did not have \u201cdue notice\u201d of the deposition and it was therefore not admissible under 2-419(a)(3). Nor was the testimony admissible under Maryland Rule 2-419(c), because there was no predecessor to W &amp; G\u2019s interest present at the deposition. Therefore, the trial court did not err in excluding the Shoemaker deposition testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Scapa argues that the trial court erred when it admitted documentary evidence dating from a period after appellee had ceased being exposed to Scapa\u2019s products. Appellant contends that the Post-Exposure Evidence was irrelevant and therefore inadmissible under Rule 5-402, and that even if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>was relevant, it was unfairly prejudicial and therefore inadmissible according to Rule 5-403. It is firmly established that admissibility, including relevance, is left to the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed absent a showing of abuse. <em>Brown v. Daniel Realty Co., </em>409 Md. 565, 601, 976 A.2d 300 (2009) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">A. Relevance</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Evidence is admissible only if it is relevant, meaning it must be probative of a material fact. Md. Rule 5-402; <em>Snyder v. State, </em>361 Md. 580, 591, 762 A.2d 125 (2000). A material fact is one that is of legal consequence to the determination of issues in the case, which are dependent upon the pleadings and the substantive law. <em>Myers v. Celotex Corp., </em>88 Md.App. 442, 454, 594 A.2d 1248 (1991). In this case, the Post-Exposure Evidence was admissible only if it was relevant to Scapa\u2019s duty to warn appellee of the dangers of asbestos. This, in turn, depends on the scope of the duty to warn and whether it continues beyond exposure. In <em>Zenobia, </em>the Court of Appeals quoted the Washington Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Lockwood v. A C &amp; S, </em>109 Wash.2d 235, 744 P.2d 605 (Wash.1987), to support the proposition that a duty to warn can continue even after exposure, depending on the facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">\u201c[W]e believe that if Raymark had made a reasonable effort to provide Lockwood with the information it acquired about the dangers of asbestos exposure after his retirement, the seriousness of his injury might have been reduced. Under those circumstances, Raymark had a continuing duty to warn Lockwood of the known dangers of its product after he was no longer exposed to it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-8\"><em>Zenobia </em>at 448, 601 A.2d 633 (quoting <em>Lockwood </em>at 691). Thus, the Court of Appeals held that whether duty to warn survives manufacture or exposure is a question of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-9\">The fact that a manufacturer or seller has discontinued its asbestos product line, and the fact that the plaintiff was no longer exposed to its product, are not circumstances which should necessarily relieve the seller of its duty to warn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Rather, these factors are relevant to a determination of what reasonable efforts to discover the danger and to warn are required. A seller is not entitled to automatic relief from its continuing duty to warn merely because it no longer manufacturers a defective product.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><em>Zenobia, </em>325 Md. at 448, 601 A.2d 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Although Scapa attempts to differentiate itself from the manufacturer in <em>Zenobia, </em>there is no avoiding the fact that Scapa\u2019s argument is essentially an argument of law, foreclosed by the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion in that case. To conclude, here, that the Post-Exposure Evidence was inadmissible as irrelevant to the duty to warn would be to conclude, as a matter of law, that Scapa\u2019s duty to warn ceased with appellee\u2019s exposure. This legal conclusion would be contrary to established precedent. The scope of a duty to warn is a question of fact, and it is incumbent upon the parties to present evidence that defines that scope. Thus, the Court held that the defendant in <em>Zenobia </em>\u201cwas not precluded from showing that it did not become aware of the need for a warning or that, in light of the fact that it no longer manufactured the product, it made reasonable efforts to warn.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, appellee was free to introduce the Post-Exposure Evidence to prove that Scapa\u2019s duty to warn extended beyond exposure to its product, and Scapa was free to rebut that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">B. Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Having held that the Post-Exposure evidence was relevant, we must still address whether its probative value was substantially outweighed by dangers of unfair prejudice or confusion of the issues, which would render it inadmissible under Maryland Rule 5-403. <em>Decker v. State, </em>408 Md. 631, 640, 971 A.2d 268 (2009) (\u201cRelevant evidence may be excluded, however, if it is unfairly prejudicial ... \u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Scapa first argues that the Post-Exposure evidence unfairly bolstered the testimony of appellee\u2019s expert, Dr. Castleman. In short, we see nothing \u201cunfair\u201d in bolstering a witness\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>testimony with otherwise admissible evidence. To the extent that Scapa can legitimately argue such \u201cunfairness,\u201d Scapa is actually arguing that the documents were misleading and confusing. Appellant contends that because the Post-Exposure Evidence dates during the period of appellee\u2019s employment, Scapa\u2019s knowledge revealed in those documents was improperly attributed to it. We do not believe that it was beyond the jury\u2019s capacity to be aware of the fact that these documents related only to a continuing duty to warn and not to Scapa\u2019s knowledge at the time of appellee\u2019s exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Finally, Scapa argues that appellee used a 1977 Scapa document to inflame the jury unfairly. Scapa cites <em>Dehn v. Edgecombe, </em>152 Md.App. 657, 884 A.2d 146 (2003), <em>aff'd </em>384 Md. 606, 865 A.2d 603 (2005), where we held that the trial court properly excluded evidence of the reasons a patient underwent surgery because its probative value was outweighed by the consideration that it would have \u201cengendered massive jury sympathy for the plaintiffs of a type that might readily override mere legal reasons against a verdict in their favor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 669, 834 A.2d 146. In light of our relevance discussion and the innocuous nature of the document\u2014discussing their substitution of asbestos with an equivalent material\u2014Scapa\u2019s comparison is inapposite. Furthermore, after discussing the document during closing, counsel for appellee concluded: \u201cThat\u2019s not a warning.\u201d Taken in its entirety, it is clear that appellee was using relevant evidence to make a valid legal argument about the scope and fulfillment of Scapa\u2019s duty to warn and that the document was not, as Scapa argues, calculated to win jury sympathy unfairly.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Because the Post-Exposure Evidence was both relevant and not precluded by any of the considerations of Rule 5-403, the trial court did not err in admitting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.
