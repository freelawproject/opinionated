The main issue to be resolved is whether about ten-thousand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>documents that constitute the Maryland State Police\u2019s internal affairs files relating to allegations of illegal racial profiling are \u201cpersonnel records of an individual\u201d within the meaning of that term as used in the Maryland Public Information Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d). We shall hold that the Circuit Court for Baltimore County erred when it concluded that the records withheld by the MSP were \u201cpersonnel records\u201d within the meaning of the Act. Therefore, the records must be produced for inspection and' copying by the NAACP.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The NAACP and the MSP entered into a federal consent decree in 2003 that obligated the MSP to combat racial profiling by its officers. The order was part of ongoing litigation between the parties. <em>See Md. State Conf. of NAACP Branches v. Md. Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>72 F.Supp.2d 560 (D.Md.1999); <em>appeal at Bridges v. Dep\u2019t of Md. State Police, </em>441 F.3d 197 (4th Cir.2006); <em>on remand, Md. State Conf. of NAACP Branches v. Md. State Police, </em>454 F.Supp.2d 339 (D.Md.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">In 2007, the NAACP became suspicious that the MSP was not fulfilling the obligations undertaken when it signed the consent decree. Accordingly, on February 27, 2007, the NAACP filed a request for information pursuant to Maryland Code (1984, 2004 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 \u00a7 10-611-10-630 of the State Government Article (i.e., the Act). The NAACP asked for twelve categories of State Police records.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Request No. 6 asked the MSP to produce:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-9\">All documents obtained or created in connection with any complaint of racial profiling, including but not limited to any complaint filed with or investigated by the MSP\u2019s Department or Internal Affairs, including all complaints filed, all documents collected or created during the investigation of each complaint, and all documents reflecting the conclusion of each investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">On March 28, 2007, the MSP granted the NAACP\u2019s request as to seven categories of records and denied it as to five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>categories. Included in the requests denied was request No. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Request No. 6 was denied on the sole ground that the documents requested were personnel records <em>of </em>an individual. In support of that denial, the MSP cited section 10-616(a) and (i) of the Act. Section 10-616 reads, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">(a) <em>In </em>general\u2014Unless otherwise provided by law, a custodian shall deny inspection of a public record, as provided in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">(i) <em>Personnel records.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-9\">(1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, a custodian shall deny inspection of a <em>personnel record of an individual, </em>including an application, performance rating, or scholastic achievement information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-10\">(2) A custodian shall permit inspection by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-11\">(i) the person in interest; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-12\">(ii) an elected or appointed official who supervises the work of the individual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-14\">It is undisputed that the NAACP is neither a \u201cperson in interest\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> nor \u201can elected or appointed official who supervises the work of the individual\u201d as those terms are used in the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-15\">The NAACP, by its counsel, sent a letter to the MSP on May 2, 2007, which concerned, among other things, request No. 6. In that letter, counsel said that the NAACP would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>have no objection if the custodian redacted from the records the names of the officers and established instead \u201ca unique number or code for each trooper ... [in order for the NAACP] to ascertain whether a particular trooper is referenced in more than one complaint and/or record without divulging that particular trooper\u2019s identity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The parties could not reach an agreement as to what should be produced. Accordingly, on September 26, 2007, the NAACP, filed suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, in which it asked the court to compel the MSP to provide it with, among other things, documents covered by request No. 6, i.e., internal affairs records concerning racial profiling complaints lodged against various troopers.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Between March and June 2008, the parties conducted discovery and, at the request of the circuit court, the records at issue were delivered to the court for inspection <em>in camera. </em>The MSP represented to the court that the documents produced were all kept at police headquarters in the MSP\u2019s internal affairs section.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">After a hearing, the court delivered an oral opinion in which it discussed relevant decisions by the Court of Appeals relating to the meaning of the words \u201cpersonnel record[s] of an individual\u201d as that phrase is used in section 10\u2014616(i) of the Act. The court concluded that the documents withheld were all personnel records because they \u201conly exist because they represent the complaints of a citizen personally directed to a State Trooper [because of] misconduct, of being intimidated by racial bias, as opposed to legitimate reasons for stopping our motorists.\u201d In the court\u2019s words, \u201cthese are the kinds of files that are personnel in nature and represent a thrust against an individual trooper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Later in his opinion, the judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-9\">So I felt at the end of the day having read these documents that a fair approach would be to require the State Police to redact the names and identity numbers\u2014all troopers have an identity number\u2014an ID number as well as the complainant\u2019s identification so that people looking at these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>documents would not be able to tell who the trooper was or who the complainant was, thereby to a great extent protecting the privacy of the trooper while at the same time giving to the Petitioner the right to see the mechanism that the State Police have taken to meaningfully investigate these complaints.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-4\">I did not feel it appropriate\u2014and this is on the record\u2014to just claim them all exempt and say NAACP, you\u2019re not getting any of it. I did not feel it fair to say you\u2019re getting all of them and risk privacy rights of the troopers being invaded and all kinds of other problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">I believe the fair approach is to find that middle ground which is what Pm going to do. I have worried continuously about the logistics involved in this. There are lots of documents. The names of the troopers are all over these documents. Names of the complainants are all over these documents. It is going to be a difficult job to redact these names....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">On August 11, 2008, the hearing judge filed an order, of which the first paragraph read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">Records responsive to Request No. 6 of Plaintiffs Maryland Public Information Act (\u201cMPIA\u201d) request dated February 27, 2007 constitute personnel records under the MPIA, however, the Court finds that they may be disclosed provided that the names and any identification number of individual Maryland State Police (\u201cMSP\u201d) troopers and the names and identifying information of any complainants are redacted from such records. Accordingly, pursuant to the MPIA, Defendant shall provide Plaintiff with such records, redacting the names and any identification numbers of individual Maryland State Police (\u201cMSP\u201d) troopers and the names and any identifying information of any complainants. The process for providing Plaintiff with these redacted records is set forth in paragraph 2-6 below.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">To avoid the time and great expense that would be required by having the MSP review and redact the thousands of documents relating to the racial profiling complaints, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>though, as the court noted, some of the documents would be of no interest to the NAACP, the court\u2019s order provided, in paragraphs 2 through 6, for a procedure whereby three attorneys designated by the NAACP would review the records in unredacted form and identify from those records which ones they wished the MSP to release to it in redacted form. The designated attorneys were prohibited from disclosing to anyone the names of any Maryland State Trooper or complainant whose names they came across; moreover, the designated attorneys were precluded from taking any notes that reflected such names, and required to destroy all of their notes immediately following the inspection.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The MSP filed, on August 21, 2008, an appeal from the court\u2019s order. As worded by the MSP, the question presented is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">Where the circuit court determined that the requested records of police internal affairs investigations are \u201cpersonnel records\u201d within the meaning of the Maryland Public Information Act, \u00a7 10-616(i), which mandates nondisclosure of personnel records, did the circuit court err by ordering an expanded <em>in camera </em>review permitting inspection of the personnel records by the requester\u2019s counsel and by ordering release of all of the requested personnel records with redaction of names and identification?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The circuit court, on September 4, 2008, granted the MSP\u2019s request to stay its August 11, 2008 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The NAACP filed a timely cross-appeal. It contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that the circuit court erred in holding that the unredacted racial profiling complaint records are \u201cpersonnel record[s] of an individual\u201d as that term is used in the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">On October 15, 2008, after the appeal and cross-appeal had been filed, the United States District Court for the District of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Maryland, in the case of <em>NAACP v. Md. State Police, et al., </em>civil action No. FTS-98-1098, ruled on a request for clarification as to what documents the MSP was required to disclose pursuant to its obligation under the 2003 consent decree. The federal court ordered that the MSP disclose to the NAACP redacted copies of the complaints made to the MSP internal affairs division concerning racial profiling. The MSP has already obeyed that order. Accordingly, in this appeal, the issue of whether the complaints of racial profiling need to be produced is not at issue. The district court, however, in an earlier action to enforce the 2003 consent decree, ruled that the consent decree did not give the NAACP the right to inspect and copy investigative files concerning the racial profiling complaints. Therefore, those are the files that are of concern in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Numerous past Court of Appeals decisions have stressed that the Maryland Public Information Act must be liberally construed \u201cin order to effectuate the [Act\u2019s] broad remedial purpose.\u201d See, <em>e.g., A.S. Abell Publg. Co. v. Mezzanote, </em>297 Md. 26, 32, 464 A.2d 1068 (1983). <em>See also Kirwan v. The Diamondback, </em>352 Md. 74, 81-82, 721 A.2d 196 (1998) (collecting cases). The broad purpose of the Act was to ensure \u201cthat citizens of the State of Maryland be accorded wide-ranging access to public information concerning the operation of their government.\u201d <em>A.S. Abell, </em>297 Md. at 32, 464 A.2d 1068. <em>See also Fioretti v. Md. State Bd. of Dental Exam\u2019rs, </em>351 Md. 66, 73, 716 A.2d 258 (1998) (same) and <em>Kirwan, </em>352 Md. at 81, 721 A.2d 196 (1998) (same). To carry out the Act\u2019s broad remedial purpose the General Assembly commanded that the Act \u201cbe broadly construed in every instance with the view towards public access.\u201d <em>A.S. Abell, </em>297 Md. at 32, 464 A.2d 1068. This means that in doubtful cases, the party requesting information under the Act is favored. <em>Kirwan, </em>352 Md. at 84, 721 A.2d 196 (\u201c[T]he statute should be interpreted to favor disclosure.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Nevertheless, the Act protects certain public records from disclosure. While \u201cpersonnel record[s] of an individual\u201d are included within the broad definition of the term \u201cpublic record\u201d <em>(See </em>section 10\u2014611(g)), such records are expressly exempt from disclosure under section 10-616(a) and (i). The personnel record exemption is \u201cintended to address the reasonable expectation of privacy that a person in interest has\u201d in his or her personnel records. <em>Univ. Sys. of Md. v. Balt. Sun Co., </em>381 Md. 79, 99-100, 847 A.2d 427 (2004). <em>See also </em>78 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 291, 293 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Racial profiling complaints against Maryland State Troopers do not involve private matters concerning intimate details of the trooper\u2019s private life. Instead, such complaints involve events occurring while the trooper is on duty and engaged in public service. As such, the files at. issue concern public actions by agents of the State concerning affairs of government, which are exactly the types of material the Act was designed to allow the public to see. <em>A.S. Abell, supra, </em>297 Md. at 32, 464 A.2d 1068. A State Trooper does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy as to such records. <em>See Worcester Telegram &amp; Gazette Corp. v. Chief of Police of Worcester, </em>58 Mass.App.Ct. 1, 787 N.E.2d 602, 607-08 (2003) (materials from internal affairs investigation were not subject to exemption because they were not of a personal nature); <em>Burton v. York County Sheriffs Dep\u2019t., </em>358 S.C. 339, 594 S.E.2d 888, 895 (Ct.App.2004) (sheriffs department records regarding investigation of employee misconduct were subject to disclosure because the public has a right to know how public employees are performing their jobs and how the department handles employee misconduct allegations).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">After section 10\u2014616(i) became law, COMAR (Code of Maryland Regulations) 17.04.14 was published in order to facilitate implementation of the Act and to guide custodians who control public access to records under the custody of the Department of Budget and Management. COMAR 17.04.14.02 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">.02 Definitions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>A. In this chapter, the following terms have the meanings indicated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-4\">B. Terms Defined.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">(1) \u201cAct\u201d means the Public Information Act, State Government Article, \u00a7 \u00a7 10-601-10-630, Annotated Code of Maryland</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">(5) Personnel Record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">(a) \u201cPersonnel record\u201d means any record, <em>regardless of physical form, indexed by name or the employee\u2019s identification number.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">The records here at issue were not indexed by the name of the employee or by the employee\u2019s identification number. Instead, all the records were kept in one filing cabinet located in the MSP\u2019s Internal Affairs Office. Thus, if COMAR 17.04.14.02 were to control, the records at issue would not constitute \u201cpersonnel records.\u201d COMAR 17.04.14.02 does not, however, control because the MSP\u2019s records are not under the custody and control of the Department of Budget and Management. Nevertheless, the regulation is of at least some importance because it demonstrates how an important State agency interprets the words \u201cpersonnel record[s] of an individual\u201d as used in section 10-616(i) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">In our view, the provision of the Act that directly addresses the production of investigatory files like the ones here at issue, is section 10-618(a) and (f), which reads, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acg\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014Unless otherwise provided by law, if a custodian believes that inspection of a part of a public record by the applicant would be contrary to the public interest, the custodian may deny inspection by the applicant of that part, as provided in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>(f) Investigations.\u2014(1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, a custodian may deny inspection of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">(i) <em>records of investigations conducted by </em>... <em>a police department, or a sheriff;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">(ii) an investigatory file compiled for any other law enforcement, judicial, correctional, or prosecution purpose; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">(iii) records that contain intelligence information or security procedures of the Attorney General, a State\u2019s Attorney, a city or county attorney, a police department, a State or local correctional facility, or a sheriff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\">(2) A custodian may deny inspection by a person in interest only to the extent that the inspection would:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">(i) interfere with a valid and proper law enforcement proceeding;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-10\">(ii) deprive another person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-11\">(iii) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-12\">(iv) disclose the. identity of a confidential source;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-13\">(v) disclose an investigative technique or procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-14\">(vi) prejudice an investigation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-15\">(vii) endanger the life or physical safety of an individual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AC8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b392-16\">It is illogical to believe that the General Assembly, when it adopted a permissible degree exception for \u201crecords of investigations conducted by ... a police department,\u201d and set forth detailed provisions governing when such records could be withheld <em>(see </em>section 10\u2014618(f)) also intended that a custodian of records must withhold investigatory files of a police department under the much more general \u201cpersonnel record[s] of an individual\u201d exception as set forth in section 10-616(i). Because the records the NAACP seeks in this case fit precisely within the class of records governed by section 10\u2014618(f), we see no reason why its provision should not control, rather than section 10\u2014616(i) of the Act upon, which the MSP relies. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>other words, the specific statutory provision takes precedence over the more general one. Therefore, access to investigative records of the type requested by the NAACP only could be denied if 1) in its reply to the NAACP\u2019s request No. 6 the MSP relied on the exception set forth in 10-618(a) and (f) the MSP believed that inspection of the records by the NAACP would be against the public interest, under 10-618(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">The MSP had 30 days from the date of receipt of request No. 6 to deny the NAACP\u2019s access and ten additional working days to give its reason for denial. Because the MSP did not deny inspection based on section 10\u2014618(a) and (i)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it never made an attempt to show that section 10-618(a) justified nondisclosure. This would have been difficult to do, in any event, given the obligations imposed on the MSP for the sake of the public by the Federal Consent decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">In <em>Kirwan v. The Diamondback, </em>352 Md. 74, 721 A.2d 196 (1998), the Court of Appeals had occasion to discuss in some detail the Act\u2019s personnel records exemption. <em>See id. </em>at 84, 721 A.2d 196. The <em>Kirwan </em>case arose when the University of Maryland student newspaper, the Diamondback, filed a public information request to obtain copies of the parking tickets accumulated by Gary Williams, Maryland\u2019s basketball coach. <em>Id. </em>at 79, 721 A.2d 196. The University of Maryland refused to give the Diamondback access to the records based on section 16-616(i). <em>Id. </em>at 80, 721 A.2d 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>In <em>Kirwan, </em>the Court commenced its analysis by stating flatly that \u201c[personnel records are exempt from disclosure under \u00a7 10-616 of the ... [Act].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 82, 721 A.2d 196 (Citing section 10-616(a) and (i)). Judge Eldridge, speaking for the Court, then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">The term \u201cpersonnel record\u201d is not expressly defined in the statute. Nonetheless, the language of subsection (i) discloses what type of documents the Legislature considered to be personnel records. The statute lists three categories of documents which are: (1) an application for employment; (2) performance rating; and (3) scholastic achievement. Although this list was probably not intended to be exhaustive, it does reflect a legislative intent that \u201cpersonnel records\u201d mean those documents that <em>directly pertain to employment and an employee\u2019s ability to perform a job. </em>Whether Coach Williams received parking tickets has little or nothing to do with his employment, his status as an employee, or his ability as a coach. It means only that he was alleged to have parked illegally.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 82-83, 721 A.2d 196 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Later in <em>Kirwan, </em>the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">As previously discussed, the policy of the Public Information Act is to allow access to public records. Generally, the statute should be interpreted to favor disclosure. In light of this policy, <em>we do not believe that the General Assembly intended that any record identifying an employee would be exempt from disclosure as a personnel record. </em>Instead, the General Assembly likely intended that the term \u201cpersonnel records\u201d <em>retain its common sense meaning. </em>This is indicated by the list following the prohibition on the release of the personnel records. The release of information regarding parking tickets accumulated by Coach Williams is not within the personnel records exemption contained in the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_z\"><em>Id. </em>at 84, 721 A.2d 196 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">The common sense meaning of the term \u201cpersonnel record^] of an individual\u201d would not include investigative files of a police department concerning racial profiling, especially in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>light of the fact that such files are covered by another section of the Act. Instead, the term should be given a more narrow scope. <em>See Providence Journal Co. v. Kane, </em>577 A.2d 661, 663 (R.I.1990) (personnel records include \u201cemployment history, qualifications, job classifications, status within the civil service system ... work schedule ... and overtime history\u201d). The definition quoted from <em>Providence Journal, supra, </em>was cited with approval in <em>Kirwan, </em>352 Md. at 84 n. 2, 721 A.2d 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">It should be emphasized that <em>Kirwan </em>includes in its definition of \u201cpersonnel records\u201d documents that <em>\u201cdirectly </em>pertain to employment and an employee\u2019s ability to perform a job.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 83, 721 A.2d 196 (emphasis added). In a very broad sense, everything an employee does while on duty might be said to \u201cpertain to employment.\u201d But, to be encompassed within the <em>Kirwan </em>definition, the records must directly pertain to employment and the \u201cability [of an employee] to perform a job.\u201d The records at issue here did not seek to uncover anything about any employee\u2019s job abilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">In Governor <em>v. Washington Post Co., </em>360 Md. 520, 759 A.2d 249 (2000), which was decided about two years after the <em>Kirwan </em>case, the Court of Appeals, for the first time, included the word \u201cdiscipline\u201d in its judicially crafted definition of \u201cpersonnel records.\u201d The case arose when two <em>Washington Post </em>reporters made separate requests for information pursuant to the Act. <em>Id. </em>at 526, 759 A.2d 249. One reporter requested telephone records of \u201call phones in the Governor\u2019s Mansion; his State House Offices; all phones in Shaw House (an annexed office in Annapolis); all phones in the Washington and Baltimore offices; all car phones and cellular phones used by the [G]overnor and anyone on his staff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A second reporter requested appointment or scheduling records of the Governor spanning a two-year period. <em>Id. </em>In the course of deciding a series of complex issues raised in that case, the Court of Appeals, at one point, focused on the personnel records exception set forth in section 10\u2014616(1) of the Act. Judge Eldridge, once again speaking for the Court of Appeals, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>The identification of the telephone number which the Governor or a member of his staff called, or the identification of someone with whom the Governor met, concerning a possible future appointment to a judgeship or position in the executive branch of state government, would not amount to a \u201cpersonnel record\u201d as defined in <em>Kirwan. </em>The simple record of what number was called, or with whom the Governor met, about possible <em>future </em>employment would not relate to the <em>discipline, promotion, dismissal, status, job perfoi\"mance or achievement of an existing or former employee. </em>Again, while the substance of the conversations might in some cases fall in the category of \u201capplication for employment\u201d or relate to \u201chiring,\u201d the fact that the Governor or a staff member telephoned or met with an identified individual would not be a \u201cpersonnel record\u201d under any \u201ccommonly understood meaning of the term,\u201d <em>Kirwan, </em>352 Md. at 83, 721 A.2d at 200.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 548, 759 A.2d 249 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">It should be noted, parenthetically, that the records requested by the <em>Washington Post </em>reporters, in a general sense, dealt with \u201can employee\u2019s\u201d (i.e., the Governor or a member of his staff) employment, but the records like the ones here at issue did not deal directly with an employee\u2019s employment or his/her \u201cability to perform a job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">The MSP maintains that the internal affairs investigation records at issue are exempt from the Act because those records \u201cunquestionably\u201d concern whether \u201can employee should be disciplined for misconduct.\u201d The NAACP replies, accurately, that: 1) when the MSP\u2019s representative was deposed in this case, he admitted that unlike disciplinary records, the racial profiling complaint records are not stored in the trooper\u2019s personnel file and 2) no racial profiling complaint has ever resulted in disciplinary actions because no complaint thus far has been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">The records at issue clearly do not' <em>directly </em>pertain to discipline \u201cof an existing or former employee\u201d but even if they did, to be exempt, the MSP would have to show that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>investigative records exception was inapplicable. <em>See </em>section 10-618(a) and (f). We therefore conclude that investigations into the question of whether various State Troopers have engaged in racial profiling, do not constitute \u201cpersonnel r\u00e9cordes] of an individual\u201d under any \u201ccommonly understood meaning of the term.\u201d <em>Kirwan, </em>352 Md. at 83, 721 A.2d 196, <em>see Washington Post, </em>360 Md. at 548, 759 A.2d 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">In support of its position that section 10\u2014616(i) of the Act justified withholding the investigatory files of the internal affairs division, the MSP places great reliance on <em>Balt. City Police Dep\u2019t. v. State, </em>158 Md.App. 274, 857 A.2d 148 (2004). That case originated when two defendants, Clark and Smith, were arrested by Detective Michael Dressel, a member of the Baltimore City Police Department. <em>Id. </em>at 278, 857 A.2d 148. Clark, who was arrested on drug charges, apparently had reason to believe that Detective Dressel had been accused (in a separate case), of dishonest acts by one or more fellow officers. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, in his criminal case, Clark filed a subpoena directing the Baltimore City Internal Affairs Division of the police department to produce all records concerning accusations by fellow police officers about Dressel\u2019s honesty. Id. The Baltimore City Police Department filed a motion to <em>quash </em>the subpoena on two grounds: 1) that the records requested were protected from disclosure by the \u201cpersonnel records\u201d exception set forth in section 10\u2014616(i) of the Act and 2) that provisions of the Law Enforcement Officer\u2019s Bill of Rights (LEOBR), as set forth in Md.Code (2003), \u00a7 3-104(n), (o) of the Public Safety Article, afforded Detective Dressel protection from the disclosure requested. <em>Id. </em>at 282-83, 857 A.2d 148. Without conducting an <em>in camera </em>review of the records, the circuit court ordered the Police Department to disclose to Clark \u201cthe portions of the IAD [Internal Affairs Division] file that contained \u2018any statement made by a named police witness that [Officer Dressel] engaged [in dishonesty] in the past.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 278, 857 A.2d 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The Police Department appealed that order to this Court. On appeal, the appellee (Clark) did not dispute the Police Department\u2019s contention that the requested documents were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>exempt from disclosure under section 10-616(i) of the Act. <em>Id. </em>at 282-83, 857 A.2d 148. Clark could afford to make that concession because the law was well established that even if the records were confidential under the LEOBR and/or under the Act, the confidential nature of the records did not guarantee insulation of the confidential matter from disclosure. Instead, the law required that Dressel\u2019s interest in confidentiality be balanced, in this context, against the confrontation and due process rights of the defendant under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. <em>Id. </em>at 286, 857 A.2d 148 (citing <em>Robinson v. State, </em>354 Md. 287, 308, 730 A.2d 181 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">In the <em>Baltimore City Police Department </em>case, we said, at the outset:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">[T]he Department asserts that IAD\u2019s file concerning its investigation into allegations of dishonesty on the part of Detective Dressel <em>qualifies as a personnel record, </em>and appellee does not contend otherwise. Guided by <em>Kirwan, we see no reason to disagree with the Department\u2019s position on this point.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">158 Md.App. at 283, 857 A.2d 148 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">We went on to agree with Clark that although the records were confidential, they were nevertheless not privileged. <em>Id. </em>at 287 n. 7, 857 A.2d 148. Also, we said that, on the record presented, we could not decide whether Clark\u2019s right to a fair trial and to confront witnesses outweighed Detective Dressel\u2019s privacy interest. <em>Id. </em>at 286-87, 857 A.2d 148. Relying on <em>Reynolds v. State, </em>98 Md.App. 348, 633 A.2d 455 (1993) and <em>Blades v. Woods, </em>107 Md.App. 178, 667 A.2d 917 (1995), we also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\"><em>Reynolds, </em>of course, dealt with the discoverability of information that is made privileged by statute, not, as here, made confidential by statute.... Two years later, however, we called for the same procedure to be conducted when the matter sought to be discovered was contained, as here, in the internal investigatory files of a police officer. <em>Blades v. Woods, </em>107 Md.App. 178, 186, 667 A.2d 917 (1995). Recognizing that IAD files are confidential, we determined it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>necessary to remand the case \u201cfor proceedings that will balance [Blades\u2019s] legitimate need for relevant information in the records against (1) the privacy rights of other persons and (2) the custodian\u2019s duty to maintain confidentiality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 185, 667 A.2d 917 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">As we did in <em>Reynolds, </em>we stated that, on remand, Blades first would have to proffer his need for disclosure and persuade the court that there is a reasonable possibility that the information in the records will assist his case. <em>Id. </em>at 186, 667 A.2d 917. \u201cIn reviewing this proffer, the court should consider the relationship between the information sought and the nature of the case, as well as the precise issue that the information is expected to address.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">We went on to say, in <em>Blades: </em>Once the [individual] has demonstrated such need, the trial judge must determine what police department records exist and which of those records are confidential. This determination should be made in camera. Any reviewed records that are deemed not relevant or usable should be sealed and filed separately. Any records that appear to be discoverable shall then be reviewed at an expanded in camera hearing, with counsel of record present as officers of the court. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">158 Md.App. at 290-92, 857 A.2d 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Because the procedures set forth in <em>Reynolds </em>and <em>Blades </em>were not followed, we remanded the case to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 291-93, 857 A.2d 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">The <em>Baltimore City Police Department </em>case, contrary to MSP\u2019s argument, is not here dispositive.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> No request was made by Clark, pursuant to the Public Information Act, and the custodian\u2019s claim that the documents were privileged under the Act went unchallenged. Moreover, the dispositive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>question, as we stressed, was not whether the material was protected from disclosure under the Act or under the LEOBR, but whether the documents were discoverable in a criminal case. <em>Id. </em>at 287, 857 A.2d 148. Lastly, the documents the trial court ordered produced in the <em>Baltimore City Police Department </em>case (records as to one officer regarding one particular character trait of that officer) comes far closer to meeting the common sense meaning of the phrase \u201cpersonnel record[s] of an individual\u201d than the records here at issue where the NAACP does not seek to impeach any officer and is not even interested in obtaining the names of any State Trooper. Instead, in this case, the appellee-cross-appellant simply wants to find out if a state agency is properly overseeing its officers. The difference in what is sought is of great importance because in \u201cevery instance\u201d the Act is to be construed so that citizens are \u201caccorded wide-ranging access to public information concerning the operation of their government.\u201d <em>A.S. Abell, </em>297 Md. at 32, 464 A.2d 1068.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u25a0 For all the above reasons, we hold that the investigatory files at issue do not constitute \u201cpersonnel record[s] of an individual\u201d as that phrase is used in section 10\u2014616(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">As an alternative argument, the MSP contends that the records at issue \u201care protected by the Law Enforcement Officer\u2019s Bill of Rights as set forth in sections 3-104(n) and (o) of the Public Safety Article.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This issue was neither raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>nor decided below and therefore will not be considered in this appeal. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131 (a) (except for jurisdictional issues, an appellate court will not ordinarily consider any issue neither raised or decided in the trial court). <em>See also City of Frederick v. Randall Family, LLC, </em>154 Md.App. 543, 575, 841 A.2d 10 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In its cross-appeal, although the NAACP argues that the records at issue were not \u201cpersonnel record[s] of an individual\u201d as that phrase is used in section 10\u2014616(i), it also argues, in the alternative, that the trial court should not have addressed that issue because: l)it was willing to have the records redacted to conceal the names of the State Troopers against whom the complaints were made, and 2) if those redactions were made, the records, even if they came within the ambit of section 10-616(i), must nevertheless be produced pursuant to section 10\u2014614(b)(3)(iii) of the Act, which provides that a custodian of records who denies an application shall \u201cpermit inspection of any part of the record that is subject to inspection and is reasonably severable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>We reject this alternative argument. First, the MSP did not accept the NAACP\u2019s suggestion that the records be redacted, which meant that the issue the trial judge first resolved was squarely presented to him. Second, section 10-614(b)(3)(iii) did not allow the court to dodge the issue because, if the records were in fact \u201cpersonnel record[s] of an individual,\u201d they would not be transformed into another category of records by simply redacting names from them.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">In summary, the trial court did not err in addressing head on, the question of whether the exemption from disclosure set forth in 10-616(i) was applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">y.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The MSP argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">In this case, the [Act] does not authorize an expanded <em>in camera </em>review, as was ordered by the circuit court, which would allow inspection of unredacted personnel records by the requesting party\u2019s counsel. Instead, the only form of <em>in camera </em>review authorized by the MPIA is prescribed in \u00a7 10-623, \u201cJudicial review.\u201d Subsection (c) of this statute, entitled \u201cCourt\u201d authorizes only \u201c[t]he court\u201d\u2014and no one else\u2014to \u201cexamine the public records in camera....\u201d As defined by the Court of Appeals, review or inspection <em>\u201cin camera\u201d </em>means [a] trial judge\u2019s private consideration of evidence. <em>Ehrlich v. Grove, </em>396 Md. 550, 553 n. 3, 914 A.2d 783 (2007) (citing Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 775 (8th ed. 2004)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">The above argument may very well have had merit if one or more of the exemptions set forth in the Act was applicable. But, as explained above, the NAACP was entitled to the records in unredacted form inasmuch as the only exemption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>the MSP relied on for its denial (\u00a7 10-616(i) of the Act) did not apply. The procedure that the court permitted and which the NAACP still is \"willing to accept, gave the MSP more than it was entitled to under the Act. Put another way, the court could have simply required the MSP to copy all the records mentioned in request No. 6. Thus, the trial judge did not commit prejudicial error when it ordered expanded <em>in camera </em>review in an effort to reduce the number of records that are to be produced and redacted. <em>See Flores v. Bell, </em>398 Md. 27, 33, 919 A.2d 716 (2007) (to prevail in an appeal, an appellant must prove prejudice as well as error).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">PORTION OP ORDER PROVIDING THAT RECORDS SOUGHT BY APPELLEE-CROSS APPELLANT WERE \u201cPERSONNEL RECORDS\u201d WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE MARYLAND PUBLIC INFORMATION ACT VACATED; REMAINDER OF ORDER DATED AUGUST 11, 2008, AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT-CROSS APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b385-16\">.

Washington Post Co., </em>149 Md.App. 289, 322-23, 815 A.2d 859 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">As the Majority further points out, the definition of personnel records as directly pertaining to \u201cemployment <em>and </em>employee\u2019s ability to perform a job\u201d is in the conjunctive and certainly is not applicable in the case <em>sub judice, </em>where the behavior at issue has nothing to do with a trooper\u2019s \u201cability.\u201d In fact, as will be discussed, <em>infra, </em>the basis and the reason for obtaining the records is not principally concerned with the performance of the troopers, themselves. The only category arguably relevant to the issue at hand is the discipline of state troopers as a result of complaints of discriminatory practices, but, as the Majority points out, records of complaints filed, in this case, fail to disclose that any discipline has been meted out.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">That brings me to my central thesis, <em>i.e., </em>that the basis for the right to obtain the records, in the first place, was mentioned by the trial judge who, unfortunately, after identifying what I believe should have been the central focus, <em>i.e., </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>records are the only means by which compliance with the consent decree can be demonstrated, the court then repeatedly, reverted to referencing the records as \u201cpersonnel in nature and a thrust against an individual trooper.\u201d What was not accorded proper consideration by the circuit court, in my judgment, was that\u2014putting aside for the moment the question of redaction<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\u2014irrespective of whether the records served a dual purpose, it is beyond cavil that the most predominant rationale for maintaining the records at issue, as the circuit court recognized, was \u201cto give the [appellee] the right to see the mechanism that the State police have taken to meaningfully investigate these complaints.\u201d The denied records, the court later iterated, \u201cwill reveal whether the MSP <em>at the institutional level </em>is properly handling racial profiling investigations and therefore complying with the letter and spirit of the consent decree as well as what the law is in the state.\u201d In the same vein, the circuit court acknowledged that the NAACP was not seeking to obtain information regarding individual troopers; rather, it was seeking \u201cto glean information <em>about the internal mechanics of the State police and whether or not they have adopted policies and protocol to \u2018meaningfully investigate\u2019 complaints of </em>... <em>racial profiling.\u201d </em>Simply put, the records were sought to monitor the Department\u2019s supervision of the troopers, not the job performance of individual state troopers.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The records that were sought are not personal, but rather involve complaints from citizens and the action taken by the Department in response thereto and intended to serve as a basis for making a determination as to the Agency\u2019s compliance with the consent decree. The manner in which the state troopers discharge their duties is relevant only in that it provides a predicate for the ultimate determination of the Department\u2019s compliance with the consent decree. Thus, the basis for the circuit court\u2019s ruling that, because the records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>\u201crepresent a thrust against an individual trooper,\u201d <em>ergo </em>\u201cthese are the kinds of files that are personnel in nature,\u201d is patently predicated on a false premise.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">We have previously held that, when a party seeks disclosure of records made confidential by statute, trial courts must engage in a balancing procedure in making their determination to permit such a disclosure. That is, a trial court must weigh the requestor\u2019s \u201c \u2018legitimate need for relevant information in the records against (1) the privacy rights of other persons and (2) the custodian\u2019s duty to maintain confidentiality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baltimore City Police Dep't v. State, </em>158 Md.App. 274, 290, 857 A.2d 148 (2004) (quoting <em>Blades v. Woods, </em>107 Md. App. 178, 186, 667 A.2d 917 (1995)). Analogizing a request for confidential records with a request for privileged records, we have explained that the person requesting the documents would \u201chave to proffer his need for disclosure and persuade the court that there is a reasonable possibility that the information in the records will assist his case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Reynolds v. State, </em>98 Md.App. 348, 633 A.2d 455, (1993)). We have further elaborated on this requirement, explaining that \u201c \u2018the court should consider the relationship between the information sought and the nature of the case, as well as the precise issue that the information is expected to address.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Blades, </em>107 Md.App. at 186, 667 A.2d 917). Implicit in this mandatory analysis is a consideration of the <em>purpose </em>for the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Even if the requested information in the case <em>sub judice </em>qualified as confidential, the purpose of the request in the case <em>sub judice </em>cannot be given short shrift. The \u201clegitimate need,\u201d or purpose for the request, advanced by the NAACP in this case implicates a matter of public interest and the implementation of a decree of a federal court. Unquestionably, the records requested bear directly on the precise issue that they were expected to address, <em>i.e., </em>compliance with the federal decree and the purpose for which they were sought is comparable to the basis for providing criminal defendants documents to ensure protection of their confrontation and due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>rights. <em>Baltimore Police, supra; Robinson v.

State, </em>326 Md. 54, 81-87, 602 A.2d 1247 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The Majority opinion characterizes the belief that any notion that the General Assembly intended that a custodian of records could withhold investigatory files of a police department under the more general \u201cpersonnel record[s] of an individual\u201d exception as set forth in 10\u2014616(i) as \u201cillogical,\u201d when it adopted an exception for \u201c \u2018records of investigations conducted by ... a police department,\u2019 and set forth detailed provisions governing when such records could be withheld (see Section 10\u2014618(f)).\u201d Op. at 370, 988 A.2d at 1081. As I indicated earlier, I concur with the Majority\u2019s foregoing discernment of the legislative intent. But, more to the point, although the record reflects that there have been serious attempts to reach an accommodation in producing the records at issue, rather than \u201cillogical,\u201d it would be \u201cunseemly\u201d that the General Assembly, when it adopted an exception for \u201crecords of investigations conducted by a police department,\u201d intended that a party to a consent decree could render that decree nugatory simply by seeking solace in a related, but less definitive statutory provision, thereby denying access to the only records which will confirm or dispel assertions of noncompliance with that decree. And, it would be particularly egregious if that party were permitted to accomplish the feat by simply shrouding the subject records with the denomination, \u201cpersonnel.\u201d Judge Deborah Eyler and Judge Woodward have authorized me to advise that they join my concurring opinion, as well as the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">DEBORAH S. EYLER and WOODWARD, JJ., join.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b404-9\">. I am mindful of the holding of the Court of Appeals in <em>Office of the Attorney General v. Gallagher, </em>359 Md. 341, 354, 753 A.2d 1036 (2000) to the effect that \"SG \u00a7 10-618(0 does not override other exemptions under the Act.\" In <em>Gallagher, </em>the Court made clear that a record exempt from disclosure under \u00a7 10-615, 10-616 or 10-617, or any other subsection that prohibits a custodian from granting disclosure, cannot otherwise be disclosed through the custodian's discretionary authority under \u00a7 10-618(f) by virtue of the fact that the document is in an investigatory file. \"... [T)he discretionary authority under \u00a7 10-618 cannot arise if the record cannot be disclosed because of a mandatory provision in \u00a7 \u00a7 10-615 or 10-617.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 354, 753 A.2d 1036. However, this holding would only be applicable if the \"other exemption,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>SG \u00a7 10\u2014616(i) is applicable. Because we conclude the records at issue are not personnel records, \u00a7 10-616 is not applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b406-6\">.

I write separately to provide a brief explanation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">At issue in this case are the records of the MSP documenting its investigations of 94 complaints, filed between 2003 and 2007, alleging that MSP officers utilized racial profiling in making traffic stops. The MSP concluded that the charges of racial profiling could be sustained in none of them. As the Majority opinion explains, the NAACP seeks to inspect these records as part of its efforts to determine whether the MSP is complying with its commitments to adopt and implement policies and procedures to end racial profiling.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Prior to its ruling, the circuit court made an <em>in camera </em>inspection of each file, totaling, in the words of the court, \u201c7- or 8,000 pages.\u201d In rendering its ruling from the bench, the circuit court identified personnel records as \u201c[-1 documents that directly pertain to employment and an employee\u2019s ability to perform a job/\u20191 right out of a case.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">[Tjhese files that I have looked through only exist because they represent the complaints of a citizen personally directed at a state trooper of misconduct, of being intimidated by racial bias as opposed to legitimate reasons for stopping our motorists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">So as a generic idea, I believe that overall, therefore, these are the kinds of files that are personnel in nature and represent a thrust against an individual trooper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">I respectfully part company with the Majority at two points in its analysis. I believe that the troopers who were the subject of the complaints have privacy interests in the records in question and I further believe that the files themselves should be considered as \u201cpersonnel records\u201d under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The Majority states that, since the complaints involve events occurring while the troopers were on duty and engaged in public service, the officers who were the subject of the complaints did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy as to such records. With all respect to the Majority, I do not believe this proposition is consistent with the analysis employed by the Court of Appeals in <em>Robinson v. State, </em>354 Md. 287, 308, 730 A.2d 181 (1999), and this Court in <em>Baltimore City Police Dept. v. State, </em>158 Md.App. 274, 282-83, 857 A.2d 148 (2004). Both decisions recognize that police officers who are the subject of internal disciplinary investigations have privacy interests in the investigative records.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\"><em>Robinson </em>involved a prosecution for armed robbery. During the trial, Robinson sought access to statements made by the arresting officers as a result of an internal affairs division (\u201cLAD\u201d) investigation of the circumstances surrounding his arrest on the basis of the <em>Jencks/Carr</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rule. 354 Md. at 298, 730 A.2d 181. One of the arguments raised by the State on appeal was that the prior statements made by the arresting officers were confidential under the LEOBR and thus, were not \u201cavailable\u201d to the police for disclosure to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 304, 730 A.2d 181. In assessing this contention, the Court of Appeals concluded that what was then \u00a7 728(5)(b)(iii) and (iv) of the LEOBR (now codified as Md.Code Ann. Pub. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Safety \u00a7 3-104(n)), \u201climits access to the internal investigation file to the affected officer, and then only to exculpatory information, and does not expressly provide for access by anyone else.... These provisions deal only with the rights of the officer and serve as a protection for them.\u201d 354 Md. at 308, 730 A.2d 181. The Court went on to hold that an officer\u2019s right in the confidentiality of IAD records was not absolute and \u201cmust be balanced ... against the confrontation and due process rights of the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309, 730 A.2d 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In <em>Baltimore Police, </em>a defendant in a criminal case subpoenaed the file of an IAD investigation of a police officer who was a witness against him. 158 Md.App. at 280, 857 A.2d 148. The trial court denied the police department\u2019s motion to quash the subpoena and the department appealed. <em>Id. </em>This Court stated \u201c[t]he Department asserts that IAD\u2019s file concerning its investigation into allegations of dishonesty on the part of [the police officer] qualifies as a personnel record [under the Act], and appellee does not contend otherwise. Guided by <em>Kirwan, </em>we see no reason to disagree... . \u201d 158 Md.App. at 282-83, 857 A.2d 148. Later in the opinion, this Court stated that \u201cthe IAD records at issue ... are made confidential by SG \u00a7 10-616.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 287 n. 7, 857 A.2d 148. Citing <em>Robinson, </em>we concluded that the police officer\u2019s privacy interest was not absolute but must be weighed against the countervailing interests in favor of disclosure. <em>Id. </em>at 286, 857 A.2d 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">I also must part company with the Majority\u2019s conclusion that the records in question should be treated as \u201crecords of investigations conducted by ... a police department,\u201d under \u00a7 10\u2014618(f), instead of personnel records pursuant to \u00a7 10-616\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">While the term \u201cpersonnel record\u201d is not defined in the Act, the Court of Appeals has explained that the term embraces records that relate to the \u201cdiscipline, promotion, dismissal, status, job performance or achievement\u201d of an employee. <em>Governor v. Washington Post, </em>360 Md. 520, 548, 759 A.2d 249 (2000); <em>see also Kirwan, </em>352 Md. at 83, 721 A.2d 196 (\u201c \u2018[Personnel records\u2019 mean those documents that directly pertain to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>employment and an employee\u2019s ability to perform a job.\u201d) After its <em>in camera </em>inspection of the records, the circuit court characterized them as \u201ccomplaints of a citizen personally directed at a state trooper of misconduct, of being intimidated by racial bias.\u201d Whether a state trooper uses race as a factor in determining whether to initiate a traffic stop bears ineluctably upon that officer\u2019s job performance. If the MSP were to conclude that a trooper was guilty of racial profiling, discipline would surely follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Certainly, the records were generated by investigations by the MSP. This fact should not render the files subject to disclosure under \u00a7 10\u2014618(f). The Court of Appeals considered a similar question in <em>Attorney General v. Gallagher, </em>359 Md. 341, 348, 753 A.2d 1036 (2000), and held that specific exemptions under the Act were applicable to a request under the Act to inspect an investigative file: \u201c[njothing in the language or history of the Public Information Act supports the view that, when records are contained within an investigatory file, \u00a7 10\u2014618(f)(2) displaces all other exemptions in the statute.\u201d Id.<footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Because I conclude that the records in question are \u201cpersonnel records,\u201d I will address the principal contention advanced by the MSP to this Court, namely, that there is nothing in the Act to permit redaction or partial disclosure of a personnel record. The MSP\u2019s position is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">The provision in question is \u00a7 10\u2014614(b)(3)(iii) which requires a custodian who denies inspection of a record \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>permit inspection of any part of the record that is subject to inspection and is reasonably severable.\u201d The MSP\u2019s position that \u00a7 10\u2014614(b)(3)(iii) does not apply to personnel records is not consistent with the legislative history of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The Act was enacted in 1970 and was codified as Article 76A of the Code. <em>Faulk v. State\u2019s Attorney for Harford Co., </em>299 Md. 493, 506, 474 A.2d 880 (1984). At that time, the statutory predecessors to the current \u00a7 30\u2014614(b) (Grant or denial by custodian), \u00a7 10-615 (Required denials-In General), \u00a7 10-616 (Required denials-Specific records), \u00a7 10-617 (Required denials-Specific information), and \u00a7 10-618 (Permissible denials), were all contained in Article 76A \u00a7 3. Section 3 did not contain a provision requiring a custodian to sever disclosable from non-disclosable records.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">In 1976, significant amendments were proposed to the Act. The proposed amendments included revising \u00a7 3(d) to read in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">(d) Whenever the custodian denies a written request for access to any public record or any portion thereof under this section, [the custodian shall provide a written statement of the grounds for the denial].... In addition, any reasonably severable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such a record after deletion of those portions which may be withheld from disclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">With regard to the proposed amendment to \u00a7 3(d), the House Constitutional and Administrative Law Committee reported:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeC-\">[T]he section permitting the withholding of public information has been modified throughout so that if only a portion of the record should be denied and the record is severable the remainder must be disclosed. <em>By amending the law in this manner, it makes it clear that in construing even the tvithholding section the law should be vieived in a manner rvhich ivould permit disclosure.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">House Constitutional and Administrative Law Committee 1976 Report to the General Assembly of Maryland at 111 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>The report makes it clear that the legislature intended that exempt records, including personnel records, be subject to reasonable severance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The NAACP is not interested in the records to obtain information regarding individual troopers. Instead, the NAACP is seeking, in the words of the circuit court, \u201cto glean information about the internal mechanics of the State Police and whether or not they have adopted policies and protocol to \u2018meaningfully investigate\u2019 ... complaints of racial profiling....\u201d Consistent with the institutional, as opposed to individual, focus of its inquiry, the NAACP offered to accept records in which the names of the officers involved were redacted. Whether stemming from the Act or the LEOBR, a trooper\u2019s privacy rights extend only to the contents of his or her own investigatory file; an individual trooper has no privacy interest in the policies and procedures of the MSP.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The statutory mandate of \u00a7 10\u2014614(b)(8) (iii) must be interpreted in light of the clearly-identified purposes of the Act, both as articulated in the legislative history and as recognized by decisions of this Court and the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>After its <em>in camera </em>review, the circuit court determined that redaction of identifying information would protect the privacy interests of the troopers. As the trial court stated, \u201c[i]f you don\u2019t know who the trooper was, it really can\u2019t be personnel in nature, and it can\u2019t be an invasion of a trooper\u2019s privacy.\u201d The circuit court further determined that it would be reasonable to permit inspection if \u201cthe names and any identification numbers of individual ... troopers and the names and identifying information of any complainants\u201d were redacted. These conclusions are tantamount to a determination that the identifying information was \u201creasonably severable\u201d from the rest of the records.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The circuit court noted that, in its view, there are \u201cthousands of documents\u201d within the files that \u201care not particularly relevant to ... the request of the NAACP.\u201d In order to reduce the time and expense associated with redacting the files, the circuit court ordered the MSP to permit inspection of the unredacted files by three attorneys of Venable LLP (the NAACP\u2019s trial and appellate counsel) with safeguards designed to prevent disclosure of information regarding the identity of either the troopers or the complainants. <em>See </em>Majority op. at 365-67, 988 A.2d at 1077-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>The circuit court intended the \u201ceyes only review\u201d to reduce costs and expedite the eventual inspection of redacted records.
