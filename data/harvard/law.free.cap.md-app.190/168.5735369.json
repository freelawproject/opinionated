At trial, the State proved that early on the morning of March 4, 2007, appellant was stopped while driving a 1975 Chevrolet pickup truck, after making a left turn in front of a vehicle with the right of way, driving 50 inph in a 35 mph zone, twice crossing the center line, and once crossing over the shoulder line. The patrol officer who stopped appellant immediately smelled alcohol on appellant\u2019s breath. Appellant told the officer that he had \u201chad two beers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">A second patrol officer, who responded as backup, administered one of the three standard field sobriety tests. Upon exiting his vehicle, appellant had \u201ca strong odor\u201d of alcohol on his breath, \u201c[h]is speech was very slurred,\u201d \u201che was swaying, using the car for balance,\u201d and his steps were \u201cuncoordinated.\u201d He claimed that he had taken an Oxycodone six hours earlier, that he walked with a cane, and that he did not feel comfortable performing the \u201cwalk and turn\u201d or \u201cone leg-stand\u201d tests. When asked to follow the officer\u2019s finger with his eyes, appellant displayed \u201call six clues\u201d indicating a level of alcohol intoxication that was \u201cway over the limit.\u201d Appellant was arrested and took an alcohol breath test at the police station, resulting in a blood alcohol content reading of .25\u2014 more than three times the legal threshold of .08.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">Appellant was sentenced to consecutive terms of two years and 18 months incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">On appeal, this Court may determine whether a sentence is illegal. <em>See Wilkins v. State, </em>343 Md. 444, 447, 682 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>A.2d 247 (1996). \u201cUnder the Double Jeopardy Clause, a defendant is protected against multiple punishment for the same conduct, unless the legislature clearly intended to impose multiple punishments.\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>357 Md. 141, 156, 742 A.2d 493 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Appellant challenges his consecutive sentences for driving while under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in violation of Md.Code, (1977, 2008 Repl.Vol.), Transportation (Trans.), \u00a7 21-902(a)(l), and driving while under the influence of alcohol <em>per se </em>(DUI <em>per </em>se), in violation of Trans. \u00a7 21-902(a)(2). He argues that the DUI <em>per se </em>sentence should have been merged into the DUI sentence because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1\">the [legislature created a single offense of driving while under the influence of alcohol, which may be committed in different ways; for sentencing purposes, the statutory offenses will merge, for the same act of driving; and multiple punishments are forbidden by the Double Jeopardy Clause ..., by the rule of lenity, and by fundamental fairness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AB\">Although we do not agree with appellant that DUI and DUI <em>per se </em>are a \u201csingle offense,\u201d we conclude, and hold, that under the rule of lenity the two offenses merge for sentencing purposes when, as in this case, they arise from a single act of driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Trans. \u00a7 21-902(a) consists of two distinct provisions that proscribe the operation of a motor vehicle by persons who are under the influence of alcohol. Subsection (a)(1) provides that \u201c[a] person may not drive ... any vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.\u201d Subsection (a)(2) provides that \u201c[a] person may not drive ... any vehicle while under the influence of alcohol per se.\u201d The latter term is defined to mean \u201chaving an alcohol concentration at the time of testing of 0.08 or more as measured by grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.\u201d Trans. \u00a7 ll-174.1(a). Under Trans. \u00a7 27-101(k), the General Assembly has established sentences for violations of \u201cany of the provisions of \u00a7 21-902(a),\u201d including enhanced sentences for repeat offenders, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>(i) For a first offense, ... a fine o\u00ed' not more than $1,000, or imprisonment for not more than 1 year, or both;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-4\">(ii) For a second offense, ... a fine of not more than $2,000, or imprisonment for not more than 2 years, or both;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">(iii) For a third or subsequent offense, ... a fine of not more than $3,000, or imprisonment for not more than 3 years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Appellant\u2019s contention that DUI and DUI <em>per se </em>are \u201ca single offense\u201d was expressly rejected in <em>Meanor v. State, </em>364 Md. 511, 526, 774 A.2d 394 (2001), when the Court of Appeals held that the two are separate offenses under the required evidence test because each has \u201can element not found in the other.\u201d In support of that interpretation, the Court reviewed legislative history leading to enactment of the DUI <em>per se </em>provision in 1995, including materials from legislative committees, the Task Force on Drunk and Drugged Driving, and Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD). The Court concluded that the legislative history established that DUI <em>per se </em>was enacted as a separate offense in the statutory scheme to permit an intoxicated driving conviction based solely on blood alcohol content, as an alternative to the fact finder having to rely on the more subjective behavioral evidence necessary to prove intoxicated driving. <em>See id. </em>at 519-24, 774 A.2d 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Because the two offenses are separate, the trial court was not required to merge appellant\u2019s <em>convictions </em>for DUI and DUI <em>per se. </em>Indeed, appellant\u2019s trial counsel acknowledged as much at sentencing, stating that \u201cCount 3, the 21-902(a)(2), and the 21-902(a)(l), do not merge. They are distinct charges with separate elements.\u201d Nevertheless, whether appellant\u2019s DUI <em>per se sentence </em>must be merged into his DUI sentence is an analytically separate question. That is because, even when two offenses are separate under the required evidence test, in some circumstances multiple punishments may not be permitted in order to avoid a violation of the constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy. <em>See Abeokuto v. State, </em>391 Md. 289, 356, 893 A.2d 1018 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>The rule of lenity was explained by the Court of Appeals in <em>Monoker v. State, </em>321 Md. 214, 222-23, 582 A.2d 525 (1990):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB_\">The rule of lenity was originally formulated by the United States Supreme Court as a principle of statutory construction. The policy behind the rule is \u201cthat the Court will not interpret a ... criminal statute so as to increase the penalty that it places on an individual when such an interpretation can be based on no more than a guess as to what [the legislature] intended.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">(Internal citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Under the rule of lenity, \u201ca court will not impose multiple punishments but will, for sentencing purposes, merge one offense into the other,\u201d with \u201c \u2018the offense carrying the lesser maximum penalty ordinarily merg[ing] into the offense carrying the greater maximum penalty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Abeokuto, </em>391 Md. at 356, 893 A.2d 1018 (citation omitted). This judicially created rule governs construction of statutory offenses rather than common law crimes. <em>See id. </em>It applies when \u201cthere is no indication that the legislature intended multiple punishments for the same act[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>If there is uncertainty about whether the legislature intended multiple punishments for a single act, that doubt will be resolved against multiple sentences. <em>See id.; Monoker, </em>321 Md. at 222, 582 A.2d 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">In the instant case, we agree with appellant that his sentences for DUI and DUI <em>per se </em>should have been merged under the rule of lenity. Appellant\u2019s position presents an issue of first impression, because we have found no reported case addressing the propriety of consecutive sentences for DUI and DUI <em>per se </em>convictions arising out of a single act of driving. <em>Cf. Turner v. State, </em>181 Md.App. 477, 491, 956 A.2d 820 (2008) (no sentencing merger issue presented; there was no disposition on the DUI <em>per se </em>charge and thus \u201cnothing to merge at sentencing under the rule of lenity\u201d); <em>Brown v. State, </em>171 Md.App. 489, 504, 910 A.2d 571 (2006) (no sentencing merger issue presented; trial court merged DUI <em>per se </em>conviction into DUI conviction); <em>Meanor v. State, </em>134 Md.App. 72, 75, 758 A.2d 1124 (2000) (no sentencing merger issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>presented; DUI and DUI per <em>se were </em>merged by trial court for sentencing purposes), <em>rev\u2019d, on other grounds, </em>364 Md. 511, 774 A.2d 394 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">However, in <em>Jones, </em>357 Md. at 167, 742 A.2d 493, the Court of Appeals held that defendants Jones and Tederick could not receive consecutive sentences for two unlawful driving convictions in circumstances that we find instructively analogous to the issue before us. In <em>Jones, </em>the Court concluded that driving on a suspended license and driving on a revoked license, offenses established under different subsections of Trans. \u00a7 16-303, are separate offenses for purposes of conviction. But the Court separately addressed \u201cwhether Jones and Tederick may be punished twice when their conduct that triggered each charge was the same act, i.e., the single act of driving, and whether the Legislature intended multiple punishment for conduct arising out of a single act or transaction that violates two or more .. . subsections of the same statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163, 742 A.2d 493. Applying the established principle that, \u201c[e]ven where two offenses are separate under the required evidence test, there may still be merger for sentencing purposes based on historical treatment, judicial decisions which hold the offenses merge, fairness, and the rule of lenityt,]\u201d the Court concluded that \u201cthe Legislature intended that punishment should be tied to the act of driving and only one sentence per driving episode [should] be permitted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164, 742 A.2d 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">In support of this construction of the statute, the Court cited the absence of any indication that the General Assembly intended that a single act of driving on an invalidated license could be punished by multiple consecutive sentences. <em>See id. </em>at 166, 742 A.2d 493. To the contrary, the Court treated the availability of sentencing enhancements, increasing the penalty for \u201csubsequent violations\u201d from one year to two years, as evidence that the legislature did <em>not </em>anticipate that a single act of driving on a license that had been both suspended and revoked vTOuld result in consecutive sentences. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Characterizing this type of repeat offender sentencing scheme as \u201ca clear expression of legislative intent that persons convicted of multiple offenses during a single driving episode not suffer cumulative punishments,\u201d the <em>Meanor </em>Court reasoned that, \u201c[i]f a subsequent offense may not be punished by more than two years, it follows that cumulative or consecutive sentences for multiple violations of \u00a7 16-303 was not intended.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ultimately, the Court ruled, \u201cat the very least, doubt exists as to whether the General Assembly intended such multiple punishment!,]\u201d so that the sentences had to be merged \u201cunder the rule of lenity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167, 742 A.2d 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The Court quoted favorably the comments of Judge Moylan, writing for this Court in <em>Tederick v. State, </em>125 Md.App. 37, 45, 723 A.2d 917, <em>aff'd sub nom. Jones v. State, </em>357 Md. 141, 742 A.2d 493 (1999), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">[t]he common denominator to all of the forms the offense may take is that a defendant drove a motor vehicle on a Maryland highway after his privilege to drive had been invalidated. The unit of prosecution is the act of driving.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARF\"><em>See Jones, </em>357 Md. at 152, 742 A.2d 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">We conclude that, like the driving on an invalidated license offense construed in <em>Jones </em>and <em>Tederick, </em>\u201c \u2018[t]he unit of prosecution\u2019 \u201d for the intoxicated driving offenses in subsections 21-902(a)(1) and (2) \u201c \u2018is the act of driving.\u2019 \u201d <em>See id. </em>An analogous \u201csingle act of driving\u201d interpretation of the statute for sentencing purposes is appropriate here, given the repeat offender sentencing scheme available for intoxicated driving convictions, and the absence of any indication that the legislature intended that a person convicted of both DUI and DUI <em>per se, </em>based on one uninterrupted driving episode, could face consecutive sentences for violating both subsections of 21-902(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">As in <em>Jones, </em>the statutory sentencing scheme increasing punishment for subsequent intoxicated driving convictions is a \u201cclear expression of legislative intent that persons convicted of multiple offenses during a single driving episode not suffer cumulative punishments,\u201d because \u201c[i]f a subsequent offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>may not be punished by more than two years, it follows that cumulative or consecutive sentences for multiple violations ... was not intended.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 166, 742 A.2d 493. Moreover, as in <em>Jones, </em>there is nothing in the language or history of \u00a7 21-902(a) from which we could conclude that, in adding DUI <em>per se </em>to the existing DUI offense, the General Assembly intended to authorize such multiple punishment in cases where a single act of intoxicated driving results in both DUI and DUI <em>per se </em>convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">This scenario materially differs from cases in which consecutive sentences have been approved for use of a dangerous or deadly weapon during the commission of another offense, because in those situations the legislature has unambiguously indicated, in both the statute and its legislative history, that multiple punishments are justified on an \u201caggravation\u201d theory that treats such weapon use as increasing the seriousness of the offense and the culpability of the offender. <em>See, e.g., Eldridge v. State, </em>329 Md. 307, 318-20, 619 A.2d 531 (1993) (recognizing that legislature has authorized multiple punishments for use of a handgun in the commission of an armed robbery under an \u201caggravating factor\u201d rationale, but holding that the legislature has not authorized consecutive sentences for merely carrying a weapon during the commission of a robbery). No comparable \u201caggravation\u201d or \u201cincreased culpability\u201d justification exists in the instant case. Here, the multiple convictions merely reflect that the State established appellant\u2019s single episode of intoxicated driving by the introduction of both blood alcohol evidence and behavioral evidence. In this circumstance, as in <em>Jones and Tederick, </em>\u201cat the very least, doubt exists as to whether the General Assembly intended such multiple punishment.\u201d Thus, appellant was entitled to the merger of the DUI and DUI <em>per se </em>sentences under the rule of lenity. <em>See id. </em>at 167, 619 A.2d 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">We are not persuaded otherwise by the holding and rationale in <em>Meanor, </em>which the State mistakenly relies on as authority for the proposition that \u201cthe General Assembly intended multiple punishments.\u201d The legislative history cited by the State merely confirms that the same maximum penalty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>exists for the two offenses, without addressing whether such sentences may be made consecutive when they arise from the same act of intoxicated driving. The State\u2019s leap from the fact that DUI and DUI <em>per se </em>are separate offenses, and that a defendant may be convicted on both as a result of the same episode, to a conclusion that that defendant may be subject to consecutive sentences, is a misinterpretation of <em>Meanor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\"><em>Meanor </em>did not address the issue of multiple punishments for DUI and DUI <em>per se </em>convictions stemming from a single driving event because the trial court in that case merged the two offenses for sentencing purposes. <em>See Meanor, </em>134 Md. App. at 75, 758 A.2d 1124. In the Court of Appeals, Meanor challenged only his <em>convictions </em>for DUI and DUI <em>per se, </em>complaining that, because he was never cited for DUI <em>per se, </em>\u201cthe trial court erred in instructing the jury that he was intoxicated if his blood alcohol level was 0.10 or more\u201d and in permitting him to be convicted of DUI <em>per se. See Meanor, </em>364 Md. at 513, 774 A.2d 394. Thus, the Court of Appeals did not resolve whether a person properly convicted of both DUI and DUI <em>per se, </em>based on a single act of driving, should have those offenses merged for sentencing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">In this case, the issue of sentencing merger is squarely presented by the trial court\u2019s imposition of consecutive sentences on the DUI conviction and the DUI <em>per se </em>conviction. We hold that, when a defendant is convicted of both DUI and DUI <em>per se, </em>arising out of the same act of driving, the lesser sentence, in this case the one for DUI <em>per se, </em>merges into the greater sentence, in this case the sentence for DUI, under the rule of lenity. Therefore, we shall vacate the DUI <em>per se </em>sentence imposed on appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">JUDGMENTS OF CONVICTION FOR DRIVING WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL AND DRIVING WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL PER SE AFFIRMED; SENTENCE FOR DRIVING WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL PER SE VACATED.
