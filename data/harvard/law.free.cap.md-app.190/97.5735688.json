Eight months later, Longtin was released. Another man, Antonio Oesby, was charged with the crime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">On October 31, 2000, Longtin\u2019s lawyer sent to then-Prince George\u2019s County Executive Wayne Curry a notice of claim that stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">Pursuant to Md.Code Ann. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-304, Mr. Longtin hereby gives notice that he suffered injuries to his person and his property and was denied important rights guaranteed to him under the United States Constitution when he was arrested on October 5, 1999 by the Prince Georgefs] County Police Department, and thereafter incar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>cerated in Prince George[\u2019]s County for a period of months for a murder he clearly did not commit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The claim was apparently forwarded to the County\u2019s Office of Law, which received it on November 6, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Nearly a year later, on October 22, 2001, Longtin filed suit in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. In his 13-count complaint, he named as defendants, Prince George\u2019s County, it\u2019s then-Chief of Police, John Farrell, and 5 members of the Criminal Investigation Division (CID) of the County Police Department: Troy Harding, Ronald Herndon, Bert Frankenfield, Glen Clark and Michael McQuillan. Longtin alleged that the defendants\u2019 actions violated two provisions of the Maryland Declaration of Rights (Articles 21 and 24)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> constituted false imprisonment, false arrest and malicious prosecution, intentionally inflicted emotional distress, invaded his privacy and portrayed him in a false light, intentionally misrepresented material facts, amounted to negligence, and resulted in negligent detention. The complaint also asserted, among other things, that the individual defendants had engaged in a pattern or practice of \u201cunconstitutional and unlawful detention and interrogation\u201d and \u201cexcessive force and brutality,\u201d which the County had tolerated, encouraged and instigated by allegedly failing to \u201cproperly train, prosecute, supervise and discipline its officers.\u201d Longtin also sought injunctive relief prohibiting improper interrogations and imposing certain procedural safeguards on those interrogations. In addition, he alleged a civil conspiracy by which the defendants \u201cagreed and jointly acted in ... unconstitutional and unlawful conduct.\u201d Finally, Longtin sought a declaratory judgment \u201cthat the detaining and interrogation of the plaintiff as well as the on-going pattern and practice of detaining individuals and conducting interrogations in the manner de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>tailed herein violate[d] Maryland Rule 4-212 and the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">An allegation generally repeated in many of the counts stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\">As a direct result of [Defendants\u2019] deprivations, Plaintiff was subjected to excessive interrogation totaling 38 hours, deprived of sleep and privacy, harassed, humiliated, and subjected to undue infliction of emotional distress. The CID Defendants attempted] to coerce Longtin to make a false confession, and thereafter falsified a confession, resulting in Longtin\u2019s incarceration for eight months, while Defendants ignored and/or neglected the exculpatory evidence in their possession.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">In 12 of the 13 counts, the complaint sought $10 million in compensatory damages and $50 million in punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">The County and the individual defendants filed separate, boilerplate answers. However, the County\u2019s answer specifically noted that \u201c[p]laintiffs claim is barred by the required notice provisions\u201d and the individuals\u2019 consolidated answer stated that the \u201cclaims are barred by the provisions of section 5-304 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings [A]rticle.... \u201d The defendants sought to raise the notice of claim issue in various motions, including motions for summary-judgment, but their contentions were ultimately rejected by the circuit court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">After some claims fell out, including some counts against the County, and the Chief of Police and Detective McQuillan were dropped as parties, the trial began in August of 2006. The case was submitted to the jury on eight counts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On August 31, 2006, the jury returned a verdict in Longtin\u2019s favor on all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>eight counts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It then awarded $5.2 million in compensatory damages against the County.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In addition, Hardy, Frankenfield and Clark were each assessed $275,000 in punitive damages and Herndon was assessed $350,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">On September 11, 2006, the County and the officers filed a Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict and/or for New Trial and/or to Exercise Revisory Power. They argued that 1) there was no authority for Longtin\u2019s \u201cpattern and practice\u201d claim; 2) the jury instruction on his due process claim under Article 24 was insufficient; 3) the $200,000 property damage award should have been reduced to reflect the evidence at trial; and 4) the damage awards should be limited by the caps in the LGTCA, C &amp; JP \u00a7 5-303 and in C &amp; JP \u00a7 11-108 (limitations on non-economic damages). Longtin opposed the motion, asserting, among other things, that even if the defense\u2019s first two arguments were correct, the errors were harmless and that \u00a7 11-108\u2019s damage cap did not apply to intentional torts such as those involved here. In addition, he asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">The Local Government Tort Claims Act (\u201cLGTCA\u201d) does not cap the damages here because, at the time of the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>giving rise to this case, the cap did not apply to constitutional claims. <em>See Housing Auth. v. Bennett, </em>359 Md. 356, 754 A.2d 367 (2000).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">A hearing was held on the motions, where argument was confined to those issues specified in the written motion. Subsequently, in an order dated August 31, 2007, the circuit court denied the motions for judgment notwithstanding verdict and for new trial, but with respect to the motion to revise, the court granted it in part and denied in part. Specifically, the court reduced the property damage award to $25,000, reduced Herndon\u2019s punitive damages to $50,000 and, \u201c[u]pon reconsideration\u201d of appellants\u2019 motion for judgment at trial, vacated the punitive damage awards assessed against the remaining defendants because of insufficient evidence of actual malice. Relying on Longtin\u2019s arguments, the court rejected the contention that the statutory caps applied in this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The County and the officers noted their appeal and Longtin cross-appealed on the punitive damages ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">QUESTIONS PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">In this appeal, appellants have raised the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">1. Whether the trial court erred in denying Appellants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment on 12 of 13 Counts in Appellee\u2019s Complaint for failure to comply with the notice provisions of the LGTCA, and/or not applying the Act\u2019s limitation on damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">2. Whether the trial court erred in allowing Appellee to advance a <em>\u201cMonell [v. Dept. of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978) ] type\u201d theory of liability against a municipality based on a \u201cpattern and practice\u201d violation under the Maryland Constitution, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>no such claim has been previously recognized in Maryland and, if adopted, there was insufficient evidence for such a finding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-4\">8. Whether the trial court erred during its evidentiary rulings allowing testimony of DNA testing along with the crimes and conviction of another individual after the determination of probable cause; permitting testimony of other interviews or interrogations; and limiting hearsay to establish probable cause for an arrest and detention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\">4. Whether the trial court erroneously instructed the jury regarding the law as it relates to claims for a due process claim; pattern and practice; that probable cause is to be judged at the time of arrest; intentional infliction of emotional distress; the authority to terminate a prosecution; and the definition of malice for punitive damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">On cross-appeal, appellee raises this question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">Did the trial court improperly reduce the punitive damages in this matter <em>sua sponte </em>without first providing notice or an opportunity to be heard to the parties?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">For reasons set forth below, we affirm the jury verdict as modified by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">On October 5, 1999, Longtin called the Prince George\u2019s County Police to report that his estranged wife was missing. At that time, the police had already discovered Zinetti\u2019s body and CID considered her husband a suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">A note from Detective Harding to Detective Herndon expressed police reaction to the call:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-12\">RON: Your V\u2019s husband called Dist. VI for check on the welfare. Det. Lloyd played along and took m/p info.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-13\">He made statement to her about the V being sexually assaulted at knifepoint in the past.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-14\">He is working somewhere in DC tomorrow. He agreed to meet Lloyd at 1500 hrs. at Dist. VI in order to \u201csign the m/p report.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Good luck:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\">Get him!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">\n<em>Troy[</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>10</em>\n</footnotemark>\n<em>]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Later on October 5, 1999, Longtin, after learning of a media report of a woman\u2019s body found near Zinetti\u2019s apartment, arrived at the yellow-taped crime scene. He asked a police officer about his wife and the officer, after calling in to his supervisor and being informed of Longtin\u2019s identity, told appellee to get into his police cruiser.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> He was then taken into an interrogation room in Landover.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Over the next day and a half, Longtin was questioned on a rotating basis by at least six different officers.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Police records showed that he slept only 50 minutes during that 38-hour period.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> At 8:55 p.m. on October 5th, Longtin signed an \u201cAdvice of Rights and Waiver Form\u201d indicating, among other things, that he had a right to talk to a lawyer and that he was willing to make a statement \u201cat this time\u201d without a lawyer. When asked at trial why he signed this document, Longtin said he had been told by officers \u201cIf I had nothing to hide or worry about, I would sign those rights, so I said \u2018Well, I have nothing to hide,\u2019 so I signed them.\u201d Although all of the detectives testified at trial that Longtin did not ask for a lawyer, Longtin testified that during the questioning he told officers that he wanted to talk to a lawyer and his cell phone records showed that he tried to call two different lawyers from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>the interrogation room. Appellants claimed that Longtin was not under arrest or in custody until the conclusion of the interrogation and thus, he did not have to receive warnings pursuant to <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), and the clock did not begin ticking on the 24-hour deadline of Md. Rule 4-212 for presenting him to a district court commissioner. However, the officers took his belt, wallet, shoelaces and cell phone and, according to Long-tin, threatened him with violence when he indicated he wanted to leave, and, at one point, handcuffed him to the wall. Appellant was asked \u201cwhat if\u201d questions about the murder, such as: \u201c[Wjhat if you had done this murder? [W]hat do you think would have happened?\u201d He was shown photographs of his dead wife.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">According to the notes of Sgt. Clark, Longtin admitted to having a verbal and physical altercation with his wife on October 3, 1999, 14 hours before her body was found. Clashing over her alleged extra-marital affair, he said he pushed her down. He stated that then he went into the kitchen, got a knife and ran after her when she left to go jogging, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t kill her.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">On October 7, 1999, Longtin was formally arrested, taken before a commissioner, and charged with murdering Donna Zinetti, an action appellant later contended violated Md. Rule 4-212(f)(l).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> A Statement of Probable Cause completed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>Detective Herndon said that Longtin \u201cvolunteered\u201d to come in and talk to police about his wife\u2019s death. The Statement recited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-4\">While interviewing the Defendant,] he was developed as a suspect. At that point the Defendant] was advised [of] his constitutional rights and subsequently admitted to be[ing] involved in this case. The defendant admitted to having a verbal and physical altercation at the victim\u2019s apartment. The defendant gave details about this case that had not been related to the media and only the perpetrator would have known. He stated that during the altercation the victim ran out of her apartment and that he ran after her with a knife. The defendant knew that the victim had been stabbed several times and that the stabbing occurred in the wooded area near the victim\u2019s apartment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">At trial, Longtin asserted that the Statement of Probable Cause was false, <em>viz. </em>that he never admitted his involvement in the case and that details of the murder were given to him by the police or were publicly available and thus were not known \u201conly [by] the perpetrator.\u201d He also emphasized that this charging document deliberately omitted appellant\u2019s repeated declaration in interrogation: \u201c[B]ut I didn\u2019t kill her.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Long-tin\u2019s attorney in the criminal case, Samuel Serio, conferred with the State\u2019s Attorney Office and was told that appellant faced a \u201cdouble life\u201d sentence in connection with the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The police took DNA samples from Longtin to compare with those left by the perpetrator of the crime. On January 14, 2000, Meredith Monroe of the Maryland Police Crime Laboratory spoke to Detective Herndon and told him that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Longtin had been excluded as a possible donor of the DNA taken from the victim. This exculpatory information was not shared with the State\u2019s Attorney or Longtin\u2019s counsel. No steps were taken to release appellee. Detective Herndon also told Monroe that he would provide her with DNA from Oesby, but waited two more months before requesting testing.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">On June 12, 2000, Detective Herndon advised the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office that the DNA found on Zinetti matched Oesby, and Longtin was released. During his incarceration, Longtin lost three automobiles. He was evicted from his apartment and his possessions were left on the curb. In the detention center, he was attacked by an inmate, and placed in a mass bunk in the middle of the floor with female guards watching him use the restroom. He was not permitted to attend his wife\u2019s funeral. As the trial judge noted when ruling on appellants\u2019 post-trial motions, Longtin left County custody \u201cwith little more than the clothes on his back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Longtin sought to establish his \u201cpattern and practice\u201d claim against the County in a variety of ways. He set forth evidence through Detective Herndon that sleep deprivation was a \u201ctool\u201d of investigation that he had been trained to use.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Admitted into evidence was an interview and interrogation training manual of the Prince George\u2019s County Community Police Institute that told officers they could read a suspect his rights \u201cor wait until after he admits.\u201d The manual stated that the interrogator should consider handcuffing an angry suspect to the wall \u201cand let [him] sit a while.\u201d Officers were advised to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>\u201cwait out\u201d a passive suspect because \u201cfew people can keep it up.\u201d If a suspect \u201cis so convincing that you are starting to believe him ... [l]eave the room [and] [d]on\u2019t go back unless you re-fortify your conviction that he is guilty.\u201d Detective Kerry Jerningan testified that it was departmental policy that police did not necessarily have to take the suspect before a district court commissioner within 24 hours if the suspect was continuously providing information, and confirmed that a police training manual described Md. Rule 4\u2014212(f)(1) as \u201c[a] Maryland procedural rule, not law\u201d that could be waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">There was testimony regarding other \u201clengthy interrogations,\u201d one lasting 72 hours, and the interrogation, confession and confinement of a developmentally-disabled minor who was released when another person was convicted of the offense. One of appellee\u2019s experts, William Katsaris, a police consultant and trainer, opined that in Longtin\u2019s case, one or more of the officers violated commonly accepted police practices by using sleep deprivation,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> denying the suspect a lawyer, physically threatening him, \u201cshoving into his face\u201d pictures of his dead wife, violating the 24-hour presentment rule, and asserting that probable cause existed to charge Longtin in the absence of physical evidence and in the face of his declaration of innocence. He also found fault in the failure to release Longtin after the DNA results were in, noting that when you find out you have an innocent man in jail, you have to get in your car and go get him out.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Appellants\u2019 expert, William Wagner, a police training consultant, sharply disagreed with Katsaris, crediting the police log over Longtin\u2019s testimony. The expert concluded that the police had acted properly. He said that probable cause existed to arrest Longtin and that when he was interrogated, he was never in custody (even though escorted to the bathroom by two officers and stripped of his belt, wallet and cell phone) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>and was free to leave or consult his attorney.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The jury found otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">1. State Constitutional Torts and LGTCA Requirements\u2014An Uneasy Fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The appellants argue that all but one of Longtin\u2019s successful claims are barred by the notice requirements of the LGTCA.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Appellants also contend that the approximately $5 million compensatory damage award cannot stand because it exceeds the monetary caps of the LGTCA.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The parties have battled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>over these defenses on many fronts. On the notice of claim issue, Longtin responds that: 1) the denial of appellants\u2019 summary judgment motion on this question was not reviewable on appeal after the case was tried by the jury; 2) because notice was timely on the malicious prosecution claim and Detective Herndon was found liable for this tort, under the \u201cgeneral verdict rule\u201d the jury was assumed to award under this count, and the County was thereafter fully liable for the entire amount of the compensatory damage award, regardless of whether the remaining claims were in compliance with notice requirements; 3) he substantially complied with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>notice requirements; 4) good cause existed to waive the notice requirements; 5) notice was not required because the individual appellants were acting outside the scope of their employment; 6) because the Prince George\u2019s County Charter had waived governmental immunity, notice was not required to impose liability on the County; and 7) the notice requirements did not apply to violations of State constitutional rights.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> On the damage caps contention, Longtin asserts: 1) the jury\u2019s finding of malice precluded application of the limits; 2) the damage award against the individual appellants was not capped; 3) because 2001 legislation purporting to cap damage claims against local governments could not retroactively impair the appellant\u2019s previously accrued claims, the caps did not apply in this case; and 4) the caps did not apply to any of the constitutional claims. Appellants urge rejection of all of these contentions. Thankfully, for reasons set forth below, we believe there is no need to address all or even most of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">The parties have devoted a great deal of attention to the question of whether the LGTCA\u2019s notice provision applies to State constitutional torts.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> This is understandable because the County was liable for the entire compensatory damage award and was determined to have engaged in two constitutional violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The Court of Appeals has consistently said that the LGTCA and the Maryland Tort Claims Act (MTCA), Md.Code (1984, 2009 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-101 of the State Government Article, <em>et seq., </em>do not exclude State constitutional torts from their coverage. <em>See, e.g., Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. 70, 107-08 n. 19, 660 A.2d 447 (1995); <em>Ritchie v. Donnelly, </em>324 Md. 344, 374 n. 14, 597 A.2d 432 (1991). <em>See also Thomas v. City of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number><em>Annapolis, </em>113 Md.App. 440, 457, 688 A.2d 448 (1997) (Stating that the LGTCA applies to \u201call torts without distinction, including intentional and constitutional torts\u201d). Less clear is whether the restrictions of those statutes that would defeat all or partial recovery apply in every respect to State constitutional torts. <em>See, e.g., Lee v. Cline, </em>384 Md. 245, 265 n. 4, 863 A.2d 297 (2004) (reserving issue of whether the damage caps of the MTCA can be applied to a monetary award for violations of the Maryland Constitution).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">On the one hand, the Court of Appeals has said that a State constitutional tort, such as one premised on a violation of a \u201cself-executing\u201d constitutional provision, like Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, is enforceable in a common law action for damages. <em>Benson v. State, </em>389 Md. 615, 631, 887 A.2d 525 (2005); <em>Widgeon v. Eastern Shore Hospital Center, </em>300 Md. 520, 536, 479 A.2d 921 (1984). In addition, a State constitutional tort action cannot be defeated by the assertion of official or local government immunity. <em>See Clea v.

In addition, in <em>Md. Reclamation Assoc. v.

Casey, </em>487 U.S. 131, 108 S.Ct. 2302, 101 L.Ed.2d 123 (1988). There, the Court held that a state tort claims act 4-month notice of claim requirement could not be applied to an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for violation of an individual\u2019s federal constitutional rights. <em>Id. </em>at 138, 108 S.Ct. 2302.

Pointing out the relative complexity of some constitutional claims, Justice Brennan said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-4\">[Mjany other deprivations, such as those involving denial of due process or of equal protection, will be far more subtle.

Moreover, if the four and six-month periods of <em>Felder </em>and <em>Burnett wave </em>deemed too short for a plaintiffs assertion of a 14th Amendment violation, it would seem to follow that the six-month notice of claim period of C &amp; JP \u00a7 o-304(b) is too short for the Maryland constitutional analog to the 14th Amendment\u2014Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">2. The Good Cause Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\"> Mindful of our obligation to avoid unnecessarily deciding constitutional questions, <em>see Davis v. State, </em>294 Md. 370, 377, 451 A.2d 107 (1982), including those premised on the inapplicability of a statute on constitutional grounds, we leave for another day the issue of whether it may or may not be possible to accommodate the special circumstances of State constitutional torts with the notice provisions of the LGTCA.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>We believe the notice of claim issue can be resolved on the much narrower ground decided by the circuit court, <em>viz. </em>that good cause existed to excuse timely compliance with regard to each of Longtin\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Although not raised by \u201cmotion\u201d as contemplated by subsection (d), Longtin, in repeated filings, sought to invoke the good cause exception, and the circuit court, by explicitly finding no prejudice to the appellants, clearly relied upon \u00a7 5-304(d) in rejecting their notice of claim defense.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> They contend that the circuit court\u2019s good cause finding is inconsistent with three cases: <em>Heron v. Strader, </em>861 Md. 258, 761 A.2d 56 (2000); <em>Wilbon, </em>172 Md.App. 181, 913 A.2d 678; <em>White, </em>163 Md.App. 129, 877 A.2d 1129. Each of these cases state that good cause exists when the claimant has presented his claim with the degree of diligence that an ordinary prudent person would have exercised under the same or similar circumstances. <em>Heron, </em>361 Md. at 271, 761 A.2d 56; <em>Wilbon, </em>172 Md.App. at 205, 913 A.2d 678; <em>White, </em>163 Md.App. at 150-51, 877 A.2d 1129. Each also notes the <em>Heron </em>factors, <em>i.e., </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>earmarks of good cause. <em>Heron, </em>361 Md. at 272, 761 A.2d 56; <em>Wilbon, </em>172 Md.App. at 205-06, 913 A.2d 678; <em>White, </em>163 Md.App. at 152, 877 A.2d 1129. These were summarized in <em>Wilbon:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-4\">excusable neglect or mistake (generally determined in reference to a reasonably prudent person standard), [2] serious physical or mental injury and/or location out-of-state, [3] the inability to retain counsel in cases involving complex litigation, ...

They also point to the holding in <em>Heron </em>that \u201cthe pendency of criminal proceedings\u201d against the claimant does not constitute good cause. 361 Md. at 272, 761 A.2d 56.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> In addition, in <em>White </em>and <em>Wilbon, </em>the presence of an ongoing police investigation into a brutality complaint did not excuse notice defectively given to the wrong entity. <em>White, </em>163 Md.App. at 157, 877 A.2d 1129; <em>Wilbon, </em>172 Md.App. at 210, 913 A.2d 678.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>These cases have little in common with the situation presented here. Longtin was not charged with burglary or a disorderly conduct offense, but murder in the first degree with the possibility of a double life sentence. Unlike Heron, he was not quickly released. Unlike White, he was not justifiably incarcerated, complaining of an ancillary constitutional violation. Longtin alleged and the jury found that agents of the County lied and withheld exculpatory DNA evidence to keep him incarcerated. If we assume that the 180-day notice period for most of the tort claims ran from the date he was arrested, he was not released until more than two months after the statutory period had expired. He was not made aware of the withholding of the DNA evidence\u2014a key component of the alleged due process violation\u2014until much later. Had Longtin filed his notice of claim in April 2000, while incarcerated, the false charges and the withholding of DNA evidence would likely have skewered any investigation or resolution of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Even if Longtin\u2019s State constitutional allegations were not factored into the equation, it is hard to disagree with the circuit court\u2019s determination that \u201cthe facts in this case are sufficient\u201d to defeat the appellants\u2019 notice defense.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> In short, an \u201cordinary prudent person\u201d in Longtin\u2019s position could not have given notice by the 180th day. Thus, we conclude that, even if notice on any or all of Longtin\u2019s claims against the County and the individual appellants were untimely, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in finding that good cause existed to excuse any delay.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>3. The LGTCA Damage Caps</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Our conclusion that it was not error for the jury to award damages against the County for violation of Longtin\u2019s constitutional right to due process does not resolve the issue of whether the amount of the compensatory damage award\u2014 $5,025,000\u2014was proper.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Appellants argue that under the LGTCA, the court was obligated to reduce the compensatory damages to $200,000. <em>See supra </em>n. 23. Among other things, Longtin contends that the statutory damage caps can never be applied to damages for violations of the State Constitution. While Longtin raises a serious question, <em>cf. Felder, </em>487 U.S. at 142, 108 S.Ct. 2302 (stating that a State law \u201cthat limits the amount recoverable in suits against local governments\u201d cannot apply in a federal civil rights action); <em>Lee, </em>384 Md. at 265 n. 4, 863 A.2d 297 (reserving issue of whether the MTCA damage caps can be applied to a State constitutional tort), we believe the correctness of the amount of the damages can be resolved on a narrower basis, <em>viz. </em>at the time Longtin\u2019s action accrued, the caps did not apply to damages from his State constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">In 1999 and 2000, during the period of Longtin\u2019s interrogation, arrest, incarceration and release, Prince George\u2019s County had no immunity, statutory or otherwise, from constitutional torts. <em>Housing Auth. of Baltimore City v. Crystal Bennett, </em>359 Md. 356, 368-69, 754 A.2d 367 (2000) (collecting cases). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number><em>Bennett, </em>which involved local governmental liability under State housing authority laws, the Court of Appeals noted: \u201cIt would not be a reasonable construction of the [LGTCA] ... to apply the monetary caps to tort actions directly against local governments when the bases for such actions are enactments of the General Assembly, state common law, the state constitution, or federal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 373-74, 754 A.2d 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">In direct response to the <em>Bennett </em>decision, the General Assembly in 2001 passed emergency legislation, which, according to its title, was intended to \u201c[clarify] that the monetary limits on the liability of a local government under the [LGTCA] apply to claims against local governments when named as defendants [and] that the monetary limits under the [LGTCA] apply to tort judgments for which local governments are liable.... \u201d Ch. 286, Laws of 2001 (HB 942). The legislation, which took effect upon the Governor\u2019s signature on April 20, 2001, reenacted without change C &amp; JP \u00a7 5-303, but provided in an uncodified Section 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">That it is the intent of the General Assembly that the total liability of a local government, directly or otherwise, in an action arising from tortious acts or omissions, may not exceed the limits on liability stated in \u00a7 5-303(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Finally, in an uncodified Section 3, the measure stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">That this Act shall apply to any claim for damages under \u00a7 5-303 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article in a case pending on the effective date of this Act and arising from events occurring on or after July 1,1987.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">The measure made no direct reference to constitutional torts.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">In bill review letters dated April 19 and April 23, 2001, Attorney General J. Joseph Curran, Jr. concluded that the legislation\u2019s retroactive application was \u201cconstitutionally defensible\u201d against a contention that it violated due process by interfering with a vested right in a cause of action. However, the April 23rd bill review letter noted that the Court of Appeals had agreed to hear <em>Dua v. Comcast, </em>360 Md. 485, 759 A.2d 230 (2000) (mem.) and that the outcome of that case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>\u201ccould have some bearing on the constitutionality of the retroactivity claimed in the bill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">The Attorney General\u2019s prediction was correct. In <em>Dua v. Comcast Cable of Md. Inc., </em>370 Md. 604, 805 A.2d 1061 (2002), the Court of Appeals said that \u201cthere normally is a vested property right in a cause of action which has accrued prior to the legislative action,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 633, 805 A.2d 1061, and invalidated two statutes that retroactively abrogated plaintiffs\u2019 \u201crights to particular sums of money\u201d as well as their \u201ccauses of action in pending cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 642, 805 A.2d 1061. Appellants might argue that <em>Dua </em>was a case involving retroactive abrogation of a cause of action, rather than retroactive imposition of a damage cap that merely reduced recovery. <em>Cf. Murphy v. Edmonds, </em>325 Md. 342, 362, 601 A.2d 102 (1992) (upholding the prospective imposition of non-economic damage caps in private litigation). However, pre-and post-i&gt;\u00ab.a cases recognize that the retroactive grant of governmental immunity \u201cmight transgress a vested right.\u201d <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Kim, </em>376 Md. 276, 296, 829 A.2d 611 (2003); <em>see also WSSC v. Riverdale Fire Co., </em>308 Md. 556, 569, 520 A.2d 1319 (1987) (stating that retroactive imposition of immunity \u201cwould cut off fully accrued causes of action for compensatory damages.\u201d). Here, what was at stake was a <em>fully </em>accrued cause of action for <em>complete </em>recovery for constitutional violations that were not previously subject to an assertion of either all or partial local government immunity. Undoubtedly, Longtin had a vested right in such a cause of action prior to the enactment of Chapter 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Appellants emphasize that the 2001 legislation was designed to be expressly retroactive to cases \u201carising from events occurring on or after July 1, 1987.\u201d However, as a matter of statutory construction, if not constitutional law, a statute, even if intended to apply retroactively, will not be given that effect if it would take vested rights. <em>Dua, </em>370 Md. at 628, 805 A.2d 1061; <em>see also WSSC, </em>308 Md. at 569, 520 A.2d 1319 (stating that a construction of a statute retroactively conferring governmental immunity to cut off fully accrued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>causes \u201cis to be avoided\u201d). Appellants\u2019 attempt to justify retroactive application of the 2001 legislation as \u201cremedial\u201d fails for the same reason. <em>See Langston v. Riffe, </em>359 Md. 396, 408, 754 A.2d 389 (2000) (stating that generally, a remedial statute may not be applied retroactively if it would interfere with vested or substantive rights); <em>WSSC, </em>308 Md. at 560, 520 A.2d 1319 (noting that the granting of immunity affects more than mere change of remedy).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">On the basis of these authorities, we conclude that, regardless of the later enactment of Chapter 286, at the time Longtin\u2019s claim had accrued, the LGTA damage caps (and the partial immunity they would have provided the County) did not apply to appellee\u2019s action for State constitutional violations. This is true whether the action was predicated on a <em>respondeat superior </em>theory or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">4. The Pattern or Practice Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The County challenges both the legal and evidentiary support for Longtin\u2019s \u201cpattern or practice\u201d claim, which he premised on a violation of Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Before addressing the County\u2019s contentions, we believe a brief history of these terms would be helpful. Generally, a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d claim falls into two categories.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The first type is a long-recognized remedy for unlawful employment discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>(and other federal antidiscrimination statutes).<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Such a suit focuses on multiple incidents of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>systematic discrimination against individuals in a protected class. <em>See, e.g., Gaston v. New York City Dept. of Health, </em>432 F.Supp.2d 321 (S.D.N.Y.2006). A second category is litigation under the 1871 federal Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Section 1983\u2019s focus on a local g'overnment\u2019s \u201cpolicies and customs\u201d came to establish a dividing line between <em>respondeat superior </em>immunity and what is often termed pattern or practice liability. <em>See Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 692-95, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). Thus, <em>Monell </em>spawned countless lawsuits aimed at allegedly unconstitutional municipal policies and customs, including those targeting systematic police misconduct. <em>See, e.g., Kammeyer v. City of Sharonville, </em>311 F.Supp.2d 653 (S.D.Ohio 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Noteworthy is Congress\u2019 enactment in 1994 of legislation governing law enforcement misconduct. This statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14141, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">(a) It shall be unlawful for any governmental authority, or any agent thereof, or any person acting on behalf of a governmental authority, to engage in a pattern or practice of conduct by law enforcement officers or by officials or employees of any governmental agency with responsibility for the administration of juvenile justice or the incarceration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>of juveniles that deprives persons of rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-4\">(b) Whenever the Attorney General has reasonable cause to believe that a violation of paragraph (1) has occurred, the Attorney General, for or in the name of the United States, may in a civil action obtain appropriate equitable and declaratory relief to eliminate the pattern or practice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOK\">According to the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s <em>Civil Rights Resource Manual, </em>at 5, this statute authorizes the Department to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">examine a wide variety of potential misconduct including: unnecessary use of deadly force; excessive force; discriminatory harassment; improper stops, searches, arrests, or failures to provide service based on impermissible criteria such as race, national origin, or gender; coercive sexual conduct; and retaliation against citizens alleging misconduct. Examples of departmental practices that may be actionable because they result in misconduct include: failure to investigate allegations of officer misconduct; failure to discipline officers who have engaged in misconduct; engaging in a code of silence to protect persons guilty of misconduct; and a failure to train personnel in proper law enforcement techniques.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">With this background in mind, we turn to the County\u2019s contentions. Appellant argues that nothing in the language of Article 24 or in Maryland caselaw gives rise to a state constitutional claim against a local government for an alleged pattern or practice violation. Reversing the dividing line in <em>Monell, </em>the County seems to contend that if a local government is liable for a constitutional tort on a <em>respondeat superi- or </em>theory, it cannot at the same time be liable for a pattern or practice violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">In our view, these arguments miss the mark. Just as a county ordinance can violate the state constitution, so too, in the words of \u00a7 1983, can a \u201cregulation, custom, or usage.\u201d In addition, given the almost uniquely expansive reach of Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>land\u2019s constitutional tort remedy, where no official or local governmental immunity is possible, <em>see </em>n. 27 and accompanying text, we think it highly unlikely that Article 24 contains any exemption from liability for an unconstitutional pattern or practice. Finally, we note that the Court of Appeals in <em>DiPino v. Davis, </em>354 Md. 18, 53, 729 A.2d 354 (1999), set forth the rationale for making local governments liable for the constitutional torts of their employees. Quoting favorably from <em>Brotan v. State, </em>89 N.Y.2d 172, 652 N.Y.S.2d 223, 674 N.E.2d 1129, 1142-43 (1996), it recognized that the government</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-4\">is appropriately held answerable for the acts of its officers and employees because it can avoid such misconduct by adequate training and supervision and avoid its repetition by discharging or disciplining negligent or incompetent employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">According to the U.S. Department of Justice, <em>see supra, </em>pp. 129-30, 988 A.2d at p. 39, violation of these duties can be trademarks of a pattern or practice of police misconduct.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> In our view, these deficiencies, when coupled with a record such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>as that presented here, can lead to liability by a local government for a violation of Article 24.[<footnotemark>46</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">The County contends that even if a pattern or practice claim exists under Article 24, there was insufficient evidence in this case to warrant liability. It asserts that Longtin presented no evidence of an unconstitutional policy, practice or custom that led to the constitutional injuries he suffered, and that he failed to prove anything more than a single instance of unconstitutional activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Although even a single decision by municipal \u201cpolicymakers\u201d can constitute a policy whose unconstitutionality can lead to liability, <em>see Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, </em>475 U.S. 469, 480, 106 S.Ct. 1292, 89 L.Ed.2d 452 (1986), there is some support for the County\u2019s contention that a single incident by a nonpolicymaking police officer cannot lead to Monell-type liability. <em>See Oklahoma City v. Tuttle </em>(plurality opinion); see also Civil Rights Resource Manual, supra at 5 (stating that proof of a \u201csingle, insignificant, isolated action would not justify a finding of a pattern or practice\u201d).<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> However, Longtin presented much more in support of his pattern or practice claim. He introduced evidence of lengthy interrogations of other individuals (of 60 hours and 72 hours); another dubious confession and erroneous incarceration; an official police training manual urging constitutionally questionable actions with respect to the conduct of interrogations, <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and the right to counsel, which the individual officers appeared to have followed \u201cby the book\u201d; expert testimony regarding violations of commonly-accepted police practices, evidence of serial violations of multiple constitutional rights by a number of offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>cers; <footnotemark>48</footnotemark> and a blurring of the line between presumptive innocence and pre-determined guilt. <em>See supra </em>pp. 113-15, 988 A.2d at pp. 29-30. The jury could have reasonably concluded that such evidence demonstrated a pattern or practice or a custom of unconstitutional police conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">5. Evidentiary Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The appellants complain of four evidentiary rulings of the trial court: 1) admission of DNA evidence regarding Longtin and Oesby; 2) introduction of evidence that Oesby was ultimately arrested and convicted; 3) introduction of other police interviews, interrogations, and the outcomes of other criminal cases to prove the pattern or practice claim; and 4) the limitation of hearsay testimony by appellants\u2019 expert witness regarding the existence of probable cause to arrest and detain Longtin. In our view, none of these evidentiary rulings warrants reversal of the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">We generally review a trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence under the abuse of discretion standard, giving more deference to the judge\u2019s discretionary weighing of relevance than a ruling premised on a pure conclusion of law. <em>Brown v. Daniel Realty Co., </em>409 Md. 565, 583, 976 A,2d 300 (2009). In addition, even if the evidentiary ruling was manifestly wrong, it will not be set aside unless the appellant can show the probability of prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 584, 976 A.2d 300. Finally, to preserve a challenge to the admission of evidence, ordinarily, a party must object each time the evidence is introduced. <em>Pulte Home Carp. v. Parex, Inc., </em>174 Md.App. 681, 763-64 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>B. DNA Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">In the circuit court, appellants filed a motion in limine to prohibit introduction of the DNA evidence because it was not available when the district court commissioner independently determined that probable cause existed to arrest and hold Longtin.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> This motion was denied. When the evidence was later disclosed in testimony, appellants made no further objection. Under these circumstances, the motion in limine will not preserve appellants\u2019 objection. <em>Pulte Home Corp., </em>174 Md.App. at 763, 923 A.2d 971.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Even if the issue had been preserved, Longtin contends that the DNA evidence was admissible to show that probable cause was destroyed. He points to <em>State v. Dett, </em>391 Md. 81, 94, 891 A.2d 1113 (2006), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">[T]he legal justification for the arrest based on the identity of the arrestee can dissipate over time. The detaining authority may come into possession of information, not known at the time of arrest or not known at some earlier point in the detention, which, by establishing that the person being detained is not, in fact, the person authorized to be detained, may cause the legal justification relating to identity to disappear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">In our view, this is one of a number of bases that would have justified the admission of the DNA results. The DNA evidence was exculpatory. The failure of Detective Herndon to disclose this evidence in January of 2000 and his delay in providing the Maryland Police Crime Laboratory with Oesby\u2019s DNA was clearly relevant to Longtin\u2019s constitutional claim. <em>State v. Williams, </em>392 Md. 194, 198, 896 A.2d 973 (2006) (stating that due process requires the State to disclose exculpatory evidence). Finally, we do not believe that the appellants\u2019 contention that the district court commissioner\u2019s determination of probable cause remains unassailable when Longtin has alleged and proven that the charging document was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>misleading and the testimony before the commissioner was false. <em>See supra </em>pp. 111-13, 988 A.2d at pp. 28-29. <em>See Davis v. DiPino, </em>121 Md.App. 28, 78, 708 A.2d 357 (1998) (A police officer is not automatically protected from liability for an unconstitutional arrest merely because a judicial officer ultimately determines to issue a warrant.), <em>aff'd. in part, vacated in part, </em>354 Md. 18, 729 A.2d 354 (1999); <em>Jones v. City of Chicago, </em>856 F.2d 985, 994 (7th Cir.1988) (\u201cIf police officers have been instrumental in the plaintiffs continued confinement or prosecution, they cannot escape liability by pointing to the decisions of prosecutors or grand jurors or magistrates to confine or prosecute him. They cannot hide behind the officials who they have defrauded.\u201d)'.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">For these reasons, we reject appellants\u2019 challenge to the circuit court\u2019s admission of the DNA evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Oesby\u2019s Arrest and Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">It would appear that the appellants\u2019 attack on the introduction into evidence of Oesby\u2019s arrest and conviction for Zinetti\u2019s murder was not preserved for the same reasons, discussed, <em>supra </em>at pp. 133-34, 988 A.2d at pp. 41-42. In any event, at the very least, such evidence was relevant to Long-tin\u2019s claim that he could not have been the murderer and that Oesby was the most likely suspect. <em>See supra </em>n. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">D. Other Crimes</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Contrary to appellants\u2019 objection, the admission of other police interviews, interrogations and the outcome of other criminal cases was clearly related to Longtin\u2019s pattern or practice claim, which we have previously determined to be both authorized and evidentially sufficient. <em>See </em>pp. 128-33, 988 A.2d at pp. 38-41. Nor were the individual officers harmed by the introduction of this evidence, because the trial court specifically instructed the jury to consider police interviews and interrogations in other cases only in connection with the pattern or practice claim against the County.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>E. Hearsay Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Noting that hearsay evidence is admissible to establish that police have probable cause to arrest, appellants argue that their expert was impermissibly limited in testifying regarding notes in Detective Herndon\u2019s case file of hearsay statements of certain persons about Longtin\u2019s alleged propensity for violence. None of the officers testified that this hearsay formed the basis for probable cause and it did not find its way into the Statement of Probable Cause. Nevertheless the court conditionally allowed the expert to make some reference to this information in the file, noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">I\u2019m concerned about the second and third level hearsay we\u2019re about to get into, which I don\u2019t think is admissible that way. Now, if he wants to say there was some violent propensity that the Police had investigated or had knowledge of it, I may let him say that, but that\u2019s conditioned on you bringing the witnesses in here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">Counsel for appellants then stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">Yes Your Honor. And in which case, I guess, I\u2019m going down that road. If that\u2019s the limitation Your Honor is giving me, then, that\u2019s where I\u2019m going.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Eventually, the expert testified about the statements in the investigatory file, but the witnesses were never identified nor called to testify. Under these circumstances, we do not see how appellants can complain about the trial judge\u2019s fair-minded response to what could have been viewed as speculative and highly prejudicial hearsay evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">For these reasons, we find no error in the court\u2019s evidentiary rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>6. Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Appellants contend that the trial judge erroneously instructed the jury in six instances. Specifically, they urge us to find errors in instructions on due process, the pattern or practice claim, probable cause, the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, the termination of prosecution element of the malicious prosecution claim and the malice requirement for punitive damages. For reasons set forth below, we reject these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">In <em>Wegad v. Howard St. Jewelers, </em>826 Md. 409, 414, 605 A.2d 123 (1992), the Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">[T]o rule upon the propriety of denying a requested jury instruction, a reviewing court must determine whether the requested instruction was a correct exposition of the law, whether that law was applicable in light of the evidence before the jury, and finally whether the substance of the requested instruction was fairly covered by the instruction actually given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-8\"><em>See also </em>Md. Rule 2-520(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">When considering the adequacy of jury instructions, we examine the charge as a whole. <em>Blanchfield v. Dennis, </em>292 Md. 319, 322, 438 A.2d 1830 n. 3 (1982). Tn addition, under Md. Rule 2-520(e), \u201cno party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless the party objects on the record promptly after the court instructs the jury, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Finally, the burden of showing reversible error and prejudice from an instruction rests with the complaining party. <em>London v. Zorn, </em>389 Md. 206, 225, 884 A.2d 142 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>B. Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The circuit court instructed the jury that for Longtin to prevail he had to show that the appellants\u2019 denial of due process \u201cshock[ed] the conscience].\u201d The trial judge elaborated on this instruction by grounding it in the allegations of the case.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Appellants do not contend that the \u201cshock the conscience\u201d test is an erroneous standard for determining a substantive due process violation. <em>See Rochin v. California, </em>342 U.S. 165, 172, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952). Rather, they assert that the court should have amplified the instruction along the lines they had proposed in order to emphasize that the unconstitutional conduct must be \u201cbrutal\u201d and \u201cinhumane,\u201d which they characterize as a \u201chigh[er] level of culpability.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\u201cShock the conscience\u201d already denotes a very high standard of culpability<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> and is so elemental a formulation that further refinement might only confuse a jury. In our view, appellants\u2019 rejected instruction was \u201cfairly covered\u201d by the instruction given. Md. Rule 2-520(c).<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>C. Pattern or Practice</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">The trial judge gave the following instruction on the pattern or practice claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants implemented a policy and practice of endorsing and encouraging unlawful and unconstitutional conduct. To succeed in a claim for a pattern or practice of improper conduct, a Plaintiff must establish an unconstitutional pattern of conduct, including incidents other than ones involving the Plaintiff, to give rise to the inference that an unconstitutional custom, policy, or practice exists or the Plaintiff must show other evidence of the actual unconstitutional policy. When a Plaintiff chooses to challenge a County\u2019s unconstitutional policy by establishing a widespread practice, more than one violation must be shown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">Whether an official practice or custom exists is a question of fact for you to determine. A practice or custom is a persistent, widespread course of conduct by municipal officials (or employees) that has become a traditional way of carrying out policy, and has acquired the force of law, even though the municipality has not formally adopted or announced the custom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Appellants challenge this instruction because it does not contain some elements of their proposed instruction, <em>viz. </em>knowledge of municipal officials of the unconstitutional custom or usage, their deliberate indifference to correction, and a causal connection between this knowledge and lack of correction and the specific violation. In our view, however, the court\u2019s instruction was both accurate and sufficiently detailed, given the nascent state of this cause of action in Maryland. We reject appellants\u2019 invitation to use a barely-briefed battle over instructions<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> to resolve still-debated issues over the details of this cause of action. <em>See </em>supra n. 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>We find that the court\u2019s instruction \u201cfairly covered\u201d that proposed by the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">D. Probable Cause</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Appellants assert that the circuit court improperly instructed the jury on the proper definition of probable cause.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">At one point in the instructions, the court defined probable cause as \u201cknowledge of facts and circumstances that would lead a reasonable person to believe the Plaintiff had committed the offense.\u201d This definition was taken from the Maryland Pattern Civil Jury Instructions for false imprisonment and arrest. <em>See </em>MPJI-Cv 15:6e.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Appellants complain that the following definition was not given:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-8\">Probable cause [is] measured by the circumstances as they reasonably appeared to [the officer] at the time when he initiated action. It is not dependent upon the actual state of the case as it may turn out upon subsequent investigation. The ultimate innocence of the arrestee is not determinative of the legitimacy of his arrest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">This proposed instruction was not entirely accurate because a malicious prosecution includes both the starting or \u201ccontinuing\u201d of a criminal proceeding without probable cause. MPJI-Cv 17:1. Moreover, the instruction viewed as a whole empha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>sized the situation as it existed at the \u201cstart\u201d or \u201cinstigation\u201d of the proceeding. <em>See </em>MPJI-Cv 17:2 and MPJI-Cv 17:4.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Appellants have not met their burden in showing that their proposed instruction was not \u201cfairly covered\u201d by the court\u2019s instruction or that they suffered any prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">E. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Although the circuit court followed the Maryland Pattern Civil Jury Instructions with respect to the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress, MPJI-Cv 15:11, appellants contend that the instruction should have added that Longtin was required to show that he suffered \u201ca severely disabling emotional response\u201d to appellants\u2019 conduct. However, the pattern instruction requires that the emotional distress be \u201csevere.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Thus, we do not see how the appellants\u2019 proffered instruction was not fairly covered by the court\u2019s instruction or how they could show prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">F. Termination of Prosecution</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Appellants assert that the circuit court should have given the malicious prosecution instruction that \u201c[o]nly [t]he State\u2019s Attorney may terminate a prosecution on a charge and dismiss the charge by entering a nolle prosequi on the record in open court.\u201d This is not a completely accurate description of how a prosecution may be terminated. <em>See </em>Comment B.2. to MPJI-Cv 17:1. Thus, there was no error in rejecting appellants\u2019 proposed instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">G. Malice / Punitive Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">Appellants argue that the trial court should have added to the Maryland Pattern Civil Jury Instruction statements regarding punitive damages generally, MPJI-Cv 10:13, and malicious prosecution specifically, MPJI-Cv 10:18, particularly to specify that \u201c[p]unitive damages can only be awarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>upon the showing of actual malice, which is characterized by-fraud, ill will, spite, evil motive, conscious wrongdoing or intention to injure.\u201d Noteworthy is the trial court\u2019s instruction regarding malice in the context of \u201cstate torts\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\">A police officer is not responsible for any State tort unless the Officer acted with malice toward that person. Malice exists when the officer intended to inflict an injury and. acted with improper motivation or with ill will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">Malice is the performance of an act without legal justification or excuse and with an evil or rancorous motive influenced by hate, the purpose of which is to deliberately and willfully injure another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The verdict sheet also clearly required the jury to find malice before awarding punitive damages. Viewing the instructions as a whole, we believe they fairly covered appellants\u2019 proposed instruction. Nor do we find that they suffered any prejudice from this or any other challenged instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">H. Reduction of Punitive Damages</p>\n<p id=\"AeC\">Longtin has cross-appealed the August 31, 2007 order of the circuit court reducing the punitive damages awarded by the jury against the individual officers. The issue presented by appellant is a narrow one: \u201cDid the trial court improperly reduce punitive damages ... <em>sua sponte </em>without first providing notice or an opportunity to be heard on the issue?\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> The question is a troubling one. Although the circuit court appeared to suggest it should have granted a motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>judgment of three of the officers on the punitive damages issue,<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> the appellants made no such argument at the time. Nor did they ask for a reduction in the punitive damage award in their post-trial motions. In addition, although there was a hearing on these motions, neither court nor counsel mentioned the excessiveness of the punitive damage awards. If the court had used the device of a remittur/new trial under Md. Rule 2-533, <em>see Battista v. Savings Bank of Baltimore, </em>67 Md.App. 257, 273, 507 A.2d 203 (1986), to address the excessiveness of damages, it would have had to hold a hearing on the issue.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> However, because the court reduced damages via a motion to revise under Md. Rule 2-535(a), even the hearing requirement of the rules would not have been triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Longtin argues that because he has a vested property right in the judgment under Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>of Rights, due process would mandate notice and an opportunity to be heard before the court could reduce the punitive damage awards, <em>sua sponte. </em>It may be true that in some instances due process requirements apply to sua sponte judicial actions. <em>See, e.g., Riffin v. Baltimore County, </em>190 Md. App. 11, 985 A.2d 612 (2010) (holding that a circuit court may issue a prefiling order <em>sua sponte </em>against a vexatious litigant, but must afford notice and an opportunity to be heard). However, the timely filing of appellants\u2019 post-trial motions robbed the judgment of its finality and invested in the court the broad and well-established authority to revise its judgment <em>sua sponte. See PSC v. Wilson, </em>389 Md. 27, 43-45, 882 A.2d 849 (2005). In short, under these circumstances, there can be no vested right in a non-final punitive damage award free of the exercise of a circuit court\u2019s revisory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Longtin argues that his constitutional argument is supported by the decision of this Court in <em>Mona v. Mona Elec. Group, Inc., </em>176 Md.App. 672, 934 A.2d 450 (2007). There, we upheld the power of a circuit court to revise its judgment, <em>sua sponte, </em>and reduce a damage award. It so happened in that case the trial judge raised the issue at a hearing on a JNOV motion, then continued the proceeding to give the parties the opportunity to brief the question before ruling. <em>Id. </em>at 684, 934 A.2d 450. This was probably a wise course of action in <em>Mona </em>and would have been so here. However, nothing in <em>Mona </em>suggests that this procedure was constitutionally required.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">More clearly established is that the due process right Longtin seeks to assert is the constitutional obligation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>trial court to scrutinize a punitive damage award. Judicial review of a punitive damage award is a requirement of procedural due process. <em>Bowden v. Caldor, Inc., </em>350 Md. 4, 25, 710 A.2d 267 (1998). Thus, it could not have been completely unforeseeable that the circuit court would consider the question.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> We also note that although the punitive damage reduction was not mentioned in appellants\u2019 post-trial filings, the key component of malice was an omnipresent issue in the case and appellants\u2019 counsel argued at length against the punitive damage award in his closing argument.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">Finally, we note that after the awards were reduced, Long-tin did not file a motion to alter or amend that judgment under Md. Rule 2-534 and request a hearing on the propriety of the punitive damages reduction. For all of these reasons, we do not believe the circuit court erred when, <em>sna sponte, </em>it revised the judgment to reduce the punitive damages award, without providing Longtin notice and an opportunity to be heard on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Thus, we find that the trial court committed no reversible error. Although we affirm the reduction of the punitive damage awards, we leave standing the $5,025,000 compensatory damage award against the County and the $50,000 punitive damage award against appellant Herndon.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

Although the parties state that Longtin was released from custody on June 12, 1999, the docket entries disclose that appellant was freed on June 13, 2000, after a circuit judge set his bond at personal recognizance. It was not until November 16, 2000, that his criminal case was <em>nol prossed. </em>On June 21, 2001, Oesby, a serial rapist, was convicted of Zinetti's murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b127-7\">. Article 21 provides that \"in all criminal prosecutions, every man hath a right ... to be allowed counsel....\" Article 24 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">That no man ought to be taken or imprisoned or disseized of his freehold, liberties or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled, or, in any manner, destroyed, or deprived of his life, liberty or property, but by the judgment of his peers, or by the Law of the land.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b128-9\">. At a January 24, 2003 hearing, Judge Lamasney said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-10\">I'm going to deny the motion on the basis of untimely notice. I think the facts in this case are sufficient. I don't find any prejudice to the county and I am going to deny the motion on that basis.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b128-11\">. According to docket entries, the defense moved for judgment at the conclusion of Longtin's case and again at the conclusion of the entire case. Both motions were denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b129-6\">. The verdict sheel consisted of special interrogatories on each defendant's liability, an entry for a general verdict for compensatory damages, and entries with respect to each defendant\u2019s liability for punitive damages. According to this verdict sheel, Prince George's County was found liable for two constitutional violations: the Article 24 count and the pattern and practice claim. Each of ihe remaining individual defendants was also found liable for two constitutional violations (Article 24 and civil conspiracy), as well as false imprisonment, intenlional infliction of emotional distress, and privacy invasion/false light. Detective Herndon was also found liable for false arrest and malicious prosecution. With respect to the common law torts, the jury specifically found that each individual defendant \"acted with malice.\" In addition, the jury found that each officer acted \u201cintentionally\u201d in violation of I.ongtin's constitutional rights and in inflicting emotional distress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b129-7\">. Of this amount, $5 million was designated as non-economic damages and $200,000 was labeled property damages.

The court made no mention of Longtin's claims for declaratory and injunctive relief. In light of the substantial relief obtained by Longtin and the passage of time, we believe these claims either have been abandoned or rendered moot or their present adjudication would serve no useful purpose. <em>See Hamilton v. McAuliffe, </em>277 Md. 336, 340, 353 A.2d 634 (1976) (Declaratory judgment may not be granted when it would not serve a useful purpose.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b132-8\">.

However, in <em>Benson v.

As far as State constitutional torts are concerned, the MTCA and LGTCA differ as to their theories of immunity and liability. Unlike the MTCA, which makes an immune entity, the State, liable while statutorily immunizing employees, the LGTCA makes non-immune local governments liable for judgments obtained against employees who are not protected from suit, but are immunized from the execution of a judgment. Under the LGTCA, employees can still assert common law or statutory immunities as a defense.

In at least three cases, this Court, without comment, has applied notice of claim requirements to claims that included State constitutional violations. <em>See Wilbon v.

Thus, he argues that we need only find this malicious prosecution claim to be timely to uphold the entire compensatory damage award. Although the general verdict rule may be a useful rule of appellate jurisprudence in other jurisdictions, <em>see McCloud v. Roy Riegels Chemicals, </em>20 Cal.App.3d 928, 97 Cal.Rptr. 910, 915 (1971), it is not the law in Maryland. Like federal caselaw, <em>see Maryland v. Baldwin, </em>112 U.S. 490, 493, 5 S.Ct. 278, 28 L.Ed. 822 (1884), Maryland follows the rule that when one claim is overturned in a multiple claim case with a general juiy verdict, an appellate court cannot possibly determine which part of the award was apportioned among the claims and a new trial must be ordered. <em>See Batson v.

White, who was arrested for and later convicted of burglary, was incarcerated during the entire notice of claim period.

Finally, to the extent Longtin\u2019s Article 24 Due Process claim mirrors his concededly timely common law malicious prosecution count, the State constitutional claim would seem to equally comply with notice requirements. <em>See Crespo v.

Longtin's brief also devotes some attention to the circuit court's weighing of factors supporting the punitive damages award. However, his reply brief states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">The defense avers that a trial court's reduction of a punitive damage [award] is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Had the trial court provided notice and an opportunity to be heard and then gone on to apply the proper test outlined above, this would certainly be the case. However, the issue on appeal is not whether the trial court abused its discretion in applying these factors, but the facts that: 1) the trial court provided no notice or opportunity for the plaintiff to be heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>prior to <em>sua sponte </em>striking more than $1 Million of the plaintiff's judgment; and 2) in doing so, the trial court failed to address all of the factors which must be addressed in deciding to strike such awards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In light of the narrowness of the question presented, it is not at all clear that issue (2) is properly before us. In any event, we do not believe the court erred simply by focusing on the most salient or relevant of the punitive damage factors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"60\">\n<p id=\"b165-7\">. The trial judge's opinion states \u201cUpon reconsideration, the Court finds that when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, there was insufficient evidence of actual malice to submit the issue to jury as to Detectives Harding, Frankenfield and Clark.\u201d With respect to Detective Herndon, the circuit judge found malice, but reduced the award upon consideration of such factors as the appellant\u2019s ability to pay, the size of the award, and his belief that deterrent value could still be achieved with a lower award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"61\">\n<p id=\"b165-8\">. Under Md. Rule 2-311(e), a circuit court may not grant a motion for new trial without a hearing. Presumably, if a judge was going to order a remittur <em>sua sponte, </em>this rule would seem to reqxtire a hearing. <em>Cf. Reubaum v. Custom Holding, Inc., </em>386 Md. 28, 46, 871 A.2d 554 (2005); Niemeyer, Schuett, Lynch and Bourne, <em>Maryland Rules Commentary </em>at 193 (3d Ed.2003) (\u201cIf the court has any expectancy of granting the motion, it should automatically order that a hearing be scheduled.\u201d); Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(d) (providing, in part: \"After giving the parties notice and an opporttmily to be heard, the court may grant a timely motion for a new trial for a reason not stated in the motion.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"62\">\n<p id=\"b166-6\">. A cursory search of out-of-state authorities discloses two cases where federal appellate courts have indicated that notice and an opportunity to be heard was required when a district court <em>sua sponte </em>modified its judgment after the then-established deadline for post-trial motions. <em>Dr. Jose S. Belaval, Inc. v. Perez-Perdomo, </em>465 F.3d 33, 37 (1st Cir.2006); <em>Chavez v. Balesh, </em>704 F.2d 774, 777 (5th Cir.1983). <em>Cf. McDowell v. Celebrezze, </em>310 F.2d 43, 44 (5th Cir.1962) (Holding that judge's <em>sua sponte </em>notice of rehearing filed one month after judgement complied with Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)). Here, however, as a result of timely-filed motions, the judgment was not final and the court's control over the proceeding was nearly plenary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"63\">\n<p id=\"b167-7\">. Appellants did specifically challenge the property damage component of the compensatory damage award, arguably putting the general subject of damages into play.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"64\">\n<p id=\"b167-8\">. In closing, appellees\u2019 counsel said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">There is no information that you gathered from two and a half weeks of trial that state[s] that any punitive damages should be given against any of those four Detectives.... There is no malice ... And there's also a rule here, if you ever get to the punitive damages, as to these four public servants. It's not designed to bankrupt them or to financially destroy them.... These are four civil servants with a long history with Prince George\u2019s Comity, within the police force, just investigating a murder....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
