They have here appealed from the refusal of the coi irt below to grant their request. One of the grounds which the learned District Judge regarded as conclusive against his reopening the question of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>sale was that all the questions raised by the interveners in their petition that he should do so were pending here on appeal. In this he was right, and they have been disposed of by us in that ease. Under the circumstances we do not feel that an appeal will lie from his order declining to grant their petition. It follows that in this case the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
