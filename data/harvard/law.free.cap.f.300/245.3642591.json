D. New York.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Aqu\">August 9, 1923.)</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b267-16\">The following is the opinion of Olney, Referee:</p>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b267-17\">On January 26, 1923, Lena Braaf (hereinafter called the claimant), loaned the bankrupt $5,000, and the bankrupt executed to claimant a chattel mortgage covering \u201call the store fixtures, floor cases, wall shelving, cash register, chairs, carpets, and all stocks of merchandise, consisting of shoes and foot-ware, now in the premises, and all other goods and chattels mentioned in the schedule hereunto annexed, and now in the premises 256 East Eordham road, in the borough of the Bronx, city of New York.\u201d The schedule annexed was as follows: \u201cWooden wall shelves; 24 wooden chairs; one (1) National; twenty-four (24) shoe stands; carpet on floor; all merchandise, stock and fixtures now in premises of store 256 East Fordham Road, Bronx, N. Y. C.\u201d The mortgage was duly recorded, as was a certificate of the consent of the holders of more than two-thirds of the stock of the bankrupt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b267-18\">A petition in bankruptcy was filed against the bankrupt on or about the 5th day of April, 1923.- There was paid to Lena Braaf the sum of $509 in part payment of her loan. Pursuant to order of. the court, the assets were sold, the lien, if any, to attach to the proceeds. The said order by which this matter was referred to me provided that the lien of said mortgage, in so far as it relates to fixtures, shall attach to the proceeds of sale to the sum of $800.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b267-19\">The receiver contends that the mortgage was invalid in that it does not comply with section 230-a of the Lien Law of the state of New York (B., C. &amp; G. Consol. Laws of New York, c. 33, 1921 Supp.). There was no proof taken that any of the provisions of said section 230-a were complied with. Claimant contends that, even if the mortgage be void as a mortgage on the merchandise, the provisions of section 230-a of the Lien Law should not be held applicable, in so far as it purports to be a mortgage on the fixtures. It is my opinion that section 230-a cannot be so interpreted, but that the mortgage to be valid must be so as a whole. I have found no decisions interpreting section 230-a, but this interpretation is, in my opinion, in line with the decisions under section 44 of the Personal Property Law, known as the Bulk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Sales Act (Consol. Laws N. Y. c. 41), which contains somewhat analogous provisions. See Heilmann v. Powelson, 101 Misc. Rep. 230, 167 N. Y. Supp. 662.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b268-4\"> Claimant further contends that the chattel mortgage, though on its face purporting to cover merchandise, was not intended by claimant or bankrupt to cover merchandise. I received evidence on this issue, over the objection of the receiver, on the theory that a bankruptcy court, being a court of equity, would .reform the instrument, if convinced the provisions thereof applying to merchandise were due to a mutual mistake of fact. All the witnesses who gave testimony on this issue, including the attorney who prepared the instrument, swore that the parties did not intend that the mortgage should cover merchandise. On the other hand, giving- due weight to such evidence as was adduced of the value of the fixtures, and the testimony to the effect that during the negotiations leading up to the execution of the mortgage claimant, through her attorney, took the position that the fixtures alone were inadequate security, and insisted that the bankrupt\u2019s lease, no evidence as to the value of_ which was offered, should be assigned to claimant, it appears exceedingly improbable that the intention of the parties as to whether the mortgage should cover the merchandise was other than is clearly expressed in the_ mortgage. The minutes of the meeting of the bankrupt's stockholders and directors and the consent sighed by its stockholders are of very little, if any, assistance in this connection, for, while the stockholders at their meeting authorized a chattel mortgage on \u201cfixtures,\u201d nothing being said about chattels or merchandise, the directors at their meeting authorized a chattel mortgage on \u201cfixtures and chattels,\u201d and the stockholders in their consent consented to a mortgage on \u201cchattels and fixtures.\u201d Chattels certainly could be construed as including merchandise. After carefully considering all the testimony, I have come to the conclusion that claimant has not sustained the burden of proof that the mortgage did not express the intent of the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b268-5\">I accordingly find that claimant has no lien upon the proceeds of sale of said merchandise or said fixtures.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b268-6\">Eesser Bros., of New York City (Hilbert I.
