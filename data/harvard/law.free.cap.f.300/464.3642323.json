Bradley and Sherman Baldwin, both of New York City, on the brief), for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b486-11\">Burlingham, Yeeder, Masten &amp; Fearey, of New York City (Roscoe H. Hupper, of New York City, and Eugene Underwood, Jr., of counsel), for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b486-12\">Before HOUGH, MANTON, and MAYER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b486-13\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"AJek\">Libelant shipped certain foodstuffs upon the steamship Montana, a vessel which fell in with the Menominee when the latter vessel was in trouble and rendered salvage services; i. e., she towed the Menominee into an English harbor. The towage delayed the Montana, and the delay injured libelant\u2019s foodstuffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-14\">These goods were carried under a bill of lading which specifically gave authority to the carrying 'vessel to assist vessels in distress and to deviate for the purpose of saving life or property, and contained the further proviso that the carrier should not be liable for \u201cany loss or damage caused by the prolongation of the voyage.\u201d It is thus admitted that by contract (not to speak of the Harter Act) the Montana had absolute right to do what she did without any liability to libelant.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-15\">This libel is filed to recover libelant\u2019s damages on the ground that the Menominee was benefited by the services of the Montana. There is substantially nothing to add to the opinion of A. N. Hand, District Judge, in the court below. This case rests solely on the. authority of The Colon, 10 Ben. 60, Fed. Cas. No. 3,024. We think that case stands alone, and it was considered and its doctrine denied in The Persian Monarch (D. C.) 23 Fed. 820. We agree with the remarks of Judge Benedict in the latter case.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-16\">On legal principle, this is a salvage claim, or it is nothing. To be sure, salvage includes many demands \u201cin the nature of salvage\u201d; but a vessel in distress cannot be made to respond, either for strict salvage or services in the nature of salvage, unless it be proven that the person making the claim (1) rendered services; and (2) that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>services benefited the vessel in trouble. It is impossible to perceive that Swift &amp; Co.\u2019s food products rendered any services whatever to the Menominee, or that the latter vessel was aided in any way by Swift &amp; Co.\u2019s loss. It does not advance the argument at all to call that loss a sacrifice. The rest of the cases bearing more or less on this subject are all cited in Judge Hand\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">Decree affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
