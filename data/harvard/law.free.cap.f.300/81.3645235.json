Hochstim [C. C. A.] 278 Fed. 102, 20 A. L. R. 123; Thames &amp; Mersey Ins. Co. v. United States, 237 U. S. 19, 26, 35 Sup. Ct. 496, 59 L. Ed. 821, Ann. Cas. 1915D, 1087); that after the option was exercised to take the sugar, duty paid it became impossible for the Sherburne Company to present for payment ocean bills of lading and rendered a certificate of insurance covering the voyage of no consequence; that, in view of this situation, it became necessary for the parties to agree, in order to enable the Sherburne Company to carry out its contract, on a substitution of dock delivery orders or warehouse receipts which might be presented in the place of ocean bills of lading in demanding payment; that there was evidence from which the jury was warranted in finding, that as early as July 9, 1920, Armour &amp; Co. agreed to a substitution of dock delivery orders or warehouse receipts and that it would make its letter of credit in favor of the Sherburne Company payable upon presentation of such orders or warehouse receipts, but that it failed to furnish such letter of credit; that the declaration and right of action in this suit is not grounded upon the anticipatory breach of September 3, 1920, while the contract remained executory, but upon performance on the part of the Sherburne Company and a refusal on the part of the defendant to accept performance ; that section 146 of the Personal Property Law of New York (Consol. Laws, c. 41) is, therefore, not applicable (Hutt v. Hausman, 118 Misc. Rep. 448, 193 N. Y. Supp. 452); that as the action is based upon performance and nonacceptance and the evidence shows that the Sherburne Company was able and ready to perform by a presentation of warehouse receipts or a delivery of the sugar itself, the jury were warranted in finding that the Sherburne Company had fully performed its part of the contract and that it was unnecessary for it actually to tender the warehouse receipts or the sugar, for to do so would be a useless thing in view of Armour &amp; Co.\u2019s absolute refusal of September 3, which it thereafter persisted in, to accept performance (Hutt v. Hausman, 118 Misc. Rep. 448, 193 N. Y. Supp. 452; Rubber Trading Co. v. Manhattan Rubber Mfg. Co., 221 N. Y. 120, 116 N. E. 1073; Strasbourger v. Leerburger, 233 N. Y. 55, 135 N. E. 920; Landes v. Klopstock, 252 Fed. 89, 164 C. C. A. 201).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>The plaintiffs do not rely upon the defendants\u2019 persisted-in refusal or repudiation as a breach, as contended by the defendant, but as evidence to excuse an actual tender, which the jury found and was warranted in finding that it waived. The defendant\u2019s exceptions are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed, with costs to the defendants in error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-7\"> Minford, Dueder &amp; Co., 106 Wall Street, New York.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">April 16, 1920.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-9\">Armour &amp; Company, Chicago, Illinois \u2014 Gentlemen: We have this day sold you for the account of E.
