Important as are the questions raised, and large as are the sums at stake, a recital of the facts on which the case mainly turns and a discussion of the questions of law arising in the case would, we think, involve merely a repetition of the reasoning of the learned trial judge, and would add nothing to the decision of the case. We therefore affirm the opinion below. 294 Fed. 725.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
