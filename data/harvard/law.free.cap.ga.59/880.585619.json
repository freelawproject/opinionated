This court will not control the presiding judge in the exercise of his sound discretion in granting a new trial, on the ground that the verdict of the jury is strongly and decidedly against the weight of evidence in respect to the amount of damages found, unless that discretion was abused.</p><p id=\"b880-9\">2. The judgment for a new hearing being affirmed on the above ground, the presumption is that other errors, if any, will be corrected by the court on that new hearing.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
