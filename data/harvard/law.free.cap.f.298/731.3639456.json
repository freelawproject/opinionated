Mr. Page died testate September 4, 1918. The plaintiff in error was his sole devisee and legatee and named as executrix. The tax became due and payable one year after decedent\u2019s death, and as executrix\" she filed with the collector-on November 21, 1919, her statutory return, setting forth;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgRn\">\u201c(a) The value of the gross estate of the decedent at the time of his death; * * * (b) the deductions allowed under section two hundred and three; (e) the value of the net estate of thejiocedent as defined in section two hundred and three.\u201d Section 205 (Comp.'St. \u00a7 6336%f).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-22\">The Act of February 24, 1919 (40 Stat. 1096 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919, \u00a7 6336%b]), was in effect when the return was filed, and it ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>pears that the executrix contended that the prior Acts had been repealed by the Act of February 24th without a saving clause -(Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919, \u00a7 6371 %a), and that no tax could be assessed; or if assessable, the amount of the tax should be ascertained by computation on the net value of the estate at the rates specified in the later Act, which were less than the rates named in the prior Acts. Both contentions were rejected, the tax was assessed according to the rates given in the prior Acts, and the amount so ascertained was paid under protest. There was no controversy as to the net value of the estate; it was correctly given in the return. In all of the Acts the net value is divided up into specified amounts or blocks, anddhe amount of the tax arrived at by taking a named per cent, of each block and then adding together the sums found. The total amount thus ascertained as to-this estate was almost twice as much, when. the per cents, given under the 1916 Act as amended are applied, as it would have been if the percentages named in the 1919 Act were applied. The phraseology of the two Acts is the same in its main purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-4\">\u201cThat a tax *. * * is hereby imposed upon the transfer of the net estate of every decedent dying after the passage of this Act,\u201d <em>\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">\u2014the schedule of rates to be applied to the net value'follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The imposition took effect at the time of death and the tax became at once a lien on the property of the estate, enforceable by sale, if not paid, on proceedings in court. New York Trust Co. v. Eisner, 256 U. S. 345, 41 Sup. Ct. 506, 65 L. Ed. 963, 16 A. L. R. 660. There was no personal liability. Shortly after the executrix made her return decedent\u2019s estate was closed'and she brought this action in her personal right as .sole beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">The case comes here from an order sustaining demurrer to each count and dismissal of the action. We think it clear, as will appear from further discussion, that it was not the intention of Congress to-wholly release estates in the condition in which this was, from the tax imposed by the amended Act of 1916; the question that challenges consideration is, whether it was intended by the Act of February 24, 1919, to substitute the lower rates named in the Act of 1919 for the higher rates found in the Act of 1916, as applicable to estates in which assessments had not been made and the tax had not become due and- payable at the time the later Act took effect.\u201d The two Acts require in' identical language that the commissioner shall make all assessments of the tax upder the authority of the existing administrative special and general provisions of law relating to the assessment and collection of taxes; \u2018and that the executor shall make and file with the collector the same-kind of return, setting forth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-8\">\u201c(a) Tbe value of the gross estate; (b) the deductions -allowed by the act;, (c) the value of the net estate; and (d) .the tax paid or payable thereon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">Each Act provides that the tax shall be due one year after decedent\u2019s-death. Each allows an exemption of $50,000. There are some differences in the two Acts as to times of payment and forfeitures to be imposed which, we think, need not be noted in detail. Notwithstanding the provision in each Act that the commissioner shall make all assess-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>merits, it may be conceded for our purposes, as contended by counsel for defendant in error, that where a return shows the net value of the estate the law makes the assessment, and it- is only when no return or a false return is made that the collector must go about gathering the facts and exercise the .power given to make an assessment; but in neither contingency do we think it could be said that an assessment is made until the collector has at hand a statement showing the net value. The tax is assessed on the net value of the estate, and whether made by the commissioner or by operation of law, the assessment must await the ascertainment of the net value. Liabilities of the decedent and administration expenses must be ascertained and deducted from the gross value for that purpose, and time is given by each Act so that may be done.' The imposition of the tax immediately on death and the simultaneous lien antedate the assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">\u2018We come to the Act of February 24, 1919, and it is agreed that the legislative intent as to whether the rates which it prescribes for purposes of assessment should be applied to the conditions we have here, is primarily to be found in \u2019section 1400 of the later Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919, \u00a7 6371%a). But first, we make note of section 401 of the later Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919, \u00a7 6336%b), and observe that it sheds some light on the inquiry, whether section 1400 discloses an intention that estates under the conditions in hand should be assessed at the lower rates fixed by the later Act. Section 401 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-5\">\u201cSee. 401. That (in lieu of the tax imposed by Title II of the Revenue Act of 1916, as amended, and in lieu of the tax imposed by Title IX of the Revenue Act\u2018of 1917) a tax equal to the sum of the following percentages of the value of the net estate (determined as provided in section 403) is hereby imposed upon the transfer of the net; estate of every decedent dying after , the passage of this Act, whether a resident or nonresident of the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Following this and as a part of section 401 is the schedule of rates to be applied, lower than the rates found in the prior Acts. The lower rates given in this section are to be applied to estates of decedents dying after February 24, 1919. But that is a subject separate and apart from the inquiry, whether other parts of the Act (section 1400) discloses an intention that those rates shall be applied also to estates of decedents dying prior to February 25, 1919, the tax imposed thereon not then being due and payable and no assessment against the same having theretofore been made. Does section 1400 of the later Act disclose such an intention? It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-7\">\u201cSec. 1400. (a) That the following parts of Acts are hereby repealed, subject to the limitations provided in subdivision (b):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-8\">\u201c(1) The following titles of the Revenue Act of 1916:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-9\">\u201cTitle 1 (called \u2018Income Tax\u2019);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-10\">\u201cTitle II (called \u2018Estate Tax\u2019) ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-11\">\u201cTitle III (called \u2018Munitions Manufacturers\u2019 Tax\u2019) * * * ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-12\">\u201cTitle IV (called \u2018Miscellaneous Taxes\u2019).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-13\">\u201c(2) The following parts of the Act entitled \u2018An Act to provide increased revenue to defray the expenses of the increased appropriations for the Army and Navy and the extensions of fortifications, and for other purposes,\u2019 approved March 3, 1917:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-14\">\u201cTitle III (called \u2018Estate Tax\u2019);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-15\">\u201cSection 402 (called \u2018Returns of Dividends\u2019).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-16\">\u201c(3) The following titles of the Revenue Act of 1917:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>\u201cTitle I (called \u2018War Income Tax\u2019) ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-4\">\u201cTitle II (called \u2018War Excess-Profits Tax\u2019);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-5\">\u201cTitle III (called \u2018War Tax on Beverages\u2019) ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-6\">\u201cTitle IV (called \u2018War Tax on Cigars, Tobacco, and Manufactures Thereof\u2019);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-7\">\u201cTitle V (called \u2018War Tax on Facilities Furnished by Public Utilities, and Insurance\u2019) ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-8\"><em>\u201cTitle </em>VI (called \u2018War Excise Taxes\u2019) ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-9\">\u201cTitle VII (called \u2018War Tax on Admissions and Dues\u2019);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-10\">\u201cTitle VIII (called \u2018War Stamp Taxes\u2019) ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-11\">\u201cTitle IX (called \u2018War Estate Tax\u2019) ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-12\">\u201cTitle X (called \u2018Administrative Provisions\u2019);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-13\">\u201cTitle XII (called \u2018Income-Tax Amendments\u2019).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-14\">\u201c(b) Such parts of Acts shall remain in force for the assessment and collection of all taxes which have accrued' thereunder, and for the imposition and collection of all penalties or forfeitures which have accrued and may accrue in relation to any such taxes, and except that the unexpended balance of any appropriation heretofore made and now available for the administration of any such part of an Act shall be available for the administration of this Act or the corresponding provision thereof: Provided, That, except as otherwise provided in this Act, no taxes shall be collected under Title I of the Revenue Act of 1916 as amended by the Revenue Act of 1917, or Title I or II of the Revenue Act of 1917, in respect to any period after December 31, 1917: Provided further, That the assessment and collection of all estate taxes, and'the imposition and collection of all penalties or forfeitures, which have accrued under Title II of the Revenue Act of 1916 as amended by the Act entitled \u2018An Act to provide increased Revenue to defray the expenses of the increased appropriations for the Army and Navy and the extensions of fortifications, and for other purposes,\u2019 approved March 3, 1917, or Title IX of the Revenue Act of 1917, shall be- according to the provisions of Title IV of this Act. In the case of any tax imposed by any part of an Act herein repealed, if there is a tax imposed by this Act in lieu thereof, the provision imposing such tax shall remain in force until the corresponding tax under this Act takes effect under the provisions of this Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-15\">The important parts of this section-bearing on our inquiry are found in sub-paragraph (b), reading thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-16\">\u201cSuch parts of Acts shall remain in force for the assessment and collection of all taxes which have accrued thereunder, and for the imposition and collection of all penalties or forfeitures which have accrued and may accrue in relation to any such taxes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-17\">This is a general saving clause broad enough to cover all of the different named taxes, including the Estate Tax, specified under (a) of the preceding part of the section. The next part of sub-paragraph (b) bearing on the inquiry is the second proviso, which takes out of and eliminates from the general saving clause above quoted \u201cEstate Taxes\u201d imposed by the two prior Acts to the extent and for the purposes named. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-18\">\u201cThat the assessment and collection of all estate taxes, and the imposition and collection of all penalties or forfeitures, which have accrued under\u201d the two prior Acts, \u201cshall be according to the provisions of Title IV of this Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-19\">Title 4 of the Act of February 24 includes section 401 above quoted. The third part of sub-paragraph (b) bearing on. the inquiry is its last sentence, reading thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-20\">\u201cIn the case of any tax imposed by any part of an Act herein repealed, if there is a tax imposed by this Act in lieu thereof, the provision imposing .such tax shall remain in force until\u2019 the corresponding tax under this Act takes effect under the provisions of this Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>For the purposes of this case we take the last sentence as an expression of a clear intention that the parts of the two prior Acts imposing estate taxes were not repealed, as to all estates of decedents dying prior to February 25, 1919; and we may add that, impliedly, the liens given by the prior Acts for the collection of the taxes which they, imposed were intended also to continue. This sentence will need further consideration. Neither are we in doubt as to the meaning of the word \u201caccrued,\u201d found in sub-paragraph (b); as contended by counsel amici curias, who appear for another estate in like conditions, that it is equivalent to <em>arising under </em>and refers to all taxes, including estate taxes, arising under the prior Acts and is not a restriction to those that were due and payable prior to February 25th. It is argued that the part of sub-paragraph (b) which determines,-or largely determines the inquiry whether it was intended that estate taxes of decedents dying prior to February 25th, which were not then due and payable and had not been assessed, should be at the lower rate provided for in the later Act, is the se.cond proviso. It says that the assessment and collection of all estate taxes and the imposition and collection of all penalties and forfeitures which have accrued under the prior Acts shall not be made according to the provisions of the prior Acts but according to the provisions of the later Act. The rate of taxation is an indispensable element in the assessment, as much so as the value on which it is to be laid. Without either no assessment can be made. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">L,et us now go back to the Act of 1916 as amended. The sections of the original Act and of the amending Act which impose the tax each contains as a part thereof the schedules of rates to be applied to the net value of estates in ascertaining the amount of the tax, and declares that the tax imposed equals those percentages. No tax estimated on net value as a basis could be imposed without a rate, nor could an assessment be made if Congress had not fixed the rate,\u2014directly, as it did, or indirectly. The declaration that a tax was imposed on the transfer of the net value of estates would have been meaningless, without a fixed or definitely ascertainable rate. The fixing of the rates to be applied to the net estate was requisite to imposing the tax, an indispensable element in the imposition. It therefore seems plain that the last sentence in sub-paragraph (b) of section 1400 of the later Act, in saving from repeal the parts of the prior acts which imposed an estate tax, retained the schedule of rates fixed by the prior Acts, else there would have been no parts of those Acts imposing the tax. Again, section 401 of the later Act imposing a tax on the estates of decedents dying after its passage, in lieu of the tax imposed by the prior Acts, limits the application of the rates found in that section to estates of decedents dying after the date on which that Act took effect. These considerations, we think, show the fallacy of the contention that the net estate of William Byrd Page should have been assessed in accordance with the rates found in section 401 of the Act of February 24, 1919. To accede to the contention, which rests, we think, on the meaning which we are asked to give to the word assessment, is but to bring the second proviso in direct conflict with the last sentence of sub-paragraph (b), which, as we have already held, saved from repeal the tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>imposed by the prior Acts according to the rates which they fixed, and at the same time to apply the rates' found in the later Act to a purpose not intended by the section in which they are found.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> But whatsoever may be the function that the word serves in administrative procedure, .the correct amount of tax imposed has been paid, the action is in assumpsit and there can be no implied promise for the return of any part of it. Bailey v. Railroad Co., 22 Wall. 604, 638, 22 L.
