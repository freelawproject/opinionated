The bill of lading required that \u201call claims for damage to goods must be made, and the nature and extent thereof fully disclosed, in the presence of the agent of the company, having the same then in custody before they are removed from the station or wharf. Unless written demand for damage shall be made upon tbe carrier liable therefor, or upon the carrier which actually delivered the goods, within ten days after delivery, all claims for damage shall be taken to have been waived, and no suit shall thereafter be maintainable to recover the same. No agent or employee shall have authority to waive such demand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b957-18\">We agree with the court below in holding that the appellant cannot recover without making proof of compliance with this clause of the bill of lading. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>Southern Pacific v.
