Irvin, was convicted and sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment upon an indictment of three counts, each of which charged the forgery of an obligation of the United States. No point was made in the trial court as to the sufficiency of the indictment, but that mainly relied on here is that it is insufficient to support a verdict and sentence. The indictment charges in each count the forging with intent to defraud of an instrument consisting of a registered Diberty Bond, together with its indorsement, specifying the forgery to consist in the false indorsement of the payee\u2019s name. It charges in substance a crime under section 148 of the Criminal Code (Comp. St. \u00a7 10318). De Lemos v. United States, 91 Fed. 497, 33 C. C. A. 655. But in each count, in setting forth the bond the allegation is, \u201cwhich said falsely made and forged obligation of the United States is <em>substantially </em>in words and figures the following,\u201d there being added apparently the full words of a complete bond of the United States, and in setting forth the indorsement the allegation is, \u2018.\u2018and on the back of which falsely made and forged obligation of the United States as aforesaid were indorsed <em>in part </em>the words and figures following, to wit,\u201d there being added apparently a full form of indorsement, duly executed and acknowledged, as required in the transfer of registered bonds. The contention made is that this is not a setting forth of the forged instrument according to its tenor, but purports to be only a substantial and partial, rather than an exact and complete, exhibition of it;</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">In People v. Tilden, 242 Ill. 536, 90 N. E. 218, 31 L. R. A. (N. S.) 215, 134 Am. St. Rep. 341, 17 Ann. Cas. 496, upon a full examination of the authorities, it is demonstrated that at common law in England and the United States, in indictments for forgery and other crimes in which a writing is the very gist of the offense, the instrument involved must be set forth in haec verba, or a potent reason alleged for not doing so. Judgment was there arrested upon an indictment very similar to the one here involved. This rule was recognized and applied by a federal court in arresting a judgment in United States v. Fisler, Fed. Cas. No. 15,105. And see United States v. Williams, Fed. Cas. No. 16,706. This was prior to the enactment of R. S. \u00a7 1025 (Comp. St. \u00a7 1691), which declares that defects of form in indictments, that do not tend to the prejudice of the defendant, shall not render the indictment insufficient, nor affect the trial, judgment, or other proceedings thereon. Since that enactment the rule has been applied in sustaining demurrers made before trial. United States v. Rossi (D. C.) 268 Fed. 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Whether the use of the words \u201csubstantially\u201d and \u201cin part,\u201d in connection with words which show a complete instrument, the forgery of which is a crime, amounts to but a defect of form, which need not be regarded before verdict under R. S. \u00a7 1025, we need not decide here. It appears that neither the court nor the defendant found any practical embarrassment in the trial by reason of uncertainty in the indictment. No variance appears or is complained of between the instruments introduced in evidence and the words set forth in the indictment. Appellant\u2019s guilt as a procurer and abettor of the forgery is abundantly established. Criminal Code, \u00a7 332 (Comp. St. \u00a7 10506). Upon the whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>record we do not find any substantial right of his to have been prejudiced. In People v. Tilden, supra, page 542 (90 N. E. 219, 221), the court, after noting that statutes altering the requirement of exact instead of substantial setting forth of the instrument have been passed in England and many of the United States, said :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">\u201cThe rule under consideration is technical, but we cannot disregard it for that reason.\u201d .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">This court, on the contrary, is bound by Judicial Code, \u00a7 269, as amended February 26, 1919 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919, \u00a7 1246), to disregard \u201ctechnical * * * defects * * * which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
