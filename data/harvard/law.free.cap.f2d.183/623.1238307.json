The mark was passed for publication and appeared in the Official Gazette of the Patent Office on December 4, 1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-13\">Appellee\u2019s notice of opposition is dated January 2, 1946. It alleged, as one ground for denying registration, that the mark sought to be registered so nearly resembles trade-marks of appellee for the same kind of goods as to be likely to cause confusion in trade. The registered marks of appellee relied upon are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-21\">Storybook Reg. No. 389,114 July 22, 1941</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuS\">Little Bo Peep Reg. No. 395,454 May 26, 1942</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6x\">Boy Blue Reg. No. 404,875 Dec. 7, 1943</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6X\">Curly Locks Mother Goose Mary Had A Reg. No. 404,581 Reg. No. 413,233 Dec. 7, 1943 April 17, 1945</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvA\">Little Lamb Reg. No. 414,597 June 19, 1945</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AL5\">Betty Blue Reg. No. 417,245</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AF51\">(1920 Act) Oct. 16, 1945.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-30\">The following applications were also cited by appellee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-31\">Red Riding Hood Application filed March 8, 1944</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5L\">Fairyland Dolls Application filed June 19, 1945</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJx\">Fairytale Dolls Application filed June 19, 1945.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abo\">A second reason alleged by appellee against the registration of appellant\u2019s mark is that the mark sought to be registered is commonly used to designate toy departments in general merchandising stores and therefore the mark is descriptive, in a general sense, of products, more specifically those of appellee, which are adapted for sale through such retail outlets.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-37\">The examiner held that the application for registration of \u201cFairyland Dolls\u201d and' \u201cFairytale Dolls\u201d could not be considered for the reason that those marks are subsequent in date to the use by appellant of his mark. The examiner stated that as to the other marks relied upon by appellee, none <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>so resembles the mark sought to be registered in appearance, sound, or meaning so as to be likely to cause confusion of origin of the goods of the respective parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">The examiner was of opinion that the exclusive use by appellant of his mark would be a restraint upon the rights of competitors, selling other toys, to employ commonplace language of description in merchandising their goods. He stated that \u201cToyland,\u201d in a very comprehensive sense, is descriptive of dolls and any other toy adapted for display and sale in the \u201cToy-land\u201d departments of stores and he then concluded that registration by appellant would be inconsistent with the right of dealers in toys, including appellee, in promoting their sales, to employ the term sought to be registered. Therefore he held that registration of appellant\u2019s mark would involve damage to appellee within the meaning of the statute. He sustained the notice of opposition and further adjudged that appellant was not entitled to his sought registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Upon appeal, the commissioner affirmed the decision of the examiner and further explicitly found, <em>ex parte, </em>that appellant is not entitled to the registration for which he made application.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">It was noted by both the tribunals below that it was shown by testimony that the term \u201cToyland\u201d is quite generally used in retail stores to identify that part of the store in which toys of various sorts are sold. That undoubtedly is a common practice in department stores. We agree with the tribunals below that such practice is a matter of common knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">We cannot agree with the examiner and the commissioner that the term sought to be registered is generically descriptive of dolls and other playthings sold in the toy divisions of department stores. Clearly, the term \u201cToyland\u201d is not descriptive of dolls in general or any other toy for sale in the toy department of any store. Moreover, the mark may not properly be held to be descriptive of the individual dolls manufactured by appellee. Therefore, we can see no reasonable likelihood of confusion in trade by the use by the parties of their respective marks as applied to identical goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">The word \u201cToyland\u201d we think, is a term in the public domain, but broadly descriptive of nothing more than toy departments and toy stores. Obviously, it is not descriptive of any particular product or line of toy products and therefore, in our opinion, is subject to appropriation and registration as a trade-mark, as claimed by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">For the reasons hereinbefore set out, the decision of the commissioner is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
