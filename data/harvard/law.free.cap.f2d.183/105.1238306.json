(B. W. Harris Manufacturing Co., Inc.) to cancel the registration of the trademark \u201cZeroland,\u201d registration No. 417,878, owned by appellee (Werber Sportswear Co.). The cases were submitted on the same record and were briefed and argued together. Accordingly, we shall dispose of - the two appeals in one decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">The cancellation proceeding was initiated against two registrations of appellee, one of which had expired prior to the institution of this proceeding, namely, registration No. 186,326. The examiner, therefore, properly dismissed the petition as to that registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Appellant based its right of action upon prior use of its trade-mark \u201cZero King,\u201d as applied to fur, sheep, leather, and textile clothing \u2014 namely, coats for men, women,- and children. Appellant had used its mark on its goods since September 1,1916, and the mark was duly registered December 23, 1930, registration No. 278,514, under the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The trade-mark \u201cZeroland\u201d was registered on November 20, 1945, for use on men\u2019s outdoor -leather and cloth lined jackets and coats; men\u2019s outdoor sheep-lined jackets and coats; ladies\u2019 outdoor cloth jackets and coats; ladies\u2019 outdoor sheep-lined jackets and coats; men\u2019s and women\u2019s cloth and sheep-lined jackets, flying jackets and flying suits for outdoor and sports' wear. This mark .was sought to be can-celled by reason of prior use of the mark \u201cZero King,\u201d as applied to merchandise possessing the sam\u00e9 descriptive properties.'</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">In his decision, the examiner held that the marks of the\" parties bore such close resemblance as to be likely to cause confusion in trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">The Commissioner of Patents disagreed with the reasoning of the Examiner of Interferences and held that the marks of the parties had different meanings and that such difference was strengthened by a prominent display of a crown in the mark \u201cZero King\u201d and a pictorial suggestion of cold inherent in the mark of appellee. The commissioner further held that \u201cWhile there is some similarity in sound and appearance between the words, this results only from the common use of the word \u2018zero,\u2019 which has a suggestive significance in connection with the products of the parties, * *</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">We are in agreement with the holdings of the commissioner. It is difficult for us to see how the word \u201czero\u201d could be appropriated for exclusive use by any applicant with respect to clothing designed to be used in cold weather. Moreover, there is a distinct difference in sound, spelling, appearance, and meaning of the words \u201cland\u201d and \u201cking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">Considering the marks as a whole, since the only similarity between them resides in the word \u201czero,\u201d we are of opinion that the clear difference in the last portion thereof, hereinbefore noted, renders the entire marks so dissimilar that likelihood of confusion will not arise in their concurrent use by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">Prior to the decision of the commissioner, appellee moved that the case be remanded to the Examiner of Interferences for the taking of additional testimony to show that appellant was not chargeable with laches or \u2022acquiescence. This motion was denied by the commissioner and, in view of our conclusion, it is not necessary for us to consider this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-12\">For the reasons hereinbefore stated, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
