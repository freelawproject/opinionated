Father appeals, arguing that the state failed to prove that his possession of pornography endangered the children\u2019s welfare. We agree and, accordingly, reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">We begin with the facts, which we state consistently with the juvenile court\u2019s factual findings and ultimate legal conclusion. <em>Dept. of Human Services v. C. Z., </em>236 Or App 436, 442, 236 P3d 791 (2010). In August 2009, on the state\u2019s petition, the juvenile court took jurisdiction over father and mother\u2019s three children on the ground that they were \u201ccurrently residing under a threat of harm for mental injury and neglect,\u201d due primarily to father\u2019s abusive treatment of mother. After that, mother and father divorced.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">In March 2010, the state filed another petition, alleging additional bases for the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction over the children, including an allegation that the children were endangered because father had \u201cdisplayed sexually inappropriate behaviors involving children.\u201d The juvenile court held a hearing on the petition in November 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">At the hearing, the state presented evidence that, in July 2009, mother brought two computers that belonged to her and father to the police for examination. She did so because she knew that father had stored adult pornography on the computers and because father had once told her that he had accidentally downloaded child pornography, but had erased it.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">A police detective, Anderson, examined the data on the computers. He determined that one of the computers contained three still images and six videos of child pornography. The three still images were \u201cthumbnails.\u201d \u201cThumbnails\u201d are smaller, lower-resolution versions of full-size images; they help computer users recognize and organize full-size images on their computers. According to Anderson, when a computer user downloads a full-size image, both the full-size image and a thumbnail are stored on the computer. When the user <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>deletes the full-size image, the thumbnail remains in a thumbnail folder, but it cannot be enlarged without special software. Anderson found the child pornography thumbnails in a thumbnail folder; the full-size images had been deleted. Anderson used special software, which was not present on the parents\u2019 computer, to enlarge the thumbnails so that he could determine their contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">The six videos of child pornography were stored in an \u201cincomplete\u201d folder, indicating that they had been downloaded, but the downloading process had not been completed. Anderson believed that the videos were downloaded using a peer-to-peer file-sharing program. According to Anderson, such programs download files in pieces. As each piece is downloaded, it is stored in an \u201cincomplete\u201d folder, where it remains until the rest of the pieces are downloaded. If the download process is interrupted \u2014 which can occur for a variety of reasons, including termination by the user \u2014 the downloaded pieces remain in the \u201cincomplete\u201d folder. If the process is completed, then the program moves the file to a \u201ccomplete\u201d or \u201cdownloaded\u201d folder. Although the videos on the parents\u2019 computer were in the \u201cincomplete\u201d folder, they were accessible. Anderson was able to view all of them, at least partially.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Anderson testified that the still images and videos of child pornography on the parents\u2019 computer were downloaded in 2005 and last accessed in 2007. Anderson further testified that, although he could tell when the files were last accessed, he could not tell the nature of the access. He could not tell whether the files were \u201cviewed, deleted, or [there was] some other activity with regard to [the] filets].\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">A second computer expert, Young, was called as a witness by father. Like Anderson, Young testified that he believed that the three still images and six videos of child pornography were downloaded using a peer-to-peer file-sharing program in 2005 and that they were last accessed in 2007. Young further testified that the access in 2007 was likely an automated search. He explained that the images and videos were last accessed on the same date, between 2:00 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>4:00 a.m., along with \u201cseveral thousand files of a wide variety * * * of types,\u201d indicating an automated activity, such as a virus scan. According to Young, the computer access records indicated that, although the still images and videos were accessed in 2007, no one viewed them at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">In addition to the still images and videos of child pornography, Anderson and Young found 300 to 400 images and videos of adult pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Mother testified that there had always been a large amount of adult pornography on the computers. She testified that father downloaded the pornography; she did not. She also testified that, as mentioned, father once told her that he had accidentally downloaded child pornography, but had erased it. She never saw child pornography on the computers.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The state called a sexual offender treatment specialist, Gilbert, to testify about the risks that arise from the possession of pornography. Gilbert testified that repeated exposure to pornography can reduce a person\u2019s inhibitions; it can reduce \u201cthe threshold of actually acting on fantasy.\u201d According to Gilbert, repeated exposure to pornography allows a person to view others \u201cmore as objects * * * than as humans[,]\u201d thereby \u201creduc[ing] them to * * * something less and easier to molest or easier to offend against.\u201d Thus, according to Gilbert, \u201cthere\u2019s an increased likelihood of sexual crime taking place when there\u2019s heavy use of pornography.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">But, Gilbert emphasized, \u201cI don\u2019t think we can say that just because someone [has] a particular image on a computer that they\u2019re therefore a * * * sexual offender.\u201d And, Gilbert continued, \u201cI think it also probably needs to be noted that just because someone demonstrates arousal to a particular target population doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re going to commit an offense or have committed an offense.\u201d When asked about the amount of pornography father downloaded, Gilbert said that it was \u201coutside the norm\u201d but that, \u201cjust because behavior lies outside the norm, it doesn\u2019t mean that a sexual crime is going to be committed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Gilbert regarded the pornography father had downloaded as a \u201cred flag.\u201d Gilbert was concerned by the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>of pornography father had downloaded and the fact that it included child pornography. He testified that father posed a \u201cpotential risk\u201d and \u201cuntil we can rule out the risk * * * we have to assume there is a risk.\u201d Gilbert said that he would need more information to determine whether father posed an actual risk, including information about why and where father obtained the pornography, how recently and frequently he used it, and how he used it. That information would, according to Gilbert, \u201chelp clarify this situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">After the presentation of the evidence at the hearing, the state moved to amend the petition, which, as mentioned, alleged that father had \u201cdisplayed sexually inappropriate behaviors involving children.\u201d The state argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">\u201cI think we can broaden this petition, Your Honor, to just say [\u2018]has displayed sexually inappropriate behaviors!\u2019] inclusive of everything, and that it does create a risk to the children * * *. And as far as whether it\u2019s an intentional download or an unintentional download, based on the evidence that\u2019s come forward, I don\u2019t believe it really matters.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Father responded that the state had failed to prove that he had intentionally possessed child pornography and that his possession of adult pornography was an insufficient basis for the juvenile court to take jurisdiction over the children. Father argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">\u201c[T]he State\u2019s argument is, \u2018Well, let\u2019s back up and just talk about Mr. Gilbert and the volume of pornography here.\u2019 Your Honor, the things I heard Mr. Gilbert talk about were \u2014 let\u2019s rule it out. I submit that in court proceedings, we don\u2019t decide that we have a concern and we\u2019re going to rule something out; we have to have a finding. A finding that, in this particular case, because of this particular fact, that there\u2019s a threat of harm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">The juvenile court amended the petition to allege that father \u201cpossessed sexually inappropriate materials\u201d that \u201cplace[d] the children under a threat of harm,\u201d and the court took jurisdiction over the children on that basis. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-9\">\u201cWell, this is one of the more difficult cases, certainly, that has come before the Court in making a decision on whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>or not to take jurisdiction over the petition. Clearly, I have jurisdiction over these kids anyway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-4\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\"><em>\u201cI think the kids were put at risk, based upon the fact that [the child pornography] was there and in their home and easily accessible to them, </em>and the fact that there\u2019s no disputing that [father] knew that it was on the computer. * * * He didn\u2019t delete it good enough. And that was his computer and he didn\u2019t go back and take care of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">\u201cAnd I think that all of that sexual stuff puts those kids at risk, especially considering what we know about those kids is that they\u2019re already at risk. * * * And Mr. Gilbert\u2019s testimony is very compelling to me, as far as how much of a risk they were actually put at by being in that environment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">\u00ab\u00edji \u00edf\u00ed \u2021 \u00ed{\u00ed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\"><em>\u201cAnd somebody who possesses a computer full of pornography that, oh, by the way, accidentally or intentionally has some child porn on it, that causes me a huge amount of concern as to whether or not they\u2019re going to be a risk to children, </em>especially when I hear Mr. Gilbert saying, \u2018That\u2019s really a red flag to me as a treatment provider who\u2019s been providing sex offender treatment for 20 years.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">Thus, the juvenile court concluded that it had jurisdiction over the children pursuant to ORS 419B.100(l)(c) because father\u2019s possession of pornography endangered them in two ways: (1) it created a risk that they would be exposed to pornography, and (2) it created a risk that father would sexually abuse them. On appeal, father assigns error to the court\u2019s conclusion, arguing that there was insufficient evidence that his possession of pornography endangered the children either (1) by creating a risk that they would be exposed to it or (2) by creating a risk that he would sexually abuse them. For the reasons explained below, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">Under ORS 419B.100(l)(c), the juvenile court has \u201cexclusive original jurisdiction\u201d over any case involving a child \u201cwhose condition or circumstances are such as to endanger the welfare\u201d of the child. \u201cEndanger connotes exposure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>\u2018danger,\u2019 which generally involves \u2018the state of being threatened with serious loss or injury[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Shugars, </em>202 Or App 302, 321, 121 P3d 702 (2005) (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>573 (unabridged ed 2002)). Thus, for the juvenile court to have jurisdiction over a child pursuant to ORS 419B.100(l)(c), the child\u2019s condition or circumstances must give rise to a threat of serious loss or injury to the child. The threat must be current. <em>State v. S. T. S., </em>236 Or App 646, 654, 238 P3d 53 (2010) (the state must prove \u201cthat there is a <em>current </em>risk of harm and not simply that the child\u2019s welfare was endangered at some point in the past\u201d (emphasis in original)). And, there must be a reasonable likelihood that the threat will be realized. <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Vanbuskirk, </em>202 Or App 401, 405, 122 P3d 116 (2005) (reasoning that the \u201ckey inquiry in determining whether \u00a3condition[s] or circumstances\u2019 warrant jurisdiction is whether, under the totality of the circumstances, there is a reasonable likelihood of harm to the welfare of the child\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">As mentioned, in this case, the juvenile court took jurisdiction over the children pursuant to ORS 419B.100(l)(c), because, in its view, the children were endangered by father\u2019s possession of pornography for two reasons. But, as father argues, the evidence was legally insufficient to support either reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">First, the juvenile court erred by concluding that it had jurisdiction over the children pursuant to ORS 419B.100(l)(c) on the ground that they might be exposed to the pornography. The state did not present any evidence that exposure to pornography would harm the children, in a way and to a degree, such that the court could take jurisdiction over them. Although we can imagine that an expert might be able to testify to that effect, the state did not present any such testimony. Furthermore, even assuming that exposure to pornography can be a basis for juvenile court jurisdiction over a child, the state failed to present evidence that, in this case, there was a current risk of such exposure for the children at the time of the hearing. The pornography was on computers that had been turned over to the police in July 2009 \u2014 more than a year before the November 2010 hearing that resulted in the judgment at issue in this case \u2014 and there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>was no evidence that father had possessed pornography since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">Second, the juvenile court erred by concluding that father himself posed a risk to his children as a result of his possession of pornography. The court relied on Gilbert\u2019s testimony. But, as described, Gilbert testified that he needed additional information to determine whether father posed an actual risk to his children. Gilbert emphasized that the fact that a person possesses pornography or engages in behavior relating to pornography that is outside the norm does not, in and of itself, mean that the person will commit a sexual offense. Accordingly, to determine whether a person who possesses pornography endangers the welfare of a child, Gilbert testified that he would need information about, for example, how recently and frequently the person used the pornography and what effects the use had on the person\u2019s thoughts and behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">That is understandable. The fact that a parent engages in behavior that could negatively affect his or her parenting does not necessarily mean that the behavior can serve as a basis for juvenile court jurisdiction over a child. <em>See, e.g., C. Z., </em>236 Or App at 442-43 (parent\u2019s substance abuse was an insufficient basis for juvenile court jurisdiction over parent\u2019s child); <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. D. T. C., </em>231 Or App 544, 554-55, 219 P3d 610 (2009) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">For example, we can easily imagine that an expert could testily that alcohol use increases the likelihood that a parent will neglect or abuse his or her child. But, the fact that a parent uses alcohol cannot, in and of itself, be the basis for juvenile court jurisdiction over a child; there must be evidence that the parent\u2019s use of alcohol \u201cendangers the welfare\u201d of the children. ORS 419B.100(l)(c). In other words, there must be evidence that the parent\u2019s use of alcohol gives rise to a current threat of serious loss or injury to the child. <em>S. T. S., </em>236 Or App at 654; <em>Shugars, </em>202 Or App at 321. Evidence of, <em>inter alia, </em>how recently and frequently the parent uses alcohol and the effects of that use on the parent\u2019s conduct would be necessary to determine whether the parent\u2019s alcohol use creates a \u201creasonable likelihood of harm to the welfare\u201d of his or her child. <em>Vanbuskirk, </em>202 Or App at 405. The same is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>true, as Gilbert\u2019s testimony indicates, with respect to father\u2019s possession of pornography in this case. Father\u2019s possession of pornography may well be concerning, as Gilbert testified and the juvenile court concluded. But there is insufficient evidence, on this record, that it created a reasonable risk that father would harm the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-7\"> In March 2010, the police seized two more computers belonging to father, but Anderson testified that he did not find any child pornography on those computers.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
