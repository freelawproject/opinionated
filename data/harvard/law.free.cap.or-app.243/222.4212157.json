When defendant was originally sentenced to probation, his criminal history score included an assault conviction. While he was serving probation, this court reversed his assault conviction. Subsequently, defendant violated the conditions of his probation. Defendant argues that the sentencing court erred in failing to recalculate his criminal history score when the court revoked his probation, and it thereby imposed a sanction that was improper under the sentencing guidelines and in violation of his federal due process rights. We review defendant\u2019s sentence for errors of law. ORS 138.222(4). As explained below, upon revocation of defendant\u2019s probation, the sentencing court was limited to imposing a sanction based on defendant\u2019s criminal history score determined at the time of the original sentencing. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">In 2005, defendant was convicted of assault, and he timely appealed. In 2007 \u2014 while his appeal from the assault conviction was pending in this court \u2014 defendant was charged with third-degree rape, third-degree sodomy, and furnishing alcohol to a minor. Defendant agreed to plead guilty to rape, and, in exchange, the state agreed to drop the sodomy and furnishing alcohol charges. Defendant\u2019s plea petition provided, in part, with handwritten material indicated by italics and printed blank lines indicated by underscoring:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">\u201c5. I know I have the following rights at trial: * * * (7) to require the district attorney to prove * * * all sentence enhancement facts to a jury or court beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">\u201c6. I understand that I give up all of the rights listed in paragraph #5 above when I plead either \u2018Guilty\u2019 or \u2018No Contest.\u2019 * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\">\u00ab* * \u2021 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-10\">\u201c8.

I am signing this plea petition and entering this plea voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly with full understanding of all matters set forth in the charging instrument and in this petition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">The court accepted the plea and, based in part on defendant\u2019s criminal history, including his then-existing assault conviction, classified defendant under grid block 6D for sentencing. That grid block carries a presumptive sentence 13 to 14 months\u2019 incarceration followed by 24 months\u2019 post-prison supervision. Consistently with the terms of the plea, however, the court imposed a downward dispositional departure and upward durational departure sentence of 60 months\u2019 probation. The judgment stated that defendant is subject to all general conditions of probation under ORS 137.540, which, among other things, describes the possible effects of failing to abide by the conditions of probation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>including revocation of probation. Defendant did not appeal his sentence on the rape conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">In 2008, this court reversed defendant\u2019s assault conviction. <em>State v. Anderson, </em>221 Or App 193, 195, 189 P3d 28 (2008). Defendant then violated a term of his probation by failing to attend a sex offender program and the court revoked defendant\u2019s probation in 2009. At the probation revocation proceeding, defendant contended that the court should recalculate the grid block used for sentencing on the rape conviction because, with his assault conviction overturned, his criminal history score should place him in grid block 6G. That grid block carries a presumptive probationary sentence that permits a probation violation sanction of only six months\u2019 incarceration. <em>See </em>OAR 213-010-0002(1). The sentencing court determined that its ability to modify the grid block applicable to defendant at a probation revocation proceeding was limited by OAR 213-010-0002(2), and it sanctioned him to 13 months\u2019 incarceration, in accordance with the term of incarceration provided for in grid block 6D.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">On appeal, defendant first argues that the sentencing court misread how the sentencing guidelines instruct courts to calculate criminal history and that it should have recalculated the grid block based on his criminal history at the time of the probation revocation. The state contends that under the sentencing guidelines, the sanction upon probation revocation is based on the grid block at the time of the original sentencing. At the time the court sentenced defendant to probation in 2006, defendant was in grid block 6D; therefore, the state asserts, the trial court sanctioned defendant with a prison term of the proper duration. We agree with the state and accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">If a defendant fails to comply with the conditions of probation, a court may revoke probation and impose sanctions provided by the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission. ORS 137.545(5)(b). The Oregon Criminal Justice Commission promulgated rules and sentencing guidelines in chapter 213 of the Oregon Administrative Rules. Pertinent in this case, OAR 213-010-0002(2) applies to probation revocations and provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>\u201cFor those offenders whose probationary sentence was * * * a departure from a presumptive prison sentence * * * the sentence upon revocation shall be a prison term up to the maximum presumptive prison term which could have been imposed initially * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">In other words, \u201conce a probationary sentence is executed, \u2018OAR, 213-010-0002 limits the revocation sanctions to those that <em>flow from the gridblock used at the time of sentencing.\u2019 \u201d State v. Bolf, </em>217 Or App 606, 609, 176 P3d 1287 (2008) (quoting <em>State v. Hoffmeister, </em>164 Or App 192, 196, 990 P2d 910 (1999)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Here, the original sentencing court placed defendant in grid block 6D based on his plea petition. The court found reasons for departing from the presumptive 13- to 14-month prison sentence, and defendant received a probationary sentence. Pursuant to OAR 213-010-0002 and <em>Bolf, </em>when the sentencing court revoked defendant\u2019s probation, the court could only impose a sanction that it could have imposed as a sentence initially using grid block 6D. Therefore, the court did not err when it sanctioned defendant to 13 months\u2019 incarceration when it revoked his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">In <em>Bolf, </em>the defendant\u2019s actual criminal history at the time of sentencing was such that the defendant\u2019s grid block was 6C, but the parties stipulated, and the judgment stated, that the defendant would be sentenced to probation under grid block 6F. 217 Or App at 608. When the defendant later violated her probation, the trial court revoked her probation and imposed a revocation sentence based on the defendant\u2019s true grid block, 6C. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, we reversed and explained that, \u201cbecause the judgment states that defendant\u2019s grid block was 6F, that determination defines and constrains the sanctions available upon revocation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 609. Defendant contends that <em>Bolf </em>is not controlling because, unlike in <em>Bolf, </em>he did not stipulate to a fictional grid block, but rather stipulated to a probationary sentence. Defendant\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Bolf </em>fails for two reasons. First, the parties did agree to a grid block. The trial court\u2019s finding that the \u201cparties stipulated to a sentence outside the presumptive sentence range for the stipulated gridblock classification\u201d is supported by the record. Second, in any event, <em>Bolfs </em>holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>does not depend on whether the parties stipulated to a grid block. <em>Bolf </em>stands for the rule that what constrains the court during a probation revocation is the grid block in the judgment, whether stipulated to or not, at the time of the original sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Defendant also contends that his probation revocation hearing should have been treated as a resentencing hearing at which the sentencing court is permitted to recalculate the criminal history score in accordance with OAR 213-004-0006(2) and <em>State v. Bucholz, </em>317 Or 309, 855 P2d 1100 (1993). The sentencing guideline on which defendant relies states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\">\u201cAn offender\u2019s criminal history is based upon the number of adult felony [convictions] * * * in the offender\u2019s criminal history <em>at the time the current crime or crimes of conviction are </em>sentenced.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">OAR 213-004-0006(2) (emphasis added). Defendant\u2019s argument, though, rests on the incorrect assumption that a defendant who is sanctioned when his probation is revoked is being \u201csentenced\u201d for a conviction of a crime as that term is used in OAR 213-004-0006(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">We recently explained the difference between a sentencing proceeding and a probation revocation proceeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-8\">\u201cThe question is whether imposing sanctions upon revocation of probation is \u2018sentencing\u2019 within the meaning of that statute. The relevant statutes appear to draw a distinction between sentencing and the imposition of probation revocation sanctions. ORS 137.120(2), for example, refers to sentencing as occurring after a person \u2018is convicted,\u2019 while, in contrast, ORS 137.545(5)(b) provides that the court that imposed a probationary sentence \u2018may revoke probation supervision and <em>impose a sanction </em>as provided by the rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-9\"><em>State v. Newell, </em>238 Or App 385, 392, 242 P3d 709 (2010) (emphasis in original). Thus, OAR 213-004-0006 does not allow a sentencing court during a revocation proceeding to recalculate a defendant\u2019s criminal history score. Instead, OAR 213-010-0002, which governs probation revocation sanctions, applies. As we held in <em>Bolf, </em>during a probation revocation proceeding, the sentencing court is to impose the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>sanction based on the grid block at the time of the initial sentence. 217 Or App at 609. The sentencing court correctly applied the sentencing guidelines to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">We understand defendant\u2019s last assertion to be that OAR 213-010-0002 is unconstitutional as applied to him. Defendant invokes the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, applicable to the state by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause. He argues that the court improperly used the assault conviction against him when applying his criminal history score from the original sentencing to determine his probation revocation sanction pursuant to OAR 213-010-0002. He contends that the court could only take his acquitted conduct into account at that point if the state proved that he was culpable of that conduct by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Watts, </em>519 US 148, 117 S Ct 633, 136 L Ed 2d 554 (1997) (under United States Sentencing Guidelines, district court could take acquitted conduct into account upon proof defendant was culpable of that conduct by a preponderance of the evidence). The state counters that the trial court did not take defendant\u2019s assault conviction into account at all in determining the revocation sanction; rather, the court merely looked to the plea agreement and held defendant to the sanction that he had agreed would be imposed if he violated the terms of his probation sentence. We agree that, by entering into the plea agreement, defendant relinquished any objection he had based on the guarantee against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Defendant was fully aware that the appeal of his assault charge was pending in this court at the time he entered the plea agreement. In exchange for defendant\u2019s guilty plea on the rape charge, the state dismissed two other charges and defendant received the benefit of a downward dispositional departure. As we noted above, the parties stipulated that defendant\u2019s grid block was <em>\u201c6-D, </em>Presumptive Sentence: <em>13-14 </em>mos[.]\u201d Defendant gave up his right to dispute his prior criminal history when he pleaded guilty. Defendant also knew that he would be subject to sanctions, including the term of imprisonment he ultimately received as a sanction, if he violated the terms of his probation sentence. Defendant entered into the plea agreement knowingly and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>voluntarily. Having entered into the stipulated agreement under these circumstances, defendant relinquished any double jeopardy objection he may have had. See <em>United States v. Broce, </em>488 US 563, 573, 109 S Ct 757, 102 L Ed 2d 927 (1989) (defendants gave up double jeopardy defense by guilty plea even though their counsel had not discussed and they had not focused on possibility of defense when plea was entered); <em>see also State v. Young, </em>188 Or App 247, 252 n 5, 71 P3d 119, <em>rev den, </em>336 Or 125 (2003) (\u201cdefendant waived any double jeopardy objection [under Article I, section 12 of the Oregon Constitution] to the imposition of multiple sentences when he entered into the plea agreement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
