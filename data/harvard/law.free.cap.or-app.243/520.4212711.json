Defendant now petitions for reconsideration of our order dismissing her appeal as moot in December 2010. We originally dismissed the appeal because her probation should have expired in August 2010; due to a probation violation, however, defendant\u2019s probation was extended to December 31, 2011. Thus, defendant remains on probation and her appeal is not moot. We therefore reconsider and withdraw the order of dismissal, allow her petition, and address the merits of her appeal. Defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s judgment, which imposed a special condition of her probation that defendant may not enter a specified \u201chigh vice\u201d area in Portland. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Defendant was arrested for prostitution on 82nd Avenue in Portland, which the prosecutor described at sentencing as an \u201carea where prostitution is a frequent occurrence and where * * * a large portion of arrests for prostitution activity occur.\u201d Defendant did not contest, and the trial court found, that defendant\u2019s crime of prostitution occurred on 82nd Avenue, a \u201chigh vice\u201d area. After pleading no contest to one count of prostitution, ORS 167.007, defendant was sentenced to 18 months of probation. The trial court imposed a special probation condition, ORS 137.540(2), prohibiting defendant from entering certain portions of 82nd Avenue and Sandy Boulevard that were described and delineated on a map as a \u201chigh vice\u201d area, unless she is \u201cin a car or on public transportation passing through the area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Defendant asserts first that the probation condition to exclude her from the specified \u201chigh vice\u201d area is not reasonably related to the crime of conviction; second, that it is more restrictive than necessary to achieve the goals of probation; and third, that it improperly infringes on her constitutional right to freedom of association. We review whether the trial court exceeded its authority to impose a special probation condition for errors of law. <em>State v. Phillips, </em>206 Or App 90, 97, 135 P3d 461 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Preliminarily, we do not reach the merits of defendant\u2019s first argument. Defendant failed to preserve her argument that the probation condition was not reasonably related to her conviction for prostitution, and, if any error occurred, it is not apparent on the face of the record. ORAP 5.45(1) (we may consider an unpreserved error only if it is \u201can error of law apparent on the record\u201d); <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-83, 823 P2d 956 (1991) (discussing court\u2019s exercise of discretion to reach plain error); <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355-56, 800 P2d 259 (1990) (factors to establish plain error).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\">The state contends that we cannot review defendant\u2019s remaining arguments that her probation condition is overbroad and needlessly infringes on her right to freedom of association because defendant pleaded no contest to the crime, and therefore her challenge to the probation condition is limited to whether it exceeds the maximum allowable by law or is unconstitutionally cruel and unusual pursuant to ORS 138.050(3). We do not agree and conclude that the issues defendant raises are reviewable pursuant to ORS 138.053(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">We are presented with a question of statutory interpretation, and we analyze ORS 138.050 in context with ORS 138.053 to ascertain the legislature\u2019s intent under the methodology described in <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993), as modified by <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). In relevant part, ORS 138.050, which addresses appeals from a sentence after a plea of guilty or no contest, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">\u201c(1) * * * [A] defendant who has pleaded guilty or no contest may take an appeal from a judgment or order described in ORS 138.053 only when the defendant makes a colorable showing that the disposition:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">\u201c(a) Exceeds the maximum allowable by law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">\u201c(b) Is unconstitutionally cruel and unusual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">\u201c(3) On appeal under subsection (1) of this section, the appellate court shall consider only whether the disposition:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>\u201c(a) Exceeds the maximum allowable by law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-4\">\u201c(b) Is unconstitutionally cruel and unusual.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The state\u2019s argument that ORS 138.050(3) precludes consideration of the issues that defendant raises on appeal necessarily rests on two premises: defendant\u2019s appeal is \u201cfrom a judgment or order described in ORS 138.053,\u201d ORS 138.050(1), and defendant has brought an appeal under ORS 138.050 that is limited to whether the probation condition exceeds the maximum allowable by law or is unconstitutionally cruel and unusual. ORS 138.050(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">To examine the first premise of the state\u2019s argument, we turn to ORS 138.053, which describes appealable judgments and orders in criminal cases. In relevant part, ORS 138.053 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">\u201c(1) A judgment * * * is subject to the appeal provisions and limitations on review under ORS 138.040 and 138.050 if the disposition includes any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">\u201c(a) Imposition of a sentence on conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-9\">\u201c(b) Suspension of imposition or execution of any part of a sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-10\">\u201c(c) Extension of a period of probation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-11\"><em>\u201c(d) Imposition </em>or modification <em>of a condition of probation </em>or of sentence suspension.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-12\">\u201c(e) Imposition or execution of a sentence upon revocation of probation or sentence suspension.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-13\">H? Hi * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-14\"><em>\u201c(3) Notwithstanding ORS 138.040 and 138.050, upon an appeal from a judgment or order described in subsection (l)(c) to (e) of this section, the appellate court may review the order that </em>extended the period of the defendant\u2019s probation, <em>imposed or modified a condition of the defendant\u2019s probation </em>or sentence suspension or revoked the defendant\u2019s probation or sentence suspension <em>if the defendant shows a colorable claim of error in the proceeding from which the appeal is taken.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-15\">(Emphasis added.) In this case, defendant\u2019s judgment imposes a condition of probation under ORS 138.053(l)(d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Accordingly, we agree with the state that defendant\u2019s appeal is \u201cfrom a judgment or order described in ORS 138.053.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 138.050(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">The state\u2019s argument then falters, though. Subsection (3) of ORS 138.053 indicates that the legislature created three exceptions to the limitations placed on the reviewability of appeals after a no contest or guilty plea within ORS 138.050. <em>See also State v. Anderson, </em>197 Or App 193, 196, 104 P3d 1175 (2005) (noting that ORS 138.050 contains exceptions to its limits on appeals). Defendant\u2019s appeal of a judgment imposing a special condition of probation falls under an exception, ORS 138.053(l)(d), specified in ORS 138.053(3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">\u201cNotwithstanding ORS 138.040 and 138.050, upon an appeal from a judgment or order described in subsection (l)(c) to (e) * * * the appellate court may review the order that * * * imposed * * * a condition of the defendant\u2019s probation * * * if the defendant shows a colorable claim of error in the proceeding from which the appeal is taken.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Therefore, even though defendant pleaded no contest, because her appeal challenges the imposition of a condition of probation, and she has demonstrated a colorable claim of error in the sentencing proceeding, her challenge is reviewable on appeal under ORS 138.053(3). We reached a similar conclusion in <em>State v. Reimers, </em>102 Or App 192, 194 n 2, 793 P2d 1382 (1990), where we construed ORS 138.053(3) (1989). That version of ORS 138.053(3) then provided: \u201cNotwithstanding ORS 138.040 and 138.050, * * * the appellate court may review the order that revoked the defendant\u2019s probation or sentence suspension.\u201d We noted that before the enactment of ORS 138.053 in 1989, the defendant\u2019s appeal of an order revoking his probation and imposing a one-year sentence would not have been reviewable under ORS 138.050 because he was not challenging the length of his sentence or asserting that it constituted cruel and unusual punishment. <em>Reimers, </em>102 Or App at 194 n 2. We thus reach the merits of defendant\u2019s remaining arguments that the probation condition was overbroad and infringed on her federal constitutional right to freedom of association.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Under ORS 137.540, a trial court may impose \u201cany special conditions of probation that are reasonably related to the crime of conviction or the needs of the probationer for the protection of the public or reformation of the probationer, or both.\u201d ORS 137.540(2)(a); <em>accord State v. Martin, </em>282 Or 583, 588, 580 P2d 536 (1978) (probation condition must be related to the offense or promote public safety or the rehabilitation of the defendant). Although a trial court has wide discretion in matters of probation, <em>Martin, </em>282 Or at 589 n 7, a probation condition that is more restrictive than necessary to achieve the goals of probation is invalid. <em>State v. Hitesman / Page, </em>113 Or App 356, 362, 833 P2d 306, <em>rev den, </em>314 Or 574 (1992). And, when fundamental rights are involved, \u201cthe sentencing court has less discretion to impose conditions in conflict therewith.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>282 Or at 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\">Defendant acknowledges that her probation condition is aimed at preventing her from engaging in prostitution or solicitation activity in the \u201chigh vice\u201d area, but argues that the condition \u201cgoes far beyond preventing that behavior.\u201d She notes there is no indication in the record that she has a prior history of engaging in criminal activity in the \u201chigh vice\u201d area, and yet she is banned from legitimate activities within the area, such as shopping or visiting friends. Because the condition \u201cimplicates defendant\u2019s constitutionally protected freedom of association,\u201d she argues that the condition must be strictly limited to what is necessary to make the probation effective. She posits that the exclusion could have been limited to banning her presence after dark or to a ban on loitering on sidewalks in the \u201chigh vice\u201d area.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">We first conclude that the probation condition is reasonably related to the protection of the public or her reformation, or both, as defendant herself appears to acknowledge at least to some degree. Because defendant committed the crime in the \u201chigh vice\u201d area, the trial court could properly conclude that prohibiting defendant from the \u201chigh vice\u201d area except as needed to travel through it would prevent her from reengaging in the offending conduct and at the same time protect the public from further acts of prostitution or solicitation in the same area.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>We also reject defendant\u2019s argument that the probation condition was impermissibly overbroad in light of defendant\u2019s invocation of her fundamental right to freedom of association. Even if defendant is correct that the probation condition could have been more narrowly tailored, that fact alone does not establish that the condition is overbroad or unconstitutionally infringed her freedom of association. In <em>State v. Kline, </em>155 Or App 96, 100, 963 P2d 697 (1998), despite the defendant\u2019s argument that his fundamental right to procreate was implicated, we rejected his argument that the trial court was required to perform a less-restrictive-means analysis when it imposed a special condition of probation that he not father any child without prior written approval of the court following his successful completion of drug treatment and anger management programs. We approved the special condition given that the defendant had fathered two children whom he had physically abused, the condition was not a total ban on his reproductive rights, and the condition provided protection to potential victims. <em>Id. </em>at 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">In this case, the trial court took into account the nature of the crime and considered the appropriateness of the condition, including modifying the condition to ensure that defendant could travel within the \u201chigh vice\u201d area. Defendant is not prohibited from associating with friends; she just may not visit with them in the \u201chigh vice\u201d area. And although defendant may not frequent stores in the \u201chigh vice\u201d area during her probation, she makes no argument that she suffers any particular harm as a result of having to shop elsewhere. We note that by statute, a probation condition can include much greater intrusions upon a defendant\u2019s freedom of association than those imposed on defendant in this case, including having to spend time in jail and being restricted to the probationer\u2019s residence. ORS 137.540(2)(a). The trial court chose a less restrictive alternative to achieve the aims of probation. We conclude that the special probation condition interferes with defendant\u2019s right of association to a permissible degree in light of its reasonable relationship to the purposes of probation. <em>State v. Sprague, </em>52 Or App 1063, 1067, 629 P2d 1326, <em>rev den, </em>291 Or 514 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Reconsideration allowed, former disposition withdrawn; affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b542-16\"> The legislature amended ORS 138.053 in 2001 and 2003, Or Laws 2003, ch 737, \u00a7 101; Or Laws 2001, eh 644, \u00a7 2, and our previous interpretations of the statute have concerned prior versions of it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
