J.</author>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">Claimant seeks review of an order of the Department of Human Services (the department) determining that claimant\u2019s household is ineligible for Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), a state and federally funded program that benefits children who are \u201cdeprived of parental support\u201d because of, among other things, the unemployment of a parent. ORS 412.001(3)(a)(A). The department based its denial on its administrative rule providing that no deprivation occurs \u201cbased on unemployment\u201d if the parent who is the primary wage earner has been or would be disqualified from receiving unemployment compensation. OAR 461-125-0170(4) (2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to claimant, the statutes governing administration of the TANF program require the state to provide benefits to all two-parent families in which the primary wage earner is unemployed, with a single exception: families where that wage earner is unemployed because he or she refuses without good cause to accept employment. Claimant contends that, by creating an exception that disqualifies more households than are contemplated by the legislature, the rule exceeds the department\u2019s statutory authority and is therefore invalid. ORS <em>183.400; Planned Parenthood Assn. v. Dept. of Human Res., </em>297 Or 562, 687 P2d 785 (1984). Consequently, claimant argues, the order must be reversed because it is based on the rule.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Oregon\u2019s TANF program is an outgrowth of federal programs beginning in the 1930s with Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), 42 USC section 606(a). The United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Batterton v. Francis, </em>432 US 416, 419, 97 S Ct 2399, L Ed 2d 448 (1977), provides a convenient history. Congress first created a welfare program for two-parent families in 1961, known as AFDC-UF, \u201cto provide assistance in some cases where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>unemployment of a parent causes dependent children to be needy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>States that elected to participate in the program were required to provide assistance where a needy child \u201chas been deprived of parental support or care by reason of the unemployment (as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary) of his father\u201d; states opting to participate received matching funds from the federal government. <em>Id. </em>at 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">In <em>Batterton, </em>the Supreme Court considered and rejected a challenge to a Maryland administrative rule, patterned after 45 CFR \u00a7 233.100(a)(1) (1976), a federal rule promulgated by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. That rule gave the states the option of disqualifying families where the primary wage earner was \u201cunemployed * * * by reason of conduct or circumstances which result or would result in disqualification for unemployment compensation under the State\u2019s unemployment compensation law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 418 n 1. The Court in <em>Batterton </em>explained the limited standard for its review of the regulation, noting that Congress had expressly delegated to the Secretary the power to prescribe standards for determining what constitutes \u201cunemployment\u201d for purposes of AFDC-UF eligibility. Thus, the Court explained, Congress had entrusted the Secretary, not the courts, with the primary responsibility for interpreting the statutory term. The Court said that the Secretary\u2019s definition of \u201cunemployment\u201d could be set aside only if it exceeded the authority delegated to the Secretary by Congress. The Court further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">\u201cOf course, the Secretary\u2019s statutory authority to prescribe standards is not unlimited. He could not, for example, adopt a regulation that bears no relationship to any recognized concept of unemployment or that would defeat the purpose of the AFDC-UF program. But the regulation here at issue does not even approach these limits of the delegated authority. By allowing the States to exclude persons who would be disqualified under the State\u2019s unemployment compensation law, the Secretary has incorporated a well-known and widely applied standard for \u2018unemployment.\u2019 Exclusion of individuals who are out of work as a result of their own conduct and thus disqualified from state unemployment compensation is consistent with the goal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>AFDC-UF, namely, to aid the families of the involuntarily unemployed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 428-29. The upshot of <em>Batterton, </em>then, is that the Secretary did not exceed the authority of federal statutes when he gave states the option to exclude families based on the primary wage earner\u2019s disqualification for state unemployment benefits. The parties do not contend, and we do not suggest, that the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Batterton </em>is authority for the department\u2019s rule in this case, but it nonetheless provides relevant background in two ways. First, it demonstrates that Oregon <em>could </em>adopt the disqualification of households such as claimant\u2019s; second, it demonstrates that the Oregon legislature has not done so, even though it has adopted the other optional disqualification, listed in the same section of the federal regulation, allowing exclusion where the primary wage earner has rejected employment. 45 CFR \u00a7 233.100(a)(3)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Since 1961, Oregon has participated in the various two-parent public assistance programs that Congress has authorized, and TANF, created by Congress in 1996, is the current version. Under ORS 412.006, any \u201cdependent child\u201d who is living in a home that meets the standards of care and health fixed by the rules of the Department of Human Services \u201cshall be granted\u201d aid pursuant to TANF. ORS 412.001(3)(a) defines a \u201cdependent child\u201d as a needy child \u201c[w]ho has been deprived of parental support or care by reason of the death, continued absence from the home or physical or mental incapacity, or unemployment or underemployment, of a parent.\u201d ORS 412.034 states that aid under ORS 412.006 \u201cshall not be granted with respect to, or on behalf of, a dependent child living with an unemployed parent if, and for as long as, the unemployed parent of such child refuses without good cause to accept employment in which the unemployed parent is able to engage[.]\u201d The statutes do not define \u201cunemployment\u201d or \u201cunemployed\u201d for purposes of TANF.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The department has extensive rulemaking authority to implement public assistance programs. For example, ORS 411.060 gives the department broad rulemaking authority with regard to all public assistance programs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>\u201c[T]he Department of Human Services shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-4\">\u201c(1) Administer and supervise all public assistance programs;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\">\u201c(2) Determine eligibility for all public assistance programs; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-6\">\u201c(3) Adopt and enforce rules necessary to ensure full compliance with federal and state laws relating to public assistance programs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Under ORS 411.070, the department must \u201cby rule fix statewide uniform standards for all public assistance programs and effect uniform observance thereof throughout the state.\u201d ORS 412.006(8) provides that \u201c[t]he department shall adopt rules to carry out the provisions of [TANF].\u201d ORS 412.049(2) further requires that the department \u201c[m]ake such rules and regulations and take such actions as may be necessary or desirable for carrying out ORS 412.001 to 412.155 and 418.647.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">The department has developed rules for implementation of TANF. OAR 461-125-0010 provides that, to be eligible for TANF, a dependent child must be \u201cdeprived.\u201d The rule defines \u201cdeprivation\u201d in conformity with the statutory definition of a \u201cdependent child,\u201d as \u201cthe loss of parental support or care because of the absence, death, incapacity, unemployment, or underemployment of a parent.\u201d The rule at issue in this case, OAR 461-125-0170, provided, \u201cDeprivation based on the unemployment or underemployment\u201d of the primary wage earner \u201cexists if all the following are true:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-9\">\u201c(1) A child lives with two parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-10\">\u201c(2) The [primary wage earner] is unemployed or underemployed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-11\">\u201c(3) The [primary wage earner] is not participating in a labor dispute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-12\">\u201c(4) <em>The [primary wage earner] is not unemployed from their most recent job for reasons that would or do result in disqualification for [unemployment compensation] benefits in Oregon.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-13\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b89-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Claimant\u2019s household consists of herself, her boyfriend Sims, and their daughter, born September 3, 2007. Sims was the primary wage earner for the family. In February 2008, he was discharged for misconduct connected with work and, for that reason, disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits. Claimant applied for TANF benefits. Because claimant\u2019s daughter lives with both of her parents, claimant\u2019s claim is governed by the rules applying to two-parent households, and \u201cdeprivation\u201d must be based on either the incapacity of a parent, or the unemployment or underemployment of the primary wage earner. The record does not show that either parent is incapacitated. The department found that Sims was the primary wage earner and was unemployed at the time of the application for reasons that disqualified him from receiving unemployment benefits. Accordingly, the department denied the application for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">On judicial review, claimant contends that the department erred in denying her application for TANF benefits because the department\u2019s rule denying eligibility when the primary wage earner has been discharged for any and all reasons that disqualify him from unemployment benefits is inconsistent with the statutes creating the entitlement to TANF, and the department therefore exceeded its authority in promulgating the rule. Claimant\u2019s primary focus is on ORS 412.001(3)(A)(a), the statute defining a dependent child as one who has been deprived of parental support by reason of the parent\u2019s unemployment, and on ORS 412.006, which requires that TANF benefits \u201cshall be granted\u201d to <em>\u201cany </em>dependent child.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In claimant\u2019s view, those provisions together require that the state pay TANF benefits when the dependent child\u2019s primary wage earning parent is unemployed and that there is only one statutorily recognized exception: ORS 412.034, which expressly excludes from eligibility the child of a parent who is unemployed and \u201crefuses without good cause to accept employment in which the unemployed parent is able to engage.\u201d In claimant\u2019s view, if the legislature had intended to authorize further restrictions on the eligibility for benefits based on unemployment\u2014 including those in OAR 461-125-0170(4) \u2014 it would have so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>stated expressly and, in the absence of a statutorily created exception, there is no authority for the department\u2019s rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">The state counters that the fact that the legislature has expressly described one exclusion from eligibility does not mean that the department lacks authority to develop others. The state notes that ORS 412.161 sets forth the legislature\u2019s policy in enacting TANF and includes the statement that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-5\">\u201cbecause federal law now requires recent employment and active work search to be eligible for federal funds for public assistance to two-parent unemployed families, the availability of federal funds helps those families who are trying hardest to help themselves be self-supporting.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">In the state\u2019s view, the exclusion from eligibility when the primary wage earner has been discharged for a reason that disqualifies the individual from unemployment is perfectly consonant with the legislature\u2019s stated policy. Further, the state points to the many statutory provisions that authorize the department to implement assistance programs through the adoption of administrative rules, and it asserts that the disputed rule is well within the authority provided by those statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">We find the department\u2019s arguments to be unpersuasive. The text of the TANF statutes is emphatic and unambiguous: Aid under</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\">\u201cthe [TANF] program <em>shall </em>be granted under this section to <em>any </em>dependent child who is living in a home meeting the standards of care and health fixed by the rules of the Department of Human Services and who is a resident of the State of Oregon, if a parent or caretaker relative with whom the child is living is a resident of the State of Oregon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">ORS 412.006(1) (emphasis added). A \u201cdependent child,\u201d in turn, is a needy child \u201cwho has been deprived of parental support * * * by reason of * * * unemployment or underemployment of a parent.\u201d ORS 412.001(3)(a). We agree with the department that the TANF statutes grant broad rulemaking authority to the department, including rules that determine eligibility for assistance programs. ORS 411.060(2). That fact, however, does not address, much less dispose of, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>issue in this case, which is whether a particular rule is within that grant of authority, however broad it might otherwise be.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">If the legislature had simply created TANF and done nothing more, the department\u2019s argument based on the general, broad grant of authority would have considerable force, and the absence of a more express grant would be insignificant. The legislature, however, has done more; it has stated in a statute \u2014 indeed, in the first section of the first substantive TANF statute \u2014 the unambiguous mandate described above. ORS 412.006(1). Moreover, that mandate is not merely aspirational; compare, for example, ORS 412.161, which lists legislative findings, all of which are couched in nonoperational terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-5\">\u201cThe Legislative Assembly finds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-6\">\u201c(1) That the provision of public assistance to children dependent by reasons of unemployment of parents would help keep families together and reduce hardship in times of high unemployment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">\u201c(2) That the lack of public assistance to two-parent unemployed families does not produce significant financial savings for the State of Oregon since family break-up increases the number of single-parent families receiving public assistance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">\u201c(3) That children in two-parent unemployed families have needs as urgent as those of children in single-parent unemployed families;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-9\">\u201c(4) That the provision of public assistance to two-parent unemployed families would provide access to medical care for these families, health being one of the prerequisites to seeking and maintaining employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-10\">\u201c(5) That because federal law now requires recent employment and active work search to be eligible for federal funds for public assistance to two-parent unemployed families, the availability of federal funds helps those families who are trying hardest to help themselves be self-supporting; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-11\">\u201c(6) That additional funds need to be made available in the temporary assistance for needy families program to effectuate this policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Further, by enacting one exception to the mandate \u2014 ORS 412.034, disqualifying households where the unemployed primary wage earner refuses employment without good cause \u2014 the legislature has signaled that, if exceptions are to be made, the legislature will make them itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">The department acknowledges much of the above, but maintains that O.AR 461-125-0170 is not an exception to the legislative mandate; rather, it is a definition of the term \u201cunemployment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">That argument suffers from a decisively fatal flaw. \u201cUnemployment\u201d is expressly and concisely defined in the rule immediately following the disputed rule: a primary wage earner is \u201cunemployed or underemployed if their monthly earned income is less than the countable income limit for their need group size.\u201d OAR 461-135-0180. The challenged rule, by its phrasing and its operation, is an <em>exception </em>to the rule that children in households with an unemployed primary wage earner \u2014 as defined by the department itself \u2014 are to be granted assistance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">\u201cDeprivation based on the unemployment or underemployment of the [primary wage earner] exists if all of the following are true: * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">* * * iji</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-8\">\u201c(4) The [primary wage earner] is not unemployed from their <em>most recent job </em>for reasons that would or do result in disqualification for U[nemployment] (Compensation] benefits in Oregon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">(Emphasis in original.) The department points to nothing in the TANF statutes or in the principles of administrative law that authorizes it to promulgate a rule that is inconsistent with the emphatic and unambiguous mandate to provide aid to any child who is deprived of care due to the unemployment of the primary wage earner parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">The department nonetheless argues that our opinion in <em>Brannon v. AFSD, </em>141 Or App 564, 575, 920 P2d 161 (1996), <em>rev den, </em>325 Or 45 (1997), should guide our analysis here. In <em>Brannon, </em>the claimant sought review of an order of the Adult and Family Services Division that had denied her benefits under the Oregon Health Plan (OHP) for failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>comply with the provisions of an administrative rule, contending that the rule was inconsistent with state and federal law. The pertinent version of the administrative rule, OAR 461-135-1100(4), denied OHP benefits to people who had been denied cash benefits under the Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) program \u2014 the predecessor to TANF\u2014 because they had failed to participate in the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills (JOBS) program. The claimant chose not to participate in the JOBS program so that she could continue an educational program that did not qualify as an alternative to the JOBS program. When the claimant stopped receiving ADC benefits, the department denied benefits on the basis of its administrative rule. The claimant argued that OAR 461-135-1100(4) impermissibly limited the population of persons otherwise eligible for OHP benefits by creating additional criteria for eligibility that did not appear in the statutes. In particular, she pointed to ORS 414.032, which provided that \u201cmedical assistance shall be <em>made available </em>to persons who are categorically needy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575 (emphasis to statutory language added in <em>Brannon). </em>The court stated that, due to the emphasized language, the statute did not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-4\">\u201cunambiguously indicate that the legislature intended that JOBS-disqualified people would be entitled to medical assistance if their income was below the federal poverty level. One could argue that the medical assistance is \u2018made available\u2019 to claimant so long as she participates in the JOBS program. Therefore, we turn to other relevant statutes to aid us in our inquiry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-5\"><em>Id. </em>The \u201cother relevant\u201d statutes to which the court turned included ORS 414.036(2), a statute underlying the state\u2019s medical assistance program, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">\u201cIn order to provide access to health services for those in need, to <em>contain rising health services costs </em>through appropriate incentives to providers, payers and consumers, to reduce or eliminate cost shifting and to promote the stability of the health services delivery system and the health and well-being of all Oregonians, it is the policy of the State of Oregon to provide medical assistance to those individuals in need whose family income is below the federal poverty level and who are <em>eligible for services under the programs authorized by this </em>chapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>(Emphasis added.) One program \u201cauthorized by this chapter\u201d was the JOBS program. That language, the court emphasized, \u201cdemonstrates that the legislature intended there to be eligibility criteria other than sub-poverty-level income.\u201d <em>Brannon, </em>141 Or App at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\"><em>Brannon </em>and the present case do not deal with the same statutory scheme, the same text, or the same evident legislative intent. First, even if we accept that \u201cmedical assistance shall be made available\u201d is \u201cnot unambiguous[ ],\u201d and \u201cit could be argued\u201d that it means something other than what it appears to mean, the language in the TANF statutes \u2014 \u201cAid pursuant to [TANF] shall be <em>granted </em>under this section to <em>any dependent child\u201d </em>\u2014 is not susceptible to such interpretation. It cannot \u201cbe argued\u201d that aid is \u201cgranted\u201d to \u201cany dependent child\u201d when it is not granted to some dependent children. Further, <em>Brannon </em>uses the supposed ambiguity of \u201cmade available,\u201d not to decide the issue, but to justify examining other statutes. Those statutes have no counterpart in the TANF laws. Nothing in the TANF statutes expresses a policy to take into account \u201crising costs.\u201d Indeed, in 2007, the Oregon legislature overhauled the TANF program and, in the process, <em>repealed </em>a statute that made TANF assistance to dependent children of unemployed parents contingent on the availability of \u201cfunds expressly appropriated and specifically available\u201d for the program. <em>Former </em>ORS 418.185 (2005), <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 2007, ch 861, \u00a7 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">More significantly, the policy statement in the statutory program at issue in <em>Brannon </em>referred to the department\u2019s authority to impose criteria from other \u201cprograms authorized by this chapter.\u201d ORS 414.036(2). Nothing in the TANF statutory scheme authorizes, expressly or by implication, application of criteria imported from any other statutory programs, much less from a program such as unemployment compensation that derives from an entirely different statutory scheme and is administered by an entirely different agency. We are not persuaded that <em>Brannon </em>provides guidance here.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-6\"> The disputed rule has been amended. Because the 2007 rule was in effect when the department issued the order in this case, references throughout to the rules are to the 2007 version.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b85-7\"> The disputed order in this case was issued in December 2008. In 2009, the Legislative Assembly enacted a statute that unambiguously authorizes the department to deny TANF benefits \u201cto a family in which a caretaker relative is disqualified from receiving unemployment insurance based upon the reason for the separation from employment.\u201d Or Laws 2009, ch 827, \u00a7 22.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
