J.</author>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Defendant appeals from a judgment, following a jury trial, convicting her of one count of using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct, ORS 163.670; one count of second-degree sodomy, ORS 163.395; two counts of first-degree sexual abuse, ORS 163.427; and one count of second-degree rape, ORS 163.365. We reject all but one of defendant\u2019s numerous assignments of error without discussion, writing only to address her contention that the trial court erred in denying her motion for judgment of acquittal on the charge of using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct. We reject that contention and, accordingly, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The pertinent facts are few. Defendant and her husband engaged in a series of sexual acts with a 13-year-old child. Also, they each observed the other engaging in sexual contact with the child during the course of those encounters. In addition, defendant\u2019s husband instructed the child regarding how to engage in certain sexual acts with defendant, and the child then did as instructed. Defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal with respect to the charge of using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct, contending that she could not be convicted of that crime \u201c[b]ecause the only other observer of the sexual activity was a participant in the sexual activity[.]\u201d The trial court denied the motion, and defendant ultimately was convicted of that charge, among others.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">On appeal, defendant renews the arguments that she made before the trial court. She asserts that ORS 163.670 \u201cdoes not apply to participants in an activity that is not disseminated by performance or recording.\u201d According to defendant, because her husband was the other person who observed defendant\u2019s sexual conduct with the child, and because he was also a participant in the sexual activity, ORS 163.670 does not apply. The state, on the other hand, asserts that, by its unambiguous text, \u201cthe statute applies whenever one person sexually abuses a child and <em>any </em>other person is permitted to observe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">Defendant\u2019s contention about the application of ORS 163.670 presents a question of statutory construction. Accordingly, we examine the text of the statute in context <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>and in light of any pertinent legislative history proffered by the parties in order to determine the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). In construing a statute, we give words of common usage their \u201cplain, natural, and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 611, 859 P2d 1143 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">ORS 163.670(1) makes it unlawful to use a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-5\">\u201cA person commits the crime of using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct if the person employs, authorizes, permits, compels or induces a child to participate or engage in sexually explicit conduct <em>for any person to observe </em>or to record in a photograph, motion picture, videotape or other visual recording.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">(Emphasis added.) The purpose of the series of statutes of which ORS 163.670 is a part is to prevent \u201cthe underlying harm caused by child sexual abuse.\u201d <em>State v. Stoneman, </em>323 Or 536, 547, 920 P2d 535 (1996). The statute does not restrict its reach to observation only by people who have not also participated in sexually explicit conduct with the child nor to conduct that is visually recorded. Rather, the statute makes it unlawful to compel or induce a child to participate in sexually explicit conduct for <em>any person </em>to observe. <em>See Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>97 (unabridged ed 2002) (the plain meaning of \u201cany\u201d includes \u201cone, no matter what one : EVERY\u201d); <em>id. </em>(\u201canyone\u201d means \u201cany person indiscriminately\u201d); <em>see also Fleming v. United Services Automobile Assn., </em>329 Or 449, 456, 988 P2d 378 (1999) (\u201cany\u201d may be used synonymously with \u201cevery\u201d); <em>Lesser v. Great Lakes </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number><em>Casualty Co., </em>171 Or 174, 184, 135 P2d 810 (1943) (\u201cThe words \u2018any person or persons\u2019 are most comprehensive and unambiguous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)). Accordingly, when, as here, a person engages in sexually explicit conduct with a child for another person to observe (whether or not that other person also has engaged in such conduct with the child and whether or not the conduct is recorded), that conduct comes directly within the statute\u2019s scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Defendant nonetheless contends that the legislative history supports her view that ORS 163.670 does not apply to an observer who also has participated in the sexually explicit conduct. Specifically, defendant points to the fact that the statute was enacted \u201cas section 3 of Senate [B]ill 375 (1985)\u201d and that bill was entitled \u201c[rjelating to child pornography.\u201d <em>See </em>Or Laws 1985, ch 557, \u00a7 3. In addition, defendant points to other legislative history stating that the bill was proposed to fight \u201cchild pornography,\u201d Staff Measure Analysis, Senate Judiciary Committee, SB 375 (1985), and \u201cexpand[ed] the coverage of the statute to include persons who authorize or permit a child to engage in [sexual] conduct for others to view or record[,]\u201d Staff Measure Analysis, House Judiciary Committee, SB 375 (1985). According to defendant, in light of the references to \u201cpornography,\u201d and the plain meaning of that term \u2014 \u201ca depiction (as in writing or painting) of licentiousness or lewdness : a portrayal of erotic behavior designed to cause sexual excitement[,]\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 1767\u2014 the statute cannot encompass the type of observation at issue here. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">To begin with, contrary to defendant\u2019s view, the legislative history to which defendant refers actually suggests an intention to encompass conduct like that at issue here. It refers directly to persons who authorize or permit a child to engage in sexual conduct for others to view, indicating that the statute was intended to apply to conduct viewed by a person who was actually present. Further, even assuming that the title of the bill imparts any information about the legislature\u2019s intent as to the meaning of the statutory language, the use of the term \u201cpornography\u2019 in the legislative history does not undermine our conclusion. Although that term may refer to a written or visual depiction of sexual conduct, as defendant points out, it is also broad enough to include acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>done before a live observer to cause sexual excitement. <em>See Webster\u2019s </em>at 1767; <em>see also id. </em>at 1769 (\u201cportray\u201d means \u201cenact\u201d). That the sexually explicit conduct was done for the observation of a person who also sexually abused the child is of no import.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">In all events, even if we agreed with defendant that the legislative history was inconsistent with the statute\u2019s plain meaning, \u201clegislative history cannot substitute for, or contradict the text of, [a] statute.\u201d <em>White v. Jubitz Corp., </em>347 Or 212, 223, 219 P3d 556 (2009). Given that the statute clearly encompasses the conduct at issue, and no latent ambiguity is suggested by the legislative history, <em>see Gaines, </em>346 Or at 172-73, defendant\u2019s contentions are unavailing. We see no indication that the legislature intended to preclude the statute from applying when a person both observes and engages in sexually explicit conduct with a child. Indeed, all indications are to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Here, defendant engaged in sexually explicit conduct with a child while her husband watched (and at times directed), and he engaged in conduct that she watched. Thus, defendant compelled or induced a child to engage in sexually explicit conduct with her \u201cfor any person\u201d \u2014 in this case, her husband \u2014 to observe. The statute, by its terms, encompasses defendant\u2019s conduct and, accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b115-7\"> Pursuant to ORS 163.665(3),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-8\">\u201c \u2018Sexually explicit conduct\u2019 means actual or simulated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-9\">\u201c(a) Sexual intercourse or deviant sexual intercourse;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-10\">\u201c(b) Genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital or oral-anal contact, whether between persons of the same or opposite sex or between humans and animals;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-11\">\u201c(c) Penetration of the vagina or rectum by any object other than as part of a medical diagnosis or treatment or as part of a personal hygiene practice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-12\">\u201c(d) Masturbation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-13\">\u201c(e) Sadistic or masochistic abuse; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-14\">\u201c(f) Lewd exhibition of sexual or other intimate parts.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
