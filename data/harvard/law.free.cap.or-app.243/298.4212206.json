J.</author>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Petitioner Oregon Shores Conservation Coalition (OSCC) appeals the circuit court\u2019s judgment in a writ of review proceeding that affirmed respondent Clatsop County\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> determination that respondents Gary and Beverly Aspmo (the Aspmos) have a vested right to complete development of a 30-lot residential subdivision in compliance with county and state waivers issued pursuant to Ballot Measure 37 (2004).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, OSCC contends that the reviewing court misconstrued the applicable law in sustaining the county\u2019s determination that the Aspmos had a vested right to complete that development because (1) the Aspmos \u201chad no final plat approval or building permits and had not initiated the <em>use\u201d </em>\u2014 viz., the construction of residences; (2) a significant portion of the Aspmos\u2019 development expenditures were not made in good faith; and (3) there was not adequate consideration of the expenditure ratio \u2014 that is, a comparison of the relevant expenditures to the \u201ctotal project cost.\u201d Further, OSCC contends that the reviewing court erred in upholding the county\u2019s finding that the Aspmos\u2019 expenditures could not be adapted to an alternative lawful use because that finding was not supported by substantial evidence. Consistently with our decision in <em>Friends of Yamhill County v. Board of Commissioners, </em>237 Or App 149, 165-68, 176, 178, 238 P3d 1016 (2010), <em>rev allowed, </em>349 Or 602 (2011), we reject OSCC\u2019s legal contentions concerning good faith and the initiation of construction and lack of permits without further discussion but conclude that the court should have remanded the decision to the county to determine the total project cost and to give proper weight to the expenditure ratio in the circumstances of this case. Further, for the reasons that we will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>explain, we conclude that OSCC\u2019s contentions concerning the adaptability of expenditures are unreviewable. Accordingly, we reverse and remand the reviewing court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">The material facts are uncontroverted. In 1995, the Aspmos obtained state and county waivers that allowed for the development of a 30-lot residential subdivision. The Aspmos subsequently obtained preliminary subdivision approval and claimed to have expended over $200,000 to develop the property before Measure 49 became effective on December 6, 2007. <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Thereafter, the Aspmos applied to the county\u2019s Director of Transportation and Development Services for a determination that they had a vested right to complete and continue the use described in the Measure 37 waivers, and OSCC submitted comments in response to the application. The director determined that \u201cthe Aspmos have demonstrated a vested right to continue and complete phase one of their development as a residential subdivision, and to construct dwellings on each of the five lots in phase one,\u201d but that they \u201chave not demonstrated a vested right to complete and continue development of the remainder of the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Significantly, unlike in other cases that we have considered,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the director determined that, in calculating the vested right expenditure ratio, the cost of residences must be included in the denominator. The director noted that, even though the \u201cAspmos did not include the cost of constructing homes on each lot in the subdivision,\u201d he could rely on a \u201crough estimate,\u201d which \u201cassumfed] the current average price per square foot of $120, for homes between 1,500 and 2,500 square feet.\u201d In light of that estimate, the director determined that \u201cthe Aspmos ha[d] spent between 2% and <em>3% </em>of the total cost to develop the property\u201d and, thus, that the expenditure ratio \u201cfactor weighted] against a vested right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\">The director also determined that the adaptability factor \u2014 that is, whether the expenditures could apply to other uses of the property \u2014 \u201cweighted] against a vested right.\u201d Specifically, the director reasoned that, even though the expenditures \u201care contrary to the property\u2019s use for forest operations,\u201d most of those expenditures \u201ccould have been used for the 1-10 lots that would have been permitted by Measure 49[.]\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Pursuant to a local procedure, the Aspmos appealed the director\u2019s decision to the board of commissioners, and, again, OSCC submitted comments. With regard to the expenditure ratio, the board agreed with the director that \u201cthe cost of constructing homes is properly included in the total project cost * * In determining the total project cost in this case, the board determined that it could properly consider \u201ca range of the potential total cost\u201d of development. Specifically, the board explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>\u201cThere is conflicting evidence in the record as to the total costs associated with constructing homes in the Subdivision. Opponent 1000 Friends of Oregon submitted evidence estimating that the total project cost is approximately $10,024,880. The Director roughly estimated that homes would cost $120 a square foot to construct and that homes would range from 1,500 to 2,500 square feet in size. At this rate, the Director calculated a total project cost ranging from $5,000,000 to $9,000,000. The Aspmos countered this testimony with evidence that homes could be constructed on the Property for substantially less than the Director estimates, particularly if they implemented prefabricated or modular construction techniques. In such case, the cost of constructing the homes could be as low as $31 a square foot. If the homes cost only $31 a square foot and were 1,812 square feet in size, the Aspmos could construct all 30 homes for approximately $1,680,000, bringing the total project cost to $2,840,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">\u201cThe Board finds that it is reasonable to consider these estimates as a range of the potential total cost for developing the Subdivision with a dwelling on each lot. This range extends from $2,840,000 to $10,024,880. The Aspmos have incurred eligible expenses totaling $244,772.89. These expenses represent between 2.4% and 8.6% of the total project cost. Although the Board finds that the Aspmos\u2019 expenditures are substantial in nature, the Board finds that there is insufficient evidence to support a determination that the expenditure ratio weighs in favor of finding a vested right to complete and continue development of the Subdivision with a dwelling on each lot.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Further, the board reasoned that, even though it did not weigh in favor of a determination of vesting, the ratio factor \u201cshould have lesser importance in the overall analysis of the Application.\u201d According to the board, that was so because \u201cthe over $7,000,000 range in cost estimates and the current volatility of the credit and housing markets renders these figures inherently unreliable\u201d such that \u201cthe resulting expenditure ratio is not informative in this context.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">With regard to the issue of the adaptability of expenditures, the board determined that the director\u2019s determination that the Aspmos\u2019 expenditures could apply to other uses was not supported by the evidence. Specifically, the board reasoned, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>\u201cEvidence in the record establishes that the Aspmos\u2019 activities through the effective date of [Measure] 49 are <em>more </em>consistent with development of a 30-lot subdivision than with any other permitted use of the Property. For example, the Aspmos expended funds to obtain permits in furtherance of a 30-lot subdivision, cleared and graded the Property to support a 30-lot subdivision, drilled wells of sufficient size to support the first phase of a 30-lot subdivision, and installed internal roads of sufficient size and location to support a 30-lot subdivision. Thus, the infrastructure was entirely inconsistent with development of forest or agricultural options, which are the only uses permitted in the underlying * * * zoning district. Moreover, this infrastructure was greatly oversized for the only other viable alternative under [Measure] 49 \u2014 the so-called \u2018Express\u2019 option [pursuant to section 6], which could allow up to three (3) homesites.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">(Emphasis in original.) Accordingly, the board \u201cfound that [the Aspmos\u2019] Application satisfies [the adaptability] factor.\u201d Stated differently, the board found that the Aspmos\u2019 expenditures were <em>not </em>adaptable to an alternative use.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Ultimately, the board determined that the Aspmos had \u201ca common law vested right to complete and continue development of the Subdivision on the Property with thirty (30) lots and a single-family dwelling on each lot.\u201d OSCC sought review of the board\u2019s decision, by way of writ of review, in the circuit court. <em>See </em>ORS 195.318.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The reviewing court\u2019s reasoning, expressed in its letter opinion, was limited to the following observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">\u201cI am in agreement with [the Aspmos\u2019] arguments as to each issue in dispute. Specifically, that the Aspmos\u2019 efforts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>expenditures, actions and progress toward completing their subdivision plan have been obvious and substantial; that their use complied with the waivers issued by the county and state; and that the county did not improperly construe the applicable law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Ultimately, the court entered a judgment affirming the board\u2019s decision. OSCC appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">On appeal, with regard to the expenditure ratio, OSCC contends that the county and the reviewing court, in sustaining the county\u2019s decision, misconstrued the applicable law in applying the expenditure ratio. Specifically, OSCC contends that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">\u201c[rlather than evaluating total project cost based on the proposed development as presented during the land use application process, [the county] considered a narrower, low-end range of costs based on [the Aspmos\u2019] assertion, made for the first time during the vesting determination, that they would place inexpensive prefabricated modular structures on the land. [The county] and the [reviewing] court ignored the stated plans for build-to-suit 3,000 square foot minimum and larger homes and instead relied on placement of 1,800 square foot manufactured homes. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">\u201cThe approach taken by [the county] and accepted by the [reviewing] court sets up a standard allowing [the Aspmos] to present an after the fact lowball figure for a total project cost in order to create the appearance of greater expenditures incurred. Creating a lower denominator after December 6, 2007[,] in order to artificially elevate the ratio of expenditures incurred skews the vesting analysis in a manner that is inconsistent with the common law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Further, OSCC contends that \u201c[t]he expenditure ratio, properly considered, deserves at least equal weight in the vesting analysis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">With regard to the county\u2019s adaptability finding, OSCC does not focus on whether the county applied the proper legal standard in determining whether the Aspmos\u2019 expenditures were adaptable. Instead, OSCC raises a substantial evidence challenge. In particular, OSCC contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>\u201cThe courts look not only to the substantiality of expenditures, but also to whether those expenditures \u2018could apply to various other uses of the land.\u2019 <em>[Clackamas Co. </em>v.] <em>Holmes, </em>265 Or [193,] 199[, 508 P2d 190 (1973)]. Expenditures and improvements have been found to be adaptable where there is an economically reasonable alternative use available. <em>Webber </em>[v. <em>Clackamas </em>County], 42 Or App [151,] 155-56[, 600 P2d 448, <em>rev den, </em>288 Or 81 (1979)]. The claimant bears the burden of showing expenditures are incompatible with alternative uses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-4\">\u201cUnder current zoning, [the Aspmos\u2019] property could be used for forestry or agricultural purposes. In addition, [section 6 of] Measure 49 provides for an alternative residential use of up to three homesites for a property like [the Aspmos\u2019] land.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">\u201cIn determining that [the Aspmos\u2019] expenditures could not be adapted to an alternative lawful use, [the county] applied a \u2018more consistent with\u2019 standard. [The county] found that the permits, land clearing, wells, and roads were \u2018entirely inconsistent\u2019 with forest or agricultural uses, and \u2018greatly oversized\u2019 for the development of a smaller subdivision allowable under Measure 49. [The county\u2019s] decision was not supported by substantial evidence, and the [reviewing] court erred in upholding [the county\u2019s] decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">(Record citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Conversely, the Aspmos contend that the reviewing court properly considered the ratio and adaptability factors. Specifically, with regard to the ratio factor, they assert that \u201cevidence of total project cost is not even required in assessing whether an owner has established a vested right.\u201d Moreover, the Aspmos contend that, in this case, \u201cthere are too many variables to set a firm estimate of the total project cost for the Subdivision.\u201d Finally, the Aspmos contend that, because \u201cthe expenditure ratio is no more important than any of the other factors!,]\u201d it was reasonable for the court and the county to determine that \u201cthis factor [was] of lesser importance under the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">In terms of the adaptability factor, the Aspmos remonstrate that the county \u201cproperly applied the applicable legal standards to determine that [the Aspmos\u2019] expenditures were more consistent with a 30-lot residential subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>than any alternative use, and that no reasonable alternatives existed from which [the Aspmos] could obtain a reasonable economic return.\u201d Further, the Aspmos note that substantial evidence supported the county\u2019s finding. With the issues so framed, we turn first to the parties\u2019 contentions concerning the ratio factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">We have previously addressed contentions concerning the ratio factor that are similar to those of the parties in this case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As we reiterated in <em>Kleikamp v. Board of County Commissioners, </em>240 Or App 57, 65, 246 P3d 56 (2010), \u201ca landowner\u2019s proof of\u2018substantial expenditures\u2019 is the <em>sine qua non </em>of a vesting determination.\u201d That determination \u201crequires an examination of both the absolute amount expended and the percentage yielded by the expenditure ratio.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66. Significantly, we explained that \u201ca cogent assessment of total project cost (and, concomitantly, the expenditure ratio) will, in turn, require particular identification of the development that the property owner sought to vest as of December 6,2007,\u201d and that \u201cproperty owners must demonstrate \u2018the <em>likely costs </em>of completing the particular development sought to be vested <em>based on construction costs as of December 6, 20071 </em>\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Friends of Yamhill County, </em>237 Or App at 178) (emphasis in <em>Kleikamp).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">In light of those principles, we conclude, as we concluded in our previous decisions, that the reviewing court \u201cshould have remanded for the county to determine the extent and general cost of the project to be vested and to give proper weight to the expenditure ratio factor in the totality of the circumstances of this case.\u201d <em>Friends of Yamhill County, </em>237 Or App at 178. Here, the county\u2019s and reviewing court\u2019s treatments of the denominator in the expenditure ratio did not assess the total project cost of the development that the Aspmos sought to vest as of December 6, 2007, based on construction costs as of that date. That legal error requires reversal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Having resolved OSCC\u2019s legal contention, we turn, finally, to its substantial evidence challenge concerning the adaptability <em>factor </em>\u2014 viz., that the reviewing court erred in determining that the county\u2019s finding that the Aspmos\u2019 expenditures were not adaptable to an alternative lawful use was supported by substantial evidence. In <em>Davis v. Jefferson County, </em>239 Or App 564, 573, 245 P3d 665 (2010), we explained that \u201c[w]e review the circuit court\u2019s application of the substantial evidence standard for whether the court applied the correct legal test for substantial evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Here, as previously described, 243 Or App at 304-05, although the reviewing court affirmed the county\u2019s determination that the Aspmos had a vested right to complete and continue the use described in the waiver, the court did not explicitly address whether substantial evidence supported the county\u2019s finding concerning the adaptability factor. Again, the court\u2019s core reasoning was that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\">\u201cthe Aspmos\u2019 efforts, expenditures, actions and progress toward completing their subdivision plan have been obvious and substantial; that their use complied with the waivers issued by the county and state; and that the county did not improperly construe the applicable law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">In light of that reasoning, we are unable to determine whether the reviewing court reviewed the county\u2019s finding concerning the adaptability factor for substantial evidence and, if it did, whether it applied the correct standard. Accordingly, on remand the reviewing court must address that issue. <em>See Davis, </em>239 Or App at 573 (\u201cThe reviewing court did not explain why it affirmed the challenged finding [concerning adaptability]. We cannot determine from this record if the court reviewed that particular finding at all, much less if it applied the correct legal standard in doing so. A remand is necessary to allow the reviewing court to address the evidentiary support for that finding.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b318-5\"> Although named as a respondent, Clatsop County has waived appearance on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b318-6\"> This is one of many recent cases concerning whether a property owner has a vested right to complete development in compliance with a Measure 37 waiver after the voters approved Ballot Measure 49 (2007), which \u201cnarrowed the effect of Measure 37, including a reduction in the degree of residential development allowed under a requested Measure 37 waiver.\u201d <em>Friends of Yamhill County v.
