ORS 166.065. Youth argues that the juvenile court erroneously admitted hearsay evidence under the domestic violence hearsay exception. OEC 803(26). For the reasons explained below, we agree and, therefore, reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">We begin with a brief statement of the relevant facts. Youth lived in an apartment with his mother, Carte. Youth and Carte had an argument and, allegedly, a physical altercation. Carte called 9-1-1 and told a dispatcher that, about an hour earlier, youth had damaged the apartment and pushed her down. Two officers responded. Carte told one of the officers that she had spanked youth, who was 16 years old, and, in response, youth grabbed her and threw her across the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The state charged youth with, <em>inter alia, </em>harassment. At youth\u2019s trial, the state sought to introduce Carte\u2019s statements to the 9-1-1 dispatcher and the officer pursuant to the domestic violence hearsay exception, OEC 803(26). The exception applies to certain statements by <em>\u201ca </em>victim of domestic violence\u201d that purport to describe an \u201cincident of domestic violence.\u201d OEC 803(26). For the purposes of the exception, \u201cdomestic violence\u201d is defined as \u201cabuse between family or household members.\u201d OEC 803(26); ORS 135.230(3). In turn, the phrase \u201c[fjamily or household members\u201d is defined to include \u201c[p]ersons cohabiting with each other.\u201d ORS 135.230(3), (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The state argued that \u201c[p]ersons cohabiting with each other\u201d refers to persons living in the same residence. Youth, on the other hand, argued that \u201c[p]ersons cohabiting with each other\u201d refers to persons living in the same residence in a relationship akin to that of husband and wife. The juvenile court agreed with the state and admitted Carte\u2019s statements to the 9-1-1 dispatcher and the officer. Based on the statements, the court found youth within its jurisdiction for harassment. Youth appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>On appeal, the parties renew the arguments they made in the juvenile court. The state also argues, as an alternative basis for affirmance, that Carte\u2019s statements were admissible as excited utterances under OEC 803(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">We first turn to the issue of the admissibility of Carte\u2019s statements under the domestic violence hearsay exception, OEC 803(26). As relevant here, OEC 803 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">\u201cThe following are not excluded by [OEC 802, the hearsay rule], even though the declarant is available as a witness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\"><em>Hi </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">\u201c(26)(a) A statement that purports to narrate, describe, report or explain an incident of domestic violence, as defined in ORS 135.230, made by a victim of the domestic violence within 24 hours after the incident occurred, if the statement:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">\u201c(A) Was recorded, either electronically or in writing, or was made to a peace officer as defined in ORS 161.015, corrections officer, youth correction officer, parole and probation officer, emergency medical technician or firefighter; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">\u201c(B) Has sufficient indicia of reliability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">ORS 135.230(3) defines \u201c[d]omestic violence\u201d as \u201cabuse between family or household members.\u201d In turn, ORS 135.230(4) defines \u201c[flamily or household members\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-11\">\u201c(a) Spouses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-12\">\u201c(b) Former spouses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-13\">\u201c(c) Adult persons related by blood or marriage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-14\">\u201c(d) <em>Persons cohabitating with each other.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-15\">\u201c(e) Persons who have cohabited with each other or who have been involved in a sexually intimate relationship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-16\">\u201c(f) Unmarried parents of a minor child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-17\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-18\">Here, our task is t\u00f3 interpret the phrase \u201c[p]ersons cohabiting with each other.\u201d When interpreting a statute, our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>goal is to ascertain the intent of the legislature, the best indication of which is the text of the statute itself. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171, 206 P3d 1042 (2009) (\u201c[T]here is no more persuasive evidence of the intent of the legislature than the words by which the legislature undertook to give expression to its wishes.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)). \u201cWe give words of common usage their plain, natural, and ordinary meanings, and we give words that have well-defined legal meanings those meanings.\u201d <em>Bergerson v. Salem-Keizer School District, </em>341 Or 401, 413, 144 P3d 918 (2006) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\u201cCohabit\u201d has a \u201cusual and accepted legal meaning.\u201d <em>Vasconcellos and Vasconcellos, </em>65 Or App 433, 435, 671 P2d 739 (1983). As we held <em>in Edwards and Edwards, </em>73 Or App 272, 277-79, 698 P2d 542 (1985), \u201ccohabit\u201d does not refer to simply living in the same residence. \u201c[I]t refers to a domestic arrangement between a man and, woman who are not married to each other, but who live as husband and wife, in that, for more than a brief period of time, they share a common domicile and living expenses and are sexually intimate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 278; <em>see also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>296 (9th ed 2009) (defining \u201ccohabitation\u201d as \u201c[t]he fact or state of living together, esp. as partners in life, usu. with the suggestion of sexual relations\u201d). Thus, \u201c[p]ersons cohabiting with each other\u201d refers to persons living in the same residence in a relationship akin to that of spouses.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">If, as the state argues, the legislature intended the domestic violence hearsay exception to apply to all persons living in a residence, the legislature could have used a different definition of \u201c[flamily or household members.\u201d Instead of including \u201c[p]ersons <em>cohabiting </em>with each other,\u201d it could have included \u201cpersons <em>residing in the same residence,\u201d </em>as it has in other statutes. <em>See, e.g., </em>ORS 163.730(4) (defining \u201c[h]ousehold member\u201d for the purposes of the stalking statutes as \u201cany person residing in the same residence as the victim\u201d); ORS 244.020(10) (defining \u201c[mjember of the household\u201d for the purpose of government ethics statutes to mean \u201cany person who resides with the public official or candidate\u201d). But it did not. Instead, the legislature made a policy choice \u2014 reflected through its selection of the term \u201ccohabitating,\u201d which has a \u201cusual and accepted legal meaning\u201d \u2014 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>limit, the application of the exception. Thus, the exception does not apply to, for example, simple roommates or dorm-mates. Nor, as dispositive here, does it apply to minor children and parents who live in the same residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">In this case, youth and Carte did not live together in a relationship akin to that of spouses. Thus, they were not \u201c[p]ersons cohabiting with each other\u201d for the purposes of the domestic violence hearsay exception. The juvenile court erred by concluding otherwise and admitting Carte\u2019s hearsay statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">As an alternative basis for affirmance, the state argues that Carte\u2019s hearsay statements were admissible under OEC 803(2) as excited utterances. An excited utterance is \u201c[a] statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.\u201d OEC 803(2). \u201c[T]he traditional rationale for allowing excited utterances to be admitted over a hearsay objection is that the \u2018excitement caused by the startling event or condition temporarily stills the capacity for reflection\u2019 and thus is likely to produce \u2018statements free of conscious fabrication.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>337 Or 528, 543, 99 P3d 271 (2004), <em>cert den, </em>544 US 931 (2005) (quoting <em>State v. Carlson, </em>311 Or 201, 215, 808 P2d 1002 (1991)). Whether a statement qualifies for admission as an excited utterance involves factual issues, including whether the statement was made while the declarant was actually under the stress of the startling event or condition; that is, whether the declarant\u2019s capacity for reflection was stilled, rendering it unlikely that he or she could consciously fabricate the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">In this case, because the state did not argue that Carte\u2019s statements were excited utterances in the juvenile court, youth had no reason to develop an evidentiary record regarding the factual issues relevant to whether Carte\u2019s hearsay statements, which were made more than one hour after the alleged physical altercation, were admissible as excited utterances, and, therefore, we cannot consider the state\u2019s alternative basis for affirmance. <em>Outdoor Media Dimensions Inc. v. State of Oregon, </em>331 Or 634, 659-60, 20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>P3d 180 (2001) (appellate court will not consider an alternative ground for affirmance if the losing party at trial could have developed a materially different factual record had the alternative theory been raised).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
