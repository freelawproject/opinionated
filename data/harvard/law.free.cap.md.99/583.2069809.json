The most ordinary prudence should have indicated to him to have his clerk (and not the salesman) read to him the contract before he signed it, but instead of doing so he trusted the salesman to read it, accepted his version, signed the contract, and put away his duplication of it furnished by the salesman (or had it put away by his clerk), and never read it, or had it read to him, until about three weeks later after the goods had come from Iowa to Cambridge, Md. <em>Cooley on Tofts, </em>488.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b612-6\">The Court erred in refusing to exclude from the jury all testimony on behalf of defendant purporting to give negotiations, conversations and representations of salesman, Joseph Wonn.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b612-7\">Where a written contract is presented by one party to another for his signature, and such person signs the same without inquiring or informing himself as to its contents and legal effect, though he had at his command the means of doing so, such person will not be heard to say, under a plea of fraud, that he has been deceived and that fraud has been practiced upon him by the other. <em>Spitze </em>v. <em>Baltimore, etc., </em>75 Md. 162; <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>Shriver, </em>79 Md. 530; <em>A. &amp; E.

The Court erred in receiving testimony concerning show case, for debtor- does not know that such a show case as he bought was not sent; he never examined the goods; he does not know there was fraud. His testimony was calculated to. mislead and influence the jury in their verdict. The Court also erred in receiving testimony as to freight bill. The bill itself was best evidence and should have been produced. Defendant\u2019s statements concerning the same are inadmissible and conflicting. In letter to plaintiffs he says $8.65, in testimony he says $8.69. He never saw the bill himself but was told by his hauler what it was.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-7\">The prayer offered by plaintiffs properly stated the law in this case and should have been granted. The printed contract offered in evidence purported to set forth the whole agreement between the parties, and the defendant, over his own signature thereto, stated that he had read it all and found it to be complete and satisfactory and that he understood that any agreement to be binding upon plaintiffs should be endorsed thereon. This contract furnished plaintiffs all the knowledge they had as to defendant\u2019s agreement with salesman, and acting upon it they packed and shipped the goods. Defendant, with a duplicate of the contract in his possession and a clerk who could read and w\u2019rite, by his own conduct,- led plaintiffs to believe that this was the contract he had made, and he is precluded from disputing it. <em>Hardy </em>v. <em>C.

Wonn was but a special agent, acting under special written iristructions from his principal, and the power of the agent and the rights of the party dealing with him, as against the principal, depend upon the legal construction of the written authority under which it is claimed the agent acted, and it is settled that the construction of the letter of authority is exclusively for the Court. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b616-6\"><em>Goldsborough &amp; Fletehet </em>,for the appellee,submitted the cause on their brief.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-7\">The evidence objected to in the fourth bill, went directly to establish the deceit of the plaintiff in the procurement of the contract. In fact, this evidence showed that the deceit amounted to false pretenses on the part of the plaintiff. This evidence is not that the plaintiff promised not to sell to other grocerymen, but that he said that he had not sold to any other groceryman, while in fact he had already sold to two. The value of the goods to the defendant depended in a great measure upon whether he would have competition. The false representation was material, it deceived the defendant and it was acted upon by him to his damage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-8\">The prayer as offered ignored the evidence as to fraud and was properly rejected.' The prayer as amended gave the ap-' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>pellants all the law they were entitled to, and even more, and they have no cause to object. If there was fraud on the part of the plaintiff which \u201cinduced\u201d or in other words deceived the defendant so that he was led into making the contract, the contract was void. <em>O'Connell v.

The appellee, as defendant, filed the general issue pleas and also a special plea asserting that the plaintiffs had procured the contract through fraud. The verdict and judgment having been for the defendant, the plaintiffs appealed. The record contains four exceptions to the Court\u2019s rulings on evidence and one to its action on the prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">The plaintiffs are manufacturing druggists in Iowa City, Iowa, and the defendant is engaged in the grocery business at Cambridge, Md., and is an illiterate .person.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>. The written contract in question is somewhat unusual in form. It consists of a sheet of paper headed \u201cAdvertising That Pays \u201d on which appears a list, constituting an assortment of goods with their respective prices amounting in the aggregate <em>$ </em>186, together with the details of a scheme by which the plaintiffs as vendors warrant the quality of the goods, undertake to do certain things to assist in their advertisement for the benefit of the vendee and guarantee him a fixed profit on the sale of them. In the body of this scheme it is stated that the authority of the' salesman is limited to taking orders on the regular forms of the vendors and that the latter will not be bound by his representations or agreements unless they are endorsed upon the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">On the back of this sheet appears an order for the goods addressed to the vendors, as follows: \u201cGentlemen \u2014 Please ship the goods herein described f. o. b. Iowa City, Iowa, on terms and conditions herein stated, all of which we have carefully read and find complete and .satisfactory. We understand-that agreement to be binding must be noted hereon.\u201d To this is appended the signature of the defendant as the vendee and also that of the salesman; as well as an acceptance signed by the vendors.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">At the trial of the case below, the plaintiffs having offered evidence tending to prove the execution and delivery of the contract and the shipment of the goods in accordance therewith and the failure of the'defendant to pay for them, the latter offered .his own testimony as to his residence and occupation and his inability to read or to write beyond signing his \u25a0 own name. He further testified to the following facts. On March 17th, 1903, Joseph Wonn, the plaintiffs\u2019 salesman, came to his store in Cambridge and offered to sell him. the goods described in the contract. No bargain was made at that visit, but Wonn returned to the store at about 8 o\u2019clock in the evening of the same day and urged the defendant to buy the goods, saying that he would leave town in the morning. He at the same time assured the defendant that none of the same kind of. goods had been sold to any other p\u00e9rs'on in Cambridge, al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>though he expected to sell one assortment of them to a dry-goods merchant. He also said that he was not permitted to sell more than two assortments of them in any one town or community, one to a grocer and the other to a dry goods man.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The defendant also testified that when Wonn urged him to order an assortment of the goods he told Wonn of his inability to read or write beyond signing his name whereupon the latter read or pretended to read the contract to him, but did not read the portion of it relating to the extent of his own authority. That the defendant before signing the order for the goods objected to what might be the cost of the freight on the goods from Iowa City whereupon Wonn said that he guaranteed that the freight would not be over $1.50 or $2.00. That the defendant, upon the faith of the various statements and representations so made to him by Wonn, signed the order proffered to him by the latter for the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">When the goods arrived at Cambridge the freight on them amounted to <em>$8.6g </em>which the defendant refused to pay and the goods were not delivered to him. He at once caused his clerk to write for him to the plaintiffs informing them of the situation and refusing to take the goods unless they would act fairly with him. A day or two after that he discovered that Wonn had already sold similar assortments of the plaintiffs goods to two other grocers in Cambridge at the time when he. induced him to sign the order for his assortment.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">To the admission of all of this testimony and more of like tenor given by the defendant the plaintiffs objected by a single objection, but the Court overruled the objection and admitted the evidence and the plaintiffs took their first exception. There was no error on the part of the learned Judge below in overruling this objection for some portions of the testimony thus objected to in bulk were clearly admissible and when such is the case it is not error to overrule the objection. <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Whiteside, </em>17 Md. 458; <em>Everett v. Neff, 28 </em>Md. 184; <em>Burgoon </em>v. <em>Bixler, </em>55 Md. 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">The second exception was taken to the Court\u2019s refusal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>\u25a0 grant a motion made by the plaintiffs to strike out this testimony of the defendant as a whole. This motion was properly-refused for the same reason that the original objection to the admission of the testimony was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The third exception was to the admission of the whole of the testimony of the defendant\u2019s clerk Reid as well as to the overruling of a motion to exclude it from the j ury after it had been admitted._ This witness testified that he was present at the interview Between the plaintift\u2019s salesman Wonn .and the defendant when, th.e contract for the purchase of the goods was signed. He heard the defendant tell Wonn that he could not read and also heard Wonn read or pretend to read the contract to him. The witness corroborated in detail the defendant\u2019s account of the statements and assurances made to him by Wonn at the time of signing the contract. As certain portions of this witness\u2019 testimony were clearly admissible there was no error in overruling this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The fourth exception was taken to the admission of the evidence of Milton C. Richardson and D. B. Hueston that they were grocers in business at Cambridge and that on March. 17th, 1903, Wonn as salesman of the plaintiffs, had sold to-them assortments of goods similar to the one sold to the defendant and that the sales to them were made before the sale to the defendant. We think this evidence was properly admitted under the pleadings in the case. The defendant was not at liberty to introduce parol evidence to vary the terms of his contract'of purchase which was in writing, but he could show by such evidence that he was induced to sign the con-, tract through fraud. <em>Hurn v. Soper, </em>6 H. &amp; J. 276; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Hamblin, </em>51 Md. 540. And that could be done notwithstanding the fact that the evidence contradicted declarations of the defendant embodied in the written contract. <em>Southern Adver</em>t<em>ising Co. </em>v. <em>Metropole Co., </em>91 Md.61; <em>Willis </em>v. <em>Kern, </em>21 La. Ann; 749. The testimony of these two witnesses tended to prove the falsity of the statements by which the plaintiff\u2019s salesman induced the defendant to make the contract which was the cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>The fact of the defendant\u2019s illiteracy did not relieve him from the obligation to inform himself of the contents of the contract by having it read to him by some one whose interests were not antagonistic to his own before he signed it, and he ,was estopped by his failure to do so from avoiding it on the ground that he was ignorant of its contents. Cyc., vol. 9, p. 390; <em>Cooley on </em>Torts, sec. 488; <em>Spitze </em>v. <em>Balto. &amp; Ohio R. R. Co., </em>75 Md. 162. But that obligation on his part did not prevent him from showing that he was induced to sign it through positive fraud. The testimony of the two witnesses now under consideration did not relate to the contents of the contract of sale. It tended to show the falsity of the statement that none of the same kind of goods had been sold or would be sold to any other grocer in Cambridge where the defendant carried on his business. This was a material statement and the defendant testified that he had relied on it in making the purchase. The statement was made by the plaintiff\u2019s agent in the ordinary course of the employment in which he was engaged and within the apparent and presumable scope of his authority and was material to the transaction with the defendant. Such statements have been repeatedly held to bind the principal as part of the <em>res gestee. A. &amp; E. Encycl., </em>2 ed., vol. 1, p. 1143; <em>Hambleton </em>v. <em>Rhind, </em>94 Md. 491; <em>Southern Adv. Co. </em>v. <em>Metropole Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Even if the plaintiffs were not bound as a matter of contract by these statements of their salesman made in the ordinary course of the employment in which he was engaged they would not be permitted to profit by his positive fraud in procuring the sale of their goods to the defendant by false statements as to the extent of sales made or to be made of the same kind of goods to other dealers in the latter\u2019s line of business in the-same community. <em>Mayer </em>v. <em>Dean, </em>115 N. Y. 556; <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Rafferty, </em>128 Pa. 337, also reported with full notes supported by numerous authorities in 6 L. R. A. 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The fifth exception is to the action of the Court below in refusing the plaintiff\u2019s prayer as. offered and in .granting it as. amended by the Court. The prayer as offered directed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>jury to find for the plaintiff for the contract price of the goods and interest if they found from the evidence that the defendant had signed and delivered the contract to the plaintiffs and that they, had shipped to him the goods therein specified and that he had not paid for them. To this prayer the Court added the following modification; \u201cUnless the jury shall further find from the evidence that the defendant was induced to sign the contract or order offered in evidence by false representations of the plaintiffs. \u201d</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b622-8\">(Decided June 8th, 1904.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">In view of the fact that the defense of fraud in obtaining the contract sued on was set up in the pleadings and of the character of the evidence, to which allusion has been made by us, tending to support that defense it was the duty of the Court to, submit the question of fraud to the jury. As the plaintiffs\u2019 prayer in the form in which they offered it entirely ignored this issue and the evidence offered in its support, it would have been improper for the Court to have granted the prayer without the modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Finding no error in the action of the Court below we will .affirm the judgment appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
