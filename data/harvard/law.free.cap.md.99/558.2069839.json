No precautions whatever were taken to protect plaintiffs\u2019 property from injury, and the wall was allowed to remain in that entirely unprotected condition from-the time defendants stopped work on Friday, until they began work on Tuesday. Can it be fairly contended by the other side that they had no knowledge of the danger? or that there was no danger of damage to plaintiffs\u2019 property by reason of the tearing down and excavating? The defendants are estopped by their own acts from making that contention. Why was the notice of Friday, May 16th, 1902, given by both defendants if the conditions were not such as to warrant a reasonable apprehension of danger? Can it be said in answer that after the notice plaintiffs had ample time to proteet their property? .The defendants by their own acts, are estopped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>from raising any such contention; the testimony shows that defendant Schlutter informed plaintiffs that defendant Novak would not let another builder go on her property in order to underpin plaintiffs\u2019 wall. Within 24 hours after the notice that underpinning was necessary was given plaintiffs, they employed the only person whom defendants would permit to do the work. The law demands nothing unreasonable, and no greater dilligence could have been shown by plaintiffs in securing some one to protect their property and possibly greater delay in having the work done. In view of this testimony, can it be said by defendants that plaintiffs were negligent in having the work done or in employing an incompetent person to do the work? Again, attention is called to the photograph referred to in the testimony. If demonstration is possible in a case involving negligence, that photograph demonstrated that the collapse of plaintiffs\u2019 wall was due to the excavations made alongside of it; the photograph showed that after the collapse of plaintiffs\u2019 wall, there remained standing a portion of the extreme rear of plaintiffs\u2019 wall, probably six or eight feet long, and the most of it the full height of the wall as originally built. Defendants\u2019 foundation trench ran nearly the whole length of the plaintiffs\u2019 wall. Defendant Schlutter\u2019s building was about twenty feet deep, and plaintiffs\u2019 building was 28 feet deep, and that photograph clearly demonstrated that for the full length of the excavation made by defendants, plaintiffs\u2019 wall collapsed, and where there was no excavation, the wall remained standing; in other words, where the wall had been undermined by the excavations, it fell, and where it had not been undermined, it remained standing. The story told by that photograph must be believed, and when taken in connection with the testimony of the witness Armiger, an experienced builder, that most undoubtedly the fall of the Imuse was the natural and probable result of digging the excavation below the foundations, and that there could be no other cause; and the testimony of the witness Miller, one of the ablest and best known contractors in Baltimore, that it is foolishness to attempt to excavate near a building where it is not properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>shored up, and-that the wall fell because the excavation had weakened the earth under the wall; it is respectfully submitted that the plaintiffs have made out a case which ought to have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-5\">Under the contract existing between defendant Schlutter and Novak, for the erection of the building, Novak was required to dig the foundations of defendant\u2019s buildings to a distance of three feet below ground. The age and character of the building was known to the defendants; and- the.work contracted to be done was such that the damage which resulted might have been anticipated as a direct and probable consequence of the performance of the work contracted .for, unless all reasonable precautions to <em>anticipate, obviate and prevent this probable consequence, were taken; </em>and the question a\u2018s to whether such injury might reasonably have been anticipated as a probable consequence of the excavation <em>was a-fact for the jury. Bonaparte </em>v. <em>Wiseman, </em>89 Md. 19.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-6\">Defendant Novak\u2019s prayer was granted upon the theory that the negligence which caused the building to fall, occurred after his employment by plaintiffs,,when all the testimony shows that all the damage that could possibly have been done by excavating, and in failing' to protect the wall, was done long before defendant, Novak,-was employed o.r began, work \u2022under his contract with plaintiffs, and. there is nothing.in- the record to show that when work was commenced that Tuesday morning between 8:30 and 9 A. M., t-hat the work was being done for plaintiffs, and even if the testimony did show that the work-begun at that time was being done under the contract with the plaintiffs, there is absolutely nothing in the record to show that there was any negligence in doing that work. The grossest kind, of negligence that might be committed by Novak during the ten or fifteen minutes in which he was engaged in doing work the morning- the building, collapsed, would hardly account for the fall of .the building. The. negligence in not protecting the wall during the tearing down of the old buildings and excavating below the foundation, of.that vvall was the <em>proximate cause </em>of t;he fall of the. building and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>anything that might have been done that morning must necessarily have been the <em>remote cause </em>of the damage.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b591-5\"><em>John M. Requardt </em>(with whom was <em>J. Fred. Requardt </em>on the brief), for Novak, appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-6\">This appellee is not liable in this action:</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-7\">1. Because the appellants had full knowledge of the character of the work he was doing on the premises of Mrs. Schlutter, and besides were duly notified that underpinning was necessary to protect their house.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-8\">2. That after such notice the burden was thrown upon the appellants to protect their property, and if they did not do so with the ample time they had, then without showing gross negligence on his part, they must bear the loss if damage ensued to their property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-9\">3. That he was not negligent in any of the work done for Mrs. Schlutter, either before he notified the appellants that they must underpin their house, or afterwards.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-10\">4. That the appellants cannot claim in this suit that he was negligent in performing the alleged contract to do the underpinning for the appellants, or that he did not properly perform the same, because this is a suit in tort for negligently excavating below the foundation of the appellants\u2019 house without notice, while their remedy, if any they have, must be a suit on such alleged contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-11\">Even if it were admitted that Novak was grossly negligent in his work after the notice given to the appellants to underpin their property, still; it is submitted, he is not liable in this action, because the next day he is alleged to have made a contract with the appellants to do such underpinning, and any act of his about the work after such contract must be construed as a failure to properly perform such contract, which the appellants are precluded from showing in this action, it not appearing that he was negligent in the interim between the time of such notice and the making of such alleged contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-12\">The theory upon which the appellants tried their case was, that they had shifted the burden of properly protecting their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>property, after notice to do so, back to Novak by entering into a contract with him to do it for them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-5\">The proposition that the appellants cannot show negligence in this case by reason of the appellee, Novak, failing to perform such alleged contract is elementary and does not need an authority to sustain it. The gravamen of this action is the wrong done to the appellants\u2019 property by reason of an excavation made below their \u2018foundation wall without notice to them. They surely cannot be heard now to say, \u201cThat they had received notice and that they promptly engaged Novak to protect their property and he had not done so, and hence the appellees are liable to them.\u201d The wrong of which they then complain is that Novak did not perform his contract, and that question, it is submitted, cannot be tried in this case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b592-6\"><em>W. Calvin Chesnut </em>(with whom were <em>Cans &amp; Hainan </em>on the brief), for D. Schlutter, appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-7\">It conclusively appears by the plaintiffs\u2019 own testimony that they <em>were expressly notified </em>by the defendant <em>in ample time to \u25a0have protected their property. </em>Indeed, the record shows that after receiving the notice to protect their property, the plaintiffs engaged the defendant, Novak, to do so for them; and the record shows further that if Novak had done so, as he agreed to- do (by the plaintiffs\u2019 testimony), the damage to the plaint-tiffs\u2019 house would not have resulted. 'Under the law of the case <em>(Bonaparte </em>v. <em>Wiseman, </em>89 Md. 22), this timely notice completely exempted the appellee, Schlutter, from liability.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-8\">The fourth prayer submitted by the appellee and granted by the Court, took the case away from the jury on the ground that the work of improving the appellee, Schlutter\u2019s lot, had been committed by her to an independent contractor, and the damage to the plaintiffs\u2019 house was not reasonably to have been anticipated as the probable consequences of the excavation, but was caused by-the negligence of the independent contractor. In the Bonaparte case, this Court decided that the mere fact that the work was done by an independent contractor -did not, of itself, exempt the owner of the lot under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>course of improvement from liability. In that case the Court further said that it was a question for the jury whether the damage was reasonably to have been anticipated as the probable consequence of the excavation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-5\">In the present case, however, there is no necessity for submitting this question to the jury, as the record fails to show any facts which would lead the jury to find that the defendant, Schlutter, could reasonably have anticipated the damage to the plaintiffs\u2019 house as a probable consequence of the excavation. The testimony of the plaintiffs tend to show that the damage was not a necessary result of the excavation, but resulted from the failure of the contractor to sufficiently prop the plaintiffs\u2019 wall. If this negligence was legally chargeable to Novak, still Mrs. Schlutter would not have been liable, .as it was negligence in a collateral matter. It was not the very doing of the work which caused the injury, but the failure of the independent contractor to do it in a proper way.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-6\">The second and third prayers of the appellee, Schlutter, w\u2019ere based on the proposition that when the appellee, Schlutter, gave the plaintiffs timely notice to protect their property, she discharged her liability to them in connection with the matter, provided she thereafter caused the excavation to be made with reasonable and ordinary care. There was no evidence in this case to show a want of this. It is again repeated that according to the record, the damage resulted from the failure to prop. After the notice, it was the duty of the plaintiffs to prop their wall and not the duty of the appellee^ Schlutter. On page 23, 89 Md., this Court says: \u201cIf one about to excavate his own lot do it, or cause it to be done, so carefully as not to injure the adjacent houses, he need not give notice to their owner; if, on the other hand, he give timely notice to the adjacent owners, the burden will be thrown on them to protect their own property, and he will not be liable for damages sustained by them, if he makes the excavation with reasonable and ordinary care.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-8\">When we apply this law to the facts of this case, the result of the trial below is obvious; It will be remembered that on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>the Friday morning mentioned the work of' excavation on Mrs. Schlutter\u2019s lot had proceeded so far that it became necessary to notify the plaintiffs to protect their property. Accordingly, work was suspended, and Mrs. Samuels, representing the plaintiffs, was notified in person by Mrs. Schlutter and the builder, Novak. This cast upon the plaintiffs the burden of protecting their own property, and this burden they assumed by employing Novak to protect their property for them. According to their testimony, they made an agreement with him to this effect the following day, Saturday. Nothing further was done until the next Tuesday morning, when, a few minutes after work was again begun by Novak, the wall collapsed. The plaintiffs, therefore, allowed nearly four days to elapse after receiving the notice before the injury to their house, resulted. As a matter of law, therefore, it is very clear that they had timely notice, and failed to act under it. By engaging Novak to do the work for them, they thereby made him their agent, and his failure was attributable to the plaintiffs and not to-the appellee-, Schlutter.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b594-5\">Page, -J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AiU\">delivered the opinion of the Court..</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">' This is an action of tort, brought\u2019by the appellants against the appellees to recover damages for injuries to the appellants\u2019 Louse, occasioned by the alleged carelessness of the appellees. It is alleged in the declaration that the appellees while engaged in removing a building adjacent to the property of the ,appellants, \u201cwillfully, carelessly and in an unskillful and unworkmanlike manner, negligently and wrongfully tore down \u25a0and removed a building adjacent to the property.of the said plaintiffs, and then and there excavated and went below the foundation walls of the plaintiffs\u2019 property, without \"notice to \u25a0said plaintiffs, and that by reason thereof the property of the plaintiffs was structurally weakened and said property collapsed and fell in, &amp;c.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">The defendants plead the general issue; and the judgment -being for them, the plaintiffs- appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">The proof shows that on Friday.,-the 16th of May, 1902, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>the appellants were notified by Mrs. Schlutter, the owner of the property about to be improved; that they \u201ccould not go ahead with their work, without underpinning her property.\u201d At that time the Schlutter building was entirely down, and an excavation or ditch had been dug for the walls of the new structure, along and below the foundations of the walls of the appellants\u2019 house. Mrs. Samuel on the same day entered into an agreement with the defendant Novak, in which the latter agreed for a consideration of fifty dollars to do the work of underpinning the walls of the appellants\u2019 house and to proceed with the work on the Monday following. Novak however, did not begin this work until the following Tuesday. At the time this agreement was made, the walls of the Schlutter building were entirely down, and there were no props, braces or other precautions to protect the wall on the adjoining property, except \u201ca narrow board. extending midway across the Schlutter lot.\u201d There was evidence offered, tending to show that it was a custom among builders, while tearing down a building \u201csimilar to this,\u201d to protect the wall on the adjoining property by the use of props and braces; and the fall of the appellants\u2019 wall, was caused by the excavation upon the appellees\u2019 lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The Court granted two prayers, both offered by the defendants. The appellants asked no instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">One of the granted prayers of the appellees instructed the jury that \u201cby the theory of the plaintiffs\u2019 case,\u201d that is, (as we construe the phrase) if they found'that the injury to the appellants\u2019 property was occasioned by the failure of Novak to properly perform a contract entered into between the plaintiffs and Novak for the protection of their property, their verdict must be for Novak.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The hypothesis upon which this instruction is based requires that the jury shall find, as the condition of Novak\u2019s liability, that the injury was caused by his failure to perform his contract to underpin the plaintiffs\u2019 wall. If this were found to be the cause of the injury, and hot the negligence of the defendants in making the excavation, then it seems to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>clear that the only cause of action the plaintiffs would have, would be against Novak for a breach of the contract in not properly performing the work of the underpinning, and not for negligently making the excavation. Upon the hypothesis of this prayer, no recovery could be had against Novak, except upon an action <em>ex contractu </em>for a breach of his contract. \u2018 \u2018It is impossible,\u201d said this Court, \u201cto disregard the substantial principles which underlie our system of jurisprudence and to some extent govern the forms of action. These principles must still be recognized, however the new form may be changed or simplified.\u201d <em>Stirling </em>v. Garritee, 18 Md. 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">This instruction was therefore properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">By the other prayer, the case was taken from the jury, so far as concerned Dora J. Schlutter. They were directed to find for her, \u201cbecause it appears from the plaintiffs' case the work of excavation on the defendants\u2019 lot was wholly committed by her to an independent contractor; that the injury to the plaintiffs? house was not reasonably to have been anticipated as the probable consequence of the excavation, but was caused by the negligence of the independent contractor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">. This prayer, makes two assumptions of fact, viz: That the injury to the plaintiffs\u2019 house was not reasonably to have been anticipated as the probable consequence of the excavation, and that it was caused by the negligence of the independent contractor; and from these two facts, because the work of excavation was committed to an ihdependent contractor, the jury- are instructed to find for the defendant Schlutter.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">The obligation of the owner, in cases of this kind, is fully laid down by this Court in the recent case of <em>Bonaparte v. Wiseman, </em>89 Md. 21. In that case the legal proposition by the appellant\u2019s fourth prayer was that the owner was not liable for the injury to the adjoining property, because the work was done by the independent contractor under the written agreement appearing in the record of that case. The Court after stating broadly the general principle, \u201cthat when the work is.done by a competent contractor under an agreement which gives him, complete control of the work and of the persons employed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>by him to do it, such persons will be his servants and not those of the employer, and the latter will not be liable for injuries caused by the negligence, because they are not his servants and are not under his control,\u201d further said, \u201cbut this doctrine has been repeatedly held not to relieve an employer from all responsibility of every kind for the consequences of defective or unskillful work done on his premises even by the servants of an independent contractor.\u201d \u201cIt has no application where the resulting injury instead of being collateral and following from the negligent act of the employee alone, is one that might have been anticipated, as a direct or probable consequence of the performance of the work contracted for, if reasonable care is omitted in the course of its performance.\u201d In the same case it was also said, \u201cthe question as to whether such injury might reasonably have been anticipated as a probable consequence\u201d of the work contracted for is a question of fact for the jury. By the contract, which appears in the record, Novak was to dig the foundations to a depth of three feet below ground, and this depth, as the proof shows would carry the excavation below the walls of the adjoining property. Whether injury to the adjoining walls ought reasonably to have been anticipated, was a question of fact, which should have been submitted by the prayer to the jury. Unless the jury found that it was not reasonably to have been anticipated, the owner was responsible for the injury if she did not take-reasonable precautions to obviate and prevent the probable consequence. The excavation was not a matter collateral to the undertaking of the contractor; it was one of the things that he contracted to do, and if that, under all the circumstances was such a thing as would probably be injurious to other persons, it was the duty of the owner to provide that reasonable care should be taken to obviate, the probable consequence. But the prayer is defective also, in that it withdrew from the jury the question of fact, as to the cause of the injury. It assumes that it was caused by the negligence of the independent contractor. The excavation was along and below the adjoining walls and no props or braces were used to sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>tain them. Whether this- was the cause of the injury, and whether the conduct of the contractor in making and leaving the ditch open, and the adjoining walls unprotected amounted to negligence on his part were questions of fact to be determined by the jury, and should have been submitted to them to find. There was also evidence of notice to the adjoining owner of the necessity for underpinning her walls, and of delay in beginning that work until the following Tuesday morning. What the effect of all this may be, we are not called upon to determine, as it does not concern any question that this record presents. Whatever it may be however, it cannot remove the objections to this prayer.' Nor can we pass upon the prayeus of the appellees, that were presented and subsequently withdrawn. They are not now before us, and we cannot consider them.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"A9n\">(Decided June 8th, 1904.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">For error in granting the prayer last referred to, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded for new trial.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
