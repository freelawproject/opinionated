She was fined $300 and commanded to enter an alcohol rehabilitation facility for seventy-two hours. Her driver\u2019s license was suspended for six months, and she was also ordered to attend DUI school and a driver awareness program. From this sentence she perfected this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">On March 18, 1994, appellant was stopped by Mentor-on-the Lake Patrolman Evangelista at approximately 12:30 a.m. He had witnessed her vehicle leave from a local tavern, make a wide turn and drive over the berm. As the vehicle approached him, he observed the car weaving in a steady pattern and crossing over the center double yellow line into the opposite lane of travel. He then followed her automobile and continued to see the car weave across the yellow line a few more times. He activated his lights, but the vehicle continued driving for an additional three-quarters of a mile before stopping.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">The officer got out of his cruiser, and as he approached the automobile, he saw that the driver was slouched behind the wheel. When he spoke with her, he noticed that appellant had bloodshot eyes, a flushed face, and smelled of alcohol. She was asked to get out of the vehicle and perform three field sobriety tests, all of which she failed. She was placed under arrest and transported to the police station where she was twice asked to submit to a Breathalyzer test. She declined both times.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">She then contacted a co-worker, who telephoned the mayor. He apparently called the police department, and after some discussion, appellant was released. She was not charged that evening. Subsequently, the arresting officer issued appellant two citations for driving under the influence of alcohol and failure to exercise reasonable control of her vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">A two-day jury trial ensued, and appellant was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol. The second charge was dismissed with appellant agreeing to pay the court costs. She timely perfected this appeal, claiming the following as error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-10\">\u201c1. The trial court erred to the prejudice of defendant/appellant in making statements in the presence of the jury which denied the defendant a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-11\">\u201c2. The trial court erred to the prejudice of defendant/appellant in excusing a juror during the trial without cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>\u201c3. The trial court erred in instructing the jury that they could consider the defendant/appellant\u2019s refusal to submit to a breathalyzer test as some evidence that she was under the influence of alcohol.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">During the course of the trial, the judge made a multitude of comments which appellant claims were, prejudicial. Specifically, she refers this court to a number of instances where the trial court made statements during the questioning of certain witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Officer Evangelista was examined concerning his testimony about appellant\u2019s appearance, including her bloodshot eyes. The following colloquy occurred during cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">\u201cQ: Well, in your training and background, did you learn about these things?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">\u201cMR. GURLEY: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: I don\u2019t know, but you know, the jurors, they are just as smart as the rest of us and they know about the fact that there may be many factors that will give you a flushed face once in a while. So, you know, I don\u2019t know, understand why we are going through with this. Let\u2019s get on to the stuff that\u2019s really important. You can make those points when you argue to the jury. If they are not quick enough to pick up on it, you can make sure they pick up on it when you argue the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">Later, the officer was asked, \u201cIf you were in a smoky room, you would too [have red eyes]?\u201d The officer answered, \u201cYeah.\u201d At that point, the court interjected, \u201cAnd if you were under the influence of alcohol, they would too; right? (Inaudible).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">Appellant later called an acquaintance and co-worker, Jeri Krotz, to testify:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-12\">\u201cQ. You talked to Zadd, you needed help. Why did you need help?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-13\">\u201cA. Because I don\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-14\">\u201cMR. GURLEY: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, she needed help. Let\u2019s hear what the help was. She seemed to be at home safe and sound, so \u2014 but, at any rate, how did you need help?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-16\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: I didn\u2019t know what to do. I didn\u2019t know \u2014 I didn\u2019t know if I could call City Hall, I didn\u2019t know if I needed money, I didn\u2019t know \u2014 I knew I had to \u2014 to help somehow, I had to help her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-17\">\u201cTHE COURT: Oh, so what you are really trying to tell everybody here is that you found out that Eva was in trouble with Mentor-on-the-Lake Police Department or at the police department and that somehow or other you wanted to see if you could get her out of there; is that a fair statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>\u201cTHE WITNESS: Well, fair, but not totally\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: So, therefore, you had just seen the Mayor and you were in the political game and so you wanted to go that route; no?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: No, Your Honor. You are correct, I did see Mayor Crocker at the funeral home, which probably brought him to mind, but I also grew up\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: (Inaudible) yeah, you had seen him many times before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: Correct, I\u2019ve known him probably fifteen, twenty years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: As a matter of fact, he\u2019s associated with the Lake County Sheriffs Department and any [sic ] of the officers of Lake County certainly know John Crocker because he is not only the Mayor of City of Mentor-on-the-Lake, but he also happens to work down there, right, or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-10\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: Yes, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve seen him on occasion down there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: And, as a matter of fact, just about everybody that\u2019s been in here so far happens to be political animals and, therefore, attend political functions and, therefore, knows that Mr. Crocker goes to these political functions; wouldn\u2019t that be a fair statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-12\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: Yes, but not \u2014 had nothing to do with why I called Mr. Crocker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: Oh, all right, so why did you call Mr. Crocker?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-14\">Counsel for appellant continued questioning the witness: \u201cQ. What did you say to Mr. Crocker?\u201d At that point, the court offered its own answer to the question: \u201cI need help.\u201d However the witness responded: \u201cNo, no, I did not. I said \u2018What can I do?\u2019 * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-15\">During further questioning of Krotz, the following exchange transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-16\">\u201cQ. Well, in any case, he called back. What did you say to him? Obviously, he said something to you. What did you say to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-17\">\u201cA. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-18\">\u201cQ. And\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-19\">\u201cTHE COURT: And, then she drove over to the Mentor-on-the-Lake Police Station. Let\u2019s not make hard work out of this thing. It\u2019s pretty simple.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-20\">Additionally, the court again interrupted the questioning of Jeri Krotz by raising and subsequently sustaining its own objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-21\">\u201cQ. Do you recall what you said, if anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-22\">\u201cA We primarily discussed that since they have towed her car, her garage door opener is in her car\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: What does all this have to do with the charge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\">\u201cMR. GARGIULO: Your Honor, may we approach the bench on this issue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">\u201c(Whereupon, the following proceedings were held at side bar.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">\u201cMR. GARGIULO: The issue is concerned with her speech.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: (Inaudible.) Why are we going into this stuff?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">\u201c(Whereupon, the following proceedings were held in open court.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: <em>The Court\u2019s objection is sustained.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-10\">The examination of witness Bonnie Beckwith included the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-11\">\u201cQ. How did you become friends?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-12\">\u201cA. It\u2019s only happened to me maybe two or three times in my life, but when I met Eva, there was an immediate rapport developed between us. There was a\u2014 a very common\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: I just want to hear how you became Mends and apparently you like her, so you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-14\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: \u2014started going to the same bars as she went to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-16\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-17\">\u201cTHE COURT: Oh, okay. Let\u2019s not make more out of this than what should be made out of this.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-18\">Finally, appellant noted one other instance which she claims demonstrated the trial court\u2019s involvement during the direct examination of defense witness Beck-with:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-19\">\u201cMR. GURLEY: May it please the Court, we will stipulate that this witness loves this Defendant like a sister.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-20\">\u201cMR. GARGIULO: Well, thank you for that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-21\">\u201cTHE COURT: That still doesn\u2019t answer the question. You ask your question and let\u2019s get the answer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-22\">In response to appellant\u2019s claims, appellee wishes to suggest that the court\u2019s actions did not display favoritism, since \u201cother Trial Court comments with Officer Evangelista on the stand could arguably be construed as depicting an anti-prosecutorial posture.\u201d The prosecution then directs this court\u2019s attention to a number of instances where the trial court undertook active participation in the matter by terminating direct examination of Patrolman Evangelista, telling the witness to \u201cquit rambling,\u201d and displaying \u201cimpatience\u201d and \u201cfrustration\u201d with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>police officer during his testimony. However, such judicial conduct, whether directed at one party or all parties, is not to be condoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The traditional rule in Ohio is that the party seeking to challenge the court\u2019s questioning of a witness is required to raise an objection with the trial court. Specifically, Evid.R. 614 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">\u201c(C) <em>Objections. </em>Objections to the calling of witnesses by the court or to interrogation by it may be made at the time or at the next available opportunity when the jury is not present.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">In <em>State v. Davis </em>(1992), 79 Ohio App.3d 450, 455, 607 N.E.2d 543, 546, the court explained the basis for the rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">\u201cThe provision relating to objections is designed to relieve counsel of the embarrassment attendant upon objecting to questions by the judge in the presence of the jury, while at the same time, assuring that objections are made in ample time to afford the opportunity to take possible corrective measures. See Advisory Committee Note to analogous Fed.R.Evid. 614. The failure of a party to object in accordance with Evid.R. 614(C) waives consideration of the claimed error on appeal because the failure to object deprives the trial court of any opportunity to correct the alleged error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">However, in <em>State v. Prokos </em>(1993), 91 Ohio App.3d 39, 44, 631 N.E.2d 684, 687, the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-10\">\u201cUnder Evid.R. 611, the court has discretion to control the flow of the trial. This control includes asking questions of the participants and the witnesses in the search for truth. Evid.R. 614. Since a trial court\u2019s powers pursuant to Evid.R. 611 and 614 are within its discretion, a court reviewing a trial court\u2019s interrogation of witnesses and comments m\u00fcst determine whether the trial court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Davis </em>* *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">An abuse of discretion has been defined as a trial court\u2019s attitude that is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable. <em>State v. Montgomery </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 410, 413, 575 N.E.2d 167, 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">Furthermore, when the matter is tried before a jury, the judge must exercise greater restraint. In <em>State v. Perkins </em>(1947), 130 W.Va. 708, 715-716, 45 S.E.2d 17, 20-21, the Supreme Court of West Virginia held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-13\">\u201cIn disposing of a similar question presented in the case of <em>State v. Hurst </em>[ (1877) ], 11 W.Va. 54, this Court laid down the following rule: \u2018It is error for a court in the trial of a criminal cause, to make a remark to, or in the presence of the jury, in reference to matters of fact, which might in any degree influence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>them in their verdict.\u2019 In the case of <em>State v. Thompson </em>[ (1882) ], 21 W.Va. 741, 756, this Court again adverted to the rule laid down in the <em>Hurst </em>case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">\u201cThe rule is amplified and restated in the seventh point of the syllabus in the case of <em>State v. Austin </em>[ (1923) ], 93 W.Va. 704, 117 S.E. 607, as follows: \u2018In the trial of a criminal case, the jurors, not the court, are the triers of the facts, and the court should be extremely cautious not to intimate in any manner, by word, tone, or demeanor, his opinion upon any fact in issue.\u2019 In the case of <em>State v. Hively </em>[ (1927) ], 103 W.Va. 237, 136 S.E. 862, this court held: \u2018Under the practice in this State, the trial judge should express to the jury no opinion on the testimony, either directly or by innuendo.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">This similar rule has been adopted in Ohio:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">\u201cIn a trial before a jury, the court\u2019s participation by questioning or comment must be scrupulously limited, lest the court, consciously or unconsciously, indicate to the jury its opinion on the evidence or on the credibility of a witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\">\u201cIn a jury trial, where the intensity, tenor, range and persistence of the court\u2019s interrogation of a witness can reasonably indicate to the jury the court\u2019s opinion as to the credibility of the witness or the weight to be given his testimony, the interrogation is prejudicially erroneous.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Wise v. Chand </em>(1970), 21 Ohio St.2d 113, 50 O.O.2d 322, 256 N.E.2d 613, paragraphs three and four of the syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">From our review of the record, we are able to discern an attitude reflecting disdain for this particular proceeding. Such demeanor and tenor lead to a prejudicial effect upon the trial and reflect poorly upon the judicial process.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">This court recently discussed a trial court\u2019s duty to maintain an appearance of impartiality in <em>State v. Bayer </em>(Mar. 24, 1995), Geauga App. No. 94-G-1853, unreported, 1995 WL 237094. This court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-11\">\u201c[T]he judiciary must not only remain detached and neutral in any proceeding before it, but the court must also epitomize itself as the paragon of impartiality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-12\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cIt is of vital importance that the litigant should <em>believe </em>that he will have a fair trial.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Turner, v. Marshall </em>(1931), 123 Ohio St. 586, 176 N.E. 454.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-13\">\u2022 \u201c * * Such a stringent rule may sometimes bar trial by judges who have no actual bias and who would do their very best to weigh the scales of justice equally between contending parties. But to perform its high function in the best way <em>\u2018justice must satisfy the appearance of justice.\u2019 Offutt v. United States, </em>[1954], 348 U.S. 11, 14 [75 S.Ct. 11, 13, 99 L.Ed. 11, 16].\u201d <em>In re Murchison </em>(1955), 349 U.S. 133, 136 [75 S.Ct. 623, 625, 99 L.Ed.2d 942, \u2014].\u2019 (Emphasis added.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number><em>Monroeville v. Ward </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St.2d 179, 195 [56 O.O.2d 110, 118-119, 271 N.E.2d 757, 766] (Corrigan, J., dissenting).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">In the instant action, we are troubled by the court\u2019s commentary during the questioning of witnesses. While we recognize that <em>Davis </em>indicated that a timely objection was a prerequisite to preserving the issue on appeal, the degree of the court\u2019s involvement is extensive. Furthermore, the court\u2019s involvement exceeded merely questioning the witnesses as some of the court\u2019s remarks could have been interpreted by the jury to reflect the court\u2019s attitude or opinion of the witness and the proponent\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Appellee claims that since the court issued a curative instruction, any improper comments were rendered harmless. During the course of the charge to the jury, the trial the court instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">\u201cIf during the course of trial I have said or done anything that you consider an indication of my viewpoints on these facts, you are hereby instructed to disregard it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">However, we are not convinced that this curative instruction was sufficient to cleanse the jurors\u2019 minds of the remarks made by the trial court so as to cure any judicial impropriety. The first assignment is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">In the second assignment, appellant claims that the court improperly dismissed a juror from the jury panel. However, as the second assignment of error is rendered moot by our resolution of the first assignment, we need not, and do not choose to address the merits of the claimed error. App.R. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">In the third assignment of error, appellant claims that the court erred by instructing the jury that it could consider appellant\u2019s refusal to submit to the Breathalyzer. Prior to closing arguments the court indicated that it would be issuing the standard jury instructions and inquired whether counsel had any \u201cspecial instruction.\u201d Appellant\u2019s attorney responded, \u201cNo special ones, but I want to go over with the court about a specific one.\u201d However, the record does not contain any further discussions regarding the jury instructions, and appellant did not raise any further objection before or after the charge to the instruction now being challenged. As such, she has waived this issue. Civ.R. 51(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">Independently, we do not perceive any error with the court\u2019s decision to provide the jury with this instruction. Specifically the trial court advised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-12\">\u201cThere has been some evidence introduced indicating that [appellant] was asked, but refused, to submit to a chemical test of her breath to determine the amount of alcohol in her system. This was for the purpose of suggesting that [appellant] believed that she was under the influence of alcohol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>\u201cIf you find that [appellant] refused to submit to the test, you may, but you are not required to considered [sic ] all this evidence, along with all the other facts and circumstances in evidence, in deciding whether or not [appellant] was under the influence of alcohol.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">Such a charge is appropriate when the record contains some evidence of this fact. Indeed, the Supreme Court of Ohio, in <em>Maumee v. Anistik </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 339, 632 N.E.2d 497, approved the instruction offered by the court in the instant action. The third assignment is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the cause is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b485-7\">Christley and Joseph E. Mahoney, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-12\">. Appellant denied that she refused to take the Breathalyzer test, but claimed that she wanted to speak with an attorney before submitting to the Breathalyzer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
