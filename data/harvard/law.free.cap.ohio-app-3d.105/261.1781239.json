The trial court erred in granting plaintiff-appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-13\">\u201c2. The trial court erred in overruling defendant-appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-14\">This case arose on February 11, 1992, when the Ohio Attorney General (\u201cAG\u201d) filed a complaint for declaratory judgment, a preliminary and permanent injunction, consumer restitution, civil penalties, and fees for alleged violations of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act, as codified in R.C. 1345.01 <em>et seq., </em>against Ricart. The complaint also included allegations of violations of the Federal Truth-in-Lending Act. The AG asked for a civil penalty of $650,000 and for consumer relief in an amount to be determined by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-15\">Ricart notified Heritage of the pending lawsuit on February 25, 1992. Ricart told Heritage that it would be seeking coverage under its policy and defense and indemnification for the lawsuit. Ricart took advantage of an offer to settle the lawsuit for $160,000 two days after notifying Heritage. Ricart entered into a consent judgment entry on February 27, 1992, with the AG\u2019s office. The consent judgment lists the practices which the AG found to constitute violations of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act. These violations will be more fully discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Ricart maintained that Heritage owed it a duty of indemnification. Heritage maintained that, according to the terms of its policy, it owed Ricart nothing for the violations settled upon in the consent judgment. Heritage then filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment, requesting the trial court to declare Heritage free from the duty to defend or indemnify Ricart for violations of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act. Ricart answered and filed a counterclaim to recover damages for Heritage\u2019s failure to provide coverage. After discovery, both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court sustained Heritage\u2019s motion for summary judgment and overruled Ricart\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding from the evidence before the court that the terms of the insurance policy issued to Ricart required Heritage neither to defend nor to indemnify Ricart. Ricart appeals from this ruling, stating that the lower court erred in its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The standard of review in this case is well established. Pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C), a motion for summary judgment shall be granted if (1) no genuine issue of material fact remains to be litigated; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) the evidence demonstrates that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the party opposing the motion. <em>Bostic v. Connor </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 144, 524 N.E.2d 881; <em>Davis v. Loopco Industries, Inc. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 64, 609 N.E.2d 144. An appellate court independently reviews the pleadings and the evidentiary material submitted to the trial court and applies the same standard to determine whether the materials submitted establish a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Lorain Natl. Bank v. Saratoga Apts. </em>(1989), 61 Ohio App.3d 127, 129, 572 N.E.2d 198, 199-200. When reviewing the grant of a motion for summary judgment, an appellate court reviews the judgment independently and does not defer to the trial court. <em>Midwest Specialties, Inc. v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1988), 42 Ohio App.3d 6, 536 N.E.2d 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Further, in a case where opposing parties file motions for summary judgment, the admission of each party that there are no factual issues is limited to the purposes of the moving party\u2019s motion, and such admissions by the movant may not be applied to the adversary\u2019s motion. The filing of cross-motions for summary judgment does not establish the absence of an issue of fact. <em>Johnson v. Kroger Co. </em>(Oct. 19, 1994), Scioto App. No. 94CA-2218, unreported, 1994 WL 577699.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">With this standard of review in mind, we shall first address the issues of \u201cadvertising injury\u201d and \u201cmisappropriation\u201d as they relate to a genuine issue of material fact. The pertinent and contested language of the garage policy issued to appellant is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>\u201cA. COVERAGE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-4\">\u201cWe will pay all sums the insured legally must pay as damages because of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">\u201c1. Personal injury caused by an offense committed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">\u201c(a) In the conduct of your business; * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">U * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">\u201c2. Advertising injury caused by an offense committed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-9\">\u201c(a) In the course of advertising your goods, products or services; * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-10\"><em>a </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-11\">\u201cD. ADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-12\"><em>U </em>* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-13\">\u201c \u2018Advertising injury\u2019 means injury arising out of one or more of the following offenses:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-14\"><em>&lt;6 </em>ij: iji iji</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-15\">\u201c3. Misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-16\">\u201c4. Infringement of copyright, title or slogan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-17\">The policy language clearly demonstrates that it covers personal injuries and advertising injuries. As there were no allegations of personal injury in the AG\u2019s complaint, the issue becomes whether or not there was an \u201cadvertising injury\u201d under the terms of the policy. In other words, do the allegations in the AG\u2019s complaint constitute an \u201cadvertising injury\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b299-18\">Ricart asserts that the policy coverage includes its \u201cstyle of doing business,\u201d claiming that the word \u201cmisappropriation\u201d modifies only the words \u201cadvertising ideas.\u201d Thus, according to Ricart, it was entitled to coverage under the policy because the AG\u2019s complaint contained allegations concerning its business practices or style of doing business. Ricart claims that the interpretation of this clause represents a genuine issue of material fact and, therefore, the trial court should not have granted Heritage\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-19\">The law surrounding the issue of construction of an insurance contract is well settled. The law requires us to read an insurance contract as a whole, <em>German Fire Ins. Co. v. Roost </em>(1897), 55 Ohio St. 581, 45 N.E. 1097; <em>Stickel v. Excess Ins. Co. </em>(1939), 136 Ohio St. 49, 15 O.O. 570, 23 N.E.2d 839; <em>Equitable Life Ins. Co. v. Gerwick </em>(1934), 50 Ohio App. 277, 3 O.O. 572, 197 N.E. 923, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>the interpretation of that insurance contract is a question of law to be decided by a judge. <em>Erie Ins. Group v. Fisher </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 380, 15 OBR 497, 474 N.E.2d 320. Where language in a contract of insurance is doubtful, uncertain or ambiguous, the language will be construed strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured. <em>Faruque v. Provident Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Co. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 34, 31 OBR 83, 508 N.E.2d 949. If a contract is clear and unambiguous, then its interpretation is a matter of law, and there is no issue of fact to be determined. <em>Inland Refuse Transfer Co. v. Browning-Ferris Industries of Ohio, Inc. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 321, 15 OBR 448, 474 N.E.2d 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">We find that to interpret this clause as suggested by Ricart would lead to an absurd result. For example, applying Ricart\u2019s construction, the very next clause of the policy would then be interpreted as meaning the term \u201cinfringement\u201d applies only to the word \u201ccopyright\u201d and not to the words \u201ctitle or slogan.\u201d Each clause in that section of the policy is predicated on a verb, an action meant to modify the nouns of the clause. We find, therefore, that the term \u201cmisappropriation\u201d is intended to be read with \u201cstyle of doing business\u201d so that there must be a \u201cmisappropriation of the style of doing business.\u201d Because the AG\u2019s complaint is devoid of allegations of \u201cmisappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business,\u201d Heritage is under no duty to defend or indemnify Ricart.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Additionally, Heritage urges this court to find that the AG\u2019s allegations of \u201cunfair competition\u201d are not a \u201cmisappropriation of style of doing business\u201d within the meaning of the contract of insurance. We find <em>Seaboard Sur. Co. v. Ralph Williams\u2019 N.W. Chrysler Plymouth, Inc. </em>(1973), 81 Wash.2d 740, 504 P.2d 1139, persuasive on this point. In <em>Seaboard, </em>an insurer brought a declaratory judgment action seeking a judgment that it had no duty to defend a suit against an automobile dealer where the state AG sought an injunction for, among other things, \u201cunfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\u201d The dealership maintained that the suit was for damages due to unfair competition because the relief requested was for the court to make any additional orders or judgments as may be necessary to restore to any person an interest in any monies or property which may have been acquired by violation of the statute. The court in <em>Seaboard </em>found that the acts complained of did not constitute unfair methods of competition because there was no allegation that \u201cany competitor had been harmed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">In the instant case, the AG\u2019s complaint alleges harm to consumers, not harm to competitors. \u201cMisappropriation of the style of doing business\u201d necessarily involves a competitor. No such allegations were listed in the AG\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Thus, we find the arguments of Heritage well taken, and we conclude, therefore, that Heritage is under no duty under the terms of this policy to defend or to indemnify for an advertising injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Next, we shall address the issue regarding the Truth-in-Lending (\u201cTIL\u201d) rider attached to and incorporated as part of the garage policy issued by Heritage to Ricart.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, The portion of the policy directly in question concerns a rider or endorsement, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">\u201cThis endorsement modifies insurance provided under the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">\u201cGARAGE COVERAGE FORM</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">\u201cIt is agreed that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-9\">\u201c1. Such insurance as is afforded under the Garage Coverage Form for LIABILITY COVERAGE applies to damages solely due to Section 130, Civil Liability, of Title I (Truth in Lending Act) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act * * * \u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">Ricart argues that coverage exists under this section of its policy with Heritage, as the AG\u2019s complaint alleged TIL violations. Heritage claims Ricart is not entitled to coverage under the TIL rider for two reasons. First, Heritage claims that the policy covers only damages under Section 130 of TILA, and there were no Section 130 damages alleged in the AG\u2019s complaint. Second, Heritage maintains that there must be a bodily injury for the TIL rider to apply, and, once again, there were no allegations of bodily injury in the AG\u2019s complaint. Therefore, Heritage argues that it is under no duty to defend or indemnify.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">As to Heritage\u2019s first argument, we find the language of the TIL rider to be clear and unambiguous. The language contained in the rider specifically states that coverage will apply where the insured incurs damages <em>\u201csolely </em>due to Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>130.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We, therefore, find Heritage\u2019s argument well taken, and Ricart\u2019s objection to the language in the TIL rider without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Second, because we concluded that the TIL rider does not provide coverage for Ricart, we do not need to entertain the issue of bodily injury. We note that, while the policy may not have fulfilled Ricart\u2019s expectations of coverage, that issue is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Further, Ricart urges that, if this court fails to find an ambiguity in the language of the contract, then we must find an ambiguity between the language of the contract and the statement contained in an affidavit given by Ricart\u2019s chief financial officer. This argument is not well taken. The affidavit presented by Ricart\u2019s chief financial officer constitutes parol evidence. Absent a showing of ambiguity within the contract, parol evidence may not be admissible to affect its construction. <em>Foster v. Union &amp; Natl. Ins. Co. </em>(1920), 101 Ohio St. 180, 127 N.E. 865. If the contract is determined to be unambiguous, \u201cintentions not expressed in the writing are deemed to have no existence and may not be shown by parol evidence.\u201d <em>Aultman Hosp. Assn. v. Community Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 51, 544 N.E.2d 920. Finding the contract clear and unambiguous, we therefore conclude that there can be no introduction of parol evidence. Accordingly, we find no ambiguity in the insurance contract in the instant case. Based on the foregoing, we find that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that Heritage is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">For these reasons, both of appellant\u2019s assignments of error are overruled, and the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b302-8\">Peggy Bryant and Tyack, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b301-13\">.
