The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>has no discretion to choose the amounts to be allocated to the arrearages and to the obligor. <em>Calhoun v. Tucker </em>(May 18, 1992), Stark App. No. CA-8698, unreported, 1992 WL 127100; <em>Colwell v. Jones </em>(Aug. 1, 1990), Summit App. No. 14528, unreported, 1990 WL 108752.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">In the case at bar, appellee had unpaid arrearages under his child support order of $5,496.65, of which $3,137.51 was owed to appellant. The trial court should have ordered the entire $1,086.11 lump sum to be applied to the child support arrearage. We therefore find that the trial court erred in ordering that the lump sum be equally divided between the parties. Appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Butler County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division, is reversed, and the cause is remanded to that court for instructions to issue an order requiring transmittal of the entire $1,086.11 lump sum to the Butler County Child Support Enforcement Agency. The agency should then apply the amount to appellant\u2019s arrearages pursuant to R.C. 3113.21(H)(3)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b80-8\">William W. Young, P.J., and Powell, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-14\">. Appellee received a lump-sum disbursement of $1,621.04 as a percentage increase adjustment on his disability claim with workers' compensation. At a hearing on the issue of distribution of the lump sum, the parties agreed that the attorney who handled the workers\u2019 compensation case for appellee should receive a third of the lump sum. The trial court subsequently adopted the referee's report, which recommended that one-third of the lump sum be paid as attorney fees and that the remaining balance of $1,086.11 be equally divided between the parties. Appellant did not appeal the attorney fees award.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
