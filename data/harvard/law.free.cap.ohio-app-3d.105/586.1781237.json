Appellant, Virginia Hearn, seeks the reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment, which was contrary to the referee\u2019s recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">On July 15, 1994, the referee recommended judgment for appellant for $1,400, plus ten percent interest and costs. Judgment was entered accordingly by the trial court on the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">On July 18, 1994, appellee filed objections to the referee\u2019s findings of fact and recommendations in the form of a letter to the judge. The objections were based on evidence allegedly presented at the hearing, but were not in the form of an affidavit or supported by a transcript or other adequate record of the hearing before the referee. Appellant did not respond to appellee\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">The judge subsequently found appellee\u2019s objections to be well taken and vacated his July 15, 1994 judgment entry. He modified the referee\u2019s recommendations by granting judgment in favor of appellant and against appellee in the amount of $700, plus interest and court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">Appellant filed this timely appeal and asserted the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-14\">\u201c1. The Trial Court erred in sustaining appellee\u2019s objections to referee\u2019s report after entering judgment on behalf of appellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-15\">\u201c2. The judgment of July 28, 1994 is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-16\">As a preliminary matter we note that under Civ.R. 53(E)(7), the trial court can enter judgment at any time during the fourteen-day objection period; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>however, if objections are subsequently and. timely filed, the court must stay its order and consider and rule on the objections. Such was the case here. <em>Barksdale v. Van\u2019s Auto Sales, Inc. </em>(1989), 62 Ohio App.3d 724, 577 N.E.2d 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error alleges that the trial court erred in sustaining appellee\u2019s objections because appellee failed to file a transcript or affidavit with his objections. We find this argument to have merit based on Civ.R. 53(E)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">In the second assignment of error, appellant challenges the trial judge\u2019s July 28,1994 judgment as being against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Regardless of whether a transcript has been filed, the trial judge always has authority to determine if the referee\u2019s findings of fact are sufficient to support the conclusions of law drawn therefrom. Thus, the trial court can come to a different legal conclusion <em>if </em>that conclusion is supported by the referee\u2019s findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">In this instance, the trial judge determined that $700, not $1,400, was the appropriate amount of judgment. There is nothing in the referee\u2019s findings to support this latter conclusion. Therefore, it is against the manifest weight of the evidence and the second assignment has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">This court reverses the judgment of the trial court and enters judgment in favor of appellant for $1,400. It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b622-11\">Ford, P.J., and Joseph E. Mahoney, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
