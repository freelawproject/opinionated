Wesley Trimble, Administrator, Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation, appeal from a judgment, following a jury verdict, declaring that plaintiff-appellee, Gary L. Douglas, is entitled to participate in the Ohio Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund. Case No. 14509 is the city\u2019s appeal; case No. 14514 is the Administrator\u2019s appeal. Although each defendant has appealed, only the city has filed a brief in support of its appeal. Consequently, we assume that the Administrator has chosen not to raise any issues or to assert any assignments of error beyond those asserted by the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">The city contends that the trial court erred by failing to grant a motion for directed verdict. The city contends that Douglas failed to present sufficient evidence to establish that his injury resulted from emotional strain or tension that was any greater than that to which all workers are occasionally subjected, and also that Douglas failed to present medical testimony to establish that the emotional stress to which he was subjected as a result of his employment by the city proximately caused his injuries. We conclude that there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the jury\u2019s verdict. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">In November 1990, Douglas suffered a cardiac arrest while attending a meeting at Miami Valley Hospital. Subsequently, Douglas filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits requesting an allowance for \u201caggravation of pre-existing cardiomyopathy and cardiac arrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">At the time of his cardiac arrest, Douglas had been employed by the city in its fire department for twenty-three years. In 1988, Douglas was a district chief. At that time, he was diagnosed as suffering from cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart. At the recommendation of his treating cardiologist, Douglas sought reassignment to a \u201cdesk job,\u201d with shorter hours. In November 1988, Douglas accepted the position of bureau chief, emergency medical services division. In this position, Douglas assumed responsibility for administering the emergency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>medical services division for the city of Dayton. In February 1989, as a result of a reorganization, Douglas became involved in a series of labor disputes. Douglas testified that by the spring of 1990, his job included the following additional responsibilities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">\u201cQ. Now, earlier we heard mention about special projects. As a result of the Assistant Chiefs promotion [the reorganization] can you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what type of special projects were assigned to you over and above your stated job duties that you described earlier?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">\u201cA. In 1990 \u2014 and it had been a long time to lead up to these number of months, at that time period and during \u2014 during the time of the incident, we were, of course, facing financial problems in the City.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">\u201cI was given the order to \u2014 by the city mayor at the time, we are not going to ask you to do more \u2014 we\u2019re going to ask you to do more of the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-8\">\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the same; it was less. I think it was a hundred thirty-six thousand dollars. I don\u2019t know the exact amount, which for my division \u2014 which was smaller than the other divisions \u2014 was a quite sizable amount of money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-9\">\u201cOne, I\u2019m supposed to overhaul the system. The system has serious problems and we\u2019re approaching twenty-six thousand runs with five paramedic units and twenty-four hour periods averaging twenty-some runs with no rest, not even time to eat; shortage of personnel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-10\">\u201cI\u2019m also faced, at that point in time, with a lawsuit by our union on the Fair Labor Standards Act dealing with our paramedics working over forty hours a week. We had to bring that somehow to a successful conclusion, so we\u2019re working on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-11\">\u201cThe third thing is our senior paramedics\u2019 positions. One of my people resigned. I lost my instructor for our four hundred thirty-eight \u2014 these six people at the time have to have continuing education for maintaining E.M.T. so I\u2019m in the process of organizing that part of my division; full time instructor and have a swing shift senior paramedic for taking up the slack and the overtime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-12\">\u201cI\u2019m also charged with the responsibility of reducing my overtime, which was impossible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-13\">\u201cThe other thing, of course \u2014 not basically which was our budget with an annual pay increase of four percent, the City charges us to keep our Department within a three percent increase. It was again impossible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-14\"><em>\u201c </em># * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-15\">\u201cQ. Was there anything else \u2014 did you face any deadlines with regard to each of the special tasks you just talked about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>\u201cA. With the complete overhaul of the department, we were on a time schedule, as I understood it by Chief Hughes, and I had District Chief Paul Plummer working with me on that project as an Assistant. We were pressed for time. We had to get it done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">\u201cPart of that was bringing on board, making a four-level response as opposed to first responder, which meant its \u2014 an engine nearest the apparatus \u2014 the\u2014I\u2019m trying to bring about the four-level responses so as to reduce the runs across the board, not to duplicate the services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">\u201cPart of the plan was to train our dispatcher, and because we were facing some deadlines, I was facing a deadline on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">\u201cQ. Do you recall what that deadline was, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">\u201cA. He wanted it on his desk by the first of the year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-9\">\u201cQ. First of the year being 19 \u2014 ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-10\">\u201cA. Apian \u2014 1991.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-11\">\u201cQ. So you\u2019re working on this during 1990; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-12\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-13\">\u201cQ. Were there deadlines with regard to the other topics you mentioned; the budget for example?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-14\">\u201cA. We actually had \u2014 that was due in November.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-15\">\u201cQ. November of what year, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-16\">\u201cA. Of\u201990 for\u201991. Final.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-17\">\u201cQ. What about the reclassification of the paramedics\u2019 position? Is there a deadline on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-18\">\u201cA. That was\u201991.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-19\">\u201cQ. Was there any deadlines imposed on you as a result of Fair Labor Laws, the issue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-20\">\u201cA. That was an ongoing thing. We didn\u2019t know really where it was going. That\u2019s something we were working on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-21\">\u201cQ. At that point in time, how many hours a week would you estimate you were working in 1990?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-22\">\u201cA. I was putting in some weeks seventy hours, averaged sixty-plus hours a week.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-23\">In May 1990, the Director of the Fire Department resigned, and Douglas was named the interim director. He remained, however, the Assistant Chief for the Emergency Medical Services Division. In other words, to all of his existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>duties were added the duties of being the interim director of the Dayton Fire Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">On the morning of November 15, 1990, while attending a work-related meeting at Miami Valley Hospital, Douglas suffered a cardiac arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The meeting at Miami Valley Hospital was a routine meeting. That morning, Douglas had felt completely exhausted and recalled having asked a paramedic while he was walking down the hallway to the meeting whether he looked all right. When asked to describe the stress he was feeling in November 1990, Douglas testified that it was: \u201coverwhelming. Again, frustration. I \u2014 it\u2019s just like I said, totally out of control at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Douglas filed a claim for participation in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund. The initial hearing officer disallowed the claim. The regional board of review reversed the hearing officer and allowed the claim. The Industrial Commission reversed the regional board of review and disallowed the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Douglas appealed the decision of the Ohio Industrial Commission to the Montgomery County Common Pleas Court. A jury returned a verdict in favor of Douglas, and judgment was entered on the verdict. From the judgment of the trial court, both the city and the Administrator appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">The city\u2019s first assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-10\">\u201cAppellee failed to introduce sufficient evidence to establish that his injury resulted from greater emotional strain or tension than that to which all workers are occasionally subjected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">Workers\u2019 compensation claims based on stress are allowed in Ohio if the employee can satisfy the following two conditions:</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">1. The injury must have resulted from greater emotional strain or tension than that to which all workers are occasionally subjected, meaning that the mental or emotional stress must be unusual; and</p>\n<p id=\"b493-13\">2. The stress to which the claimant was subjected in his employment must, in fact, have been the medical cause of the injury. <em>Ryan v. Connor </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 406, 28 OBR 462, 503 N.E.2d 1379.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-14\">In its first assignment of error, the city contends that the trial court should have granted its motion for a directed verdict because of a failure of proof as to the first of the two conditions specified in <em>Ryan, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-15\">The city cites <em>Pence v. McSwain Carpets </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 793, 623 N.E.2d 201, and <em>Small v. Defiance Pub. Library </em>(1993), 85 Ohio App.3d 583, 620 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>N.E.2d 879, for the proposition that the mere facts that an employee is working long hours and has significant responsibilities will not satisfy the first prong of the test set out in <em>Ryan, supra. </em>In <em>Pence, supra, </em>the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County, in a two-to-one decision, upheld a finding by the trial court that the stress to which the employee in that case was exposed was not substantially greater than that to which all employees are occasionally subjected. The employee suffered an intercerebral hemorrhage while working on a year-end inventory in her position as an inventory supervisor. While this position was new to her, it was not new to her place of employment, and the trial court found that she failed to show that she was subjected to greater stress than that to which other employees were subjected.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Application of the first prong of the test set out in <em>Ryan, supra, </em>is necessarily fact-sensitive. In his separate concurring opinion, Judge Gorman opined that the decision by the trial court in <em>Pence, supra, </em>was against the manifest weight of the evidence. In the case before us, we are being asked to hold that the decision by the jury was not supported by the evidence, rather than that the evidence compelled a result in the employee\u2019s favor. Furthermore, we conclude that Douglas has presented a stronger case for having been subjected to significantly greater stress than that to which all workers are occasionally subjected. While the stress upon him in his position as Assistant Chief in charge of the Emergency Medical Services Division was at a maximum, he was required to undertake the additional duties of Director of the entire Fire Department, while retaining his responsibilities as Assistant Chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">In <em>Small, supra, </em>a summary judgment in favor of the employer was affirmed. In that case, a director of a public library suffered a fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage while presiding over a meeting related to a project to computerize the catalog systems of her own and three other area libraries. While this project was of great importance to the employee in that case, there was no evidence that the stresses to which she was subject were significantly greater than the stresses to which every employee is subject from time to time. We agree with the city in the case before us that the issue is not whether an employee subjectively experiences greater stress than most employees ordinarily experience, but whether the stress to which the employee is subject, viewed objectively, is significantly greater than the stress to which all employees are subject from time to time.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Once again, we find the facts in the case before us to be potentially distinguishable from those in <em>Small, supra. </em>Douglas was already subject to a great deal of stress in his job as Assistant Chief, and when the additional responsibilities that he was required to undertake as interim Director of the Fire Department were superimposed upon his other duties, we conclude that a reasonable finder of fact could find that Douglas was exposed to a significantly greater stress than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>stress to which all employees are occasionally subject. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying the city\u2019s motion for a directed verdict upon this ground, and the city\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The city\u2019s second assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">\u201cAppellee failed to introduce sufficient evidence that the stress to which he was subjected in his employment was, in fact, the medical cause of the injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">In addition to proving that the stress to which he is subject is significantly greater than the stress to which all employees are, from time to time, exposed, a claimant must, of course, prove that the injury for which he is seeking workers\u2019 compensation benefits was caused by the work-related stress to which he was exposed. Like any other issue of medical causation, this requires expert testimony, within a reasonable degree of medical probability, that the work-related stress caused the injury. Proof by a reasonable degree of medical probability means that the condition more likely than not caused the injury. <em>Cooper v. Sisters of Charity of Cincinnati, Inc. </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St.2d 242, 56 O.O.2d 146, 272 N.E.2d 97; see, also, <em>Wells v. Miami Valley Hosp., Inc. </em>(1993), 90 Ohio App.3d 840, 853-854, 631 N.E.2d 642, 650-651.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Thus, the question we are called upon to decide is whether the testimony of Douglas\u2019s medical expert, James Pacenta, M.D., is sufficient, if believed, to establish that Douglas\u2019s cardiac arrest was caused by the unusual work-related stress to which he had been exposed in the preceding weeks and months. We have reviewed both the transcript and the videotape of Paeenta\u2019s deposition, in its entirety, and we conclude that his testimony, when viewed in its entirety, is just barely sufficient to prove medical causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">A determination whether the testimony of a medical expert is sufficient to survive a motion for directed verdict on the issue of proximate cause must be determined in light of all of the expert\u2019s testimony. <em>Becker v. Lake Cty. Mem. Hosp. West </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 202, 207, 560 N.E.2d 165, 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">In his deposition, Pacenta testified that a person with a previous history of cardiomyopathy, like Douglas, has an increased risk of a cardiac arrest in response to stress. Pacenta testified that chronic, ongoing stress causes physical changes to the body that may, in turn, result in irregularities in the heartbeat, triggering a cardiac arrest, like the cardiac arrest in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">In arriving at our conclusion that Pacenta\u2019s deposition testimony, when viewed in a light most favorable to Douglas, satisfies the causation prong of the <em>Ryan </em>test, we have reviewed the entire eighty-one-page transcript of his testimony, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>our conclusion is based upon the entirety of that testimony. However, we would point to the following specific testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">\u201cQ. Okay. Doctor, you gave a prior opinion in this case, I think we have discovered during your discovery deposition to Mr. Ebenger\u2019s law firm, in pursuit of the, Mr. Douglas\u2019s request for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. And it was determined that your prior opinion was not based upon a reasonable degree of medical certainty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">\u201cHowever, today, you state an opinion that you say is based upon these hypothetical fact patterns that the person did have the cardiac arrest based upon an exacerbation of a preexisting cardiomyopathy condition. Your prior opinion, as I say, wasn\u2019t based upon a reasonable degree of medical certainty. Can you explain?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-7\">\u201cMR. EBENGER [representing Douglas]: Objection because I believe that it was. The doctor said in a prior opinion more likely than not, that\u2019s medical probabilities, but you can answer, Doctor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: Part of, and it is just my limitation in terms of some of the legal aspects \u2014 we are dealing with questions that don\u2019t have, at least from my perspective, they are grey. There is not a black and a white.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-9\">\u201cAnd I think that your question about \u2014 and I think to make it clear from my standpoint, you have an individual who is clearly at increased risk for sudden death, for ventricular fibrillation, it could happen spontaneously at any time and without warning and without an inciting event.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-10\">\u201cSo that is clear that that is the case. Now <em>the question that I was asked was </em>a situation where someone is under what he perceived to be as a high degree of stress, <em>would that, or in a medical probability exacerbate </em>\u2014 could <em>that or does it aggravate a preexisting condition?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-11\"><em>\u201cWell, you have got a substrate where somebody is at increased risk. And it is my opinion, and it is just an opinion, that that is a medical probability. </em>But we are dealing \u2014 again, to be, and I think part of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-12\">\u201cQ. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-13\">\u201cA. \u2014the first letter that I wrote was a cause-effect and I still feel that way. If you, if you would ask me do you think that his stressful environment \u2014 just say for a supposition that this is all totally completely true, ok, and this is the kind of situation he was under, did this cause his arrest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-14\">\u201cI would say I don\u2019t \u2014 you know, and, I think that is the idea, <em>I feel I have been asked did it contribute to it, and that\u2019s the question which I was sort of addressing.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>\u201cAgain, clearly without having the underlying condition, I don\u2019t think any of this stuff would be of, of significance.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Not long after this testimony, which was taken upon cross-examination, Pacenta conceded that something other than stress can cause arrhythmia, which would cause a cardiac arrest in a person with cardiomyopathy. However, Pacenta had previously testified that the stress to which Douglas claimed to have been exposed would likely have caused physical changes to his body that <em>contributed, </em>to the cardiac arrest by making it more likely that an arrhythmia would result in a cardiac arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">A motion for a directed verdict is to be granted only when the trial court, after construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is directed, finds that upon any determinative issue, reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion upon the evidence submitted, and that conclusion is adverse to that party. Civ.R. 50(A)(4). In the case before us, the issue is a close one. However, we conclude that when Pacenta\u2019s deposition testimony, in its entirety, is viewed in a light most favorable to Douglas, a reasonable finder of fact could conclude that the work-related stress to which Douglas was exposed contributed to the cardiac arrest for which he sought workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The city\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">The city\u2019s assignments of error having been overruled, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b497-11\">Brogan, P.J., and Wolff, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
