[sic ] an employee buyout payment or separation allowance of $43,325.00, in calculating plaintiff-appellant\u2019s gross income for child support purposes for the years 1993,1994 and 1995. (June 21,1994 entry).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">\u201cAssignment of Error No. 2:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">\u201cThe trial court erred when in its June 21, 1994 entry it c\u00e1lculated the amount of plaintiff-appellant\u2019s child support obligation without actually completing a child support computation worksheet and making that worksheet a part of the trial court\u2019s record. (June 21,1994, entry).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">A review of the record indicates that the parties were married in September 1980, and had four children. They were divorced in December 1991. The court imposed a child support obligation on appellant, Byron McCoy, of $204 per month plus poundage. This support order was based on a court determination that appellant\u2019s full-time employment with the CSX Railroad Company (five days per week) and his part-time employment at the U.S. Postal Service (one day per week) provided him a total annual income of $36,000. The court also found that appellee\u2019s annual income from her employment as a clerk was $12,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Subsequently, the CSX Railroad Company informed Byron McCoy that his full-time employment with it could not continue in its present form. The company provided Mr. McCoy with several options: (1) procuring comparable employment in Jacksonville, Florida; (2) continuing with the CSX Railroad Company without the possibility of receiving \u201cmonetary protection\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; or (3) terminating his employment with the company and taking a $43,325 lump sum \u201cseparation payment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">Mr. McCoy selected the third option. Upon terminating his employment with the CSX company, Mr. McCoy retained only his part-time job with the U.S. Postal Service. In this position, Mr. McCoy works one day per week, and receives approximately $13 per hour. He has no other employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">On March 3, 1994, Mr. McCoy filed a motion to modify child support with the Court of Common Pleas of Meigs County. He asserted as grounds for the modification of child support that termination of his employment with the CSX company was a significant change in circumstances. Appellant asserted that the money he received upon the termination of his employment with the CSX <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>company should not be included in his gross income for purposes of figuring child support, and that only the wages he earned through his part-time employment as a U.S. postal carrier should be considered for the purposes of figuring this obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">After the trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the matter, it journalized its findings and orders in an entry dated June 21, 1994. The court found that the one-time payment received by appellant was a \u201cbuyout,\u201d and ordered it included in appellant\u2019s gross income for purposes of child support calculations. However, the trial court failed to include a child support worksheet as required by R.C. 3113.215 in determining appellant\u2019s child support obligation. Appellant, unsatisfied with the trial court\u2019s ruling, filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Several months later, in a contempt proceeding dealing with Mr. McCoy\u2019s failure to comply with his amended child support obligation, the trial court ordered the Meigs County Child Support Agency to prepare a child support worksheet to support its June 21,1994 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">For purposes of analytical clarity, we begin by addressing appellant\u2019s second assignment of error. Mr. McCoy asserts that the trial court committed reversible error by failing to use a child support worksheet in calculating his child support obligation and by failing to include such a worksheet in the record for our review. For the reasons stated below, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">When a trial court considers a motion for modification of child support, it must follow the procedure contained in R.C. 3113.215(B)(4). See <em>Marker v. Grimm </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 139, 601 N.E.2d 496; <em>Ohler v. Ohler </em>(Sept. 16, 1994), Fulton App. No. 93FU000014, unreported, 1994 WL 506158; <em>Justinger v. Schlegel </em>(Sept. 26, 1994), Paulding App. No. 11-94-2, unreported, 1994 WL 521205; <em>Blake v. Blake </em>(May 4, 1995), Gallia App. No. 94CA16, unreported, 1995 WL 273846. R.C. 3113.215(B)(4) requires a trial court to \u201crecalculate the amount of support that would be required to be paid under the support order in accordance with the schedule and pursuant to the applicable worksheet.\u201d The Revised Code describes the \u201capplicable worksheet\u201d in R.C. 3113.215(E) and (F). The worksheet outlines the financial status of both the parties and allows for a thorough consideration of financial issues that affect the determination of child support. Figures from the worksheet are used in conjunction with a child support schedule contained in R.C. 3113.215(D)(1) to determine the amount of child support which must be paid.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Normally, we review the actions of a trial court concerning domestic relations issues on an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 218-219, 5 OBR 481, 481-483, 450 N.E.2d 1140, 1141-1142. However, the Supreme Court recently held in <em>Marker, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 143, 601 N.E.2d at 498-499, that the terms of R.C. 3113.215 are \u201cmandatory and must be followed literally and technically in all material respects.\u201d <em>Marker </em>requires the trial court to act in \u201cstrict compliance with the provisions of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143, 601 N.E.2d at 499; <em>Justus v. Justus </em>(Oct. 27, 1993), Gallia App. Nos. 92CA24 and 92CA37, unreported, 1993 WL 436033. See, also, <em>Justinger, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">We recognize that evidence regarding the financial status of each party was presented at the hearing and is contained in the court\u2019s record. However, R.C. 3113.215 requires the trial court to use a worksheet containing this information. The trial court had the responsibility to ensure that the child support calculations were made using the worksheet and the schedule. <em>Marker, supra, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 142, 601 N.E.2d at 498-499; <em>Blake, supra. </em>Without a completed worksheet, it is impossible to utilize the child support table contained in R.C. 3113.215(D), or to determine if the table is even applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Trial courts must also ensure that the completed worksheet is included in the record. See <em>Marker </em>at 142, 601 N.E.2d at 498-499; <em>Loving v. Balazs </em>(Nov. 18, 1994), Lake App. No. 94-L-021, unreported, 1994 WL 660621; <em>Tarver v. Payne </em>(Nov. 3, 1994), Cuyahoga App. No. 67079, unreported, 1994 WL 615033; <em>Justinger, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Clearly, a trial court is required to utilize a worksheet in its determination of a motion to modify child support. <em>Marker </em>and <em>Loving, supra. </em>If the trial court intends to adopt worksheets submitted by a party, the worksheets must be completed, signed by both parties, dated and notarized. See R.C. 3113.215(E); <em>Marker, supra, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 142, 601 N.E.2d at 498-499; <em>Justinger </em>and <em>Blake, supra. </em>In the present case, there simply is no such worksheet. The worksheet submitted by appellee is not signed, dated or notarized, as is required under R.C. 3113.215(E). Worksheets submitted to the court by the parties are not binding on the court. They may be adopted by the court only if they meet the requirements of R.C. 3113.215(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">A worksheet that was completed in November 1994, months <em>after </em>the trial court\u2019s June 21, 1994 entry, also appears in the record. This worksheet was prepared not by the court but by the Child Support Enforcement Agency for Meigs County. However, it is clear that the court adopted it as its own. The inclusion of this worksheet in the record long after the court has already entered a child support order \u201cbased\u201d upon those calculations is not in \u201cstrict compliance\u201d with R.C. 3113.215. However, we do not believe it is reversible error in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>A primary purpose for including the worksheet in the record is to ensure meaningful appellate review of the trial court\u2019s actions. <em>Marker, supra. </em>Here, it would make little sense to remand the matter for recalculation under a new worksheet which contains the same information as the one in the record. Because effective appellate review is not precluded by utilizing the November 1994 worksheet, we find the error, if any, to be harmless. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">In his first assignment of error, appellant protests the trial court\u2019s characterization of his $43,325 \u201cbuyout\u201d payment from the CSX company as gross income for child support purposes. Appellant does not expressly state the standard of review on this issue, but we believe, since it is necessarily a factual inquiry, that it presents a manifest weight of the evidence question. See <em>Foster v. Foster </em>(Mar. 3, 1993), Pike App. No. 490, unreported, 1993 WL 63382; <em>Wright v. Wright </em>(Nov. 10, 1994), Hocking App. No. 94CA02, unreported, 1994 WL 649271. An appellate court will not reverse the decision of a trial court as against the manifest weight of the evidence if the trial court\u2019s decision is supported by any competent, credible evidence which goes to all the essential elements of the case. <em>Security Pacific Natl. Bank v. Roulette </em>(1986), 24 Ohio St.3d 17, 20, 24 OBR 14, 16-17, 492 N.E.2d 438, <em>440-441; C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 280, 8 O.O.3d 261, 262, 376 N.E.2d 578, 579. This standard of review is highly deferential. Even \u201csome\u201d evidence is sufficient to sustain the verdict and prevent a reversal if it applies to all the essential elements of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">We begin with a review of the definition of \u201cgross income.\u201d \u201cGross income\u201d for purposes of child support is defined in R.C. 3113.215(A)(2) as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-7\">\u201c * * * except as excluded in this division, the total of all earned and unearned income from all sources during a calendar year, whether or not the income is taxable, * * * including], but not limited to, income from salaries, wages, overtime pay and bonuses to the extent described in division (B)(5)(d) of this section, commissions, royalties, tips, rents, dividends, <em>severance pay, </em>pensions, interest, trust income, annuities, social security benefits, workers\u2019 compensation benefits * * (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-8\">\u201cGross income\u201d includes \u201cseverance pay,\u201d but not \u201cnonrecurring or unsustainable income or cash flow items.\u201d R.C. 3113.215(A)(2). Severance pay is not defined by the statute, but according to common usage means \u201cpayment by an employer to employee beyond his wages on termination of his employment. Generally, it is paid when the termination is not due to employee\u2019s fault and many union contracts provide for it.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 Ed.Rev.1979) 1232. \u201cNonrecurring or unsustainable income or cash flow items\u201d include \u201cany income or cash flow item that the parent receives in any year or for any number of years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>not to exceed three years and that the parent does not expect to continue to receive on a regular basis,\u201d but do not include \u201ca lottery prize * * * not paid in a lump sum or any other item * * * that the parent receives or expects to receive for each year for a period of more than three years or that the parent receives and invests or otherwise utilizes to produce income or cash flow for a period of more than three years.\u201d R.C. 3113.215(A)(11).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Accordingly, if the cash payment from the CSX Railroad Company to appellant is a \u201cnonrecurring or unsustainable income or cash flow item,\u201d it may not be included in appellant\u2019s gross income for purposes of child support calculation. However, if it is \u201cseverance pay,\u201d the trial court was correct in including it.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">The trial court\u2019s entry awarding child support indicates that the $43,325 payment is a \u201cbuyout\u201d rather than severance pay. However, the \u201cbuyout\u201d was a cash payment provided to him in a lump sum upon termination of employment without fault. The trial court effectively considered the payment to be severance pay and we agree. There is competent, credible evidence to support this finding. Specifically, the \u201cbuyout\u201d was paid upon appellant\u2019s termination and represented a sum beyond wages. Furthermore, it is clear that the termination was not due to any fault of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">In so holding, we note that the generic language of the statute referring to \u201cnonrecurring or unsustainable income or cash flow items\u201d cannot be used to exclude a specifically defined category of gross income. Where the legislature has specifically included severance pay in \u201cgross income,\u201d the courts are not free to construe general language of the statute in a manner that renders specific enumerations meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is meritless and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b691-10\">Peter B. Abele, P.J., and Stephenson, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b687-11\">. Mr. McCoy\u2019s employment with the CSX company provided him with a guaranteed salary regardless of whether the company needed him to perform work for it. Mr. McCoy was expected to be \"on call\u201d to work for the company Monday through Friday. Had Mr. McCoy chosen the second option, he would have no longer had '-\u2018monetary protection.\u201d That is, he would only have been paid for the work he performed, receiving no compensation for any unworked hours.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b688-9\">. We note that neither party contests the court's finding that Mr. McCoy's termination was a significant change of circumstances, <em>i.e., </em>the court was authorized to modify the then-current support order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
