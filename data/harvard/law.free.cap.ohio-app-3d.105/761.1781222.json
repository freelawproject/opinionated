Scalzo, has submitted a motion to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California </em>(1967), 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493. In support of his motion, counsel for appellant states that after reviewing the record of the proceedings in the trial court, researching the applicable law and conferring with trial counsel, he was unable to find any meritorious, appealable issues. Counsel for appellant does, however, set forth three potential assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-14\">\u201cI. The trial court failed to strictly comply with Ohio Juvenile Rule 29[D].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-15\">\u201cII. Whether juvenile-appellant was denied the effective assistance of counsel at trial, in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-16\">\u201cIII. The court abused its discretion by committing juvenile to the Department of Youth Services in violation of Juvenile Rule 35(B).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-17\">The facts giving rise to this appeal are as follows. On September 20,1993, appellant was adjudicated delinquent by the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, based on a reduced charge of gross sexual imposition. In the same judgment entry the court (1) sentenced appellant to commitment to the Department of Youth Services; (2) stayed the commitment order; and (3) placed appellant on probation. One condition of appellant\u2019s probation was his placement in rehabilitative detention at St. Anthony\u2019s Villa, Sexual Offenders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>Treatment (\u201cSOT\u201d) program. A second condition of probation was that he cooperate and participate with treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">On June 17, 1994, a motion to show cause why disposition should not be changed was filed by appellant\u2019s probation officer, which alleged that \u201c[appellant] violated the court order by leaving the St. Anthony Villa Residential SOT program without permission and is currently A.W.O.L. and his whereabouts at this time are unknown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">On June 24, 1994, a separate complaint' that was assigned a separate case number was filed by an officer of the Toledo Police Department, which alleged that appellant \u201cdid on listed date break out a window at listed location and escape from his treatment center. While doing so the Def. did cause a counselor * * * to chase him and in the process of that chase did cause other members of that facility to become involved in the chase. Causing much confusion and disruption in the normal school activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">On July 1, 1994, a hearing was conducted by a referee of the juvenile court. A transcript from the hearing shows that the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: My understanding, Mr. Driscoll, that there\u2019s been an agreement reached in these matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-9\">\u201cMR. DRISCOLL: Yes, Honor. At this time there\u2019s going to be an admission made to Complaint Number 94-11743, violation of safe school ordinance. On that admission, I will not INAUDIBLE, and proceed to the motion to show cause, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: And Mr. Popil, is that your understanding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-11\">\u201cMR. POPIL: Yes, Your Honor. I would like to state for the record I did talk with my client [appellant] this morning. He is aware that he has a right to a trial regarding the window incident. At this time he would like to admit and state what actually happened last week on this offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-12\">\u201cAnd he does know potential penalties if he does admit to this offense. He knows his constitutional rights to a trial, to remain silent, that he\u2019s presumed innocent, that the prosecutor has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, the right to call witnesses, etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-13\">\u201cAt this time he wants to give up his rights and admit to the 94 case, with the understanding that the motion to show cause will be dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-14\">At the conclusion of the attorneys\u2019 statements, the following exchange took place.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: [Appellant], I\u2019m going to ask you a couple questions just to make sure what your attorney said is correct. You understand that you do have the right to have a trial on this safe school ordinance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>\u201c[APPELLANT]: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: It\u2019s my understanding that you don\u2019t want a trial and that you\u2019re going to admit today, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-6\">\u201c[APPELLANT]: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: And you understand that you are on a stayed commitment. That means that if you admit to this charge today, the Court could lift that stay and send you to D.Y.S., do you understand that that can happen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-8\">\u201c[APPELLANT]: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: No one\u2019s forcing you to admit today, you\u2019re doing it because you want to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-10\">\u201c[APPELLANT]: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: And no one\u2019s made you any promises as to what the Court will do if you admit today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-12\">\u201c[APPELLANT]: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: Is it true then that on June 23rd, 1994, that you broke out a window at St. Anthony Villa?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-14\">\u201c[APPELLANT]: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: And it\u2019s also true that you were chased?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-16\">\u201c[APPELLANT]: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-17\">\u201cTHE COURT: And this cause[d] disruption and confusion of the school activity at St. Anthony\u2019s Villa?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-18\">\u201c[APPELLANT]: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-19\">\u201cTHE COURT: How old were you when this happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-20\">\u201c[APPELLANT]: Seventeen, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-21\">\u201cTHE COURT: And St. Anthony\u2019s Villa is located in Lucas County, Ohio, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-22\">\u201c[APPELLANT]: Yes Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-23\">\u201cTHE COURT: State satisfied with the admission?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-24\">\u201cMR. DRISCOLL: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-25\">\u201cTHE COURT: The Court is also satisfied that the admission is knowingly, voluntarily made. The Court therefore finds [appellant] to be in violation of the safe school ordinance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-26\">The transcript shows that the focus of the hearing then changed to disposition. Appellant told the referee that he refused to return to St. Anthony\u2019s Villa SOT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>program and that if he was returned there he would run away. Following two further hearings and appellant\u2019s continued refusal to change his position regarding a return to St. Anthony\u2019s Villa, the referee made the following statements on the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: This is the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division. We\u2019re here on this 21st day of July, 1994. We\u2019re here in the matter styled * * * [appellant\u2019s full name].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-6\">\u201cThis matter was continued today for final disposition. The Court has continued this matter a number of times. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-7\">\u00ab * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. The Court will lift the stay on the gross sexual imposition charge, commit you to the Department of Youth Services for a minimum of six months. Court will order that you not be released until you complete sex appropriate treatment in the institution. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-9\"><em>i&lt; </em># * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: This hearing is adjourned. You\u2019ll be credited for the time you spent in C.S.I. This hearing is adjourned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-11\">Thereafter the court approved the written recommendation of the referee and ordered the prior stay rescinded and appellant committed to the Department of Youth Services \u201cfor a minimum period of six months to age 21.\u201d On August 29, 1994, appellant filed a <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal, \u201cfrom the commitments imposed in the above-captioned case on the 28th of July 1994 and from all rulings of the Court on all motions and objections of the juvenile or counsel.\u201d On October 4, 1994, counsel was appointed for appellant for purposes of appeal. On January 13, 1995, counsel for appellant filed his brief and request to withdraw as counsel pursuant to <em>Anders, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b799-14\"><em>Anders, supra, </em>and <em>State v. Duncan </em>(1978), 57 Ohio App.2d 93, 11 O.O.3d 83, 385 N.E.2d 323, set forth the procedure to be followed by appointed counsel who desires to withdraw for want of a meritorious, appealable issue. In <em>Anders, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that if counsel, after a conscientious examination of the case, determines an appeal to be wholly frivolous, he should so advise the court and request permission to withdraw. <em>Id. </em>at 744, 87 S.Ct. at 1400, 18 L.Ed.2d at 498. This request, however, must be accompanied by a brief which identifies anything in the record that could arguably support an appeal. Counsel must also furnish his client with a copy of the brief and request to withdraw and allow the client sufficient time to raise any matters that he chooses. Once these requirements have been satisfied, the appellate court must then conduct a full examination of the proceedings held below to determine if the appeal is indeed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>frivolous. If the appellate court determines that the appeal is frivolous, it may grant counsel\u2019s request to withdraw and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">In this case, appointed counsel for appellant has satisfied the <em>Anders </em>requirements. This court notes further that appellant has not filed a <em>pro se </em>brief or otherwise responded to counsel\u2019s request to withdraw. Accordingly, this court will now proceed to examine the potential assignments of error set forth by appellant\u2019s counsel and review the entire record from the trial court to determine if this appeal lacks merit and is wholly frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The first potential assignment of error asserts that appellant was deprived of due process of law because the referee failed to strictly comply with the requirements of Juv.R. 29(D) when it accepted his admission to the new charges. Juv.R. 29(D) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-6\">\u201cInitial procedure upon entry of an admission. The court may refuse to accept an admission and shall not accept an admission without addressing the party personally and determining both of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-7\">\u201c(1) The party is making the admission voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the allegations and the consequences of the admission;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-8\">\u201c(2) The party understands that by entering an admission the party is waiving the right to challenge the witnesses and evidence against the party, to remain silent, and to introduce evidence at the adjudicatory hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-9\">\u201cThe court may hear testimony, review documents, or make further inquiry, as it considers appropriate, or it may proceed directly to the action required by division (F) of this rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-10\">Appellant argues that the referee in his case was obligated to strictly comply with the requirements of Juv.R. 29(D). This court recently considered the issue of a trial court\u2019s compliance with Juv.R. 29 in accepting admissions in <em>In re Christopher R. </em>(1995), 101 Ohio App.3d 245, 655 N.E.2d 280, and determined that the appropriate standard is substantial compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-11\">Upon consideration of the entire record of proceedings in the trial court and as summarized above, this court finds that the trial court did substantially comply with the requirements of Juv.R. 29 when it accepted appellant\u2019s admission to the charges and, therefore, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-12\">The second potential assignment of error asserts that appellant received ineffective assistance of trial counsel because he \u201cwas committed to the custody of the Department of Youth Services after entering his \u2018admission.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-13\">The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted a two-part test for determining whether a defendant has received ineffective assistance of counsel. The test requires evidence that (1) the representation of the defendant\u2019s trial counsel fell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>below \u201can objective standard of reasonable representation\u201d; and (2) the substandard representation resulted in prejudice to the complaining defendant. <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), <em>42 </em>Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph two of the syllabus. In addition, \u201cin Ohio a properly licensed attorney is presumably competent.\u201d <em>State v. Jackson </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 107, 110-111, 18 O.O.3d 348, 350-351, 413 N.E.2d 819, 822-823.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Upon consideration thereof, this court finds nothing in the record which would support a finding that the representation appellant received from his trial counsel fell below \u201can objective standard of reasonable representation.\u201d Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">The third potential assignment of error asserts that the trial court abused its discretion by committing appellant \u201cto the Department of Youth Services in violation of Juvenile Rule 35(B).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">R.C. 2151.355, which sets forth the power of a juvenile court to make dispositional orders concerning a juvenile who is found to be delinquent, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-8\">\u201c(A) If a child is found by the court to be a delinquent child, the court may make any of the following orders of disposition:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-9\"><em>U </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-10\">\u201c(2) Place the child on probation under any conditions that the court prescribes. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-11\">i&lt; * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-12\">\u201c(4) If the child was adjudicated delinquent by reason of having committed an act that would be an aggravated felony of the third degree or a felony of the third or fourth degree if committed by an adult, commit the child to the legal custody of the department of youth services for institutionalization for an indefinite term consisting of a minimum period of six months and a maximum period not to exceed the child\u2019s attainment of the age of twenty-one years[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-13\">Juv.R. 35(B) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-14\">\u201cThe court shall not revoke probation except after a hearing at which the child shall be present and apprised of the grounds on which revocation is proposed. The parties shall have the right to counsel and the right to appointed counsel * * *. Probation shall not be revoked except upon a finding that the child has violated a condition of probation of which the child had * * * been notified.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-15\">Unless the juvenile court exceeds the statutory sentencing guidelines or abuses its discretion, this court will not reverse the decision of the juvenile court on appeal. <em>In re Anthony M. </em>(Mar. 10, 1995), Lucas App. No. L-94-204, unreported, 1995 WL 96786. An abuse of discretion \u201cconnotes more than an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>error of law or of judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 173, 404 N.E.2d 144, 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Upon consideration of the entire record of proceedings before the trial court and as summarized above, this court finds that the trial court did not act outside its statutory authority or in abuse of its discretion when it rescinded its prior stay and committed appellant to the Department of Youth Services \u201cfor a minimum period of six months to age 21.\u201d Accordingly, appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Upon our own independent review thereof, this court finds further that the record fails to reveal any arguable issues for appeal and that this appeal is wholly frivolous. The motion to withdraw filed by appellant\u2019s counsel is, therefore, granted and the decision of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, is hereby affirmed. Appellant is ordered to pay the court costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b802-8\">Glasser, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b802-9\">Handwork, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b802-10\">Handwork, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AyN\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">I dissent from the decision of the majority in this case, because, for the reasons stated below, I believe that the record presented to this court does present arguable issues for appeal. Accordingly, I would follow the procedure outlined by the United States Supreme Court and would not rule on the merits in this case; rather, I would appoint new counsel to prepare an appellate brief on behalf of appellant. <em>McCoy v. Court of Appeals of Wisconsin, Dist. 1 </em>(1988), 486 U.S. 429, 444, 108 S.Ct. 1895, 1905, 100 L.Ed.2d 440; <em>Penson v. Ohio </em>(1988), 488 U.S. 75, 84, 109 S.Ct. 346, 352, 102 L.Ed.2d 300, 311. See, also, <em>State v. Duncan </em>(1978), 57 Ohio App.2d 93, 93-94, 11 O.O.3d 83, 83-84, 385 N.E.2d 323, 323-324.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-12\">Briefly, I believe the majority goes astray at the outset, when it characterizes this appeal as solely relating to \u201ca judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, which ordered appellant to serve a previously stayed six-month commitment to the Department of Youth Services.\u201d The record reflects that this is actually an appeal from combined proceedings in the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas which related to a motion that appellant\u2019s probation be revoked because he violated his probation requirements, and to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>complaint alleging that appellant committed a violation of the safe school ordinance which rendered him a delinquent.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">The proceedings resulted in two judgment entries filed on July 28, 1994. In one judgment entry, which the majority acknowledges in its initial statement, the court found that appellant \u201cadmitted that he left St. Anthony\u2019s Villa Residential SOT program without permission and stayed away without permission.\u201d As a result, the court revoked appellant\u2019s probation and imposed a commitment order after lifting a stay. In the second judgment entry, the court found that appellant \u201cadmitted that he broke out a window at the Villa and was chased by staff members at the Villa.\u201d As a result, the court entered a finding that appellant violated the safe school ordinance and adjudged him delinquent.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Clearly, then, two separate incidents and two separate proceedings existed. One charge was the basis of the motion to change disposition, <em>ie., </em>to revoke appellant\u2019s probation, and the other charge was the basis of an entirely new complaint for delinquency. Furthermore, the transcript in this case lists two case numbers, and the referee makes a statement that the hearing is being held as to both cases. Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal is \u201cfrom the commitments imposed in the above-captioned case on the 28th of July 1994 and from all rulings of the Court on all motions and objections of the juvenile or counsel.\u201d Accordingly, our record encompasses an appeal from both judgments. The existence of the two separate proceedings and judgment entries is important, because we must be clear about the nature of the proceedings involved when the court accepted appellant\u2019s admission and entered its judgments before we can make any true evaluation of whether any arguable issues for appeal exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">Close review of the transcript of the hearing shows that appellant\u2019s trial attorney states in the transcript that his client is willing to make an admission relating to a specific case number. The case number identified by appellant\u2019s trial attorney is the case number assigned to the separate charge for delinquency, not the case number assigned to the revocation of probation case. The trial attorney\u2019s identification regarding which case his client\u2019s admission related to is supported by the exchange between the referee and appellant. Appellant entered an admission to breaking a window and causing a chase, a violation of the safe school ordinance, the charge that related solely to the delinquency case. Finally, before the admission was made, appellant\u2019s counsel stated that his client wanted \u201cto give up his rights and admit to the 94 case, <em>with the understanding that the motion to show cause will be dismissed.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) These facts lead to the reasonable conclusion that the admission in this case was made to the delinquency charge, thereby triggering Juv.R. 29(D) requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>The majority acknowledges in its facts that the two separate cases were initiated, but it fails to be consistent in its characterization of what the nature of the proceedings truly were in the juvenile court. Instead, it creates confusion by initially characterizing this as an appeal relating solely to a revocation of probation proceeding, and then proceeds, under the first proposed assignment of error, to apply Juv.R. 29(D) to this case, a rule which relates only to acceptance of an admission in a delinquency case, not to a revocation of probation proceeding. See Juv.R. 35(B). While, as I have explained, I believe that the record does support a conclusion that the admission made in this case did relate to the delinquency case, I do not understand how the majority can begin its discussion by characterizing this as an appeal which relates solely to a revocation of probation order and then apply a standard that does not apply to revocation of probation. Neither can I understand, even accepting the majority\u2019s tacit acknowledgment that the admission was entered to the delinquency charge and not to the charge relating to a violation of probation, how the majority can conclude on the basis of the record in this case that there was substantial compliance -with Juv.R. 29(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">I believe that pursuant to the holding in <em>In re Christopher R., supra, </em>the requirements of Juv.R. 29(D) are met when (1) a juvenile\u2019s attorney makes a statement in the presence of the juvenile and the court indicating that the attorney has informed the juvenile of his specific constitutional rights, and that the juvenile understands his rights and understands the effect of the waiver of his rights, and (2) the court then makes inquiry to determine that the juvenile heard and understood what his attorney said, that the juvenile is voluntarily making the admission, and that the juvenile understands his rights and the effect of his admission. However, the transcript from this case shows that neither part of the above test was met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Appellant\u2019s attorney made an incomplete statement regarding the rights to which appellant was entitled. The exact statement was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-7\">\u201cI would like to state for the record I did talk with my client [appellant] this morning. He is aware that he has a right to a trial regarding the window incident. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-8\">\u201cAnd he does know potential penalties if he does admit to this offense. He knows his constitutional rights to a trial, to remain silent, that he\u2019s presumed innocent, that the prosecutor has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, the right to call witnesses, etc.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">I believe this statement is too brief and indefinite to show that appellant was aware of all of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">Furthermore, even if the statement was sufficient to show that appellant was informed of all of his constitutional rights, there is nothing in the record to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>support a finding that the second requirement, that the referee make inquiry to determine that appellant heard and understood what his attorney said, was met in this case. The transcript shows that the referee merely asked appellant (1) whether he understood that he was waiving his right to a trial; (2) whether he understood that he could be sent to the Department of Youth Services; and (3) whether anyone made promises to him as to what the court\u2019s disposition in the case would be if he entered an admission. The referee therefore had no basis to form a personal conclusion that appellant did understand all of his constitutional rights or the effect of his decision to waive all of those rights. Arguable issues clearly exist, therefore, regarding whether error occurred when the juvenile court accepted appellant\u2019s admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Finally, even though I believe the record does support the conclusion that the admission in this case related to a delinquency charge, I believe that counsel could make an argument that at the very least the record shows confusion regarding whether the proceedings were relating to the delinquency charge or the revocation of probation case. Appellant, through his counsel, made it clear that the admission related to the delinquency case, but the transcript shows that the court used the admission in the delinquency case to revoke appellant\u2019s probation despite separate charges being entered to support the motion for the revocation of appellant\u2019s probation. I believe that counsel could further plausibly argue that this confusion regarding the exact nature of the proceedings gives rise to arguable issues for appeal. I would not proceed to the merits of this case until an appellate brief discussing those issues was filed with this court by new counsel appointed to act on appellant\u2019s behalf.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
