Appellant, Ray Payton, seeks the reversal of the trial court\u2019s decision finding him liable to appellee, David Roberts, for the sum of $1,163.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Appellant is an automobile mechanic, doing business as High Tech Automotive in Hubbard, Ohio. In June 1993, he performed certain services on the transmission of appellee\u2019s 1991 Mercury Sable. Approximately two months later, appellee brought the vehicle back to appellant, claiming that the transmission was again not functioning properly. However, even though appellant had given appellee a ninety-day warranty on the prior work, he refused to make any further repairs. As a result, appellee had to have the vehicle repaired at a different garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">In December 1993, appellee initiated the instant action by filing a small claims complaint against appellant. In his complaint, appellee essentially alleged that appellant had failed to perform the original work in a proper manner. For relief, he sought the sum of $2,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The action was initially tried before a court referee. Based upon certain evidence presented by appellee, the referee found in his report that, when appellant had made the original repairs, he had failed to use the correct transmission parts. Accordingly, the referee recommended that judgment be entered in favor of appellee for the sum of $2,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">On the same date that the referee\u2019s report was issued, the trial court rendered a judgment consistent with the referee\u2019s recommendation. When appellant subsequently filed timely objections to the report, the trial court vacated the judgment and held a separate evidentiary hearing on the matter. See Civ.R. 53(E)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Following the hearing, the trial court issued a new judgment in favor of appellee. As part of this judgment, the court expressly found that the proximate cause of the damage to the vehicle transmission had been appellant\u2019s failure to properly \u201ctorque\u201d certain bolts. As to the issue of damages, the court further found that appellee had failed to mitigate his damages. As a result, the court held that appellee was only entitled to $1,163.25, instead of $2,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">In appealing from this judgment, appellant has raised one assignment of error for consideration. Under this assignment, he contends that the trial court\u2019s finding as to the cause of the damages to the transmission was against the manifest weight of the evidence. For the following reasons, this court concludes that the merits of this argument cannot be addressed in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">Our review of the record indicates that, in objecting to the report of the referee, appellant raised two evidentiary questions. However, in doing so, appellant did not submit a transcript of the hearing before the referee, or an affidavit concerning the nature of evidence presented to the referee. See Civ.R. 53(E)(6). Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s factual determination as to the proximate cause of the damages to the vehicle\u2019s transmission was based solely upon the referee\u2019s report and the evidence which was presented directly to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>In relation to this point, this court notes that in its judgment entry, the trial court stated that its decision was based in part upon its independent analysis of the referee\u2019s report. When an objecting party fails to submit to the trial court the necessary affidavit or transcript of the referee\u2019s hearing, the scope of a trial court\u2019s review of the factual findings in a report is limited to determining whether those findings are sufficient to support the referee\u2019s ultimate factual findings and the conclusions of law. See <em>Welsch v. Mariano </em>(Nov. 10, 1994), Trumbull App. No. 94-T-5062, unreported, at 4, 1994 WL 660864.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">. In other words, in the absence of a transcript or affidavit, the trial court\u2019s \u201canalysis\u201d of the report could not have included a determination as to whether the evidence presented to the referee supported the referee\u2019s findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Further, given that the trial court\u2019s finding as to the proximate cause issue was partially based upon the evidence it heard in its own separate hearing, the scope of an appellate court\u2019s review must include a transcript of that hearing. However, we are unable to review the evidence presented at that hearing of the trial court because appellant has failed to file a transcript of that particular hearing as part of the appellate record.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">App.R. 9(B) states that if an appellant intends to argue on appeal that a trial court\u2019s factual finding is against the manifest weight of the evidence, he must ensure that a transcript of all relevant evidence is included with the record. This obligation is placed upon the appellant because he has the burden of demonstrating the alleged error by reference to the record. See <em>Schialdone v. Schialdone </em>(Dec. 16, 1994), Trumbull App. No. 93-T-5007, unreported, at 6, 1994 WL 721621, citing <em>Knapp v. Edwards Laboratories </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 197, 15 O.O.3d 218, 400 N.E.2d 384. When the appellant fails to satisfy this obligation, an appellate court must presume that the evidence supported the trial court\u2019s findings. <em>Dragojevic-Wiczen v. Wiczen </em>(1995), 101 Ohio App.3d 152, 155-156, 655 N.E.2d 222, 224-225.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">In his brief on appeal, appellant contends that no \u201cofficial record\u201d of the evidentiary hearing was kept. Under such circumstances, appellant should have submitted a statement of the evidence, pursuant to App.R. 9(C). Again, in the absence of such a statement, this court must presume that the evidence supported the trial court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Since appellant cannot demonstrate that the judgment in this case was against the manifest weight of the evidence, his sole assignment of error lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b634-11\">Ford, P.J., and Joseph E. Mahoney, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
