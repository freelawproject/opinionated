The court of common pleas granted the Industrial Commission\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal on the basis that the appeal was filed beyond the sixty-day limit for appealing the Industrial Commission\u2019s decisions contained in R.C. 4123.519.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In his solitary assignment of error, Cantrell asserts that dismissal of his appeal was in error because the sixty-day time limit begins to run' only when a party receives the formal written decision of the Industrial Commission, and upon the undisputed evidence in this case his attorney never received such formal notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">Although not without concern for the wisdom or economy of requiring Cantrell to go back to the Industrial Commission and prove what it apparently concedes\u2014 that notice to Cantrell\u2019s attorney was mailed to the wrong address and therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>not received \u2014 we hold that compliance with R.C. 4123.522, the statutory \u201csavings procedure,\u201d is a required first step to vesting the court of common pleas with jurisdiction in a case involving an alleged failure of notice. Because Cantrell did not pursue this administrative remedy before filing his appeal in the court of common pleas, we affirm that court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">On October 19, 1990, the Industrial Commission, through a district hearing officer, denied Cantrell\u2019s claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits for laryngeal cancer which he allegedly contracted as a result of asbestos exposure while an employee of the defendant-appellee Celotex Corporation. Cantrell timely appealed this decision to the Dayton Regional Board of Review, which affirmed the decision of its hearing officer on August 22, 1991. The Industrial Commission then affirmed the regional board on December 8,1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">According to Cantrell, the Industrial Commission then sent notice of its decision to his attorney at the address of his old law firm, where he had not worked for approximately two years. This allegation is borne out by the decision itself, which bears the addresses of the parties and contains a different address for Cantrell\u2019s attorney than the one that appeared in the earlier decisions of the hearing officer and regional board. In its response to the Industrial Commission\u2019s motion to dismiss his appeal to the court of common pleas, Cantrell\u2019s counsel averred that he only became aware of the Industrial Commission\u2019s denial of the claim on May 11, 1993, when he called to inquire as to why no decision had yet been issued. According to Cantrell\u2019s counsel, he had yet to receive written notice of the Industrial Commission\u2019s decision during the pendency of his appeal in the court of common pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">As he argued below, Cantrell asserts before this court that the Industrial Commission\u2019s failure to provide his counsel with written notice of its decision rendered inapposite the requirement in R.C. 4123.519 that the appellant file his notice of appeal to the court of common pleas within sixty days of the receipt of the Industrial Commission\u2019s order. In the absence of written notice, Cantrell asserts that it is sufficient that he filed his appeal to the court of common pleas within sixty days of May 11,1993, the date upon which his counsel received actual knowledge of the decision. Moreover, Cantrell argues that R.C. 4123.522, the statutory section which sets forth an administrative procedure whereby parties who have failed to receive notice through no fault or neglect of their own may receive an additional twenty-day period in which to file an appeal, does not apply because that procedure only need be followed where the notice is posted to the proper address.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>II. Notice Requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">The starting point of our analysis is the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Weiss v. Ferro Carp. </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 178, 542 N.E.2d 340. <em>Weiss </em>makes clear that both a party and the party\u2019s attorney are entitled to written notice of the Industrial Commission\u2019s decision, and \u201c[n]ot until after receipt of this notice does the time for appeal under R.C. 4123.519 begin to run.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 182, 542 N.E.2d at 344. Actual knowledge of the decision such as that Cantrell\u2019s attorney received after making a telephone inquiry to the Industrial Commission is not the same as \u201cnotice,\u201d and only upon receipt of the latter does the sixty-day period commence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">That is not to say, however, that because both a party and his representative are entitled to notice, notice to one and not the other necessarily precludes the running of the sixty-day period. This is so because of language in R.C. 4123.522. That section provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u201cThe employee, employer and their respective representatives shall be entitled to written notice of any hearing, determination, order, award, or decision under the provisions of Chapter 4123. of the Revised Code. If any person to whom a notice is mailed shall fail to receive such notice and the industrial commission, upon hearing, shall determine that such failure was due to cause beyond the control and without the fault or neglect of such person or his representative and that such person or his representative did not have actual knowledge of the import of the information contained in such notice, such person may take the action afforded to such person within twenty days after the receipt of such notice of such determination of the industrial commission. Delivery of such notice to the address of such person or his representative shall be prima facie evidence of receipt of such notice by such person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">As noted in <em>Weiss, </em>the proviso in R.C. 4123.522 that such person or his representative did not have actual knowledge of the import of the information contained in the notice is designed \u201cto prevent a party from delaying the filing of an appeal where notice has been sent to both the party and his representative, and one of them has not received such notice but is fully aware of the decision and receipt thereof by the other * * *.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183, 542 N.E.2d at 344. In other words, R.C. 4123.522 was implemented \u201cto afford relief where notice is not received by either the party or his representatives, and one or both of them has no knowledge of the decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although <em>Weiss </em>acknowledged that there was no duty upon a party who receives notice to advise his representative, a representative who has actual knowledge of the notice received by his or her client cannot deliberately allow the sixty-day period for filing an appeal to expire.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>III. Right to Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">It follows, therefore, that if, as Cantrell\u2019s counsel asserts, he did not receive written notice of the Industrial Commission\u2019s decision, and if he did not obtain actual knowledge of the decision until May 11,1993, the sixty-day period in R.C. 4123.519 for filing an appeal to the court of common pleas did not begin to run and his appeal should not have been dismissed for that reason. As noted at the outset, on the basis of representations made in its brief and in oral argument, the Industrial Commission is apparently willing to concede for purposes of this appeal that the notice was misdirected and never received by Cantrell\u2019s counsel, and that, furthermore, Cantrell\u2019s counsel did not have actual knowledge of the decision until May 11, 1983. The question arises, however, whether a party claiming a failure of notice has a preemptory right to take an appeal to the court of common pleas by merely averring in the notice of appeal or in the complaint that no notice was received and that the appeal was brought within sixty days of receiving actual knowledge of the decision. We hold that such a preemptory right of appeal does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The reason for our holding is twofold. First, it is clear that the legislature has created an administrative remedy for a party claiming a failure of notice. As described in <em>Weiss, </em>R.C. 4123.522 is \u201c \u2018savings procedure\u2019 which applies in circumstances where notice of the decision to be appealed is not received * * <em>Id. </em>at 179, 542 N.E.2d at 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">We cannot agree with Cantrell\u2019s assertion, moreover, that he was not required to exhaust this administrative remedy because the remedy applies only to situations involving the so-called \u201cmailbox rule,\u201d a rebuttable presumption that a letter mailed is presumed to be received in due course. See <em>Young v. Bd. of Review </em>(1967), 9 Ohio App.2d 25, 38 O.O.2d 36, 222 N.E.2d 789. According to Cantrell, the \u201cmailbox rule\u201d has no bearing in the present case because the presumption only attaches when the letter is sent to the correct address. <em>Weiss, </em>however, states that the \u201cmailbox rule\u201d applies \u201conce a notice is mailed,\u201d <em>Weiss </em>at 180, 542 N.E.2d at 341, making no distinction as to whether it was properly addressed. Furthermore, we believe that the \u201cmailbox rule\u201d is only one evidentiary aspect of the procedure under R.C. 4123.522, not its sole reason for being, and that, no matter whether the presumption is rebutted or shown to have no logical application, the legislature intended R.C. 4123.522 to be the mechanism by which \u201cany person to whom notice is mailed\u201d may demonstrate that it was not received in due course. In sum, the fact that the Industrial Commission put an old address on the notice mailed to his counsel clearly makes Cantrell\u2019s task of defeating the \u201cmailbox rule\u201d easier, but it does not obviate the need for an administrative hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Secondly, lest we be accused of perpetuating a Kafkaesque bureaucracy, in which people are required to submit to hearing matters which no one contests, a close examination of <em>Weiss </em>makes clear that a party cannot, from a jurisdictional standpoint, bypass the savings procedure of R.C. 4123.522 and take an appeal directly to the court of common pleas by merely asserting actual knowledge of a decision. In <em>Weiss, </em>the claimant received written notice of the Industrial Commission\u2019s decision in January 1986, but his counsel, who never received notice, did not learn of the decision until April of that year. In determining the claimant\u2019s time for filing an appeal, the court in <em>Weiss </em>wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">\u201c[The claimant\u2019s] counsel was entitled to notice of the commission\u2019s decision of December 9, 1985, which denied the appeal. When counsel learned of the adverse decision on April 16, 1986, the sixty-day period under R.C. 4123.519 for appeal to the common pleas court had presumptively run since counsel was presumed to have received notice under the \u2018mailbox rule.\u2019 <em>Accordingly, [the claimant\u2019s] time for appeal did not begin to run on April 16, 1986, when its counsel first learned of the commission\u2019s adverse decision. It was first necessary, as counsel did, to apply to the commission pursuant to R.C. 4128.522 for a determination that the presumption of receipt of the decision was factually incorrect and, thus, the filing of an appeal should be allowed. </em>[The claimant\u2019s] time to appeal the commission\u2019s decision denying the appeal did not begin to run until September 2,1986, when appellant received <em>notice </em>of the commission\u2019s order granting appellant\u2019s motion under R.C. 4123.522 and of the adverse decision of December 9, 1985, referred to therein.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Weiss, supra, </em>at 182-183, 542 N.E.2d at 344.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">From this passage it is clear that no direct right of appeal inures to a party upon learning of an adverse decision; rather, it is the receipt of <em>notice </em>of the Industrial Commission\u2019s order granting relief under R.C. 4123.522 and the adverse decision that resurrects the party\u2019s presumptively expired time for filing the appeal. Indeed, both <em>Weiss </em>and its predecessor, <em>Skiba v. Connor </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 147, 5 OBR 313, 449 N.E.2d 775,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> support the conclusion that no right of appeal attaches as the result of mere knowledge of the decision, and that it is not until after receipt of written notice that the right of appeal attaches and the time for appeal begins to rum In this respect, in a case involving an alleged failure of notice, we deem the Industrial Commission\u2019s order granting relief under R.C. 4123.522 and receipt of the adverse decision jurisdictional prerequisites to a party\u2019s right to appeal to the court of common pleas. We note that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>appears Cantrell\u2019s counsel has <em>yet </em>to receive his notice, so he may now seek relief under R.C. 4123.522, and the Industrial Commission\u2019s order under that section will allow him to properly proceed to the court of common pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Finally, because both sides have sought to enlist it in their causes, we note that this court\u2019s decision in <em>Hendrickson v. ANR Freight Systems </em>(Aug. 1, 1990), Hamilton App. No. C-890332, unreported, 1990 WL 107456, is distinguishable and consistent with our holding in the case <em>sub judice. </em>In <em>Hendrickson, </em>the Industrial Commission mailed notice to the claimant\u2019s attorney in an envelope incorrectly stating his firm\u2019s name. Unlike the scenario involving Cantrell, however, the attorney did receive the notice almost a month after it was mailed. The attorney then filed an appeal to the court of common pleas within sixty days of receipt of the notice but beyond the presumptive running of the sixty-day period in accordance with the \u201cmailbox rule.\u201d Observing that the case involved a lack of timely notice rather than a failure <em>of </em>notice, this court held that there was no need for the claimant to resort to the savings procedure in R.C. 4123.522 since R.C. 4123.519 expressly granted to his counsel sixty days in which to file his appeal from the date he ultimately received the improperly addressed notice. The same result would have applied here had Cantrell\u2019s attorney eventually been forwarded the notice mailed to his old law firm. Because the notice was not forwarded, this case involves a failure of notice and resort to R.C. 4123.522 is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth herein, the order of the trial court dismissing Cantrell\u2019s appeal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b130-9\">Gorman, P.J., and Hildebrandt, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-13\">. R.C. 4123.519 states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-14\">\"Notice of such appeal shall be filed by the appellant with the court of common pleas within sixty days after the date of the receipt of the decision appealed from or the date of receipt of the order of the commission refusing to permit an appeal from a regional board of review. Such filing shall be the only act required to perfect the appeal and vest jurisdiction in the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b129-7\">. The central holding of <em>Skiba, </em>that R.C. 4123.522 was strictly an intra-agency remedy, was overruled in the syllabus of <em>Weiss. Weiss, </em>however, cites <em>Skiba </em>for the proposition that it is notice, not actual knowledge, which triggers the time for appeal under R.C. 4123.519. <em>Weiss, </em>44 Ohio St.3d at 182, 542 N.E.2d at 344.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
