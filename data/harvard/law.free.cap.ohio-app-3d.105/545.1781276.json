Henry III was arrested and charged with two traffic offenses: having no operator\u2019s license, in violation of Columbus City Code Section (\u201cC.C.\u201d) 2135.01, and operating his vehicle at too slow a speed, in violation of C.C. 2133.04. In addition, Columbus Division of Police Officer Barry Kirby caused the issuance of further complaints charging Henry with aggravated menacing in violation of C.C. 2303.03, assault in violation of C.C. 2303.01, and resisting arrest in violation of C.C. 2315.01. Henry was jailed and posted bond the following day. More pertinent facts are set forth below in our discussion of the first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">Following a hearing, the trial court overruled motions filed by defense counsel seeking dismissal of the various charges. In an entry dated January 6, 1995, the court indicated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-9\">\u201c * * * [M]otion to dismiss for lack of probable cause overruled; motion to dismiss for lack of reasonable suspicion to stop is overruled because the deft, was voluntarily stopped prior to officer coming on to the scene.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">A jury trial commenced on January 9, 1995. An entry dated the same day indicates that the no operator\u2019s license charge was dismissed upon motion of the assistant city prosecutor. At the close of the city\u2019s case, the trial court sustained defense counsel\u2019s Crim.R. 29 motion for a judgment of acquittal as to the slow speed charge. Accordingly, only three remaining charges were submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">The jury acquitted Henry of the aggravated menacing charge but found him guilty of resisting arrest. The trial court sentenced Henry to thirty days in jail, suspended the sentence, and placed Henry on one year\u2019s probation. The court also imposed a fine of $200 and ordered Henry to pay costs totaling $563. The jury was unable to agree on a verdict as to the assault charge; at the request of the city, the assault charge was ultimately dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-12\">Henry (\u201cappellant\u201d) has timely appealed, assigning two errors for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-13\">\u201cAssignment of Error Number One:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>\u201cThe trial court erred when it entered a judgment of conviction against the defendant when the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction and the conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence presented when the prosecution failed to prove that the arrest was lawful and supported by probable cause, that proper notice had been given of the cause for the arrest, and that the defendant understood that he was under arrest. The court further erred by entering the conviction when the evidence established that excessive and unnecessary force had been used which the defendant was entitled to resist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">\u201cAssignment of Error Number Two:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">\u201cThe trial court erred when it failed to instruct the jury on all matters of law necessary to render a proper verdict on the charge of resisting arrest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">By his first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in entering a judgment of conviction because the evidence was not sufficient to sustain a guilty verdict. He further submits that the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">In <em>State v. Conley </em>(Dec. 16, 1993), Franklin App. No. 93AP-387, unreported, 1993 WL 524917, this court examined the standards of review for criminal cases challenging the sufficiency and weight of the evidence. We explained the test to be applied in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">\u201cThe test to be used in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction is set forth in the second paragraph of the syllabus of <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259 [574 N.E.2d 492]. Upon such issue, determining whether, as a matter of law, the evidence is sufficient to support a conviction, the evidence must be construed in a light most favorable to the prosecution, and the reviewing court must determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. H? ^ Hi \u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">However, as we explained in <em>Conley, </em>the test for reviewing the manifest weight of the evidence is slightly different:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-12\">\u201cWhen the manifest weight of the evidence is the issue, the evidence is not construed most strongly in favor of the state. Instead, the appellate court must engage in a limited weighing of the evidence to determine whether there is sufficient competent, credible evidence to permit reasonable minds to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230 [39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212]. This test is stated in the second paragraph of the syllabus of <em>State v. Eskridge </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 56 [526 N.E.2d 304], as being \u2018a reviewing court will not reverse a conviction where there is substantial evidence upon which the court could reasonably conclude that all the elements of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>offense have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 See, also, <em>Elyria v. Tress </em>(1991), 73 Ohio App.3d 5 [595 N.E.2d 1031].\u201d See, also, <em>State v. Shamblin </em>(Mar. 31, 1994), Franklin App. No. 93APA07-965, unreported, 1994 WL 109685.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Appellant was convicted of resisting arrest, in violation of C.C. 2315.01(a), which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\">\u201cNo person, recklessly or by force, shall resist or interfere with a <em>lawful </em>arrest of himself or another.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The crux of appellant\u2019s argument on appeal is that he was not <em>lawfully </em>arrested and, therefore, he could not be properly convicted of resisting such unlawful arrest. Based upon our review of the record, as detailed below, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">The testimony of Officer Barry Kirby alone establishes the fact that appellant was unlawfully arrested. His recollection of certain events surrounding his arrest of appellant, which events ultimately culminated in the repeated macing of and multiple injuries to appellant, differs in pertinent respects from that of appellant, other defense witnesses, and other police officers. However, for purposes of our review, we need only resolve the issue of whether or not the warrantless arrest of appellant was properly based upon probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">Officer Kirby was en route to a disturbance call at approximately 3:30 p.m. on October 12, 1994. He noticed appellant\u2019s pickup truck slowing traffic on Ohio Avenue, so the officer parked his cruiser right behind the truck. Appellant was sitting in his truck, talking with a woman on a bicycle. Kirby became suspicious when he observed a \u201chand-to-hand transaction\u201d in the form of the woman \u201cexchanging * * * or attempting to exchange [a] tissue\u201d with appellant. Based upon the officer\u2019s \u201ctraining and experience,\u201d he concluded that a drug deal was taking place.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">Officer Kirby got out of his cruiser and approached the suspect woman whom he had observed with the tissue because \u201cgenerally the person with the tissue * * * is the one in control of the narcotics.\u201d When he demanded and inspected the tissue, his search revealed no narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">Officer Kirby\u2019s attention was \u201cquickly withdrawn from the female\u201d when appellant said, \u201cWe\u2019re not selling crack cocaine,\u201d and called the officer a \u201cracist pig.\u201d According to Officer Kirby, appellant had got out of his truck, shouted profanities at the officer, and \u201cinsinuated that [Kirby] was doing something wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-12\">Officer Kirby testified that he then asked appellant if he \u201ccould please see his driver\u2019s license.\u201d He believed that appellant responded, \u201cI don\u2019t have one on me.\u201d Citing \u201cofficer safety reasons and convenience,\u201d the officer explained standard procedure under these circumstances to include escorting the subject to the cruiser, patting the subject down for weapons, and running a \u201cstatus check\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>on the computer to verify whether the subject has a valid driver\u2019s license. When appellant refused the officer\u2019s \u201cinstructions] to have a seat\u201d in the cruiser, the officer placed appellant in a \u201ctransport wristlock.\u201d Appellant \u201cyanked away\u201d and grabbed the officer\u2019s arm. Officer Kirby then sprayed appellant in the face with mace. When asked why he maced appellant, the officer testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\">\u201cBecause at that time <em>he\u2019s under arrest based on the fact </em>that he\u2019s orally communicated to me <em>that he does not have a license on him, which is an offense.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">When asked if the officer had informed appellant that he was under arrest, Officer Kirby claimed that he had, adding that he told appellant to \u201cstop resisting.\u201d A struggle to the ground ensued, and the officer maced appellant a second time. In order to subdue appellant on the ground and render him unable to move, the officer applied pressure to a pressure point on appellant\u2019s mandibular joint. Backup officers, including Keith Kline, arrived soon to assist Kirby. Appellant was ultimately handcuffed and placed in a paddy wagon.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Officer Kirby received immediate medical attention to flush out his eyes from the \u201cbackspray\u201d he received when he twice maced appellant. Appellant, who sustained two direct blasts of mace in his face, received no such immediate medical attention. After the officers completed necessary paperwork in a nearby church parking lot for over one hour, appellant was eventually transported to a local hospital for treatment and finally to jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">On cross-examination, Officer Kirby acknowledged that even after he verified that appellant was indeed a validly licensed driver, he issued him a ticket anyway. On the ticket,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Officer Kline described appellant\u2019s \u201cno ops\u201d offense as follows: \u201cMR. HENRY WAS OPERATING THE ABOVE VEHICLE WITH OUT [sic ] AN OHIO DRIVER[\u2019]S LICENSE ON HIS PERSON OR NEAR AT HAND.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">According to Officer Kirby, appellant was arrested for allegedly violating C.C. 2135.01, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-10\">\u201c(a)(1) No person * * * shall operate any motor vehicle * * * unless such person, upon application, has been licensed as an operator * * * by the Ohio Registrar of Motor Vehicles * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">The requirement to <em>display </em>one\u2019s driver\u2019s license is governed by C.C. 2135.06, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-12\">\u201cThe operator * * * of a motor vehicle shall display his license, <em>or furnish satisfactory proof that he has such license, </em>upon demand of any peace officer * * *. When a demand is properly made <em>and the operator </em>* * * <em>has his license </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number><em>on or about his person, </em>he shall not refuse to display such license. Failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that such person is licensed * * * <em>when such person does not have his license on or about his person </em>shall be prima-facie evidence of his not having obtained such license.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Citing no authority, counsel for the city summarily argues that \u201cit is a violation of [C.C.] 2135.06 * * * [to fail] to display a driver\u2019s license upon the demand of any peace officer.\u201d Neither provision quoted above nor any case law supports such an assertion. Reading the above provisions in their entireties and <em>in pari materia </em>clearly establishes the officer\u2019s (and appellee\u2019s counsel\u2019s) mistake of law; it is <em>not </em>a crime for an Ohio resident to drive in Columbus without having his or her operator\u2019s license on his or her person. See <em>Columbus v. Harris </em>(Nov. 26, 1976), Franklin App. No. 76AP-750, unreported. On the contrary, C.C. 2135.06 explicitly contemplates the common situation in which the driver does <em>not </em>have his or her license in his or her immediate possession and allows the driver the opportunity to provide information by which the officer may verify licensure.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The officer\u2019s mistaken belief that appellant\u2019s conduct was in violation of the law did not create probable cause to arrest appellant. Since appellant was not lawfully arrested, he could not properly be convicted of resisting such an arrest. See <em>State v. Johnson </em>(1982), 6 Ohio App.3d 56, 6 OBR 268, 453 N.E.2d 1101; <em>State v. Miller </em>(1990), 70 Ohio App.3d 727, 591 N.E.2d 1355. Thus, appellant\u2019s conviction was based upon evidence which was insufficient as a matter of law and, further, was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Therefore, the first assignment of error is sustained to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Our resolution of the first assignment of error renders the second assignment of error moot. See App.R. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Having sustained the first assignment of error, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and this cause is remanded with instructions to enter a judgment of acquittal as to the resisting arrest charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b584-10\">Lazarus, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b584-11\">Petree, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b583-13\">. For reasons which are not apparent, Officer Kline, one of the backup officers who assisted Officer Kirby, signed the traffic tickets as the \"issuing-charging law enforcement officer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b584-12\">Petree, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ASb\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-13\">Being unable to agree with the majority opinion, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-14\">The test for determining whether a police officer has probable cause for making a warrantless arrest of a suspect is \u201cwhether at that moment [of the arrest] the facts and circumstances within [the officer\u2019s] knowledge and of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>[he] had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the [suspect] had committed or was committing an offense.\u201d <em>Beck v. Ohio </em>(1964), 379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 223, 225, 13 L.Ed.2d 142, 145. Thus, the issue before this court is whether Officer Kirby had probable cause to arrest appellant, based on the facts and circumstances before him at the moment of the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"ACV\">When Officer Kirby asked appellant for his driver\u2019s license, appellant informed him that he did not have his license with him. The majority states that \u201cit is <em>not </em>a crime for an Ohio resident to drive in Columbus without having his or her operator\u2019s license,\u201d and cites this court\u2019s decision in <em>Columbus v. Harris </em>(Nov. 26, 1976), Franklin App. No. 76AP-750, unreported, for this proposition. I agree with this statement of the law; however, the majority fails to include the next sentence of <em>Harris </em>in its analysis. That sentence states, \u201c[h]owever, failure to furnish satisfactory evidence of being licensed is prima-facie evidence of the operator\u2019s not having obtained such license.\u201d <em>Id. </em>C.C. 2135.06, which governs the display of one\u2019s driver\u2019s license, provides that failure to furnish evidence of a driver\u2019s license upon the demand of a police officer is prima facie evidence of not having obtained such license. Specifically, C.C. 2135.06, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-6\">\u201cFailure to furnish satisfactory evidence that such person is licensed * * * <em>when such person does not have his license on or about his person </em>shall be prima-facie evidence of his not having obtained such license.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">In the instant case, appellant failed to furnish satisfactory evidence that he was a licensed driver. Consequently, this failure provided Officer Kirby a reasonable basis to believe that appellant may have been operating his automobile without a driver\u2019s license, in violation of C.C. 2135.01. The fact that appellant may have at some later time produced a valid driver\u2019s license, or provided satisfactory evidence of licensing, does not vitiate the fact that at the moment of the arrest, appellant\u2019s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence of licensing was sufficient to warrant Officer Kirby in believing that appellant was operating his automobile without a valid driver\u2019s license in violation of C.C. 2135.01. Thus, based on the facts and circumstances before him at the time, Officer Kirby had probable cause to arrest appellant for a violation of C.C. 2135.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">Because Officer Kirby had probable cause to arrest appellant for violating C.C. 2135.01, appellant could be properly convicted of resisting arrest in violation of C.C. 2315.01(a).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
