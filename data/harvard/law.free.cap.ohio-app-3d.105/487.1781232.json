Goodrich Co. and against the appellant Ralph Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">Appellant slipped in oil while at work for appellee as a machine operator on July 26, 1982. He filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation which was allowed for lumbar strain. He later returned to work but subsequently claimed he was unable to continue working and has not returned to work since October 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-12\">On February 16, 1988, appellant filed a motion with the Industrial Commission to have it consider the allowance of the psychiatric condition \u201cmajor depression\u201d as a part of his original workers\u2019 compensation claim. The claim was allowed by the Industrial Commission for aggravation of preexisting dysthymic disorder as a result of his original industrial injury. Appellee B.F. Goodrich Company filed an appeal with the common pleas court which granted a motion of appellee for summary judgment on September 2, 1993, on the basis that appellant had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>complied with the two-year statute of limitations set forth in R.C. 4123.84. Appellant then appealed to this court for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">We reversed the trial court\u2019s first grant of summary judgment, finding that the record did not set forth whether \u201cmajor depression\u201d and \u201cdysthymia\u201d are separate medical conditions and that reasonable minds could come to more than one conclusion based upon the record before us at that time concerning whether appellant\u2019s application was within the two-year statute of limitations set forth in R.C. 4123.84. The dispositive issue at that \u25a0 time appeared to be whether appellant knew or should have known that his back injury caused his additional condition of \u201cmajor depression.\u201d The cause was remanded for further proceedings in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">On remand, appellee took the deposition of Dr. John M. Showalter and again filed its motion for summary judgment based only upon this additional evidence. The trial court again granted summary judgment for appellee and this appeal resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Appellant sets forth the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-9\">\u2022 \u201cThe trial court erred in granting summary judgment where there is no evidence that Mr. Hill knew or should have known that he had developed a residual (flow through) psychiatric condition more than two years before he filed for the condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-10\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 2</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-11\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting summary judgment where there is no evidence that Mr. Hill knew or should have known that he had developed a residual (flow through) psychiatric condition and that it was related to his original injury more than two years before he filed for the condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-12\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 3</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-13\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting summary judgment where fact questions exist as to whether Mr. Hill\u2019s claim for a residual (flow through) psychiatric condition was timely filed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-14\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-15\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the issue of whether Mr. Hill knew or should have known that he had developed a residual (flow through) psychiatric condition more than two years before he filed for the condition when this court had reversed an earlier grant of summary judgment and held that the matter was one on which reasonable minds could differ. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>grant of summary judgment on an issue which had previously been decided by this court violated the law of the case doctrine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 5</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the issue of whether Mr. Hill knew or should have known that he had developed a residual (flow through) psychiatric condition in violation of Ohio Revised Code Section 4123.95 which requires liberal construction of the workers\u2019 compensation law in favor of claimant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">As all of the assignments are interrelated, they will be treated together.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">The issue seems now to be whether the deposition of Dr. Showalter, which is the only evidence added after this court reversed the trial court\u2019s initial granting of summary judgment, is sufficient to fill the gaps that were present during the first appeal, for the law-of-the-case doctrine would bar the trial court from again granting the summary judgment based upon the same evidence without providing new evidence for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">We find that the deposition of Dr. Showalter did add needed information regarding the symptoms of \u201cmajor depression\u201d and \u201cdysthymia\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-10\">\u201cQ. And in 1985, is it fair to say dysthymia and depression were pretty much interchangeable terms?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-11\">\u201cA. Yes, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-12\">\u201cQ. Okay. Now, let me \u2014 when you talk about a condition described as major depression\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-13\">\u201cA. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-14\">\u201cQ. \u2014do major depression and dysthymia have the same symptoms?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-15\">\u201cA. The symptoms are pretty much identical, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-16\">\u201cQ. What is the \u2014 what is the difference between the two?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-17\">\u201cA. The biggest difference is really the severity of the condition, major depression being more severe, more acute than chronic \u2014 than dysthymic disorder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-18\">\u201cDysthymic disorder may develop into major depression. In other words, someone can have kind of a low grade depression for a year or so and then suddenly, for sometimes unexplainable reasons, they get very depressed and it turns into a major depression. But the main difference between the two is severity and chronicity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>In addition, we find that the deposition of Dr. Showalter set the time frame regarding appellant\u2019s knowledge of the condition when he evaluated the appellant in 1984:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">\u201cQ. And when you evaluated Mr. Hill in 1984, and I think I misspoke earlier and said \u201985, but in \u201984, could you tell from your evaluation when he started feeling depressed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">\u201cA. Well, my best conclusion in reviewing the report, it\u2019s likely to have occurred probably onset being sometime after his back surgery. Could have been a little bit of onset when he was first injured, the first injury being in 1972.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">\u201cBut typically the patients I see, especially if they\u2019re injured a second time and have surgery and maybe don\u2019t get real good response to the surgery, they begin to have some self doubts, begin to get discouraged, get back to the level of functioning that existed prior to the injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">\u201cAnd, you know, I don\u2019t have details to substantiate that, but in reviewing Mr. Hill\u2019s record, it would be fairly typical of many patients I had seen in the same category. So probably from the time he went back to work in 1978 up until 1982 when he was injured a third time, I guess, work related injury, he was probably beginning to get depressed and discouraged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">\u201cAnd we know specifically because he stated to me about being depressed since he\u2019s been unemployed, and apparently he last worked in October of \u201983, so probably began to develop and then \u2014 then became more severe when he suddenly couldn\u2019t work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-10\"><em>i( </em>* <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-11\">\u201cQ. What did Mr. Hill tell you or relate to you as to what was the cause of his depression, the cause of his feeling blue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-12\">\u201cA. Well, I know that he mentioned about being depressed because he was unemployed. As I say, that\u2019s in the second paragraph there on the second page. And that would be a typical pattern of people that I have seen in people that are injured and no longer able to work. I did not, in reviewing the report, see anything that necessarily related it to \u2014 to anything that happened in the past. I\u2019m not sure when he was divorced here, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-13\">\u201cQ. Did he indicate to you why he \u2014 his employment was terminated in his view?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-14\">\u201cA. He said he was let go because of ongoing medical problems. That\u2019s the second paragraph on Page 1 there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-15\">\u201cQ. And what was your understanding of what those medical problems were?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>\u201cA. Well, he had several back injuries. He related to me his first injury was in 1972. He reinjured his back in 1975, had back surgery in 1976. He was off for a year and a half. He went back to work and worked up until 1982 when he reinjured his back and these were \u2014 at one point in here, I related a diagnosis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">\u201cIt looks like, bottom of \u2014 in the third paragraph, Page 1, medical reports available. And oftentimes when I get referrals from attorneys or other sources, they\u2019ll send me medical reports. Lumbosacral strain, degenerated L5 disc and headaches unrelated to problem, possibly migraine in origin. So apparently he had a lumbosacral strain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">\u201cQ. So did Mr. Hill relate to you that he was \u2014 was depressed because of his back condition, at least in part?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">\u201cA. It would appear that that certainly had a fair amount to do with it, yeah, his back condition. If he\u2019s in pain \u2014 he did indicate he was in pain, and often pain and depression go hand in hand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">This testimony by Dr. Showalter indicates that appellant was depressed in 1984, more than two years before the filing of his motion for additional compensation in 1988, and that he had reason to know or actually did know that the depression was related to his 1982 injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">The assignments of error are overruled and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b526-11\">Evans and Shaw, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
