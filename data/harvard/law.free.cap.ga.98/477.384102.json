It appears that the plaintiff and her husband borrowed money from a third person, for which they executed their joint and several promissory note, a brother of the husband signing the same as surety. According to the facts as found by the jury, the husband, prior to the giving of this note, had used his wife\u2019s money in the purchase of certain land, taking the title thereto to himself. In order to indemnify his brother by reason of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>the latter\u2019s suretyship upon the above mentioned note, the husband executed to him a deed to the land so purchased, the grantee accepting the deed with knowledge of the fact that the land therein described had been paid for with the wife\u2019s money. The case \u2014 it being a petition by the wife for the cancellation of this latter deed \u2014 was submitted to the jury upon special questions; and although the petition distinctly alleges that the deed from the husband to&gt; his brother was made without plaintiff\u2019s consent, there was no finding by the jury as to this particular matter. The answer, however, joined no issue with her upon this question, the husband averring that he bought and paid for the land with his own money, and the brother alleging that he took the deed in good faith and without any notice or knowledge of the wife\u2019s equity. The case, therefore, stands as if the deed was taken without the wife\u2019s consent, and the naked question presented is: Oan a husband, without his wife\u2019s consent, convey land thus belonging to her to a third person, even for the purpose of securing her own debt, or indemnifying one who stands security for her, when such person has knowledge as to the true ownership of the land? \"We think not. If the legal title had been in the wife, it could not be pretended that any conveyance by the husband \u2014 no matter for what purpose executed\u2014 would pass the title out of her; and certainly, he has no more authority to attempt to dispose of her perfect equity in the land, without her express consent, by a conveyance of the legal title held in his name, to one fully informed as to the wife\u2019s equity. The act of the husband in conveying would be as nugatory in the one instance as in the other, so far as she was concerned. <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
