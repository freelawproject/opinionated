The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>case was submitted, upou tbe law and tbe facts, to tbe presiding judge, who made the <em>mamlamms </em>absolute-; and to this judgment the ordinary excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\"><em>Mandamus </em>will not lie to compel a public officer to do .an act not clearly commanded by law. \u201cIt is only practicable by <em>mandamus </em>to compel performance of specific acts, where the duty to discharge them is clear and well defined, and when no element of discretion is involved in the performance.\u201d Where the officer has a discretion in the matter, the court may by this means compel him to- exercise his discretion, but cannot direct in what manner he shall exercise it. 14 Am &amp; Eng. Enc. of Law, art. <em>Mandamus, </em>104; Merrill on <em>Mandamus, </em>\u00a7106 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The ordinary has, when sitting for county purposes, original and exclusive jurisdiction over establishing bridges in conformity to law (Code, \u00a7337), and there is no law which makes it imperative upon him to carry out the- recommendations of a grand jury or of successive grand juries, with regard to the establishment of new bridges. This is a matter within his discretion, and no recommendation of the grand jury would deprive him of the right to exercise his discretion in the premises, nor authorize a proceeding by <em>mandamus </em>to compel him to have such a bridge built. The \u2022court erred in making the <em>mandamus </em>absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
