Therefore, the older of two such judgments against the same defendant has priority over the younger, as to a fund arising .from a sale of his property, although the execution issued upon the younger may have been duly entered upon the general execution docket, and the execution issued upon the older has never been entered upon that docket at all.</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b499-8\">May 23, 1896.</decisiondate>\n<judges data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"A4j\">By two Justices.</judges>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"p\" id=\"AsN\">Argued at the last term.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-9\"><em>Certiorari. </em>Before Judge Janes.

In that-case, tbis court defined tbe meaning of tbe word \u201clien\u201d as used in the phrase \u201cwho may have ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>quired a transfer or lien binding the same property,\u201d occumng in the first section of the registry act of 1889 (Acts 1889, p. 106), and held that it applied only to' liens acquired by contract, and not to those obtained by judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The second section of that act provides for the keeping of a general execution docket, and declares that, \u201cas against the interests of third parties acting in good faith and without notice, who may have acquired a- transfer or lien binding the defendant\u2019s property, no money judgment obtained within the county of the defendant\u2019s residence, in any court of this State, . . shall have a lien upon the property of the defendant from the rendition thereof, unless the execution issuing thereon shall be entered upon said docket within ten days from the time the judgment is rendered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The obvious purpose of this section is to protect those who may acquire titles or liens in ignorance of the fact that a judgment existed against the other contracting party, of which the person taking such title or lien had not, under the pre-existing laws, reasonable and ample means of becoming informed. The word \u201clien\u201d where first used in that portion of the section above quoted, has the same meaning which was ascribed to this word as used in the first section of the act; that is, it means a \u201clien\u201d acquired by contract. The reasoning of Judge TIart in the case of <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Simmons, supra, </em>is applicable in the latter instance as fully as in the former. It follows that the act in question has no application to contests between ordinary common law judgments, and consequently, the older of two such judgments against the same defendant has priority over the younger, as to a fund arising from a sale of his property, although the execution issued upon the younger may have been duly entered upon the general execution docket, whereas the execution issued upon the older has never been so entered at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
