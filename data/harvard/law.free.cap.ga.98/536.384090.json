A disregard by the sheriff of such order would, of course, put him in contempt of the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-13\">The case now in hand is of an altogether different character. In it, it appears that the plaintiffs, in an action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>brought in a justice\u2019s court, obtained a judgment which, the defendants in that action carried to the superior court by <em>certiorari. </em>While the <em>certiorari </em>was pending, the plaintiffs in the original action sued out a garnishment based upon the judgment they had obtained in the justice\u2019s court, and thereupon the plaintiffs in <em>certiorari </em>obtained from the judge of the superior court a summary attachment for contempt against the justice of the peace who issued the garnishment, and against the parties at whose instance this process was sued out. At the hearing, the judge of the superior court discharged the justice, but ordered the other respondents committed to jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">We can find neither law nor precedent to sustain such a proceeding. It does not appear that any execution was issued upon the judgment rendered in the justice\u2019s court, or that any effort to proceed with that judgment was made. The mere suing out of a garnishment was no violation of the <em>supersedeas </em>resulting from the issuing of the writ of <em>certiorari. </em>Indeed, a garnishment may be sued out upon a pending action in which no judgment at all has been rendered; and in any event, the garnishment bond affords sufficient protection to the opposite party. The proceeding for contempt was totally unauthorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
