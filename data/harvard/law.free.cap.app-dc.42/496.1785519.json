The modern rule is to the effect that where personal property is placed in the hands of a bailee for hire in good condition, and it is injured or destroyed while in his custody under circumstances ordinarily inconsistent witu the exercise of due care, and there is nothing to rebut the inference arising from the circumstances, the loss may fairly be found to have been occasioned by the bailee\u2019s negligence; but this rule in no way relieves the bailor of the burden of establishing his case by a fair preponderance of the evidence.

There was no evidence that the horses were acquainted with each other, or that they theretofore had been permitted to go to the trough together and unaccompanied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-7\">The court charged the jury to the effect that it was the duty of the defendant, in the management and control of plaintiff\u2019s horse while in his possession, to exercise \u201cthat degree of care which an ordinarily prudent man, engaged in the same business as the defendant, would exercise under like circumstances,\u201d and that if the hoi\u2019se when delivered to him was in sound condition and when returned to the plaintiff was in an injured or damaged condition, \u201cthen the burden of proof was upon the defendant to prove by the preponderance of the evidence that said injury or damage resulted from no want of due and proper care on his part.\u201d To this charge an exception was noted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number><em>Mr. Joseph W.

If the chattel is shown to have been delivered to the bailee in good condition, and to have been returned to the bailor in an injured condition, or not to have been returned- at all, the law places upon the bailee the burden of showing that the loss was not due to his fault, or at least that he exercised ordinary care (if it be a bailment for the mutual benefit of both bailor and bailee). This is particularly the rule where the loss would not ordinarily have happened without negligence. The burden of. exculpation is placed upon the bailee in these cases because he, if anyone, can explain how the loss occurred; it is only reasonable that he should show that he exercised due care. <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>46 N.

In other words, the facts of the occurrence, unexplained, warrant the inference of negligence, and call for explanation from the bailee, because he alone is in a position to make it. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>70 N. J. L. 594, 57 Atl. 126, 15 Am. Neg. Rep. 611; <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>46 N. Y. 490, 1 Am. Neg. Cas. 696; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>A. O. Taylor &amp; Son, </em>92 Neb. 769, 139 N.

But this rule in no way changes the burden of proof, for, when all the evidence is in, the preponderance must be with the plaintiff. <em>Sweeney </em>v. <em>Erving, </em>228 U. S. 233, 57 L. ed. 815, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 416; <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Capital Traction Co. </em>34 App. D. C. 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Here, however, the plaintiff did not rest his case upon the fact that property placed in the defendant\u2019s custody in good condition was injured in such a way as to be inconsistent with due care on the part of the defendant, but introduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>evidence tending to show negligence. This evidence was not controverted by the defendant, and therefore the sole question for the jury was whether, under the undisputed facts, the defendant had exercised due care. In the circumstances, we do not think there is reversible error in the charge. We therefore affirm the judgment, with costs. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
