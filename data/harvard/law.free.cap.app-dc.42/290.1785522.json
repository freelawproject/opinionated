A plaintiff\u2019s affidavit must be direct and unequivocal to warrant tbe en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>forcement of the 73d rule, which has the effect of depriving the defendant of a trial on the merits (citing <em>8t. Claw </em>v. <em>Conion, </em>12 App. D. C. 163) ; but an affidavit of defense filed thereunder is sufficient to prevent the entry of summary judgment, if, taken as a whole, it convinces the court that it was made in good faith, and presents substantial reasons why the rule should not be enforced.

The question as to what constitutes a reasonable time during which an account rendered may be retained without objection before it becomes an account stated is one of law in the Eederal courts where the facts are clear.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b319-9\">4.

A debtor\u2019s contention that his creditor\u2019s bill is too high raises merely a question of measure of liability, which is not a defense after the bill has become an account stated.</syllabus>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b319-13\">No. 2648.</docketnumber>\n<otherdate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"AqI\">Submitted April 8, 1914.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ady\">Decided May 4, 1914.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-14\">Hearing on an appeal by the defendant from a judgment for plaintiffs in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, under the 73d rule, for want of sufficient affidavit of defense.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b319-15\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-16\">The Court in the opinion stated the facts as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-17\">Appeal from a judgment for the plaintiff's, William F. Mat-tingly and Walter C. Clephane, appellees here, in the supreme court of the District under the 73d rule, the declaration containing the general counts and, as a part thereof, a count upon an account stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-18\">The account filed with the declaration, under the head of particulars of demand, contained a charge of $1,400 for personal services rendered the defendant, William W- Filey, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>the plaintiffs at his request in filing and prosecuting to a final decree a certain equity cause in the supreme court of the District. The defendant was credited with $200, which the account states was the retaining fee paid by him, leaving the balance due of $1,200. In their affidavit plaintiffs, among other things, state that there was no agreement as to the amount of their compensation; that the fee charged is reasonably low and just and fair to the defendant; that the defendant paid a retaining fee of $100 to the plaintiff Mattingly and a like fee to the plaintiff Clephane; that on the 1st day of March, 1913, \u25a0or approximately eight months before the suit was instituted in November, 1913, they mailed to the defendant \u201ca bill for said services in the amount of said balance of twelve hundred ($1,200) dollars, the receipt of which he acknowledged, and did not dispute the amount, and promised to attend to same,\u201d which he did not do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-5\">In his affidavit of defense the defendant admits that he employed the plaintiff Mattingly, but \"that he never employed the plaintiff Walter C.

A sufficient ground of defense was set up by the allegation that the defendant never employed the plaintiff Clephane as \u25a0his attorney. A joint action having been brought, neither of the plaintiffs was entitled to recover unless a joint right was established. Misjoinder of.parties plaintiff is always fatal to the action, and may be shown under the general- issue. <em>Snell </em>v. <em>Deland, </em>43 Ill. 322, 326; <em>Ulmer </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>2 Me. 117, 118; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Raynor, </em>102 Mich. 473, 475; <em>Gerry </em>v. <em>Gerry, </em>77 Mass. 381; <em>Rhoads </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>14 Iowa, 575, 577.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-8\">2.

The affidavit of defense, however, is sufficient to prevent the entry of summary judgment if, taken as a whole, it convinces the court that it was made in good faith and presents substantial reasons why the rule ought not to be enforced. <em>Codington </em>v. <em>Standard Bank, </em>40 App. D.

And in the Federal courts, when the facts are clear, it is a question of law as to what is to be regarded as a reasonable time. <em>Wiggins </em>v. <em>Burkham, </em>10 Wall. 129, 19 L. ed. 885; <em>Standard Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Van Etten, </em>107 U. S. 325, 27 L. ed. 319, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 178. Plaintiff's\u2019 affidavit of merit in the present case contains a statement that the account forming the basis of the action was held by the defendant for a period of eight months without being disputed in any way. This statement is not met or attempted to be met in the affidavit of defense. It is apparent, therefore, that the account rendered became an account stated. Since the affidavit of defense does not raise any question as to fraud, accident, or mistake, but merely questions the measure of liability, it is clear that no defense to the action has been stated. In other words, defendant merely says that plaintiffs\u2019 bill is too high. This averment raises no question of either accident or mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. <em>Affirmed,.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
