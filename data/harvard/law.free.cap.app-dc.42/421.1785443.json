A landlord\u2019s re-entry for nonpayment of rent, and reletting of the premises, do not discharge the tenant from his obligation to pay rent, when accompanied by notice to the tenant that such act shall not be understood as avoiding the lease or discharging the obligation to pay rent.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b449-9\">2. The measure of damages for a tenant\u2019s breach of lease for nonpayment of rent may be rendered under the 73d rule, where the defendant though less than that stipulated in such lease, is fair and reasonable, is the difference between the r\u2014it called for by the two leases.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b449-11\">3. Judgment in assumpsit for breach of lease by a tenant for nonpayment of rent may be rendered under the 73d rule, where the defendant filed no affidavit of defense, and the plaintiff has rendered the damages certain by reletting the premises.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b449-13\">4. Assumpsit is the proper form of action by a landlord to recover damages for a tenant\u2019s breach of lease for nonpayment of rent, where, the landlord having relet the premises, the tenant did not object to the rate of the rental reserved on the reletting; and it is not necessary to sue in covenant though the lease is under seal.</syllabus>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b449-15\">No. 2727.</docketnumber>\n<otherdate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"Aae\">Submitted October 7, 1914.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AzC\">Decided November 2, 1914.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-16\">ITraring- on an appeal (specially allowed) by the plaintiffs from an order of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia denying a motion for judgment under the 73d rule in an action to recover for the breach of a lease.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"Aze\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>The Court in the opinion stated the facts as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-5\">This is an action in assumpsit to recover for the breach of a lease, and John O.

Jordan, defendant, for the term of eight years, beginning January 1st, 1910, and ending December 31st, 1917, for the sum of $40,000, payable in monthly instalments of $416.67.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-7\">The lease contains this covenant among others:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-8\">\u201cThat these presents are executed upon each and all of the following conditions, that if there shall be any default for the period of ten days in the payment of said rent, or any instalment thereof, as herein reserved, or if there shall be any breach by the party of the second part, his administrators, executors, or as: signs, of any of the covenants herein contained, then in such . case, in addition to other remedies therefor provided by law, it shall and may be lawful for the said party of the first part, her heirs and assigns, forthwith to declare this lease terminated and ended, and thereupon to re-enter upon said premises and repossess the same as of her or their former estate therein, or without any formal demand or entry to recover possession of the same in like manner as if said term had expired.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-9\">The affidavit further recites that the lessee failed to pay the monthly instalment of rent due on March 1st, 1914, and has refused to pay the same or any other instalment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-10\">On April 4, 1914, plaintiff re-entered the premises, notifying the defendant that the lease contract had been broken because of said default, and that plaintiff would hold him liable for all unpaid rent, as well as for all resulting loss or damage. That on March 1, 1914, there remained unpaid $19,166.82, representing forty-six instalments of $416.67 each. Defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>sublet the premises for $405 per month, and plaintiff could let the same for no greater sum, whereupon plaintiff let the premises to said subtenant for the unexpired part of the four years. That the damage sustained by plaintiff was the difference between the two rentals, which during that period amounted to $1,036.82, with interest, which sum he claims as damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-5\">Defendant pleaded <em>nil debet </em>and <em>non assumpsit, </em>but filed no countervailing affidavit.

A landlord who terminates a tenancy under a written lease, between stated periods when the rent is regularly payable, cannot maintain an action for rent under the lease, or an action of assumpsit for use and occupation of the premises after the last rent day prior to the termination of the tenancy. <em>Joliet First Nat.

The entry and reletting are sufficient to show an acceptance of the surrender of the lease, where, taking into consideration all the circumstances, the act is of a character-to show that the landlord has resumed possession to the exclusion of the tenant, with the intention of releasing him from his liability. <em>Biggs </em>v. <em>Stueler, </em>93 Md. 100, 111, 48 Atl. 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">In a later case it was said: \u201cThere are some authorities to the effect that a re-entry and reletting of abandoned premises by the landlord without the consent of the tenant would create a surrender, by operation of law. * * * The best approved cases, however, assert the contrary doctrine, and hold that where a tenant repudiated the lease, and abandons the demised premises, and the lessor enters and relets the property, that such a re-renting does not relieve the tenant from the payment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>tbe rent under the covenants of the lease.\u201d <em>Oldewurtel </em>v. <em>Wiesenfeld, </em>97 Md. 165, 176, 54 Atl. 969.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">See also <em>Hunnewell </em>v. <em>Bangs, </em>161 Mass. 132, 36 N.

In the last-cited case the court said: \u201cA landlord upon a wrongful abandonment by his tenant may, if he choose, decline to meddle with the property at all, and at the end of the term sue for the rent. He is not, however, driven to this course, run the risk of damage to his property or the insolvency of his tenant. In this case the plaintiff [landlord] pursued the right course in letting the property - to Eilippini [subtenant] -x- -x- * ari\u00bf Ixis [landlord\u2019s] measure of damage is the difference between the rent he was to receive and the rent actually received from the subsequent tenant, provided there has been good faith in the subsequent letting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">See also <em>Underhill </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>132 N. Y. 269, 30 N. E. 576; <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Willis, </em>51 Neb. 162, 70 N. W. 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">The affidavit recites that possession was taken by the plaintiff, with notice that the possession should not be understood as avoiding the lease, and that he would look to the defendant for the payment of his rent. It was a reservation of his other remedies as stipulated in the lease. Taking possession of the house and releasing it were all acts in the interest of and for the benefit of the tenant, and ought not to have the effect to discharge him of the obligation to pay his rent. It was more to his interest than the lessor\u2019s for the latter to release the premises. Had he leased it for the same amount the tenant would have been entirely relieved; if less, he is liable for the difference. It was certainly much better for the tenant that the lessor should rent the premises and get something for them than to lock the door and wait to sue for the whole amount of the rent at the expira<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>ti\u00f3n of the lease. It was for the benefit of both parties, and any possible presumption that the landlord has accepted the surrender and released the tenant is rebutted by tbe notice given by the landlord. Tbe tenant should be estopped to set up bis own wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">It is contended by tbe defendant tbat this action is upon tbe lease which is under seal, and must therefore be in covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The amount of tbe damage is rendered certain by tbe action of tbe landlord in releasing tbe property. In releasing, be bas accepted tbe new tenant and credited tbe amount of bis obligation upon tbe lessee\u2019s contract. Tbe defendant bas not objected to tbe amount for which tbe property was released to bis subtenant, and it is to be presumed tbat tbe amount is fair and tbe best that the landlord could obtain. Consequently tbe measure of damage is tbe difference between what tbe defendant undertook to pay and what tbe landlord was able to obtain from tbe new tenant. Tbe amount of tbe demand, being tbe difference between tbe original and tbe new lease, is rendered certain, and the 73d rule governs tbe proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Tbe action is properly in assumpsit for tbe use and occupation of the premises. Tbe judgment is reversed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
