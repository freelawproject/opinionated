Coates, appellant, against the District of Columbia, claimed damages upon the following allegations: That plaintiff is a farmer living in Prince George\u2019s county, in the state of Maryland, possesses a herd of cows and maintains a dairy. That under a license from the health officer of the District of Columbia he has carried on a large and profitable business in supplying milk to customers in said District. That he has complied with all regulations of the health department, whereunder his dairy and farm have been constantly inspected by the said department. That under said rules and regulations the plaintiff, \u201cby reason of conditions existing during the period first hereinbefore mentioned, was compelled to submit to the disinfecting of the stable or barn on his said farm to be occupied by his herd of cows.\u201d That in the prosecution of the work of disinfection, carried on between. December 11, 1911, and January 6, 1912, by the employees and agents of the said department, the same was improperly and negligently done. That with gross carelessness and negligence, and despite the protest of plaintiff, the floors, walls, and ceilings of his said barn were sprinkled and saturated with bichloride of mercury, in consequence of which the plaintiff\u2019s whole herd of seventy-five healthy milk-producing cows were ruined through mercurial poisoning.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-8\">That he had to expend $250 to eradicate the poison of mercury with which his said barn had been so negligently saturated, and has sustained other damages, in all amounting to $12,033.22, for which he brings his suit. Defendant demurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>to this declaration on the ground that the employees of the health department of the District were engaged in the performance of a governmental function for which the defendant is not liable. The demurrer was sustained. Plaintiff elected not to amend his declaration and his action was dismissed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b224-4\"><em>Mr. F. P. B.

C. 273.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b225-5\">Mr. Chief Justice Shepard</author>\n<p id=\"AiC\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The learned trial justice committed no error in sustaining the demurrer. He was guided by the rule which has been pronounced in previous decisions of this court. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>29 App. D. C. 273, 282, 25 L.R.A. (N.S.) 98; <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Tyrrell, </em>41 App. D. C. 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">In those cases\u2014the first relating to defective conditions in a fire-engine house, and the second to the escape of gas in a public-school building\u2014the distinction was noted between the two kinds of powers and duties with which municipal corporations are charged; the one merely municipal for special local purposes and benefits; the other of a public or governmental character for the general public welfare. Tor negligence in the performance of the former there is liability; for negligence of agents in the performance of the latter there is no liability. The subject is discussed at length and many supporting authorities cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">There is no occasion for further discussion of the general question.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Por a stronger reason, if anything, the duties imposed upon the health department of the District are to be considered public and governmental in their nature; and by the great weight of authority municipal corporations are not liable in damages for the negligent acts of the employees of such a department in the performance of their duties. 4 Dill. Mun. Corp. 5th ed. \u00a7 1642; <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>St. Paul, </em>33 Minn. 289, 53 Am. Rep. 31, 23 N. W. 220; <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Rockland, </em>52 Mo. 118, 121; <em>Lynde </em>v. <em>Rockland, </em>66 Me. 309, 315; <em>Ogg </em>v. <em>Lansing, </em>35 Iowa, 495, 498, 14 Am. Rep. 499; <em>Louisa County </em>v. <em>Yancey, </em>109 Va. 229, 236, 63 S. E. 452; <em>Ulrich </em>v. <em>St. Louis, </em>112 Mo. 138, 143, 34 Am. St. Rep. 372, 20 S. W. 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>, There is, perhaps, another ground upon which the demurrer might be, sustained without regard to the foregoing; but, as it has not been presented or argued, we will merely suggest the point without deciding it. The dairy where the acts complained \u2022 of were committed is in the State of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Officers of the District of Columbia are without power beyond its boundaries; and, if they undertake to exercise it, the District could not be held liable for their acts. We are advised of no act of Congress that attempts even to authorize their exercise of the power of disinfection of a dairy beyond the boundary; even .if .such power could be conferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs. Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">For denial of writ of error, see post, p. 307.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
