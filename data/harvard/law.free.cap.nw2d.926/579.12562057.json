(concurring).\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   I concur in the order denying leave to appeal and write separately to highlight two errors I believe the Court of Appeals made in its published opinion and to reiterate my hope that the United States Supreme Court will clarify the proper application of harmless-error analysis in this context. Given the current law, I cannot say that the Court of Appeals erred in its conclusion that the error here was harmless. I reluctantly agree with the order denying leave to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I think the Court of Appeals' analysis of the first factor that\n   <em>\n    Coleman v. Alabama\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167869\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/1/\">\n    399 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167869\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/1/\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167869\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/1/\">\n    26 L.Ed.2d 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1970), identifies as important to the role for counsel at a preliminary examination is flawed. The first\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   factor is \"the lawyer's skilled examination and cross-examination of witnesses may expose fatal weaknesses in the State's case that may lead the magistrate to refuse to bind the accused over.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167869\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/1/\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The panel reasoned that \"[g]iven that defendant was convicted at trial on the basis of sufficient evidence, the possibility that counsel could have detected preclusive flaws in the prosecution's probable-cause showing is moot.\"\n   <em>\n    People v. Lewis (On Remand)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12555564\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/910/404/#p31\">\n    322 Mich. App. 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12555564\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/910/404/#p31\">\n    910 N.W.2d 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). But in our prior opinion, we explained that\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   does not permit a court to presume that if a defendant is ultimately convicted after a fair trial, he suffered no harm from the deprivation of counsel at the preliminary examination.\n   <em>\n    People v. Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=501%20Mich.%201\">\n    501 Mich. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 11,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=903%20N.W.2d%20816\">\n    903 N.W.2d 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). While the Court of Appeals cited that passage in its analysis, it nonetheless stated that the fact of the conviction \"is relevant to our consideration of the first\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   factor.\"\n   <em>\n    Lewis (On Remand)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12555564\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/910/404/#p31\">\n    322 Mich. App. at 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12555564\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/910/404/#p31\">\n    910 N.W.2d 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Whatever the correctness of that statement (and I express no opinion on it), the panel then said that the defendant's conviction made this factor\n   <em>\n    moot\n   </em>\n   . That is, the Court of Appeals seemingly made the fact of the conviction at trial dispositive to its analysis of the first factor, which this Court said is not permissible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The panel's analysis of the second\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   factor is also flawed. That factor is \"the skilled interrogation of witnesses by an experienced lawyer can fashion a vital impeachment tool for use in cross-examination of the State's witnesses at the trial, or preserve testimony favorable to the accused of a witness who does not appear at the trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167869\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/1/\">\n    399 U.S. at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167869\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/1/\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court of Appeals relied heavily on the fact that trial counsel was given a transcript of the preliminary examination in concluding that this factor weighed in favor of finding the error harmless. But this misses the point: a transcript of a preliminary examination conducted without the benefit of defense counsel doesn't address the problem that the prosecution's witnesses were not cross-examined at that hearing. And like the panel's analysis of the first factor, this reasoning would result in finding error harmless in every case conducted in absence of defense counsel: preparing a transcript isn't the problem; it's that the transcript is unhelpful. Thus, counsel's possession of the preliminary examination transcript is entitled to little weight in the analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Despite these flaws, I believe the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that any error in depriving the defendant of counsel at the preliminary examination was harmless. The panel correctly analyzed the remaining\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   factors and specific circumstances of this case. But I reach this conclusion largely because\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   takes \"the two perhaps most intuitive options for assessing harm off the table,\"\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=501%20Mich.%201\">\n    501 Mich. at 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=903%20N.W.2d%20816\">\n    903 N.W.2d 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , leaving reviewing courts without much guidance about how to apply harmless-error review in this context. Guidance from the United States Supreme Court would be welcome. I hope that Court will either provide such guidance or clarify \"whether the\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   harmless-error review remains a sustainable rule when a defendant is denied counsel\n   at a preliminary examination.\"\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=501%20Mich.%201\">\n    501 Mich. at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=903%20N.W.2d%20816\">\n    903 N.W.2d 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ( MCCORMACK , J., concurring).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Bernstein and Clement, JJ., join the statement of McCormack, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    The Court of Appeals cited\n    <em>\n     Coleman\n    </em>\n    in support of its analysis of this factor, but its citation was to Justice White's concurring opinion, which of course is nonbinding.\n    <em>\n     Lewis (On Remand)\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12555564\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/910/404/#p31\">\n     322 Mich.
