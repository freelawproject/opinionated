On appeal, Curtiss argues the district court erred in granting summary disposition because there was newly discovered evidence, he received ineffective assistance of counsel in prior post-conviction relief proceedings, and there were conflicts of interest with his attorneys throughout his criminal and post-conviction relief proceedings. He also argues the court erred by denying his motions for reconsideration and to correct an illegal sentence. We summarily affirm under N.D.R.App.P. 35.1(a)(4), (6), and (7).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carlson v.
