Appellant argues that this rationale extends to interpreter services for client communications outside of court when the public defender lacks the funds to pay for those services. Appellant's argument is unpersuasive for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   was decided in 1993. In 1999, the legislature added the language in section 611.33, subdivision 3, expressly imposing the burden of paying for interpreter services for out-of-court activities on the agency requesting the assistance of an interpreter. 1999 Minn. Laws ch. 216, art. 7, \u00a7 41, at 1366-67. When\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   was decided, that subdivision provided that fees and expenses of a qualified interpreter were to be paid out of the county's general revenue fund, without regard to the agency or entity involved.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20611.33\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 611.33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 3 (1992). But the statute now expressly requires the public defender to pay for out-of-court interpreter services, and\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   provides no support for appellant's contention that section 611.21 provides a \"safety valve\" for interpreter services when the public defender has depleted its budget.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   is also distinguishable because Wilson sought investigative and expert services, and appellant is seeking interpreter services. Section 611.21 is titled \"services other than counsel.\" Although headings are not part of the statute, they are relevant to legislative intent \"where they were present in the bill during the legislative process.\"\n   <em>\n    Minn. Express, Inc. v. Travelers Ins.

Section 611.21 was enacted in 1965 and the heading \"services other than counsel\" was present at that time. 1965 Minn. Laws ch. 869, \u00a7 8, at 1634. Section 611.21 expressly permits counsel for an indigent defendant to apply for \"investigative, expert, or other services necessary to an adequate defense in the case.\" Investigative and expert services are \"services other than counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Application of Olson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9405012\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/648/226/#p227\">\n    648 N.W.2d 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 227 (Minn. 2002). By its plain language, section 611.21 concerns services that counsel would not ordinarily provide. Counsel do not generally provide investigative or expert services,\n   because to do so could make counsel a witness in the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Fratzke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10671774\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/325/10/#p11\">\n    325 N.W.2d 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 11-12 (Minn. 1982) (discussing the advocate-witness rule in the Code of Professional Responsibility). But consulting and communicating with clients is at the heart of the attorney-client relationship; therefore, it is the responsibility of the public defender to pay for interpreter services integral to client communication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The chief judge's conclusion that section 611.33, subdivision 3, requires the public defender to pay for interpreter services to facilitate client communication is also consistent with other statutory provisions that require the public defender to bear the expense of client representation. For example, transcripts are necessary for effective appellate review.\n   <em>\n    Griffin v.

Nor is the assertion that judges in other districts have granted similar requests persuasive. Under the plain language of sections 611.21 and 611.33, subdivision 3, we discern no basis for holding that section 611.21 provides a \"safety valve\" to fund interpreter services when the public defender has depleted its budget. The legislature expressly imposed the burden of paying for out-of-court interpreter services on the party requesting the service. Because section 611.21 does not apply to interpreter services, the chief judge did not abuse his discretion by denying appellant's application for those services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    DECISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Interpreter services intended to facilitate out-of-court communication between the public defender and a client who is impaired in communication are not \"services other than counsel\" that may be authorized under section 611.21. The chief judge did not err by denying section 611.21 funds for services not covered by that statute.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    The application was made to the chief judge because the request was over $ 1,000.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20611.21\">\n     Minn.
