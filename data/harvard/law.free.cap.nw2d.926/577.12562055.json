The application for leave to appeal the November 14, 2017 judgment of the Court of Appeals is considered, and it is DENIED, because we are not persuaded that the questions presented should be reviewed by this Court.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurrence\">\n  <author id=\"p-7\">\n   Viviano, J. (concurring).\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   I concur with the denial order because I believe the Court of Appeals reached the right result by upholding the trial court's grant of summary disposition in favor of defendants under\n   <em>\n    Scarsella v.

Under my reading of the pertinent statutes, although dismissal may still be warranted under a different rule, it would not be warranted under MCR 2.116(C)(7) for failure to comply with the statute of limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   But since no party has asked us to reconsider\n   <em>\n    Scarsella\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   I concur with the Court's denial order in this case.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-11\">\n    Whether dismissal would still be warranted for failing to file an affidavit of merit if\n    <em>\n     Scarsella\n    </em>\n    were overturned and, if so, on what grounds, are interesting questions that would need to be addressed in an appropriate future case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-12\">\n    In arguing that the Court of Appeals should have applied equitable tolling, plaintiff points to\n    <em>\n     Ward v.

These cases only call into question how\n    <em>\n     Scarsella\n    </em>\n    should be applied. Thus, plaintiff raises no argument as to whether\n    <em>\n     Scarsella\n    </em>\n    's interpretation of the pertinent statutes is correct.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
