To answer that question, we must determine whether the language of MCL 769.1k(1)(b)(\n   <em>\n    iii\n   </em>\n   ), which gives trial courts the authority to assess costs without \"separately calculating those costs involved in the particular case,\" applies to the attorney-fee provision in Subparagraph (\n   <em>\n    iv\n   </em>\n   ), which authorizes the imposition of expenses for legal assistance to a defendant. We conclude that it does not. Accordingly, we reverse Part V of the Court of Appeals' opinion and remand to\n   the trial court for that court to support its findings related to the cost of providing legal assistance to defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In December 2015, defendant was convicted of one count of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, MCL 750.520b, and five counts of second-degree criminal sexual conduct, MCL 750.520c, for sexually assaulting his live-in girlfriend's daughters. The trial court sentenced defendant as a fourth-offense habitual offender, MCL 769.12, to 25 to 50 years' imprisonment for the first-degree criminal sexual conduct conviction and to 200 to 360 months' imprisonment for the second-degree criminal sexual conduct convictions. The trial court also assessed $4,500 in costs and fees, representing $3,625 for attorney fees and $875 as a separate judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant appealed, challenging his convictions on several grounds, but pertinent to this appeal, he challenged the amount of attorney fees assessed against him. The Court of Appeals affirmed his convictions and sentences in an unpublished per curiam opinion, holding that the \"trial court's award of $4,500 in defense\n   costs, without making findings of fact as to the award of attorney fees, was proper.\"\n   <em>\n    People v. Lewis\n   </em>\n   , unpublished per curiam opinion of the Court of Appeals, issued May 18, 2017 (Docket No. 331513), p 6,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202200253\">\n    2017 WL 2200253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court of Appeals reasoned that the language of MCL 769.1k(1)(b)(\n   <em>\n    iii\n   </em>\n   ) and (\n   <em>\n    iv\n   </em>\n   ) was clear such that a separate calculation of costs was not required-including the expense of providing defendant with legal assistance.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II.

That panel held that the trial court was required to establish the cost of legal representation for the specific defendant when assessing attorney fees pursuant to MCL 769.1k(1)(b)(\n   <em>\n    iv\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 2.

Thus, the trial court must establish the cost of providing legal services to the specific defendant at issue when assessing attorney fees under MCL 769.1k(1)(b)(\n   <em>\n    iv\n   </em>\n   ). [\n   <em>\n    Duke\n   </em>\n   , unpub op at 2.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We agree that the inclusion of the language \"without separately calculating those costs involved in the particular case\" under Subparagraph (\n   <em>\n    iii\n   </em>\n   ) evidences the Legislature's intent that the provision apply only to that subparagraph. Inclusion of average-costs language in Subparagraph (\n   <em>\n    iii\n   </em>\n   )-rather than the Subdivision (b) umbrella-further suggests that the Legislature intended to create an exception to the default rule of Subdivision (b); if the exception permits costs\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   separate calculation, then logically the default rule must require that costs be separately calculated for the particular case. Moreover, MCL 769.1k(1)(b)(\n   <em>\n    iii\n   </em>\n   ) does not include attorney fees in its list of the kinds of costs that do not have to be separately calculated for the particular defendant, namely: \"[s]alaries and benefits for relevant court personnel,\" \"[g]oods and services necessary for the operation of the court,\" and \"[n]ecessary expenses for the operation and maintenance of court buildings and facilities.\" Although this list is nonexclusive, the costs of providing legal assistance to a defendant are logically distinguishable from the costs enumerated in Subparagraph (\n   <em>\n    iii\n   </em>\n   ), in part because to\n   include legal-assistance costs among Subparagraph (\n   <em>\n    iii\n   </em>\n   ) costs would be to render Subparagraph (\n   <em>\n    iv\n   </em>\n   ) surplusage. See\n   <em>\n    People v. McGraw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4092063\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/484/120/#p126\">\n    484 Mich. 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 126,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=771%20N.W.2d%20655\">\n    771 N.W.2d 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) (\"In interpreting a statute, we avoid a construction that would render part of the statute surplusage or nugatory.\"). Moreover, the costs laid out under Subparagraph (\n   <em>\n    iii\n   </em>\n   ) are all fairly standard expenses for a court's operations, tend not to vary significantly by case, and are not affected by any particular case. In contrast, attorney fees can vary greatly among defendants depending on a variety\n   of circumstances, such as the nature and number of the criminal charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   IV. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court was required to determine the cost of providing legal assistance to defendant pursuant to MCL 769.1k(1)(b)(\n   <em>\n    iv\n   </em>\n   ). The Court of Appeals erred by holding otherwise. For this reason, we reverse Part V of the Court of Appeals' opinion and remand to the trial court for that court to support its findings regarding the cost of legal assistance provided to defendant.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
