However,\n   <em>\n    Mich.

And an institution must satisfy both standards in order to be entitled to a charitable tax exemption. Yet\n   <em>\n    Mich. Baptist\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Retirement Homes\n   </em>\n   seemingly preclude nearly any restrictive standard as to who can receive an institution's services while\n   <em>\n    Baruch\n   </em>\n   allows such restrictions so long as they are \"reasonable.\" If a charity that satisfies\n   <em>\n    Baruch\n   </em>\n   is nonetheless to be precluded from an exemption by\n   <em>\n    Mich.

The former stands for the proposition that \"reasonable\" standards can be applied in determining which members of the community a charitable institution purports to serve will actually be provided services, while the latter seemingly stands for the proposition that the process of applying such standards is, by itself, disqualifying as a \"charitable institution.\" \"[I]t is [this Court's] obligation to overrule\n   or modify case law if it becomes obsolete, and until this Court takes such action, the Court of Appeals and all lower courts are bound by\"-and, in my judgment, will be confused by-\"that authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Associated Builders &amp; Contractors v.
