ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   To establish the elements of first-degree child abuse, the prosecution had to prove-in relevant part-that defendant \"knowingly or intentionally cause[d] serious physical ... harm\" to KM. MCL 750.136b(2). Serious physical harm means \"any physical injury to a child that seriously impairs the child's health or physical well-being, including, but not limited to, brain damage, a skull or bone fracture, subdural hemorrhage or hematoma, dislocation, sprain, internal injury, poisoning, burn or scald, or severe cut.\" MCL 750.136b(1)(f). Because the Legislature provided that the perpetrator must \"knowingly or intentionally\" cause the serious physical harm, it is not sufficient for the prosecution to prove that a defendant intended to commit the act that caused the physical harm; the prosecution must prove that the \"defendant intended to cause serious physical harm or knew that serious physical harm would be\n   caused by [his or] her act.\"\n   <em>\n    People v. Maynor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1414153\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/470/289/#p291\">\n    470 Mich. 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 291,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=683%20N.W.2d%20565\">\n    683 N.W.2d 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In this case, the prosecution presented evidence that tended to suggest that defendant injured KM at some point on December 6, 2013, or early in the day on December 7, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   KM's half-sister, KD, who was five years old on the day at issue, testified that she wanted defendant to play with her, but he wanted to play video games. After she began to cry, defendant became angry\n   with her, punished her, and eventually spanked her. She said she went to her room but peeked into the living room when she heard KM crying. She saw defendant shaking KM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant suggests that KD's testimony was improbable because her timing was off and she failed to earlier disclose the shaking incident. When reviewing challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence, this Court must not interfere with the fact-finder's role in deciding the weight and credibility to give to a witness's testimony-\"no matter how inconsistent or vague that testimony might be.\"\n   <em>\n    People v.

Rather, this Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and uphold the verdict if a reasonable finder of fact could have found that the elements were proved beyond a reasonable doubt. See\n   <em>\n    People v. Wolfe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2016033\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/440/508/#p514\">\n    440 Mich. 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 514-515,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=489%20N.W.2d%20748\">\n    489 N.W.2d 748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992), amended\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2014052,2014065,2014066,2014044,2014077\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/441/1201/\">\n    441 Mich 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). Therefore, we cannot disregard KD's testimony; instead, we must make every reasonable inference from her testimony in favor of the verdict. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2014052,2014065,2014066,2014044,2014077\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/441/1201/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   KD's testimony about the timing was not entirely clear. She did at first imply that the shaking incident occurred sometime immediately before defendant took\n   her to his mother's house, which would have been early on Saturday, December 7, 2013. The children's mother, Dakota Chitwood, testified that KM was already showing signs of fussiness and pain by that time, and Chitwood was home and would likely have been in a position to witness the discipline had it occurred Saturday morning. However, KD later testified that the discipline occurred after she got home from school and before her mother got home from work. From KD's testimony a reasonable finder of fact could infer that the shaking incident occurred on Friday.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The prosecution also presented expert testimony that KM had several injuries. Sarah Brown, D.O., a child abuse pediatrician, testified that KM had blood in the \"space between her brain and her skull\"-the \"subdural space.\" The bleeding was \"all over both sides of her brain.\" She also had a suspected tibia fracture, and Brown stated that an ophthalmologist observed bleeding in the back of KM's eye, which was referred to as retinal hemorrhages. Brown stated that KM's injuries could have been caused by someone violently shaking KM or by throwing her onto a couch or other soft surface. Brown acknowledged that KM had had a prenatal stroke, which caused the left hemisphere of KM's brain to shrink substantially. But she opined that KM's subdural hematomas and retinal hemorrhages were not attributable to her stroke. There was also testimony that the latter injuries arose during the time frame set forth in KD's testimony. Thus, when Brown's testimony is considered with KD's testimony that she saw defendant shake KM, a jury could reasonably, infer that defendant violently shook KM and that his acts caused her to suffer the identified injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Further, it does not matter that the finder of fact must make multiple inferences to establish these elements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   When considering the sufficiency of the evidence, this Court must consider the inferences that can be fairly drawn from the evidence, and \"it does not matter that the evidence gives rise to multiple inferences or that an inference gives rise to further inferences.\"\n   <em>\n    People v. Hardiman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1057184\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/466/417/#p428\">\n    466 Mich. 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 428,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=646%20N.W.2d%20158\">\n    646 N.W.2d 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002). Finally, the Legislature specifically defined serious physical harm to include subdural hematoma. See MCL 750.136b(1)(f). Therefore, the prosecution presented sufficient evidence to establish defendant's identity as the person\n   who inflicted an act that caused a serious physical injury to KM. See\n   <em>\n    People v. Yost\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3596658\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/278/341/#p356\">\n    278 Mich.

The only remaining issue is whether the prosecution presented sufficient evidence to establish that defendant intended to cause serious physical harm or knew that serious physical harm would result. See\n   <em>\n    Maynor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1414153\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/470/289/#p291\">\n    470 Mich. at 291, 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=683%20N.W.2d%20565\">\n    683 N.W.2d 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Because it is difficult to prove an actor's state of mind, the prosecution may rely on minimal circumstantial evidence to prove that the defendant had the required mental state.

The evidence that defendant shook KM and that his shaking caused her injuries was sufficient to establish that defendant acted intentionally and caused her serious physical harm. Brown further opined that the acts that caused KM's injuries had to be violent. There was expert opinion to the contrary, but this Court must resolve that dispute in the prosecution's favor.\n   <em>\n    Wilkens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1608793\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/267/728/#p738\">\n    267 Mich.

A reasonable finder of fact could find Brown's testimony credible and find that defendant shook KM violently. It could then further infer from the violence of the act that he either intended to cause her\n   serious injury or knew that it was likely to do so. See\n   <em>\n    Unger\n   </em>\n   , 278 Mich.

STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant next argues that the trial court erred when it allowed Brown to testify that she diagnosed KM with \"definite pediatric physical abuse.\" He maintains that Brown's testimony amounted to an opinion that he was guilty.

Brown\n   did not limit her diagnosis to her belief that KM's injuries were best explained as inflicted or not accidental; she opined that this case involved a \"definite case of abusive head trauma.\" It was also evident from her testimony that \"abusive head trauma\" meant child abuse. She repeatedly told the jury that KM's injuries were \"caused by definite pediatric physical abuse,\" and she stated that \"we know that abusive head trauma\" causes these injuries because people confess to hospital staff and investigators or other family members after inflicting the injuries. She also agreed that KM had suffered previous abuse even though she was only nine weeks old. She further told the prosecutor that she was correct when the prosecutor noted that Brown looked at the totality of the circumstances before concluding that this case involved \"child abuse.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Brown's testimony that KM's injuries were caused by \"abusive head trauma\" or otherwise amounted to \"child abuse\" strongly suggested that it was her opinion that whoever inflicted the injuries on KM did so with culpable state of mind; that is, her testimony plainly implicated whether defendant \"knowingly or intentionally\" caused serious physical harm to KM within the meaning of MCL 750.136b(2). Because Brown was in no better position than the jury to assess the intent that defendant had when he acted, her belief that his actions were abusive or amounted to child abuse were irrelevant and inadmissible as a matter of law.

Consequently, the trial court plainly erred to the extent that it allowed Brown to use the phrase \"abusive head trauma\" to label her diagnosis rather than a less\n   prejudicial label, such as inflicted or nonaccidental head trauma, and erred by allowing her to agree that KM's injuries amounted to \"child abuse.\" See\n   <em>\n    Carines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"897929\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/460/750/#p763\">\n    460 Mich. at 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=597%20N.W.2d%20130\">\n    597 N.W.2d 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

She also testified that there were some people who felt that abusive head trauma was misdiagnosed. Moreover, defense counsel called three witnesses who testified that they did not agree with Brown's diagnosis: Julie Mack, M.D., who was a pediatric radiologist; Douglas Smith, M.D., who was a retired pathologist; and Joseph Sheller, M.D., who was a pediatric neurologist. The experts informed the jury that they did not believe that a medical professional could diagnose abuse. Mack testified that the medical records might give rise to a suspicion of abuse but opined that a medical professional cannot diagnose abuse. Smith also testified that the diagnoses of shaken-baby syndrome or abusive head trauma were founded on flawed studies and that there was great controversy over whether a medical professional could make such diagnoses. Sheller similarly testified that the presence of the symptoms seen in KM would cause a reasonable pediatrician to be concerned about the potential for abuse, but that a suspicion does not mean abuse actually occurred. Sheller stated that the symptoms at issue were not an absolute sign of abuse. Given this testimony, the jury was well aware of the limits on Brown's opinion. Any prejudice occasioned by her characterization of the acts was minimal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Although the prosecutor mentioned in her closing argument that Brown had characterized the symptoms as having been caused by abuse, she did not argue that the jury should rely on Brown's opinion\n   when deciding whether defendant had the requisite intent to establish first-degree child abuse. Instead, she argued that KD's account of events, the severity of the injuries, and defendant's subsequent actions tended to prove defendant's guilt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   There was evidence that KM became symptomatic while in defendant's care, and KD testified that she saw defendant shake KM at around that same time. The timing and eyewitness account permitted an inference that KM manifested her symptoms at that time because they were inflicted at that moment. A detective also reported that KD had reported that she had heard defendant yell \"shut up\" to KM. KD stated that defendant punished her when she cried at a time when he wanted to play video games. The evidence tended to suggest that defendant could become angry and frustrated by crying children. Brown also testified that KM's injuries were consistent with having been violently shaken. There was also testimony that defendant warned KD not to tell anyone and threatened to come after a neighbor if she or her husband said anything wrong about his statements to investigators. Defendant's statements suggest that he was conscious of his guilt. See\n   <em>\n    People v.

He also implies that the prosecutor's use of the evidence in closing was improper, but again he has not offered any meaningful analysis. To the extent that defendant might be arguing that the trial court plainly erred by allowing the evidence or that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by arguing the evidence, defendant has abandoned those claims on appeal. See\n   <em>\n    People v. Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3806771\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/271/280/#p315\">\n    271 Mich.

For that reason, we limit our analysis to determining whether defendant\n   has established that defense counsel's handling of this testimony and evidence amounted to ineffective assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   At trial, Brown testified that she examined KM's x-rays from her admission to Bronson Hospital and had some concern. She ordered a new bone survey on December 17, 2013. She testified that the new bone survey revealed that KM had a spiral tibia fracture. Although she acknowledged that the report from Bronson stated that KM's bone survey was normal, Brown stated that she recalled from memory that a physician from Bronson diagnosed KM with two fractures, but she could not forensically confirm one fracture. Brown did not otherwise offer any opinion as to when or how the fracture occurred. The prosecution rested after Brown's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The defense experts thereafter disagreed about whether the x-rays showed a fracture. Mack testified that the x-rays did not reveal a fracture and that even if she were to hypothesize that the films showed a fracture, she would have concluded that the fracture was \"weeks old\" by the time of the x-rays. Smith did not offer an opinion on the x-rays other than to observe that the interpretations were inconsistent and depended on evidence of a periosteal reaction that was normally found in children who are growing because the periosteum was an active tissue that helps shape the bone during growth. Sheller, by contrast, agreed that the images showed a fracture, but he disregarded it in his opinion because it occurred before the date of the injuries at issue and was for that reason not relevant to his diagnosis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The evidence that KM might have suffered a fracture at some point before the events at issue was inadmissible under MRE 402, which prohibits the\n   admission of irrelevant evidence. In the absence of evidence connecting the fracture to defendant, it did not have \"any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" MRE 401. Indeed, without evidence from which a jury could reasonably find that KM suffered\n   the injury while under defendant's care and that the nature of the injury was consistent with having been inflicted by human agency, the evidence was not even relevant to prove conduct in conformity with character, which would ordinarily be improper under MRE 404(b).

Even to the extent that the evidence might be admissible because Brown relied on it as a component of her differential diagnosis of abusive head trauma, the evidence was likely inadmissible under MRE 403 because it invited speculation by the jury, and the danger of unfair prejudice outweighed whatever marginal relevance the evidence might have had for purposes of the diagnosis. Nevertheless, even though this evidence was likely inadmissible, it does not follow that defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to its admission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   As already discussed, this Court must affirmatively entertain the range of possible reasons that defense counsel might not have objected.

Defense counsel also used the inconsistent and weak evidence of a fracture to challenge the credibility of the prosecution's experts.

The trial court found that a score of 25 points was appropriate for OV 3. The trial court mentioned the possibility that the leg fracture might be permanently incapacitating but then indicated that there was not enough testimony to know whether the leg fracture or other injuries would amount to incapacitating injuries. Nevertheless, it found that there were permanently incapacitating injuries to the brain and that the injury to the brain was potentially life-threatening.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   To the extent that the trial court found that defendant's actions caused a permanent incapacitating injury to KM, we find it clearly erred.

There was no expert testimony about the long-term effects of the injury to KM's brain caused by\n   her subdural hematomas. The prosecution's own expert, Brown, testified that she did not think they would \"ever know if she's having neurological problems\" as a result of the injuries she sustained on the day at issue because it \"would be very difficult to figure out\" whether the effects were from her \"prenatal stroke\" or from her head injury. She also opined that there would be no long-term effects from the tibia fracture or from her retinal hemorrhage. Nevertheless, there was evidence that KM's injuries were life-threatening.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The record shows that KM had significant subdural bleeding, repeated seizures, and retinal hemorrhage and that these injuries were severe enough that the treating physicians at the hospital where she first reported had her airlifted to a larger hospital. Accordingly, the trial court did not clearly err when it found that KM's injuries were life-threatening and assigned 25 points under OV 3. See MCL 777.33(1)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The trial court also found that defendant used excessive brutality in the commission of the offense. Specifically, it noted the leg fractures and the extent of KM's brain injuries. For that reason, it assigned 50 points under OV 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The trial court had to assess 50 points under OV 7 if it found that that a \"victim was treated with sadism, torture, excessive brutality, or similarly egregious conduct designed to substantially increase the fear and anxiety a victim suffered during the offense.\" MCL 777.37(1)(a). Because the Legislature provided that the brutality must be-in relevant part-excessive, the trial court could only assign 50 points if it found that the abuse involved in this case exceeded the brutality that normally encompasses first-degree child abuse.

Although serious physical harm necessarily includes subdural hemorrhages, a person can commit first-degree child abuse without causing such an injury. And in this case, there was evidence-albeit disputed-that defendant had to have violently shaken or thrown KM to cause the subdural hematomas and other injuries.

The fact that the offense of first-degree child abuse applies to children, see MCL 750.136b(1)(a), does not mean that the trial court may not consider the victim's youth for purposes of scoring OV 10; it should unless the Legislature provided otherwise. See\n   <em>\n    Hardy\n   </em>\n   , 494 Mich. at 441-442,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=835%20N.W.2d%20340\">\n    835 N.W.2d 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Legislature did not provide that MCL 777.40(1)(b) does not apply to crimes against children. Accordingly, the trial court could properly consider KM's youthfulness for purposes of scoring OV 10. There was record evidence permitting an inference that defendant violently shook or threw KM when she was just nine weeks of age. That evidence supported a score of 10 points under MCL 777.40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   As for OV 13, the trial court had to assign 25 points under that variable if it found that defendant's offense was part of a \"pattern of felonious criminal activity involving 3 or more crimes against a person.\" MCL 777.43(1)(c). The trial court must count all crimes that occurred within a five-year period, which includes the sentencing offense; further, the court must count all offenses even if the offense did not result in a conviction. MCL 777.43(2)(a). As noted in defendant's PSIR, he was on bond for felonious assault when he committed the present offense, which, when counted with the sentencing offense, constituted two offenses against a person. The trial court did not make any specific findings with regard to a third felony offense, so it is unclear how it arrived at the score of 25 points for this OV. On this record, the trial court clearly erred to the extent that it found that defendant had committed three felony offenses against a person within the past five years. See\n   <em>\n    Hardy\n   </em>\n   , 494 Mich. at 438,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=835%20N.W.2d%20340\">\n    835 N.W.2d 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The trial court calculated defendant's total OV score to be 110, which placed him in cell VI/C of the resentencing grid with a minimum sentence range of 135 to 225 months. See MCL 777.62. After subtracting 25 points, the new score would place him in cell V/C and the new range would be 126 to 210 months. MCL 777.62. The trial court sentenced defendant to serve a minimum sentence of 180 months in prison, which was within the range provided under cell V/C. Because the error was not preserved for appellate review, defendant cannot show that he is entitled to be resentenced unless he does so through a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel during sentencing. See\n   <em>\n    People v. Francisco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3682994\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/474/82/\">\n    474 Mich. 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 89 &amp; n. 8,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=711%20N.W.2d%2044\">\n    711 N.W.2d 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). On appeal, defendant asserts that his trial counsel was ineffective to the extent that he failed to raise any of the errors he now\n   asserts on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Had defense counsel raised this issue at sentencing, the trial court would\n   have had to recalculate the total OV score and sentence within the appropriate range. Therefore, defendant has established that defense counsel's failure to raise this claim at sentencing fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and prejudiced his sentencing. See\n   <em>\n    Yost\n   </em>\n   , 278 Mich. App. at 387,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=749%20N.W.2d%20753\">\n    749 N.W.2d 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, on this record, we agree that defendant is entitled to resentencing with zero points assessed under OV 13.

Because defendant's sentence was within the range provided under the advisory sentencing guidelines, his sentence was \"presumptively proportionate, and a proportionate sentence is not cruel or unusual.\"\n   <em>\n    People v. Bowling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4087760\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/299/552/#p558\">\n    299 Mich.

To overcome the presumption, defendant had to show that there was something unusual about the circumstances of his case that made the sentence disproportionate.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . He has not identified any unusual circumstances beyond arguing that his sentence was invalid as a result of flaws in his trial and sentencing. In any event, defendant can raise this issue before the trial court on remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Defendant also suggests that the trial court erred when it allowed KD to testify by video in violation of his right to confront the witnesses against him. Defense counsel, however, told the trial court that he\n   had agreed with the prosecutor to allow certain witnesses-lay and expert-to testify via electronic communications. Moreover, defense counsel agreed that one of the witnesses was the mother of KM and KD, Chitwood, who had relocated out of state and was having transportation difficulties. So, he had to have understood that the child witness would also be testifying by video. By agreeing that the witnesses could testify by \"any means that is available to allow them to testify,\" defense counsel waived any claim of error with regard to that procedure.

As already discussed, although there is disagreement within the medical community about the diagnosis of abusive head trauma, Brown could offer an opinion as to whether KM's injuries were inflicted by human agency. Further, while Brown's use of the term \"abusive\" to describe the head trauma may have been improper, that error did not warrant relief. Finally, whether Brown held a personal or professional bias was a proper subject for cross-examination; it was not grounds to preclude her from testifying. See\n   <em>\n    People v.
