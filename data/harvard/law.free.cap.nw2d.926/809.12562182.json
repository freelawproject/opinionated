The circuit court erred by: (1) purporting to deny the defendant's motion as not complying with MCR 6.502(C), when the proper relief for such a defect is, under MCR 6.502(D), either returning the motion to the defendant or adjudicating the motion on the merits notwithstanding the defect; (2) treating the defendant's motion for relief from judgment as a successive motion; and (3) concluding that the claim of new evidence had been previously resolved against the defendant on appeal. The motions to remand for an evidentiary hearing, to expand the record, to stay, and for immediate consideration of the motion to stay are DENIED as moot.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
