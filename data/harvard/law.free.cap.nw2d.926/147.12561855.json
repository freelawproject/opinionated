Ayling also appeals from an order denying her motion to reconsider. The district court concluded Ayling's claims against the Defendants were untimely. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b62] Ayling's son, Blake Ayling, was a student at UND. He was last seen alive at an on-campus party at approximately 1:30 a.m. on March 24, 2012. He was found dead in the rail yard south of UND's campus at approximately 6:30 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. on March 24, 2012. Dr. Sens performed the autopsy on the same day. She determined Blake Ayling was intoxicated, he had a 0.278 blood-alcohol concentration at the time of death, he died from blood loss, and his death was accidental.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b63] After learning of the autopsy results, Ayling questioned the blood-alcohol concentration because Blake Ayling reportedly did not show signs of intoxication at the party or before the party. Ayling met with Dr. Sens in April 2013, and Sens explained the autopsy report and defended her conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b64] On December 27, 2013, Ayling spoke with a forensic toxicologist who questioned Dr. Sens' methods in performing the autopsy. The toxicologist believed Blake Ayling's urine and vitreous humor should have been tested for alcohol to corroborate the blood test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b65] Ayling sued Dr. Sens, UND School of Medicine employees, and Grand Forks County employees in February 2017, alleging Sens failed to competently perform a medical autopsy as a part of the investigation of Blake Ayling's death. Ayling alleged the other Defendants failed to properly supervise Dr. Sens. After serving and filing her complaint, Ayling requested numerous documents from the Defendants through discovery. The Defendants moved to quash or stay the discovery, arguing that dispositive motions would be filed. The district court stayed discovery, recognizing \"that judicial economy will be best served by staying all discovery pending the outcome of the Defendants' dispositive Motions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b66] The Defendants brought motions to dismiss and for summary judgment, requesting dismissal of Ayling's complaint under several legal theories, including failure to bring her lawsuit within the three-year statute of limitations. In January 2018 the district court issued an order granting the Defendants' motions for summary judgment because Ayling sued more than three years after she discovered she had a possible claim against the Defendants. The court concluded Ayling discovered she had a possible claim no later than\n   December 2013 when she spoke with the toxicologist who indicated Dr. Sens' autopsy of Blake Ayling may have been below the standard of care. The court entered a judgment dismissing Ayling's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b67] Following entry of the judgment, Ayling filed a \"motion to reconsider and/or vacate pursuant to N.D.R.Civ.P. 59(j) and Rule 60(b)\" relating to the district court's January 2018 order granting the Defendants' motions for summary judgment. The district court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b68] Ayling argues the district court erred in granting the Defendants' motions for summary judgment dismissing her complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b69] \"An action barred by a statute of limitations generally is dismissed under the summary judgment standards of N.D.R.Civ.P. 56.\"\n   <em>\n    Estate of Nelson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6880214\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/863/521/\">\n    2015 ND 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6880214\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/863/521/\">\n    863 N.W.2d 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Riemers v.

The statute of limitations generally begins to run from the commission of the wrongful act giving rise to the cause of action, unless an exception applies. The discovery rule is one exception, and under the discovery rule the accrual of a claim is postponed until the plaintiff knew, or with the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known, of the wrongful act and its resulting injury. We have said, after acquiring knowledge of facts sufficient to put a person of ordinary intelligence on inquiry, a party has a responsibility to promptly find out what legal rights result from those facts, and failure to do so will be construed against the party. The discovery rule does not require full knowledge of the extent of an injury; rather, it only requires the party be aware of an injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Frith v.

The district court discussed Ayling's knowledge of facts related to her son's autopsy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   In this case, the underlying event was the medical autopsy of Blake, occurring March 24, 2012. Plaintiff was made aware of the autopsy result on June 28, 2012. By December of 2013, she had hired an independent toxicologist in order to review Dr. [Sens'] autopsy. By this time, she had discovered, according to the allegations of her Complaint, various actions done or not done by Dr. Sens that raised questions: \"[Ayling] had many questions about the coroner file documents and sent a letter to Dr. Sens dated March 24, 2013.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 32). Ayling \"drafted a confirming letter to Dr. Sens dated April 24, 2013 based on the notes she took ... also had a few more questions as 2 hrs. was not enough ....\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 34). Then Ayling investigated the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity as to the fraternity's culpability. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 36). Ayling attempted to discern raw toxicology data, and when she could not, she hired an independent toxicologist to do so, speaking with the expert by telephone on December 27, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 39).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   These were facts that would put a reasonable person on notice of a potential claim. There is no dispute of material fact precluding summary judgment here, as there is only one reasonable interpretation: any plaintiff in Ayling's position had sufficient facts to be put on notice of a claim by December [27,] 2013 because of the multitude and variety of facts Ayling relies on in her Complaint she discovered as part of her investigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b613] The record establishes Ayling began questioning the autopsy report after she became aware of it in June 2012. She sent letters and emails to Dr. Sens about her performance of the autopsy. She met with Dr. Sens in April 2013 to discuss the autopsy. After speaking with the independent toxicologist on December 27, 2013, Ayling was aware of facts sufficient to put her on notice of a potential claim, and she failed to sue the Defendants within three years of that date. The district court did not err in concluding that by December 27, 2013, Ayling knew or should have known she had a possible claim against the Defendants. The court did not err in granting the Defendants' motions for summary judgment dismissing Ayling's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b614] Ayling argues the district court erred in its decisions relating to her discovery requests. A district court has broad discretion over the scope of discovery, and its discovery decisions will not be reversed on appeal unless the court abused its discretion.\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Mark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7057871\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/834/291/\">\n    2013 ND 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7057871\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/834/291/\">\n    834 N.W.2d 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A court abuses its discretion when it acts in an arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable manner, it misinterprets or misapplies the law, or its decision is not the product of a rational mental process leading to a reasoned determination.\n   <em>\n    Key Energy Servs., LLC v.

In response, the Defendants filed motions to quash, for a protective order, and for a stay of discovery. The Defendants argued the district court should stay discovery because they would be filing dispositive motions, including motions to dismiss and for summary judgment. The court stayed discovery, recognizing \"that judicial economy will be best served by staying all discovery pending\n   the outcome of the Defendants' dispositive Motions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b616] After the Defendants filed their dispositive motions, Ayling requested the district court to delay ruling on the motions to allow her to conduct additional discovery under N.D.R.Civ.P. 56(f). In granting Grand Forks County's summary judgment motions on statute of limitations grounds, the court stated, \"[Ayling] fails to specifically identify any discovery that would defeat the motion based on the statute of limitations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b617] Under N.D.R.Civ.P. 56(f), a district court may delay its ruling on a motion for summary judgment to allow additional discovery \"[i]f a party opposing the motion shows by affidavit that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition.\" However, \"when further discovery would not involve an issue which is the subject matter of the summary judgment motion, a trial court does not abuse its discretion in deciding the motion without granting the Rule 56(f) request.\"\n   <em>\n    Perry Ctr., Inc. v.
