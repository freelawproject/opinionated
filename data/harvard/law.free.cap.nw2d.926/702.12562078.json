The Respondent has had behavioral issues while in the State Hospital.

He testified that he did not say what was reported and there was no sexual innuendo in what he did say. However, the Court noted that there were approximately thirty (30) pages of Dr. Fox's report that included behavior issues noted of the Respondent at the State Hospital.

The trial court's findings\n   of fact and conclusions of law should be stated with sufficient specificity to assist the appellate court's review and to afford a clear understanding of the trial court's decision. Conclusory, general findings do not comply with N.D.R.Civ.P. 52(a), and a finding of fact that merely states a party has failed in its burden of proof is inadequate under the rule. Rather, the trial court must specifically state the subordinate facts upon which its ultimate factual conclusions rest.
