Following a detention hearing, the district court found probable cause for the charge. On March 20, the state charged Thibodeaux with fifth-degree criminal sexual conduct. The charge was based on the same incident and contained an identical probable-cause statement but was filed in a new petition. As part of a plea agreement, Thibodeaux admitted the charge of fifth-degree criminal sexual conduct and the district court dismissed the petition with the fourth-degree charge. The district court did not order Thibodeaux to register as a predatory offender. In December 1997, Thibodeaux was certified as an adult and convicted of fourth-degree assault. Following that conviction, the district court ordered that Thibodeaux was required to register as a predatory offender based on the fifth-degree criminal-sexual-conduct adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 24, 2017, Thibodeaux filed this lawsuit against respondent Drew Evans in Evans's official capacity as Superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA). Thibodeaux alleged that, by requiring him to register as a predatory offender, Evans violated his due-process rights and that Evans was estopped from requiring him to register based on his 1997 plea agreement. Both parties moved for summary judgment, and the district court granted summary judgment to Evans. This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.

As part of a plea agreement, Thibodeaux admitted the charge of fifth-degree criminal sexual conduct and the petition charging him with fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct was dismissed. Thibodeaux argues that, because the entire petition, rather than just a charge, was dismissed, that he \"can no longer be designated as having been 'charged' with an offense.\" But he does not cite any Minnesota law to support this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The statutory language does not require that the charged offense and ultimate conviction or adjudication be in the same petition.

The petitions contain identical probable-cause statements. And although the charges were in separate petitions, the record makes it clear that Thibodeaux pleaded guilty to fifth-degree criminal sexual conduct as part of a plea agreement to resolve the fourth-degree charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

The supreme court observed that the requirement to register for those who are \"merely\n   <em>\n    charged\n   </em>\n   with predatory offenses\" was meant to \"ensure that true predatory offenders cannot plead out of the registration requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7087235\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/778/700/#p705\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7087235\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/778/700/#p705\">\n    at 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

When the state initially charged Thibodeaux with fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct, the district court determined that the charge was supported by probable cause. Thus, Thibodeaux was charged with a registration offense and that charge was supported by probable cause. He reached a plea agreement to resolve that charge and was ultimately adjudicated delinquent of an offense arising out of the same set of circumstances. On this record, the district court did not err in determining that Thibodeaux had been charged with an offense requiring registration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Thibodeaux argues that the predatory-offender registration statute is unconstitutional because it violates his right to substantive due process.

Thibodeaux argues that, since\n   <em>\n    Boutin\n   </em>\n   was decided, \"much has changed\" and asks that we determine that the statute implicates his fundamental right to liberty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Thibodeaux argues that since the\n   <em>\n    Boutin\n   </em>\n   decision in 1999, a series of local community ordinances have been enacted that severely restrict the rights of a registered predatory offender. Thibodeaux generally alludes to the local ordinances and asserts that they \"implicate the fundamental rights of those who are required to register as predatory offenders.\" But he does not argue that any of the ordinances have affected him personally. Thus, he has not shown that he has suffered an injury from these ordinances, which he must do to challenge the constitutionality of this statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Paulson v.

In\n   <em>\n    Munger\n   </em>\n   , we noted that the appellant did \"not argue that the statute burdens his right to enter and leave another state or his right to be treated as a welcome visitor in other states.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6900028\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/858/814/#p823\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6900028\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/858/814/#p823\">\n    at 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thibodeaux's argument that the statute violates his fundamental right to interstate travel is based on the same registration requirements at issue in\n   <em>\n    Munger\n   </em>\n   that we previously rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Finally, Thibodeaux argues that the predatory-offender statute violates the fundamental right of an individual \"to marry and live with their family.\" This argument is based on a separate statute that requires a supervising agency to authorize a registered offender to live in a household with children and requires local law enforcement to notify the appropriate child-protection agency.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20244.057\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 244.057\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). Thibodeaux does not allege that he was personally affected by this requirement, but generally alleges that the statute infringes his fundamental right to live with his family. The statute provides that \"[a] corrections agency supervising an offender required to register ... shall notify the appropriate child protection agency before authorizing the offender to live in a household where children are residing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20244.057\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The statute does not prohibit him from living in a household with children, it simply requires that the appropriate child-protection agency be notified. In that sense, it is similar to the requirement that he provide notice if he moves out of state. The statute creates an additional notice requirement but does not ultimately infringe upon his rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On this record, we conclude that the district court did not err in determining Thibodeaux's substantive due-process rights were not violated. Thibodeaux has not shown that the statute infringes upon a fundamental right, and, therefore, the statute is subject to rational-basis review.\n   <em>\n    Boutin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11638095\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/591/711/#p716\">\n    591 N.W.2d at 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, the party must show wrongful conduct on the part of an authorized government agent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7072391\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/797/18/#p25\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, the party must show that he reasonably relied on the wrongful conduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7072391\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/797/18/#p25\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Third, the party must show that he incurred \"a unique expenditure in reliance on the wrongful conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7072391\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/797/18/#p25\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Fourth, \"the balance of the equities must weigh in favor of estoppel.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7072391\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/797/18/#p25\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Equitable estoppel is not available \"where there is an adequate remedy at law available.\"\n   <em>\n    ServiceMaster of St. Cloud v. GAB Bus. Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10697500\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/544/302/#p305\">\n    544 N.W.2d 302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 305 (Minn. 1996).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The district court determined that equitable estoppel did not bar the BCA from requiring Thibodeaux to register as a predatory offender because Thibodeaux did not rely on any statements made by the BCA and there was no wrongful conduct on the part of the BCA because it properly administered\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20243.166\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 243.166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). Thibodeaux's claim of equitable estoppel is based on his assertion that, as part of the plea agreement, the prosecutor agreed that he would not be required to register as a predatory offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Thibodeaux argues that the wrongful conduct on behalf of the prosecutor may be\n   attributed to the BCA because they are both part of the executive branch. But the supreme court has observed that, \"[a]s a general rule, for equitable estoppel to lie, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant, through his language or conduct, induced the plaintiff to rely, in good faith, on this language or conduct to his injury, detriment or prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    Ridgewood Dev. Co. v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10682175\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/294/288/#p292\">\n    294 N.W.2d 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 292 (Minn. 1980). Here, Evans is the defendant in his official capacity as superintendent of the BCA. And Thibodeaux has not alleged any wrongful conduct on the part of Evans or an authorized agent of the BCA. As the district court observed, the BCA properly administered the requirements of the predatory-offender statute. Accordingly, the district court properly determined that equitable estoppel did not apply because Thibodeaux failed to allege any wrongful conduct on the part of Evans or the BCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    DECISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Thibodeaux was charged with an offense that required him to register as a predatory offender under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20243.166\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 243.166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 1b. Because the charge was supported by probable cause and because he was adjudicated delinquent for another offense arising out of the same set of circumstances, the district court did not err in determining that he was charged with an offense requiring registration. Thibodeaux has not established that the registration requirement violates his rights to substantive and procedural due process. And because he has not established any wrongdoing on the part of Evans or the BCA, the district court did not err in determining that equitable estoppel does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    Affirmed.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
