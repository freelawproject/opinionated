When the City of New Orleans (the \"City\") learned that it had issued identical flawed invitations to bid on two public road-paving projects, the City decided to reject all of the bids and to re-advertise the projects. One of the bidders, Command Construction Industries, L.L.C. (\"Command\"), filed two lawsuits seeking to enjoin the City from rebidding the projects and to force the City to award the projects to Command. After the suits were consolidated, the trial court rendered a March 15, 2017 judgment granting a preliminary injunction in favor of Command on one project, and denying injunctive relief to Command on the other project. The judgment also denied Command's requests for writs of mandamus on both projects. Both the City and Command appealed. For the reasons that follow, we\n   affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    The Projects\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pursuant to the Louisiana Public Bid Law, on July 31, 2015, the City issued an Invitation to Bid on a public work for the paving of streets in the Gentilly Terrace and Desire area neighborhoods of New Orleans (the \"Gentilly Project\"). The Invitation to Bid stated that each bidder was \"required\" to submit a Louisiana Contractors License Number with two specific classifications: (1) \"Public Works Construction\"; and (2) \"Highway, Street &amp; Bridge Construction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 14, 2015, the City issued another Invitation to Bid for the paving of streets in the Treme and Laffite neighborhoods of New Orleans (the \"Treme Project\"). Like the Gentilly Project, the Invitation to Bid on the Treme Project required contractor licenses in \"Public Works Construction\" and \"Highway, Street &amp; Bridge Construction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 10, 2015, the City opened the bids for the Gentilly Project; and on September 22, 2015, the City informed Roubion Roads &amp; Streets, LLC (\"Roubion\") that it was the lowest bidder and that the City intended to award the contract to Roubion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 2, 2015, Command, which was the second-lowest bidder on the Gentilly Project, protested the City's plan to award the contract to Roubion. Command complained that Roubion was a non-responsive bidder because it did not meet the licensing requirements for the contract, in that Roubion only had a license classification for \"Highway, Streets &amp; Bridge Construction,\" and not for \"Public Works Construction,\" as required by the bid documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The City opened the bids on the Treme Project on September 15, 2015. On October 6, 2015, the City sent a letter to Command advising that the City intended to award the Treme Project to Command, subject to the receipt and approval of post-bid documentation and the execution of a formal contract with the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 7, 2015, Roubion responded to Command's bid protest on the Gentilly Project. Roubion advised the City that, although the Invitation to Bid required a license for \"Public Works Construction,\" there was no such classification recognized by the Louisiana Licensing Board of Contractors. Roubion told the City that Roubion was the lowest responsive and responsible bidder on the Gentilly Project because the only \"true\" license requirement in the Invitation to Bid was the classification \"Highway, Street &amp; Bridge Construction,\" which Roubion held.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On October 16, 2015, the City advised Command that the City had determined that there was just cause for rejection of all bids on the two projects because \"no bidder ha[d] the nonexistent contractor license classification as per the instructions on the Invitation to Bid.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On October 16, 2015, Command filed two separate \"Verified Petitions for Preliminary Injunction, Writ of Mandamus, and Permanent Injunction, or in the Alternative, for Damages\" (collectively, the \"Petitions\"). In the Petitions, Command sought to enjoin the City from rebidding both the Gentilly and the Treme Projects, and requested writs of mandamus to compel the City to award the two contracts to Command. The two lawsuits were consolidated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A hearing was held on November 5, 2015. On March 17, 2017, the trial court rendered a judgment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (1) denying Command's Petition for Preliminary Injunction with respect to the Gentilly Project;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (2) granting Command's Petition for Preliminary Injunction with respect to the Treme Project;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (3) denying Command's Petition for Writ of Mandamus with respect to the Gentilly Project; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (4) denying Command's Petition for Writ of Mandamus with respect to the Treme Project.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The trial court found that, on the Gentilly Project, the City had \"just cause\" to reject all bids \"due to the City's flawed bidding process.\" On the Treme Project, however, the trial court found that Command was the \"lowest responsive and responsible bidder,\" and should be awarded the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On April 18, 2017, Command filed an \"Ex Parte and Unopposed Motion to Make Preliminary Injunction Permanent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On that same date, the trial court issued an order making permanent the March 15, 2007 judgment in favor of Command with respect to the Treme Project only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The City appeals that portion of the March 15, 2017 judgment granting Command's request for a preliminary injunction on the Treme Project, and the April 18, 2017 order making that portion of the judgment permanent. Command appeals that portion of the March 15, 2017 judgment denying Command's request for a preliminary injunction on the Gentilly Project, and denying Command's requests for a writ of mandamus on both the Gentilly and Treme Projects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"A trial court has broad discretion in the granting or denial of a preliminary injunction, and will not be disturbed on review absent clear abuse of that discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Yokum v.

Selection.\" The term \"Person\" means \"any individual, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, joint venture, or other business entity.\" The term \"Selection\" is defined as \"the City's identification of the person to whom the City intends to award a contract or to qualify under a request for qualifications.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Here, the Protest Policy gives business entities such as Command the right to protest the City's selection of a bidder. Again, the Protest Policy cannot be read so broadly as to apply to the City. This argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In sum, none of Command's \"waiver\" arguments have any merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Preliminary Injunction: Gentilly Project\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In Command's appeal, it contends that the trial court erred in denying its request for injunctive relief on the Gentilly Project because the City had no \"just cause\" to reject all of the bids. According to Command, the requirement in the Invitation to Bid that the contractor have a \"Public Works Construction\" license \"clearly refer[red]\" to \"Municipal and Public Works Construction,\" so that Command was the lowest responsive bidder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Just Cause\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Public Bid Law's \"strict prohibition of waiver or deviation from bid forms and statutory law must ... be weighed with the statutory requirements that a public entity must have 'just cause' to reject any bid or reject all bids.\"\n   <em>\n    Enmon Enters., L.L.C. v.

However flawed the Invitation to Bid was, under La. R.S. 38:2212(B)(1), the City cannot waive or deviate from this requirement. We reject Command's contention that the City merely made a \"spelling error\" in its bid invitations, and that \"Public Works Construction\" is the same as \"Municipal and Public Works Construction.\" The Public Bid Law must be strictly construed. Because no bidding contractor complied with the Invitations to Bid, the City was entitled to disqualify all of the bidders as non-responsive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Broadmoor\n   </em>\n   , 04-0212, p. 20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9268805\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/867/651/\">\n    867 So.2d at 663-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We find that the City, therefore, had \"just cause\" under La. R.S. 38:2214(B)(5) to reject all of the bids on the Gentilly Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   We also find that the City's decision to reject all of the bids was fair and reasonable. Although Command argues that no bidder was prejudiced by the erroneous license requirement, we note that this confusing error may have discouraged prospective bidders on the Gentilly Project because they could not possibly comply with a license requirement of \"Public Works Construction.\" The City's\n   decision to reissue the Invitation to Bid with clear and unambiguous instructions, and to rebid the contract, ensured fair competition among bidders and maintained the integrity of the bidding process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court was not manifestly erroneous in denying Command's request for a preliminary injunction on the Gentilly Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Preliminary Injunction: Treme Project\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In the City's appeal, it argues that because it had just cause for rejecting all bids on the Gentilly Project due to the City's flawed bidding process, it also had just cause to reject all bids on the Treme Project. According to the City, because both projects had the identical classification error in their Invitations to Bid, if the Gentilly Project's bidding process was flawed, then the Treme Project's bidding process was also flawed. We agree, and find that the City also had just cause for rejecting all bids on the Treme Project. The trial court, therefore, manifestly erred in granting Command's request for injunctive relief, and awarding the contract to Command.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Mandamus\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Finally, Command contends that the trial court erred in denying Command's requests for a writ of mandamus awarding the Gentilly and Treme contracts to Command.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   If a public entity does not have just cause to reject the low bidder or just cause to reject all bids, mandamus can be used to compel the awarding of the contract to the lowest responsible bidder under the Public Bid Law.\n   <em>\n    Wallace C.

Because we find that the City had \"just cause\" to reject all of the bids on the Gentilly and Treme Projects, we need not address Command's argument that the trial court erred in denying its requests for mandamus relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \"[A] public entity cannot deviate in any manner from the requirements it sets forth in its bid documents and the requirements set forth in any aspect of the Public Bid Law.\"\n   <em>\n    Enmon\n   </em>\n   , 11-0459, p. 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7023503\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/76/548/#p554\">\n    76 So.3d at 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this matter, none of the bidders on the Gentilly and Treme Projects complied with the licensing requirement in the Invitations to Bid. We conclude, therefore, that the City had just cause to reject all bids on the two projects. Command, therefore, is not entitled to injunctive or mandamus relief. Accordingly, we affirm that portion of the March 15, 2017 judgment denying Command's request for a preliminary injunction on the Gentilly Project. We also affirm that portion of the March 15, 2017 judgment denying Command's requests for a writ of mandamus on the Gentilly and Treme Projects. We reverse that part of the March 15, 2017 judgment granting Command's request for a preliminary injunction on the Treme Project, and reverse the April 18, 2017 judgment granting Command a permanent injunction on the Treme Project. This matter is remanded for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    At the November 5, 2015 hearing, counsel for the parties jointly stipulated that Command's requests for a preliminary and permanent injunction in the consolidated matters would be tried together; and, in the event any preliminary injunction was issued for either matter, such preliminary injunction would be made permanent.
