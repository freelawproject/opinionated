After a trial, a jury convicted Darius Parnell Haynes in the Circuit Court of Copiah County of two counts: possession of cocaine while in possession of a firearm and possession of a weapon by a felon. Because the evidence was legally sufficient to support the conviction of possession of cocaine, we affirm Haynes's conviction for possession and the corresponding sentence. The conviction and sentence for possession of a firearm by a felon are not\n   affected as Haynes has not requested that we review them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. On March 27, 2016, Haynes and Kimmeisha Harris fought at a friend's house. After the fight, Haynes left with Xavier Brown in Brown's maroon Mercury Marquis, which had broken-out back window. Meanwhile, Harris went to the hospital, where she gave Investigator Wendell Fountain a statement. Harris told Investigator Fountain that, during the fight, she thought she had seen Haynes with a gun and that Haynes had threatened to shoot her. Harris also gave Investigator Fountain a description of the car in which Haynes had left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. After leaving the hospital, Investigator Fountain spotted a maroon Mercury Marquis with a broken-out back window at a nearby gas station. Brown was standing outside the car, pumping gas. Haynes was sitting in the passenger seat. Investigator Fountain approached the vehicle and noticed a small plastic bag containing a white substance, which was identified at trial as 0.34 grams of cocaine. The plastic bag was in plain view, located in the ashtray between the driver and passenger seats. Investigator Fountain asked Haynes \"if he knew why he was making contact with him.\" According to Investigator Fountain, Haynes said, \"It's probably because of a little incident that I just had.\" Investigator Fountain then received consent from Brown to search the car, and he found a gun in the glove box. Brown testified that the gun in the glove box belonged to Haynes and was the same gun from the incident at the friend's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. Brown also testified concerning State's Exhibit 3, the small plastic bag of cocaine\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   that Investigator Fountain had recovered from the ashtray. The following exchange between the State and Brown entered evidence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   State: [D]id you get a chance to snort any of that cocaine that night?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Brown: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   State: So when you had that substance, you believed it to be cocaine?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Brown: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   State: And so you said you snorted it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Brown: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   State: Who else was with you when you snorted that substance believed to be cocaine?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Brown: Darius [Haynes].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   State: And did he snort some of that substance that you believed to be cocaine?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Brown: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   State: So when the officer came up, he saw the remainder of the substance; is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Brown: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   State: And the substance that you two were using came out of this content [sic]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Brown: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Brown also testified that the cocaine found in the car belonged only to him, not Haynes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 5. On November 16, 2016, a jury found Haynes guilty of possession of cocaine while in possession of a firearm and possession of a weapon by a felon. The trial court sentenced Haynes to three years for the possession offense, which was enhanced due to the firearm possession, and to ten years for being a felon in possession of a firearm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both sentences were to be served concurrently without the benefit of\n   parole. Haynes filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court denied the motion, and Haynes filed his notice of appeal as to both counts. On appeal, Haynes contests only his conviction on Count I. He argues that the evidence is legally insufficient to support his conviction for possession of cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 6.

In this case, the record is uncontradicted that Haynes lacked actual possession of the cocaine at the time of his arrest, so the State had the burden to prove Haynes had constructive possession of it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 8. For constructive possession, this Court has developed the following framework:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [W]hat constitutes a sufficient external relationship between the defendant and\n   the narcotic property to complete the concept of \"possession\" is a question which is not susceptible to a specific rule. However, there must be sufficient facts to warrant a finding that defendant was aware of the presence and character of the particular substance and was intentionally and consciously in possession of it.... Constructive possession may be shown by establishing that the drug involved was subject to [the defendant's] dominion or control.

Here, the evidence in the record is legally sufficient to support the conviction of possession of cocaine. The cocaine was discovered in plain view in a car in which Haynes was sitting. More so, Haynes was sitting in the passenger seat right next to the ashtray that held the cocaine. The record also demonstrated that Haynes was aware of the cocaine as Brown admitted that he and Haynes had \"snorted\" cocaine from the package in the ashtray \"that night\" and that Officer Fountain \"saw the remainder of the\" cocaine that the two had used. The fact that Brown and Haynes had \"snorted\" this same cocaine also shows that Haynes exerted \"dominion and control\" over the cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 10. The dissent relies on\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

The evidence of Haynes's use of the seized cocaine, though, distinguishes this case from\n   <em>\n    Harris.\n   </em>\n   Unel Harris, the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   -who was a passenger in someone else's car-was not linked to the specific heroin that was recovered from the vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217927\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/646/904/\">\n    646 F.2d at 906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In its analysis, the\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   court noted that Harris's track marks, \"given the absence of any traces of heroin use or of any paraphernalia needed for such use in [the] car, ... in no way operate to prove that Harris had control or dominion over the specific heroin found wrapped in packets in [the] car.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217927\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/646/904/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Unlike the lack of evidence in\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   , the evidence in this record demonstrates that Haynes used a portion of the same cocaine that was found in the ashtray. In other words, we-unlike the Fifth Circuit panel-are faced with evidence that \"operate[s] to prove that [Haynes] had control or dominion over the specific [cocaine] found wrapped in [a] packet[ ] in [Brown's] car.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217927\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/646/904/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Indeed, Brown agreed that he and Haynes had \"snorted\" cocaine from the package in the ashtray \"that night\" and that Officer Fountain \"saw the remainder of the\" cocaine that the two had used.

Further, the dissent's position would narrow established criminal law by equating ownership and possession-two distinct concepts in our law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Possession-not\n   ownership-is the issue before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 12. Brown's testimony that \"the cocaine belonged to me\" did not foreclose the jury from determining that Haynes also had possessed the cocaine, as Haynes exerted \"dominion and control\" over it.\n   <em>\n    Hudson v.

Brown knew Haynes. From his own testimony, he had used drugs with Haynes. The jury could have found that Brown had an incentive to claim ownership of the cocaine and shield his friend from further criminal liability in light of Haynes's prior felony record and the fact that Haynes had a firearm in the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 14. The only question before us on a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is whether the jurors could have found the essential elements of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution. On this record, they could. Today, we heed the guidance of the dissent in\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   that an appellate court is not to \"undertake[ ] a de novo review of the evidence using the typewritten transcript of the testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217927\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/646/904/\">\n    646 F.2d at 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ainsworth, J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 15.
