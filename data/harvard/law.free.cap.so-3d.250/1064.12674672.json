The plaintiff, Jean McKeogh, filed this suit against the following five defendants: (i) Michael O'Brien (\"Dr. O'Brien\"), an orthopedic surgeon; (ii) The Administrators of the Tulane Educational Fund, d/b/a Tulane University School of Medicine (\"Tulane EDU\"), Dr. O'Brien's employer; (iii) Robin Silverman (\"Ms. Silverman\"), a licensed physical therapist; (iv) University Healthcare System, L.C., d/b/a Tulane University Hospital &amp; Clinic (\"TUHC\"), Ms. Silverman's employer; and (v) Health Care Indemnity, Inc., Ms. Silverman's insurer. Two of the defendants, Dr. O'Brien and Tulane, filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted the motion. From that judgment, Ms. McKeogh appeals. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 5, 2014, Dr. O'Brien performed a total shoulder arthroplasty on Ms. McKeogh's left shoulder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. O'Brien saw Ms. McKeogh for her office visits, including her post-operative care, at the\n   Tulane Institute of Sports Medicine (\"TISM\"), an uptown satellite clinic of TUHC located on Tulane University's campus. As part of her post-operative care, Dr. O'Brien prescribed physical therapy. For convenience, Dr. O'Brien's patients frequently opted to have such prescribed therapy at TUHC's Physical Therapy Department (the \"PT Department\"), which was located in the same building as the TISM but in a separate suite. Ms. McKeogh opted to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 9, 2014, Ms. McKeogh returned to Dr. O'Brien and reported that she believed she was injured during physical therapy four days earlier. Dr. O'Brien ordered a CT Arthrogram of Ms. McKeogh's left shoulder, which was performed ten days later. The CT Arthrogram revealed a non-displaced fracture involving the coracoid process anteriorly. Ultimately, Ms. McKeogh developed a \"frozen shoulder\" and underwent a second surgical procedure on April 1, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ms. McKeogh filed a complaint requesting a medical review panel (\"MRP\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In her complaint, Ms. McKeogh's allegations regarding Dr. O'Brien were as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 Failure to properly communicate with and monitor SILVERMAN in the methods of physical therapy that she was applying to PETITIONER;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 Failure to ascertain that SILVERMAN was qualified to perform physical therapy manipulations on a person with a condition such as that which afflicted PETITIONER;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 Failure to exercise reasonable care to inform, instruct and train SILVERMAN in proper physical therapy methods to be applied to petitioner who had under gone a complex shoulder replacement procedure; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 Failure to use reasonable care and diligence in ascertaining the condition of PETITIONER post-surgery and determining [the] proper course of action in treating PETITIONER post-surgery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On February 23, 2016, the MRP rendered its opinion. As to Ms. Silverman, the MRP found the evidence supported the conclusion that she failed to meet the applicable standard of care, as alleged in the complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As to Dr. O'Brien, Tulane EDU, and TUHC, the MRP found that the evidence did not support the conclusion that they failed to meet the applicable standard of care, as alleged in the complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. McKeogh then commenced\n   this suit. In her petition, she repeated the allegations she made before the MRP, including that Dr. O'Brien and Tulane EDU were vicariously liable for Ms. Silverman's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 4, 2016, Dr. O'Brien and Tulane EDU filed a motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. O'Brien's motion for summary judgment was premised on the following two grounds: (i) Ms. McKeogh's lack of an expert to establish medical malpractice;\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (ii) her lack of evidence of an employer-employee relationship between him and Ms. Silverman to establish vicarious liability for Ms. Silverman's alleged malpractice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In opposing the motion, Ms. McKeogh acknowledged that she was not contending Dr. O'Brien's active negligence (medical malpractice) caused her injuries; however, she contended that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to Dr. O'Brien's right to control Ms. Silverman, precluding summary judgment on her vicarious liability claim against them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In support of their position that Ms. Silverman was not an employee of Tulane EDU, Dr. O'Brien offered the affidavit of Patricia Bethancourt, Tulane EDU's associate general counsel, and Dr. O'Brien's deposition testimony. In her affidavit, Ms. Bethancourt attested to the following facts regarding the legal relationships between the parties:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 [Tulane EDU] owns and operates the Tulane University School of Medicine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 [Tulane EDU] does not own or operate Tulane University Hospital and Clinic [the \"Hospital\"]. In 1995, the Hospital was sold to [TUHC]. Since 1995, [TUHC] has been a separate legal entity not under the control of [Tulane EDU].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Dr. Michael O'Brien is employed by [Tulane EDU].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 [Tulane EDU] does not own or operate [TUHC's PT Department] and does not employ the physical therapists. The physical therapists working at [TISM] are employed by [TUHC].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 Neither Dr. O'Brien nor [Tulane EDU] has any authority to hire, fire, train, or supervise employees of [TUHC] working in the [PT Department].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In his deposition, Dr. O'Brien echoed Ms. Bethancourt's attestations regarding the parties' legal relationships. Dr. O'Brien testified that he has an office where he sees patients both at Tulane Medical School downtown and at the TISM uptown. Dr. O'Brien explained that the TISM is owned by TUHC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In opposition to the motion for summary judgment, Ms. McKeogh offered the following evidence: two affidavits by Ms. McKeogh; an affidavit by an orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Thomas Lyons; an affidavit by a physical therapist, Dr. T. Kirk Nelson; and an affidavit by her attorney, Bernard Bagert, Jr.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, Dr. O'Brien filed a motion to exclude Ms. McKeogh's affidavits. As discussed elsewhere in this opinion, the only affidavit the trial court examined at the hearing was Dr. Lyons' affidavit, which the trial court excluded in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Following the hearing, the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment, giving the following oral reasons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Louisiana Civil Code Article 2320 imposes liability on the employer only for those acts of its employee which it might have prevented, not the acts of third parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The affidavit of Patricia Bethancourt, which was submitted, confirmed that [Tulane EDU] do[es] not operate TUHC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Miss McKeogh has not offered any evidence to rebut the testimony or the affidavit of Mrs. Bethancourt and Dr. O'Brien that the physical therapist Silverman was not an employee of [Tulane EDU].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Although Ms. McKeogh asserts numerous assignments of error, we find one dispositive-whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment. The summary judgment procedure is favored and \"is designed to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action ... and shall be construed to accomplish these ends.\" La.

Based on our\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, we find that Dr. O'Brien made a prima facie showing that there was an absence of factual support for an essential element of the vicarious liability claim. The burden thus was on Ms. McKeogh to produce evidence that a genuine issue of material fact remains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Ms. McKeogh contends that the trial court erred in failing to find that the evidence she submitted was sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact and that she met her burden. The gist of Ms. McKeogh's argument is that, despite Ms. Silverman's status as a payroll employee of a third party (TUHC),\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   sufficient evidence was presented to create a genuine\n   issue of material fact as to whether Dr. O'Brien had the right to control Ms. Silverman. The evidence Ms. McKeogh relies upon in support of her contention is three-fold-Dr. O'Brien's deposition testimony, her own affidavits, and Dr. Lyons' affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Dr. O'Brien's deposition\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Ms. McKeogh contends that the trial court erred in failing to consider Dr. O'Brien's statements in his deposition acknowledging his control over how Ms. Silverman performed her job. Viewed in context, Dr. O'Brien contends that his deposition testimony belies this contention. We agree. The full excerpts of Dr. O'Brien's testimony on which Ms. McKeogh relies are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \u2022 \"I don't really have supervision of their physical therapy. I'm never present. I'm not their boss. I'm not in charge of making sure the physical therapist is capable of performing the rehabilitation. So if you're asking would I abandon their supervision, I don't think I have the position of supervising the physical therapist because I never directly supervise them. I'm not there during their physical therapy visits.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \u2022 \"There's communication between the physicians and the therapists, especially if there are any challenges, whether it's a challenge in rehabilitation that the patient is experiencing or a new injury or a change in the rehab plan. Because we work in such close proximity, it would be common for a therapist to come speak with me or me go speak with a therapist because it's less than a minute away. That being said, it's not my job to micromanage the physical therapists. I trust that the physical therapists are all adequately trained, especially in the care of a postoperative orthopedic patient, that if I send an order with guidelines, I assume they will be able to follow those guidelines. So I don't try and micromanage the way that they do their exercises. If I find that a therapist is not doing what I ask, either too much or too little and a patient is unhappy with their progress in therapy, I will suggest that they go elsewhere for therapy. That's true whether if it's at TUHC or Ochsner or any private physical therapy office.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Dr. O'Brien's deposition testimony establishes that he lacked the authority to direct, control, or dismiss a physical therapist employed by a third party such as TUHC. As Dr. O'Brien contends, the only \"control\" that he had over the physical therapists working in TUHC's PT Department was to recommend his patients to another physical therapy center\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    Ms. McKeogh's affidavits\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In an attempt to establish Dr. O'Brien had control, Ms. McKeogh also cites two statements from her second affidavit. The first statement she cites is that \"[o]n May 5, 2015 [Ms. Silverman's] replies to my complaints and my request that she stop was 'I'm doing this because this is what Dr. O'Brien told me to do.' \" The\n   statement quoting what Ms. Silverman told Ms. McKeogh is hearsay. The hearsay exception in La. C.E. art. 801(D) for a statement offered against a party, which Ms. McKeogh cites, is inapplicable; the statement is Ms. Silverman's, not Dr. O'Brien's, statement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. C.E. art. 801(D)(2) (providing that \"[a] statement is not hearsay if: ... [t]he statement is offered against a party and is: (a) [h]is own statement\"). Although Ms. Silverman is a party to the suit, she is not a party to Dr. O'Brien's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The second statement Ms. McKeogh cites is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   After Dr. O'Brien finally realized that my shoulder bone had been fractured in physical therapy by Robin Silverman he stated: \"I didn't do this.\" He also stated \"I should have supervised Robin more closely.\" This clearly demonstrated that he exercised control over Robin Silverman and also possessed the right to exercise control over her treatment of me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Unlike the first statement, the second statement is Dr. O'Brien's alleged statement that he \"should have supervised Robin [Silverman] more closely.\" Even assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that the statement is competent summary judgment evidence,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   the statement is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact. The statement, at best, would create a genuine issue of fact on a claim of independent fault in supervising an employee; however, the claim Ms. McKeogh is asserting is a vicarious liability claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Frank L.

Galligan, Jr., LOUISIANA TORT LAW, \u00a7 13-2 (1996) (\"TORT LAW\") (noting \"it is important to distinguish between the employer's vicarious liability\n   and his independent fault in hiring, retaining or supervising an employee\"). In sum, the statement alone, without any evidence of an employer-employee relationship, is insufficient to create a triable issue of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Dr. Lyons' affidavit\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Ms. McKeogh contends that the physical proximity of the physician and the physical therapist is a fact that should be weighed in making the determination of control. Ms. McKeogh cites Dr. Lyons' affidavit for the proposition that a physician generally retains the right to control a physical therapist who works in the same location. In particular, she cites the following statement by Dr. Lyons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   [I]t is typical and customary for a treating orthopedist to retain the right to exercise control over the actions of the physical therapist when a patient is receiving physical therapy at the same location as the office of the treating orthopedist who both performed the surgery and ordered the physical therapy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Although Dr. Lyons' affidavit is devoid of any reference to the facts of this case, Ms. McKeogh emphasizes that Dr. O'Brien's office was only a few steps away from the location where Ms. Silverman injured her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. McKeogh's physical proximity argument is unpersuasive for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   First, at the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, the trial court expressly found that Dr. Lyons was not competent to make the statement regarding the legal relationship between Dr. O'Brien and Ms. Silverman. The trial court reasoned that although Dr. Lyons was qualified, as an expert, to testify as to the standard of care of other orthopedists in the area, he was not qualified to testify regarding the vicarious liability issue. Stated otherwise, the trial court reasoned that Dr. Lyons was not qualified to make a \"legal conclusion\"-a \"vicarious liability statement\"-regarding the relationship between a physical therapist and an orthopedic surgeon. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Second, Ms. McKeogh's physical proximity argument is not supported by the jurisprudence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hull v. Jefferson Par.Hosp.

WJMC had a contract with RehabCare for the services. The plaintiff contended that because WJMC provided the building, leased the space and equipment for the rehabilitation facility, and provided guidelines for staffing, it sufficiently controlled RehabCare such that Ms. Joseph was an employee of WJMC. The plaintiff also contended that WJMC, on its website, promoted the rehabilitation facility as being owned and operated\n   by WJMC and failed to disclose that it was staffed by a third party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Affirming the trial court's grant of WJMC's motion for summary judgment, the appellate court in\n   <em>\n    Hull\n   </em>\n   rejected the apparent authority argument and found that WJMC had produced sufficient evidence to establish that it was not vicariously liable for Ms. Joseph's negligent acts.\n   <em>\n    Hull\n   </em>\n   , 16-273 at p. 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12365320\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/220/838/\">\n    220 So.3d at 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As in\n   <em>\n    Hull\n   </em>\n   , we reject Ms. McKeogh's apparent authority argument based on the mere physical proximity of Dr. O'Brien's office and TUHC's PT Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In sum, none of the evidence Ms. McKeogh relies upon is sufficient to controvert the evidence that Dr. O'Brien submitted, establishing the lack of an employment relationship between him and Ms. Silverman. Ms. Silverman is a physical therapist who was employed by another party, TUHC, not by Dr. O'Brien or his employer, Tulane EDU. Dr. O'Brien had no supervisory role over Ms. Silverman; Dr. O'Brien could not hire, fire, train, supervise, or otherwise direct Ms. Silverman's actions. As Dr. O'Brien contends, Ms. McKeogh's vicarious liability claim is premised on a misunderstanding of the legal relationship of the parties. Dr. O'Brien thus established the lack of a genuine issue of material fact, entitling him to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DECREE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the trial court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    An arthroplasty is a \"surgical operation to repair a joint, to replace a joint.\" P.H.
