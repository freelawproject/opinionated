We hold that the defendant\n   was deprived of effective assistance of counsel in this case, given the documented evidence of repeated abuse the victim perpetrated upon the defendant before his death. We therefore reverse the court of appeal, vacate the defendant's conviction and sentence, and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Renaldo and Catina Curley, married for approximately nine and a half years, lived in a New Orleans residence with their children: Renaldo Boykin, Renaldo Curley's son from a prior relationship; Develon and Brittany Espadron, Catina Curley's children from a prior relationship; and April and Devon Curley, the couple's biological children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   At trial, the state presented the testimony of seven witnesses, and the defense called 13 witnesses, including defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The evidence revealed that, on March 30, 2005, the evening of the shooting, the victim and defendant were living apart in a temporary separation. Defendant had been living with her mother for several days while the victim remained in the family's home with their children. That evening, the victim was at the home with four of the children, defendant's cousin, and a neighbor. Defendant testified that she called her house to check on her children, and spoke on the phone with one of her children, Brittany. After hearing from Brittany about the presence of guests, she returned home, entered, and ordered the cousin and neighbor to leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After the cousin and neighbor left, defendant proceeded upstairs to retrieve clothes from her second floor bedroom. The victim followed her upstairs and subjected her to verbal and physical violence, including arguing and cursing at her, throwing a soda can at her, and threatening additional violence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   At some point, the victim left the bedroom and returned to the downstairs living room. Soon after, defendant also went downstairs, but before doing so, she armed herself with a handgun the victim kept under their mattress. She testified that she needed the weapon to protect herself. The exit door was located somewhere near the foot of the stairwell, but defendant had apparently placed her car keys on a table in the living room when she entered the home. There are varying accounts of what happened next, but there is no dispute that the weapon in defendant's hand ultimately discharged, sending a single bullet into the victim's chest and killing him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The State indicted Curley for second degree murder on August 4, 2005. La. R.S. 14:30.1(A)(1). At her arraignment, she pleaded not guilty, but subsequently withdrew her former plea and entered a dual plea of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity (NGBRI). As a result of Hurricane Katrina, Curley's trial was delayed. In February 2007, two days before trial was to commence, Curley's new post-Katrina counsel, John Fuller, appeared in court with Curley present, withdrew the dual plea, and entered a plea of not guilty. Despite extensive testimonial and documentary\n   evidence regarding abuse the victim perpetrated upon defendant, trial counsel did not educate himself on the method by which BWS evidence should be introduced at trial, nor did he consult with an expert or seek to introduce expert testimony regarding BWS and its effects. Instead, trial counsel presented alternative theories of justification and accidental discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Though testimony regarding the facts of what transpired on the night of the shooting was disputed, there was no such confusion with respect to the physical abuse the victim perpetrated upon defendant over a period of many years. The defense presented testimonial and documentary evidence of multiple prior instances of physical abuse. Among other testimony, New Orleans Police Department Detective Scott Melia testified to at least six police reports detailing domestic violence dating back to 1995 involving defendant and the victim and, in one instance, one of the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defense counsel called Brittany Espadron, defendant's biological daughter and the victim's stepdaughter. She testified that she could not count how many times she had seen the victim hit defendant and Renaldo Boykin. Brittany also indicated that the victim had beaten her and her little brother Devon in the past and had also choked her. Devon Curley, the biological son of defendant and the victim, who was \"nine or ten years old\" when the shooting occurred, testified that he had seen and heard about the victim hitting both defendant and Renaldo Boykin in the past. Further, the victim had hit him and \"slammed\" him \"a lot.\" Devon also used the phrase \"a lot\" when he was asked how often the victim beat defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Herman Benton, defendant's former supervisor at Walmart, where defendant worked from approximately 2002-2005, testified that defendant called in \"numerous times\" to say she could not come to work. Benton recalled one particular incident when he required defendant to come in to prove why she could not be at work that day. When she showed up, defendant had what Benton described as \"trauma\" to her entire facial area; her forehead, eyes, and cheeks were all swollen. Defendant described to him that she had been involved in a physical altercation with her husband. Without detailing them specifically, Benton further testified that he had observed defendant with other facial injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Finally, defendant herself testified and detailed the abuse she suffered at the hands of the victim. She described that the victim had broken her nose in 2002 or 2003 while she was working at Walmart. The broken nose caused bruises to both sides of her face, blackened her eyes, and caused them to swell shut. She also described that the victim once threw her to the ground and kicked her in the shoulder, dislocating it. She stated that the victim would not let her report or seek treatment for this injury, blocking the door and pulling the phone out of the wall, and she still suffered from shoulder problems at the time of trial. Defendant further described a particular incident where the victim allegedly tried to push her from a moving car.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant testified that she could not always call the police when the victim abused her because the victim would sometimes break the phone or keep her from leaving the house. Therefore, she stated that the police reports did not tell of every time the victim abused her. Defendant indicated that she stayed with the victim because she loved him and had a desire to make their marriage work despite her belief that he had a \"sickness.\" She indicated that she had tried to leave in the past but always ended up returning, though the beatings were beginning to become \"overwhelming.\" While defendant admitted that she sometimes fought back to defend herself from the victim, she estimated that he was the aggressor 95% of the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Only a single witness testified that the victim never abused defendant: Renaldo Boykin, the victim's biological son and defendant's stepson, who was 12 years old at the time of the shooting. Despite the testimony set forth above to the contrary, Boykin stated that he had never witnessed nor known the victim to hit defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After a multi-day trial, an Orleans Parish jury returned a verdict of guilty as charged, and the trial court sentenced defendant to life imprisonment at hard labor \"without benefit.\" The court of appeal affirmed the conviction and sentence.\n   <em>\n    State v. Curley\n   </em>\n   , 08-1157 (La.

The district court held a hearing where defendant's trial counsel, John Fuller, testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Most of the testimony at the post-conviction hearing related to Fuller's withdrawal of defendant's NGBRI plea. Fuller admitted that he did not consult with defendant before withdrawing the NGBRI plea. He testified that he withdrew the NGBRI plea based on his belief that an insanity defense was suggestive of a \"paranoid schizophrenic or whatever.\" He stated that he did not \"take into account relative to a not guilty by reason of insanity [plea] the opportunity to present a battered spouse expert.\" He further testified that he was unaware of prohibitions of introducing certain types of psychological evidence absent a NGBRI plea, and thought that the NGBRI plea was \"inappropriate for a self-defense defense.\" Related to the self-defense claim he ultimately pursued, Fuller testified that he did not know that he could introduce expert testimony concerning BWS under a \"not guilty\" plea at all. Putting aside funding issues, he confessed to \"ignorance\" related to a BWS expert. He also believed a self-defense claim based on a prior history of abuse was \"obvious\" and that, in retrospect, \"I should have talked to or at least conferred with a battered spouse expert.\" He stated that the \"twelve years worth of abuse\" that defendant suffered was \"probably the worst [he'd] ever seen,\" so he found no reason at the time to consult an expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The trial judge, who also presided over Curley's original trial, granted relief and ordered a new trial, reasoning that BWS evidence is admissible to refute specific intent only when raised under a NGBRI plea.

It found Fuller's decision to withdraw the NGBRI plea to be a strategic decision. The court also found that defendant failed to demonstrate prejudice under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   by making a showing that \"even had counsel not withdrawn the plea and had hired an expert in battered wife syndrome, that expert would have found that respondent suffered from that syndrome to the extent that it negated her ability to distinguish right from wrong.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Finally, trial counsel failed to consider how expert testimony would prove helpful to defendant's case, failing to investigate any use of an expert to contextualize the vast amount of testimony regarding the abuse in this case.

Specifically, this case presents as a terrible tragedy, which is far too common. A person is dead. The defendant faces a lengthy prison term. There was evidence of domestic abuse. Such abuse is never acceptable. These propositions rightly invoke a desire to do something to change whatever can be changed in this tragic situation, but these propositions do not and cannot result in putting aside the single legal issue with which this court is now presented: whether the defendant met the substantial burden of proof imposed in her post-conviction proceeding after being convicted by a jury that heard the evidence, including the testimony of the defendant herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The crux of the defendant's argument is that she received ineffective assistance of counsel because her attorney failed to investigate and present an expert on domestic violence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The law is well established that \"claims alleging a deficiency in attorney performance are subject to a general requirement that the defendant affirmatively prove prejudice.\"\n   <strong>\n    Strickland v.

While laden with potential contradictions to the self-defense theory, the defense also presented the theory that the defendant did not point the gun at her husband, but that, instead, the gun accidentally discharged and her husband was struck by the bullet after it ricocheted off the floor. From all that appears, the ricochet theory was not the product of counsel's strategy, but was presented mainly through the defendant's own trial testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In stark contrast to either defense theory, the jury was presented with eyewitness testimony from the decedent's son that the defendant had not been abused and had pointed the gun at the decedent. Additionally, forensic evidence established that the bullet entered the decedent at an angle that was not the result of a ricochet and that, in the room where the shooting occurred, no evidence was ever found of the bullet striking anything other than the decedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   While the defendant remained adamant that she had the gun pointed downward\n   when it fired, the state rebutted the defendant's ricochet claim at trial by presenting testimony that a strike mark would have been visible on the vinyl tiles located in the residence where the shooting occurred. No strike marks were found. Further evidence indicated the projectile recovered from the decedent's body had only \"mild deformity,\" that the coroner testified came from striking a single rib of the decedent, not from a ricochet. Additionally, the coroner described the bullet's trajectory as level with the floor, further undermining the defendant's ricochet theory due to an accidental discharge. In sum, the unbiased forensic evidence undermined the defendant's accidental discharge testimony. The forensic evidence was corroborated by a witness, the decedent's son, who unequivocally testified that the defendant pointed the weapon directly at her husband and then the gun \"went off.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   According to the court of appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   [The defendant] recounted that the gun was loaded when she withdrew it from under the mattress. She denied loading the weapon and could not explain the presence of bullets on the bedroom floor when the police arrived. Also, she said she never pointed the gun at [her husband]; rather, she maintained that all the while [her husband] approached her, she kept the gun pointed at the floor. Finally, she said she received $25,000.00 in life insurance proceeds after the victim's death.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    State v.
