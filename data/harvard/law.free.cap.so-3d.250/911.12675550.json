On an unspecified date in 1996, Relator filed an application for post-conviction relief in the trial court. On June 21, 1996, the trial court denied Relator's application as untimely. In response to Relator's request for review, this court granted Relator's writ, finding the trial court erred in denying his application for post-conviction relief as untimely.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In response to this court's orders, the trial court held an evidentiary hearing on September 19, 1997, on Relator's applications for post-conviction relief filed in June and November 1996. At the hearing, the trial court denied all of Relator's claims asserted in those applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At this same hearing, however, the trial court heard arguments on Relator's motion to correct an illegally lenient sentence. Relator argued his habitual offender sentence was illegal since he was not advised of his rights before admitting to his status as a habitual offender. On that particular issue, the trial court granted Relator relief and advised the District Attorney, if he desired, to re-file the habitual offender bill and reschedule a hearing on the bill. On March 24, 1998, a habitual offender hearing was again held and Relator was adjudicated a habitual offender. On April 2, 1998, he was sentenced to one hundred years at hard labor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The motion was denied on March 13, 2017, as repetitive and without merit. On January 24, 2017, Relator filed a \"Motion to Clarify Sentence,\" wherein he claimed that because the federal court ruled that the 1998 habitual offender sentence was not a valid sentence, he does not know whether he is serving the 1991 sentence or the 1998 sentence. The trial court denied the motion as being without merit. On March 2, 2017, Relator filed a \"Supplemental Motion to Correct an Illegal Sentence Imposed under La.R.S. 15:529.1 the Habitual Offender Law,\" wherein he asserted that the bill of information which resulted in the conviction for attempted second degree murder was defective and that after the federal district court acquitted him of one of the convictions, the federal court judge failed to remand to the district court for reconsideration of the remaining sentence; therefore, he did not have the opportunity to present mitigating factors to reduce the sentence.

As noted above, the 1992 habitual offender adjudication was vacated in 1998, which served to vacate the sentence, and Relator was resentenced to one hundred years as a second time habitual offender. There was no conflict between the rulings of this court, the Supreme Court, and the federal court. We find there is no merit to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    March 2, 2017, \"Supplemental Motion to Correct an Illegal Sentence Imposed under La.R.S. 15:529.1 the Habitual Offender Law.\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In his supplemental motion to correct an illegal sentence, Relator argued that after the federal court acquitted him of one of the convictions, it failed to remand the matter to the trial court for reconsideration of the remaining sentence. Accordingly, he was not afforded the opportunity to present mitigating factors in support of a reduction of the sentence. He further argued that the sentence was constitutionally excessive in that it was cruel and unusual punishment considering the circumstances of his case. Finally, he argued that the 1990 bill of information was defective in that it described as an element of the offense the specific intent to inflict serious bodily harm, whereas attempted second degree murder requires proof of specific intent to kill rather than inflict bodily harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As noted above, an illegal sentence is a sentence that was not authorized by law. While a claim of an illegal sentence may be heard at any time, Relator's sentence was a sentence that was authorized by law. At the time of the offense, second degree murder was punishable by life imprisonment, at hard labor, without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. La.R.S. 14:30.1. The attempt statute provided that \"If the offense so attempted is punishable by death or life imprisonment, he shall be imprisoned at hard labor for not more than fifty years.\" La.R.S. 14:27 (D)(1). Relator was adjudicated a second felony offender. Pursuant to the Habitual Offender Law, in pertinent part, as it existed at the time of the offense:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   If the second felony is such that upon a first conviction the offender would be punishable by imprisonment for any term less than his natural life, then the sentence to imprisonment shall be for a determinate term not less than one-half the longest term and not more than\n   twice the longest term prescribed for a first conviction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   La.R.S. 15:529.1(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Relator's sentence was a legally imposed sentence. Accordingly, his claims are in the nature of an application for post-conviction relief and, thus, are untimely filed, and Relator has not provided an exception to the time limitation. La.Code Crim.P. art. 930.8. Furthermore, the excessiveness of the sentence was addressed on appeal, and the sentence was not found to be excessive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hall,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7494981\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/606/972/\">\n    606 So.2d 972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As for the defective bill of information, Relator attached a copy of the bill, and it does not state that specific intent to inflict serious bodily harm was an element of the offense of attempted second degree murder. However, on appeal, it was revealed that when the trial court instructed the jury as to elements of the crime, it listed as an element of attempted second degree murder specific intent to kill or inflict serious bodily harm. This court found the error harmless in the case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7494981\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/606/972/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the claims were untimely filed and repetitive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In each motion discussed above, we find no error in the trial court's rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISPOSITION\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     WRIT DENIED\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n   In Relator's February 2, 2017, \"Motion to Correct an Illegal Sentence,\" Relator's claim that the trial court failed to advise him of his right to remain silent at the habitual offender's hearing was addressed by the trial court on September 19, 1997.

Accordingly, this claim was repetitive. The remaining claim that the 1991 and 1998 bills of information were defective was not a claim cognizable as an illegal sentence claim. The claim was in the nature of an application for post-conviction relief and thus untimely filed, and Relator did not provide an exception to time limitation for filing for post-conviction relief.

Accordingly, Relator's claim of illegal sentence was in the nature of an application for post-conviction relief and thus, untimely filed, and Relator did not provide an exception to time limitation for filing for post-conviction relief.
