Robert and Nicole Armbruster, a married couple, and two companies controlled by Mr. Armbruster-F.I.N.S. Construction, LLC (\"FINS\"); and Celeste Developer, LLC (\"Developer\")-are the Plaintiffs. Steven Anderson and four companies controlled by Mr. Anderson-Cambrie Celeste, LLC (\"Celeste\"); Cambrie Partners I, LLC (\"Partners\"); Cambrie Celeste Commercial Tenant, LLC (\"Tenant\"); and Avalon Re: Partners, LLC (\"Avalon\")-are the Defendants. From the trial court's judgment granting the Defendants' peremptory exception of res judicata and dismissing the suit, the Plaintiffs appeal. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Anderson is a property developer who specializes in the use of tax credits to develop properties. Mr. Armbruster is a contractor. Together, Mr. Armbruster and Mr. Anderson, through various companies that they respectively control, have engaged in numerous real estate and construction ventures. The ventures jointly entered into by Mr. Anderson and Mr. Armbruster have spawned much litigation. The joint venture that gave rise to the instant litigation involved a project to rehabilitate property located at 621 Celeste Street in New Orleans, Louisiana (the \"Property\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Briefly summarized, the factual background of the venture is as follows. On March 21, 2006, pursuant to an act of cash\n   sale, Religious and Celeste, LLC (\"R &amp; C\"), an entity co-owned by the Armbrusters,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   acquired the Property for $1,480,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   R &amp; C ultimately intended to develop the Property, in multiple phases, into mixed used commercial, retail, and residential space. The first phase of R &amp; C's development plans was to rehabilitate the building located on the Property, which at the time of acquisition was a three-story shell in poor condition. R &amp; C used FINS-Mr. Armbruster's construction company-to perform the work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   R &amp; C also began the process of applying for historic tax credits (\"HTC\") for the rehabilitation project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   R &amp; C financed the rehabilitation project by obtaining from Omni Bank (\"Omni\") two loans, totaling $2,872,000, which the Armbrusters personally guaranteed. R &amp; C defaulted on the Omni loans, and Omni commenced a foreclosure action on June 10, 2009. To avoid foreclosure, Mr. Armbruster, acting as R &amp; C's representative, entered into a deal with Mr. Anderson and two of his companies, Avalon and Celeste. The deal, as ultimately closed, encompassed two steps. Collectively, these two steps are referred to as the \"Transaction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The first step of the Transaction was an act of cash sale, executed on December 29, 2009, by which R &amp; C transferred title to the Property to Celeste subject to the Omni mortgage. The second step of the Transaction occurred on March 22, 2010, when Celeste assumed R &amp; C's Omni debt. As part of the Transaction, Mr. Armbruster and Mr. Anderson, through their respective companies, also entered into various other agreements, including a lease (the \"Lease\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Lease was an integral part of the second step of the Transaction. According to the Defendants, the parties entered into a New Markets Tax Credit (\"NMTC\") transaction to obtain a low market loan to refinance the existing debt on the Property. In order for the NMTC transaction to close, the Property had to be leased. On March 22, 2010, Celeste leased to Tenant the commercial component of the Property. On that same date, Celeste, Tenant, and Starboard Management, LLC (\"Starboard\"), a company owned by the Armbrusters, entered into the Lease. Under the Lease, Starboard rented the residential component of the Property from Celeste and the commercial component from Tenant. Contemporaneously, the Armbrusters, FINS, and Developer (collectively the \"Guarantors\") executed an agreement to guarantee Starboard's obligations under the Lease (the \"Guaranty\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   About three months after the second step of the Transaction, on June 2, 2010, R &amp; C filed a petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 1, 2012, Celeste and Tenant (the lessors) filed in Louisiana state court a cumulated\n   action for eviction and breach of contract against Starboard and the Guarantors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In response, on March 29, 2012, R &amp; C filed an adversary proceeding in the Bankruptcy Case against Mr. Anderson, Celeste, Partners, and Avalon (the \"Adversary Proceeding\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The gist of R &amp; C's claims in the Adversary Proceeding was that the documents executed in connection with the Transaction did not accurately memorialize the deal it had made with Mr. Anderson and that instead Mr. Anderson had defrauded R &amp; C with respect to the Transaction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The relief R &amp; C requested was to have the Bankruptcy Court void the Transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In March and April 2013, a seven-day trial was held in the Adversary Proceeding. On April 11, 2014, the Bankruptcy Court's Judgment was issued, dismissing R &amp; C's claims. On August 11, 2014, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana affirmed the Bankruptcy Court's Judgment, stating: \"[i]nsofar as the core proceedings are concerned, the Court finds that the ruling of the Bankruptcy Court is not clearly erroneous; as to all other claims, the Court finds no error of fact or law on this record, and accepts the Bankruptcy Court's proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, overruling objections to the same.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the conclusion of the trial in the Adversary Proceeding, the stay of the Eviction case was lifted in July of 2013. During the following three years of litigation of the Eviction Case, Starboard was summarily evicted and held in contempt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 27, 2016, the trial court granted a motion for summary judgment filed by Celeste and Tenant and rendered judgment against Starboard and the Guarantors in the amount of $1,614,941.69, representing past due rent and damages. Starboard and the Guarantors appealed. On November 6, 2017, this court affirmed the trial court's judgment granting summary judgment as to Starboard only; however, as to the Guarantors, this court reversed the trial court's judgment granting summary judgment and remanded for further proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Cambrie Celeste LLC v.

In their petition,\n   the Plaintiffs set forth in detail the facts of the Transaction and alleged that Mr. Anderson and the other defendants-companies owned and controlled by Mr. Anderson-drafted and fraudulently induced Mr. Armbruster, on behalf of the other plaintiffs, to execute six specific agreements (the \"Anderson Documents\") in a complex scheme to enable the Defendants to obtain lucrative tax credits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Through the petition, the Plaintiffs sought to rescind the Anderson Documents. In the alternative to rescinding the Anderson Documents, the Plaintiffs sought damages for bad faith breach of contract and unfair trade practices. In response, the Defendants filed an exception of res judicata. On June 7, 2017, the trial court rendered judgment granting the Defendants' exception of res judicata and dismissing with prejudice the Plaintiffs' claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Although the Defendants assert multiple assignments of error,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   the dispositive issue is whether the trial court erred in granting the Defendants' peremptory exception of res judicata.

The federal judgment was rendered on August 11, 2014, by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, which affirmed\n   the Bankruptcy Court's Judgment in the Adversary Proceeding (the \"Bankruptcy Court's Judgment\").

Cir. 2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The claims R &amp; C asserted in the Adversary Proceeding involve the same transaction and occurrence at issue here. As the Defendants contend, the Plaintiffs are asserting, in this case, the same argument-that the actual \"deal\" involved in the Transaction was different than what is reflected in all the documents that they actually executed. The Plaintiffs also are seeking the same relief that R &amp; C sought in the Adversary Proceeding-to void the Transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Plaintiffs' attempt to divorce the Anderson Documents from the Transaction addressed by the Bankruptcy Court's Judgment is unpersuasive. In the Bankruptcy Court's Judgment, the contours of the Transaction were expressly noted to include all the documents executed in connection with both steps of the Transaction-all the December 2009 and March 2010 closing documents. The Bankruptcy Court, in its judgment, expressed this point as follows: \"[b]ecause the [T]ransaction consisted of both these steps, the use of [the] terms 'transfer' or 'transaction' in this opinion shall be construed [to] include all of the documents executed on December 29, 2009 and on March 22, 2010, unless otherwise specified.\" The Bankruptcy Court's Judgment thus encompassed the entire Transaction, including the Anderson Documents executed on those dates. The requirement that both actions involve the same cause of action is thus met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In sum, all four federal res judicata requirements are met here. Nonetheless, the Plaintiffs contend-implicitly relying on a jurisprudential exception to res judicata\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   -that the Bankruptcy Court\n   was without subject matter jurisdiction over their claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support, the Plaintiffs cite\n   <em>\n    Stern\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ., for the proposition that a bankruptcy court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over claims that \"do not relate to the bankruptcy estate.\" The Plaintiffs' reliance on the\n   <em>\n    Stern\n   </em>\n   case is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Plaintiffs' argument generally conflates a bankruptcy court's subject matter jurisdiction with its constitutional authority to hear and decide cases. The Supreme Court, in the\n   <em>\n    Stern\n   </em>\n   case, however, observed that whether a bankruptcy court has subject matter jurisdiction over a matter is a different issue than whether a bankruptcy court has the statutory authority to decide a matter and to enter a final order and judgment on that matter.\n   <em>\n    Stern\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450496,4332163\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/462/\">\n    564 U.S. at 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450496,6049563,4332163\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2594/\">\n    131 S.Ct. at 2607-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (observing that \"allocation [of core and non-core proceedings] does not implicate questions of subject matter jurisdiction\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Here, the Plaintiffs, in their petition for declaratory judgment, seek to rescind the Anderson Documents, which would, in effect, rescind the Transaction. The Plaintiffs' contention that their claims are not related to the Bankruptcy Case and that the Bankruptcy Court thus lacked subject matter jurisdiction over their claims is unpersuasive. As the federal district court's judgment in the Adversary Proceeding demonstrates, the Bankruptcy Court had subject matter jurisdiction over all matters related to the Transaction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Plaintiffs' implicit attempt to invoke an exception to the federal res judicata doctrine is unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In summary, all the requirements for res judicata are met; none of the exceptions to the res judicata doctrine apply.

A bankruptcy judge's jurisdiction over a non-core \"related\" claim is not limited in the sense of that section. Section 26(1)(c) applies to limitations on the types of theories, remedies, or relief available if a claim is brought in a particular forum. But bringing a non-core \"related\" claim before a bankruptcy judge does not in any way limit the available theories, remedies, or relief.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Celotex Corp. v.

A bankruptcy judge is perfectly capable of recommending, and the district court of awarding, judgment based on any theory, remedy, or relief, just as if the claim had been brought originally before a district court, or even a state court of general jurisdiction, outside of a bankruptcy proceeding.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
