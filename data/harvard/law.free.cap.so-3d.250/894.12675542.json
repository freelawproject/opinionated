Trial is currently scheduled for September 14, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant was arraigned on August 8, 2016, for operating a vehicle while intoxicated, a violation of La.R.S. 14:98. On November 17, 2016, Defendant filed a \"Motion to Suppress Evidence,\" a \"Supplemental Motion to Suppress Evidence with Incorporated Memorandum,\" and a \"Notice of Objection to the Introduction of the State's Crime Lab Certificates into Evidence as Prima Facie Proof of the Assertions Contained Therein.\" Hearings were held on May 11 and 15, 2017, to address all the issues raised in the above three pleadings. The trial court granted Defendant's motions to suppress the blood/alcohol results and the statements made by defendant to the investigating Louisiana state troopers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The State of Louisiana now seeks review of the trial court's rulings. The issues raised are whether Defendant's verbal consent for the blood/alcohol test was valid and whether the statements were freely and voluntarily made. For the following reasons, we find that the trial court erred when it granted Defendant's motions to suppress the evidence. Accordingly, this court grants and makes peremptory the State's writ, vacates the trial court's ruling, and remands the matter for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 6, 2016, Defendant was involved in a single vehicle accident in Jefferson Davis Parish. He was injured and subsequently taken by a medical helicopter to a hospital in Lafayette. At the hospital, Defendant gave statements to Louisiana State Trooper John Sims. Defendant also consented to a blood/alcohol test that showed he was over the legal limit. Defendant\n   was arrested and charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    EVIDENCE ADDUCED AT MAY 11, 2017 MOTION HEARING\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   John Sims and Scott O'Connell, troopers with the Louisiana State Police, testified at the hearing, and several documents were introduced by the State and Defendant, which are attached as exhibits to the State's writ application:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   State's Exhibit 1: Arrestee's Rights Form, Rights Relating to Chemical Test for Intoxication.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   State's Exhibit 2: Notice to Withdraw Blood for Chemical Test for Intoxication.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   State's Exhibit 3 and Defense's Exhibit 3: \"Optional Test.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   State's Exhibit 4: \"Initial Observation\" and the traffic citation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   State's Exhibits 5 and 6: Blood/alcohol test kit containing \"Consent Form.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Defense's Exhibit 1: \"Certificate of Arrest.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Defense's Exhibit 2: \"Certificate of Authenticity\" and the ambulance service records.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Trooper Sims testified that he was requested by Trooper O'Connell, who remained at the scene of the accident, to go to the hospital and interview Defendant and to begin the necessary paper work. Trooper Sims stated that when he first encountered Defendant, he could smell the odor of alcohol. Defendant's eyes were bloodshot and his speech was slurred. Trooper Sims determined there was probable cause to arrest Defendant for operating a vehicle while intoxicated. The trooper testified that Defendant was conscious and coherent. Trooper Sims stated he gave Defendant the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings prior to questioning him. The trooper contended that Defendant gave him verbal consent to do a blood/alcohol test and that Defendant acknowledged the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights he was giving up and voluntarily admitted he had three glasses of crown and coke prior to driving. The trooper stated he would not have had blood drawn if Defendant had not consented but would have obtained a warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Trooper Sims admitted that when he arrived at the hospital he was not advised as to the extent of Defendant's injuries. He agreed, however, that Defendant had significant injuries. He described the observable injures being to Defendant's head, face, neck, and back. He was not aware of any medications the hospital might have administered to Defendant. Although the trooper testified that he wrote in Defendant's answers to the questions on State's Exhibit 3, \"Optional Test,\" he did not remember if he had made the note on the form that stated Defendant was incoherent. Later, however, the trooper explained that when he wrote \"incoherent,\" he meant that while Defendant could understand the questions, he had difficulty understanding what Defendant was saying. Trooper Sims agreed that on any of the forms that required Defendant's signature, Defendant did not sign the forms. The trooper contended that although Defendant was unable to sign the forms, he gave verbal consent. When asked why Defendant could not sign the forms, the trooper responded only that Defendant was injured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Senior Trooper O'Connell arrived at the hospital later in the morning. He testified that he spoke with Defendant and asked him to relate what occurred that caused the accident. The trooper stated that Defendant said he was driving his passenger home from a party. Trooper O'Connell said that Defendant was conscious. He noted that he could smell alcohol and that Defendant's speech was slurred, but the trooper was not sure if Defendant's bloodshot eyes\n   were caused by alcohol or by the accident. The trooper testified that at the time he spoke with Defendant he was unaware that Defendant's face, jaw, and neck had multiple fractures or of what medication may have been given to Defendant at the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The State attempted to call the nurse who drew Defendant's blood for the blood/alcohol test. The State advised the trial court it desired to show that a qualified person had drawn Defendant's blood as required by La.R.S. 32:664. However, the trial court ruled that the nurse's testimony regarding her qualifications were irrelevant to a motion to suppress. The State and Defendant agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Finally, Defendant submitted the EMT's report and noted for the trial court's consideration where on the EMT's record the notation was made that Defendant suffered \"Altered Level of Consciousness\" and that he was not able to sign the consent form for treatment because of \"[n]eurological condition limits ability to sign.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On May 11, 2017, at the hearing, the trial court granted Defendant's motions to suppress the blood/alcohol results, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   I mean, the officers were-were very honest and they stated, you know-O'Connell didn't-you know, he was very honest and so was Officer Sims. They were very honest in their statements, and Officer Sims said I don't remember what happened.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   But concerns the Court-and the officers were not aware of the-of the level of unconsciousness of the defendant at the time of the accident, okay, and that because of neurological reasons he couldn't sign, that he had injuries to the mouth and face which Officer Sims noted. Neither officer knew what medication the defendant was on at the time of the voluntary consent form. But those are all questions to me, and based on that, I-I've got to say the consent form is not free and voluntary. This should have been a warrant from-the judge would have signed a warrant and got the permission to draw the blood, okay, under this type of an injury, all right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On May 15, 2017, the trial court reconvened the suppression hearing for the purpose of granting Defendant's motion to suppress the statements he made for the above stated reasons and further stated that Defendant \"was mirandized prior to giving his consent which I said was not free and voluntary. Therefore, I cannot find that he fully understood the Miranda right and that [sic] he was waiving.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The issues before this court are whether Defendant fully understood his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and therefore knowingly and intelligently waived his rights, and whether his consent for a blood/alcohol test was freely and voluntarily given. In the State's Brief in support of the writ, the State argues that the trial court erred when it granted Defendant's motions to suppress the results of the blood/alcohol test and the statements made to the two troopers as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [T]he testimonial evidence of the State Troopers prove that the defendant Newson was conscious, coherent, and able to understand waiving his rights, and give intelligent answers to all of the questions posed to him. The only evidence introduced by the defense to refute their conclusion on consent and waiver were the Acadian Ambulance records indicating that the defendant was in an \"altered level of consciousness\" and \"alert but confused\" at 01:27 hours,\n   <strong>\n    approximately 3 hours before he gave Trooper Sims consent to draw blood at 03:41 hours.\n   </strong>\n   There was\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   evidence introduced\n   to prove that the defendant was unconscious or unable to give consent at the time he was met by the troopers at the hospital.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In his motion to suppress the blood/alcohol results, Defendant argued that the Trooper should have applied for a warrant to conduct the blood/alcohol test because of Defendant's diminished mental capacity caused by his injuries. Defendant further argued that for the same reason he did not knowingly and intelligently waive his privilege against self-incrimination. Accordingly, the statements Defendant made and the blood/alcohol test should be suppressed. Defendant repeats those arguments in opposition to the State's writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State asserts in brief that the trial court erroneously based its decision on the above two cited United States Supreme Court cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that the natural metabolization of alcohol in the bloodstream did not present a per se exigency that justified an exception to the Fourth Amendment requirement for a warrantless blood testing. The State is not arguing a \"per se exigency\" was involved in this case, but rather that the consent defendant gave for the blood drawn was voluntary. The State further argues that\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   is inapposite to the current case because in\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   the defendant refused to give consent. There were three defendants in\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   . One of the defendants, Mr. Beylund, consented to the blood/alcohol test because he was told he did not have the right to refuse and if he did, his license would be suspended and he would be fined in an administrative proceeding. In\n   <em>\n    Birchfield,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Supreme Court, while addressing how the \"search-incident-to-arrest\" doctrine applied to blood tests, stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Unlike the other petitioners, Beylund was not prosecuted for refusing a test. He submitted to a blood test after police told him that the law required his submission, and his license was then suspended and he was fined in an administrative proceeding. The North Dakota Supreme Court held that Beylund's consent was voluntary on the erroneous assumption that the State could permissibly\n   compel both blood and breath tests. Because voluntariness of consent to a search must be \"determined by the totality of all the circumstances,\"\n   <em>\n    Schneckloth, supra\n   </em>\n   , at 227,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172008\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/218/\">\n    93 S.Ct. 2041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   we leave it to the state court on remand to reevalutate Beylund's consent given the partial inaccuracy of the officer's advisory.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Supreme Court noted specifically that \"[o]ur prior opinions have referred approvingly to the general concept of implied consent laws that impose civil penalties and evidentiary consequences on motorists who refuse to comply.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2185. The Supreme Court, however, further stated that \"motorists cannot be deemed to have consented to submit to a blood test on pain of committing a criminal offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2186.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The form Trooper Sims read to Defendant indicated that he had the right to refuse the test but if he did, he would be fined and his license would be revoked for a year. The form also indicated that a refusal\n   <strong>\n    could\n   </strong>\n   constitute a crime. If\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   is retroactively applicable to Defendant's case, the State suggests that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies, as discussed in depth below. However, while the trial court acknowledged the holding in\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , the trial court did not indicate that it relied on\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   to support its ruling to exclude the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In the current case, Defendant's primary argument was that because his injuries resulted in diminished mental capacity, he was not capable of giving consent; thus, the State should have obtained a warrant. The trial court's May 11, 2017, ruling was based on Defendant's alleged inability to consent due to the extent of the injuries as described during the suppression hearing and the fact that the troopers both testified that they did not know what medications, if any, were administered to Defendant at the hospital. The trial court further noted that while Defendant was deemed incapable of signing any of the forms giving consent for the blood/alcohol test or indicating his understanding and acknowledgement of the wavier of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights with his signature, there was no explanation of why he was unable to sign the forms. The only explanation pointed out by Defendant was the notation in the EMT's records that Defendant suffered an altered level of consciousness three hours earlier at the scene of the accident and that a neurological condition limited his ability to sign.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   While the State had the burden of proving the admissibility of the evidence, Defendant had the burden of proving the grounds for his motion to suppress. We find that Defendant failed to present any evidence that because of his injuries, his consent was not valid or that he suffered any sort of diminished capacity or inability to understand and acknowledge the rights that he was giving up. While Defendant presented the EMT's records, which were observations made at the accident site three hours earlier, there were no medical records presented from the hospital which would have established his mental state upon arrival, the extent of his injuries, or the medications he may have been administered prior to the two troopers interviewing him at the hospital. Defendant even had the opportunity at the hearing to examine the nurse who drew his blood. Instead, Defendant agreed with the trial court that the nurse's testimony would have been irrelevant to the suppression question, even though the nurse's observations about Defendant's mental status and his medications could have been very relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   As pointed out by the State, the trial court relied on observations noted in the\n   EMT's report that Defendant was suffering from altered levels of consciousness and was unable to sign a consent form for treatment three hours before the trooper spoke with Defendant at the hospital. In its ruling, the trial court stated that Trooper Sims noted on the optional test form that Defendant was incoherent. Trooper Sims explained what he meant was that it was difficult to understand Defendant. Defendant's \"incoherency,\" his trouble speaking, may have been due to the fact he had suffered fractures of his jaw during the accident, not because he did not understand what was being told to him or asked of him by the troopers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendant's actual answers, as noted by Trooper Sims, were specific. He told Trooper Sims that he had been drinking crown and coke. There was testimony that an opened crown royal bottle was found in the Defendant's truck. He told the trooper that he was at Burton Coliseum and was driving a friend home when the accident occurred. He also told Trooper Sims that he had seen a doctor for a health checkup on the Wednesday before. He even told the trooper the doctor's name.
