In January 2014, the City of Arab established the City of Arab Downtown Historic District (\"the historic district\"),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   City of Arab Ordinance No. 2014-4, which included the area in which the building is located. In October and November 2014, Shoal Creek replaced four of the second-floor windows of the building. The AHPC discovered the modifications and directed Shoal Creek to file an application for a COA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 11-68-9(a) (\"No change in the exterior appearance of ... any building ... within an historic district may be made[ ] ... unless and until a certificate of appropriateness for such change ... is approved by the historic preservation commission created by the municipality designating the historic property or the historic district.\").

The windows you selected were inappropriate in material choice and glazing pattern. Historic photos indicate that the original windows appeared to be double hung, wooden sash windows. The windows you selected were vinyl, vertical gliding windows.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"2.

On February 5, 2015, the City of Arab and the AHPC filed an answer and counterclaimed for injunctive relief. On March 3, 2015, Shoal Creek filed a reply to the counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After a trial, the circuit court entered a final judgment on May 10, 2016, upholding the AHPC's decision to deny the application for a COA and ordering Shoal Creek \"to install appropriate windows, as approved by [the AHPC,] and [notifying Shoal Creek] that further changes to the structure shall be in compliance with the City of Arab's Historic Preservation Ordinance.\" On June 9, 2016, Shoal Creek filed a postjudgment motion, which the circuit court denied on July 15, 2016. On August 26, 2016, Shoal Creek filed its notice of appeal to the supreme court, which deflected the appeal to this court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ala.

When a historic preservation commission establishes a historic district, it must classify every building within the district as either \"contributing,\" meaning that it \"contributes to the district,\" or \"noncontributing,\" meaning that it \"does not contribute to the district.\" 2013 ordinance, \u00a7 IV(B)(3). The AHPC classified the building as \"noncontributing\" because the exterior appearance of the building had been substantially modified from its original 1930s condition.

Section 11-68-9 expressly provides that no change to \"any building\" within a historic district can be made unless a COA has been approved by the governing historic preservation commission. That statute, along with the 2014 ordinance, gives the AHPC the authority to review changes to the exterior appearance of noncontributing buildings within the historic district to assure compliance with applicable design standards. Indeed, some of the passages within the AHPC design guidelines generally apply to all buildings within the historic district and other specific design guidelines adopted by the AHPC also may well apply to noncontributing buildings. However, the window-design standards, the only design standards at issue in this case, do not apply to noncontributing buildings, so we decline to address in the abstract the scope of the authority of the AHPC over such buildings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Article III of the AHPC's design guidelines provides, in pertinent part, that \"[t]he Commission shall deny a Certificate of Appropriateness if it finds that the proposed\n   work is not consistent with the Design Guidelines.\" The AHPC denied the COA application filed by Shoal Creek because it found that the replacement windows violated the window-design standards. The AHPC did not rely on any other provision in its design guidelines for denying the COA application. We conclude that the AHPC based its denial on a faulty interpretation of the window-design standards. The window-design standards do not provide a rational basis for the determination of the AHPC, which otherwise had no other specific criteria upon which to deny the COA application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Because Shoal Creek did not violate the window-design standards, the AHPC could not deny its COA application on the alternative ground that the style of the replacement windows conflicted with the general historical character of the building\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   or the historic district, which ground it supported at trial with the opinion of expert witnesses.

Although the lots met the specific regulation governing the minimum area requirements for lots in the subdivision, the planning commission justified its authority to deny the proposed resubdivision based on the following general provision in the regulations: \" 'The size, width, depth, shape and orientation of lots and the minimum building setback lines shall be appropriate to the location of the subdivision and the type of development and use contemplated.

Instead, the legislature intended that a historic preservation commission can deny a proposed change to a building within a historic district based only on specific uniform standards.

Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the AHPC had no rational basis for enforcing the window-design standards against Shoal Creek and that the AHPC could not deny\n   the COA application solely on the ground that the replacement windows did not conform to the general character of the historic district, a standard \"capable of arbitrary application.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9585927\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/374/305/\">\n    374 So.2d at 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the circuit court and remand the case for the entry of a judgment consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   APPLICATION OVERRULED; OPINION OF MAY 5, 2017, WITHDRAWN; OPINION SUBSTITUTED; REVERSED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Pittman, Thomas, and Donaldson, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Thompson, P.J., concurs specially.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   THOMPSON, Presiding Judge, concurring specially.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The language set forth in the General Design Guidelines (\"guidelines\") of the City of Arab Historic Preservation Commission (\"AHPC\") provides that \"[t]he following standards shall be applied to all rehabilitation or alteration of\n   <em>\n    contributing\n   </em>\n   buildings and structures in the [historic] district.\" General Design Guidelines, Article VII, \u00a7 2.b. One of those standards regarding the alteration of windows does not apply to the building at issue.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9585927\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/374/305/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 2.b.8. Thus, I concur with the main opinion that, based on that language, the AHPC could not properly prohibit Shoal Creek Land &amp; Cattle, LLC (\"Shoal Creek\"), from replacing the windows of its building located within the historic district (\"the building\") with windows that did not comply with the guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   I write specially to point out that the language in Article VII, \u00a7 2.b., appears to be an aberration. In enacting the law that authorizes municipalities to require a certificate of appropriateness for changes to buildings within an historic district, the Alabama Legislature appears to have contemplated that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   buildings and structures within the historic district would be subject to design guidelines, regardless of whether they were \"contributing\" buildings or not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 11-68-9(a), Ala. Code 1975 (\"\n   <em>\n    No change in the exterior appearance of\n   </em>\n   an historic property or\n   <em>\n    any building, structure, or site within an historic district\n   </em>\n   may be made, and no historic property may be demolished, and no building or structure in an historic district may be erected or demolished unless and until a certificate of appropriateness for such change, erection, or demolition is approved by the historic preservation commission created by the municipality designating the historic property or the historic district.\" (emphasis added)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Similarly, the City of Arab (\"the city\") adopted Ordinance No. 2013-1 on January 8, 2013, establishing the AHPC. The purpose of the ordinance is \"to establish a uniform procedure for use in providing for the protection, enhancement, perpetuation and use of places, districts, sites, ... in accordance with the provisions of the Ordinance.\" \u00a7 I, Ordinance No. 2013-1. The ordinance provides that a \"certificate of appropriateness\" is required to make \"a change [to a building or structure] that will effect either the exterior architectural or environmental features of an historic property or\n   <em>\n    any building, structure, site, object, landscape feature or work of art within an historic district\n   </em>\n   .\" \u00a7 II(F), Ordinance No. 2013-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   I note that Ordinance No. 2013-1 provides that, regarding the recommendation and designation of proposed historic districts and properties, the evaluation of historic districts calls for properties within the district to be classified as either \"contributing (contributing to the district)\" or \"noncontributing (does not contribute to the district).\" \u00a7 IV(B)3, Ordinance\n   No. 2013-1. Section IV also sets forth the criteria the AHPC is to consider when selecting an historic district. I believe that the city intended for the distinction between a contributing building and a noncontributing building to apply only in the initial determination as to whether a proposed historic district met the required criteria to warrant designation as an historic district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Section V of Ordinance No. 2013-1 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   \"After the designation by ordinance of an historic property or of an historic district, no historic property may be demolished, no building or structure in an historic district may be erected or demolished and\n   <em>\n    no material change in the exterior appearance\n   </em>\n   of such historic property, or\n   <em>\n    of a structure, site, object, or work of art within such historic district\n   </em>\n   , shall be made or be permitted to be made by the owner or occupant thereof, unless or until the application for a Certificate of Appropriateness has been submitted to and approved by the [AHPC].\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00a7 V(A), Ordinance No. 2013-1 (emphasis added). The plain language of the ordinance does not create an exception for the need of a COA for \"noncontributing\" buildings or structures. The guidelines themselves also provide that proposed projects for exterior work on \"\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   properties\" within an historic district are subject to review by the AHPC \"for their appropriateness to the historic district.\" General Design Guidelines, Art. II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Based on the language in the authorizing statute, the applicable city ordinance, and the guidelines themselves, I believe that the intent of the legislature and of the city was to have the guidelines apply to each building or structure within a designated historic district. However, the plain language of the section of the guidelines setting forth the standards for the replacement of windows, among other alterations, explicitly excludes the applicability of those standards from the building at issue in this case. Therefore, I reluctantly agree with the main opinion that the AHPC had no basis on which to enforce the guidelines against Shoal Creek.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The AHPC did not deny the application because it was filed after the replacement work had been completed, and the AHPC informed the circuit court that it was not contending that the denial of the application could be upheld on that ground. Therefore, we do not discuss that point.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Shoal Creek also asserted various claims for a declaratory judgment, but it abandoned those claims at the commencement of the trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    We note that the building was not designated as a historic property.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 11-68-6.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
