Dysart, Judge Sandra Cabrina Jenkins, Judge Paula A. Brown )\n </judges>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Judge Paula A. Brown\n   The instant dispute arises from a petition for a deficiency judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Respondent/Plaintiff, Whitney National Bank (\"Whitney Bank\") held two promissory notes in favor of Relators/Defendants, Gary C. Landrieu and Maria Cortes Landrieu (collectively referred to as the \"Landrieus\"). Whitney Bank alleges that the Landrieus executed a collateral mortgage note as security for the promissory notes and the Landrieus encumbered their property, which included \"a developed parcel on the 300 block of Chartres\" (the \"Property\") located in New Orleans, Louisiana. Respondents/Third-Party Defendant, H.O.D.C., L.L.C., d/b/a Keller Williams Realty of New Orleans (\"Keller Williams\") was hired by the Landrieus to sell the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before the Landrieus could sell the Property, Whitney Bank foreclosed on it. The Property was sold in 2010 at a sheriff's sale pursuant to a writ of seizure and sale. In 2017, Whiney Bank filed a \"Petition for Deficiency Judgment\" and a supplemental petition, against the Landrieus alleging that the sales proceeds from the Property were insufficient to satisfy the Landrieus' obligations. In response, the Landrieus filed, collectively, an answer to the petition, exceptions, and affirmative defenses; a reconventional demand arising in tort against Whitney Bank; and a third-party demand arising in tort and breach of contract against Keller Williams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Keller Williams filed a peremptory exception of prescription as to claims asserted by the Landrieus' in their Third-Party Demand. A hearing was held, and a judgment was rendered on November 9, 2017 in favor of Keller Williams, in part, and against the Landrieus. The judgment dismissed, with prejudice, all tort claims asserted in the Landrieus' third-party demand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Landrieus filed a motion for new trial requesting the district court to reconsider that portion of the November 9, 2017 judgment granting the exception of prescription. A hearing was held on December 15, 2017. On December 28, 2017, the district court rendered judgment and denied the Landrieus' motion. On March 13, 2018, the Landrieus filed, in the district court, a notice of intent to seek review in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Whitney Bank filed peremptory exceptions of no cause of action and prescription as to the Landrieus' reconventional demand. A hearing was held on December 15, 2017, and a judgment was rendered on December 22, 2017. In this judgment, the district court denied both exceptions. On January 4, 2018, Whitney Bank filed a\n   motion for new trial. Whitney Bank requested the district court to reconsider the December 22, 2017 judgment only as to the exception of prescription. A hearing on the motion for new trial was held on April 6, 2018. On April 18, 2018, the district court rendered a judgment dismissing with prejudice all tort claims asserted against Whitney Bank. The Landrieus timely sought review by this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Landrieus seek review of both judgments-the December 28, 2017 judgment denying the Landrieus' motion for new trial and the April 18, 2018 judgment granting Whitney Bank's motion for new trial. We will address each judgment separately.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Denial of motion for new trial (Landrieus)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Landrieus argue the district court erred in denying their motion for new trial to reconsider the granting of Keller Williams' exception of prescription as to all tort claims. The Landrieus contend these claims, although prescribed, can be urged as defenses pursuant to La. C.C.P. art. 424 ; and, the claims should not be dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The district court's judgment that granted partial relief to Keller Williams was an interlocutory judgment, which the district court did not certify as a final judgment. La. C.C.P. art. 1915 ;\n   <em>\n    Wells Fargo Fin. Louisiana, Inc. v. Galloway\n   </em>\n   , 17-0413, pp. 4-5 (La. App. 4 Cir. 11/15/17),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12378122\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/231/793/#p798\">\n    231 So.3d 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 798. Thus, the motion for new trial was not the proper procedural device for the Landrieus to seek review of the November 9, 2017 judgment. Instead, the Landrieus should have sought review via a timely filed supervisory writ application pursuant to Uniform Rules-Courts of Appeal, Rule 4-3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Landrieus, however, filed the notice of intent in the district court on March 17, 2018, well over thirty days of the November 9, 2017 judgment. Uniform Rules-Courts of Appeal, Rule 4-3. Further, \"[t]he filing of a motion for new trial seeking reconsideration of an interlocutory judgment cannot interrupt the 30-day period for filing an application for supervisory writs established by Rule 4-3 of the Uniform Rules-Courts of Appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Carter v.

C.C.P. art. 424 ; and, the claims should not be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Spencer v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar.

The\n   <em>\n    Llopis\n   </em>\n   Court found the trial court erroneously considered and granted the motion for new trial and explained that \"there is no procedure by which a party may apply for a new trial following the denial of an interlocutory judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12198895\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so3d/206/1066/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , 16-0041, p. 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12198895\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so3d/206/1066/\">\n    206 So.3d at 1069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
