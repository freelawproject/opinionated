For the reasons that follow, we affirm the adjudication and sentence, but we remand for an amendment of the judgment of disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF THE CASE AND FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In mid-June 2016, A.B. bought her 16-year-old developmentally disabled grandson, K.B., a $99 bicycle from Wal-Mart. On June 26, 2016, while riding his bicycle, K.B. was approached by W.S. K.B. was acquainted with W.S. from playing sports together. W.S. asked to \"see\" the bicycle; and K.B. agreed, but instructed W.S. to \"come back\" with it. W.S. then took the bicycle, quickly rode away, and never returned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Shortly thereafter, K.B.'s mother and grandmother, who were riding together in a vehicle, observed K.B. standing alone at the corner of Claiborne Avenue and Laharpe Street. K.B.'s grandmother noticed that K.B. did not have his bicycle. The women stopped and asked K.B. where his bicycle was. K.B. responded that W.S. had taken it. After unsuccessfully attempting to locate W.S., they reported the theft to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 7, 2016, K.B. saw W.S. walking along Dumaine Street. K.B. called his mother, and she came to meet him. The two followed W.S. a short distance and\n   then called the police. When the police arrived, K.B.'s mother provided the police a description of W.S. Shortly thereafter, the police found W.S. (who was about a block away) and arrested him. While in custody, W.S. stated to an officer that K.B. had allowed him to borrow the bicycle and that, because the tires went flat, he had \"left it at the corner.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 1, 2017, the State filed a delinquency petition, alleging that, on June 26, 2016, W.S. had committed theft of a bicycle belonging to K.B. valued at less than $500. On August 16, 2017, W.S. entered a denial; and the case was set for an adjudication hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 2, 2017, the juvenile court conducted the adjudication hearing. At the conclusion of the hearing, the juvenile court adjudicated W.S. delinquent and set the case for a disposition hearing. On November 29, 2017, the juvenile court conducted the disposition hearing. At the conclusion of the hearing, the juvenile court imposed a suspended six-month sentence, six months of active probation, and restitution in the amount of $99.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ERRORS PATENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We have reviewed the record for errors patent and found one. While the judgment of disposition reflects that W.S. was adjudicated delinquent for theft, the judgment does not reflect the grade of the offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State in Interest of J.D.\n   </em>\n   , 14-0551, p. 10 (La.

Although juvenile delinquency proceedings are not criminal in nature, due process requires that the State prove every element of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    In re Winship\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12054393\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/358/\">\n    397 U.S. 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12054393\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/358/\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12054393\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/358/\">\n    25 L.Ed.2d 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1970).

Specific criminal intent is that state of mind which exists when the circumstances indicate that the offender actively desired the prescribed criminal consequences to follow his act or failure to act. La. R.S. 14:10(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At trial, K.B. testified that, although he had given W.S. permission to ride his bicycle, he had instructed W.S. to \"come back\" with it. Instead, K.B. further testified, W.S. took K.B.'s bicycle, quickly rode away with it, and never returned. This evidence was sufficient to allow the juvenile court to find a taking by fraudulent conduct and to infer the specific intent to permanently deprive; thus, under\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   , this evidence was sufficient to support W.S.'s adjudication for theft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Nonetheless, W.S. argues that the juvenile court committed manifest error in finding a taking because \"the testimony clearly established [that] W.S. asked to ride the bike and [that] K.B. gave him permission to do so.\" That K.B. initially\n   consented to W.S. borrowing the bicycle, however, is immaterial. \"Theft under La.

To the contrary, defense counsel elicited from the arresting officer W.S.'s statement that, rather than returning the bicycle to K.B., W.S. abandoned it because the tires became flat. In light of this evidence, the juvenile court's inference that W.S. had the specific intent to permanently deprive K.B. of the bicycle was not clearly erroneous.
