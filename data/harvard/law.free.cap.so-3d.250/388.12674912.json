Defendant pleaded not guilty at his arraignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 24, 2016, defendant withdrew his plea of not guilty, and after being advised of his\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights, pleaded guilty as charged. As part of the plea agreement, the State withdrew its intent to pursue the death penalty. Thereafter, with the consent of the parties and in compliance with La.

If, after an independent review, the reviewing court determines there are no non-frivolous issues for appeal, it may grant counsel's motion to withdraw and affirm the defendant's conviction and sentence. However, if the court finds any legal point arguable on the merits, it may either deny the motion and order the court-appointed attorney to file a brief arguing the legal point(s) identified by the court, or grant the motion and appoint substitute appellate counsel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7436533\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/676/1108/#p1110\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the present case, defendant's appellate counsel asserts that after a detailed review of the record, she could find no non-frivolous issues to raise on appeal. She asserts that defendant pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement, which was properly accepted by the trial court after defendant was fully informed of the legal consequences surrounding his plea. Further, appellate counsel states that defendant was informed of the sentence to be imposed and the trial court imposed the agreed upon sentence without objection by defendant, precluding defendant from challenging his sentence on appeal. The State has filed a brief in this matter, concurring with appellate counsel's assertion that there are no non-frivolous issues to be raised on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Appellate counsel has filed a motion to withdraw as attorney of record which states she has made a conscientious and thorough review of the trial court record and can find no non-frivolous issues to raise on appeal. Appellate counsel indicates that she has notified defendant of the filing of her motion to withdraw and of his right to file a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   supplemental brief in this appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant has not filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   supplemental brief in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   An independent review of the record supports appellate counsel's assertion that there are no non-frivolous issues to be raised on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The bill of indictment properly charged defendant and plainly and concisely stated the essential facts constituting the charged offense. It also sufficiently identified defendant and the crime charged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. C.Cr.P. arts. 464 - 466. The record also shows that there are no appealable issues surrounding defendant's presence. The minute entries and commitment reflect that defendant and his counsel appeared at each stage of the proceedings against him, including his arraignment, his guilty plea proceeding, and his sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant pleaded guilty to first degree murder, a violation of La. R.S. 14:30, after having received the consent of the court and the State, with the stipulation that the court would impose a life sentence without benefit of probation, parole,\n   or suspension of sentence and without conducting a sentencing hearing, in accordance with La. C.Cr.P. arts. 557(A) and 905(B). If a defendant pleads guilty, he normally waives all non-jurisdictional defects in the proceedings leading up to the guilty plea and precludes review of such defects either by appeal or post-conviction relief.\n   <em>\n    State v.

A guilty plea is constitutionally infirm if it is not entered freely and voluntarily, if the\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   colloquy is inadequate, or when a defendant is induced to enter the plea by a plea bargain or what he justifiably believes was a plea bargain and that bargain is not kept.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8449925\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/924/1120/#p1124\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A review of the record reveals no constitutional infirmity in defendant's guilty plea. The record shows defendant was aware he was pleading guilty to one count of first degree murder in exchange for the State relinquishing its intent to pursue the death penalty. On the waiver of rights form and during the colloquy with the trial judge, defendant was advised of his right to a judge or jury trial, his right to confrontation, and his privilege against self-incrimination, as required by\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   Defendant verbally indicated to the trial court that he understood that by pleading guilty he was waiving these rights. He also placed his initials next to the rights he was waiving and his signature at the end of the waiver of rights form indicating that he understood he was waiving these rights by pleading guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant was informed during the colloquy, and by means of the waiver of rights form, of the mandatory sentence for the offense as well as the actual penalty that would be imposed upon acceptance of his guilty plea. He was also informed that his guilty plea could be used to enhance a penalty for any future conviction. Defendant indicated that he understood the possible legal consequences of pleading guilty and confirmed that his guilty plea was freely and voluntarily given without any promises or threats having been made to encourage him into entering his guilty plea. He also stated that he was satisfied with the handling of his case by his attorney. After the colloquy with defendant, the trial judge accepted defendant's guilty plea as knowingly, intelligently, freely, and voluntarily made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Lastly, defendant's sentence does not present any issue for appeal. The mandatory sentence prescribed by La. R.S. 14:30(C)(2) was imposed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, defendant's sentence was imposed pursuant to, and in conformity with, the plea agreement after the trial court granted the State and defendant's joint motion to waive sentencing delays as required under La. C.Cr.P. art. 905(B). La. C.Cr.P. art. 881.2(A)(2) precludes a defendant from seeking review of his sentence imposed in conformity with a plea agreement, which was set forth in the record at the time of the plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    State v.
