Because the appeal delays had expired, this court considered the timely filed notice of intent to seek writs as a timely filed motion and order for appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Armstrong v.

The trial court set June 30, 2018, as the return date. The State of Louisiana, through the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS), filed a motion that opposed the lodging of the entire record of the proceedings. The trial court signed an order on June 7, 2018, stating \"that the record to be lodged regarding the appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeal is limited to the record of the hearing of January 8, 2018, including the written reasons for judgment and the judgment.\" T.D. and S.D. assert that this ruling was based on the trial court's interpretation of this court's statement in its writ decision that \"the trial court's written judgment dismissing Relators' petition for adoption was signed on December 21, 2017, and notice issued that same date. That judgment was not appealed and is not the subject of the instant proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    State of Louisiana in the Interest of E.A.D.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18-233%20%28La.App.%203%20Cir.%205/16/18%29\">\n    18-233 (La.App. 3 Cir. 5/16/18)\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (unpublished writ decision).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following the trial court's June 7, 2018 ruling, and before the trial court record was lodged, T.D. and S.D. filed a motion in this court to supplement the appellate record, which was assigned docket number 18-451. While that motion was pending, the designated trial court record, marked\n   \"Designation,\" was received by this court and assigned docket number 18-465. It contained no pleadings before January 8, 2018. In their motion to supplement the record, T.D. and S.D. have listed fifteen hearings from December 15, 2015, through January 8, 2018. T.D. and S.D. assert that they are appealing rulings other than the February 7, 2018 judgment and that the record should include all pleadings, notices, returns, and transcripts. T.D. and S.D. argue that they were not provided notice or a reasonable opportunity to be heard before those rulings were issued. Accordingly, they ask that the appeal record be supplemented to include: all pleadings filed in this matter; all subpoenas, notices, and returns on service; and transcripts of all hearings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   DCFS opposes the motion to supplement and asserts that the adoption proceedings are separate from the child in need of care proceedings. However, we note that the trial court issued a ruling that the juvenile court has continuing jurisdiction over these proceedings and ordered that the adoption proceedings be transferred to Division I, docket number JC 2015985.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   DCFS states that the trial court's designation of the record by the granting of its motion follows the applicable rules of civil procedure and that the appellants, T.D. and S.D., are not entitled to have the record supplemented. DCFS also argues that the motions filed by T.D. and S.D. are premature because the record had not been lodged at the time the motion to supplement was filed. DCFS's proposition that Appellants cannot supplement the record is antithetical to law and jurisprudence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"[T]he appellant is responsible for the record on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Daigle v.
