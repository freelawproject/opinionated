In response, Relators filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting plaintiffs could not be improperly terminated, as they had not been properly hired. As part of their opposition\n   thereto, plaintiffs' counsel, Daniel Broussard, obtained and filed the affidavit of Leonard Ray Lacour, a member of the Boyce Town Council.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prior to obtaining the affidavit, the Town Council had met in executive session twice to discuss this litigation, and Relators' counsel had also discussed the matter with Lacour. Relators, therefore, alleged the communication between Lacour and plaintiffs' counsel violated Rule 4.2 of the Louisiana Rules of Professional Conduct (Rule 4.2)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   because it was made outside the presence and without the consent of defense counsel. The trial court struck the affidavit from the summary judgment proceedings and denied summary judgment, but declined to exclude Lacour's testimony at trial. Relators filed a motion for protective order, requesting the trial court (1) preclude plaintiffs, their attorney, and/or agents from meeting with any town official wherein the subject matter of this litigation is discussed, and (2) exclude Lacour's affidavit and testimony/evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Application, p. 34. Plaintiffs opposed the motion, arguing that Fisher, a \"constituent,\" had a right to talk to Lacour, but did not file their own motion for protective order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The trial court denied the motion in part \"insofar as it seeks to exclude Ray Lacour as a witness\" and granted the motion in part, ordering: (1) defense counsel may communicate with Mayor Moore; (2) plaintiffs' counsel may communicate directly with Police Chief Washington, \"as he was and, depending upon the ruling of the Third Circuit, may be a plaintiff in this matter\"; but (3) neither counsel for plaintiffs nor defendants \"shall have further direct contact with any Alderman of the Town of Boyce, or any other Town of Boyce employee with managerial authority.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Application, p. 85. Relators now seek review of the trial court's ruling, particularly as to its refusal to exclude Lacour as a witness and its prohibiting defense counsel from communicating with the Town Council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We find that this suit involves the\n   <em>\n    res nova\n   </em>\n   issue of whether Louisiana law requires exclusion of evidence and testimony from an officer of a represented organization who was improperly contacted by opposing counsel in violation of Rule 4.2. On June 26, 2017, this court stayed the August 27, 2017 bench trial and ordered additional briefing.

Relators posit that the penalty for such communication should be the exclusion of Lacour's testimony in its entirety at trial and, therefore, the trial court erred in failing to exclude Lacour's testimony. Citing the provisions of Rule 4.2, Relators assert the communication between plaintiffs' counsel and Lacour about the subject of this litigation was prohibited because: (1) Lacour, as Alderman, is by definition an \"officer\" of the Town, which is a defendant in this suit and which Broussard knew was represented by counsel, La.R.S. 33:381,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Rule 4.2(b) (\"person the lawyer knows is presently ... officer ... of a represented organization\"); (2) defense counsel discussed the litigation with Lacour prior to the communication,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Rule 4.2(b)(1) (\"who ... consults with the organization's lawyer concerning the matter\"); (3) the Town Council met in executive session twice, with Lacour present, to determine what direction to proceed in this litigation prior to the contact,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Rule 4.2(b)(2) (\"who has the authority to obligate the organization with respect to the matter\"); and (4) plaintiffs have placed the Town Council's alleged inactions regarding\n   plaintiffs' hiring and termination front and center in this litigation as a basis for their suit,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Rule 4.2(b)(3) (\"whose ... omission in connection with the matter may be imputed to the organization for purposes of civil ... liability\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Relators also advance the dual purposes of Rule 4.2 to prevent disclosure of attorney/client communications and to protect a party from \"liability-creating statements\" elicited by a skilled interrogator.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the interest of furthering same, Relators argue that, when an improper communication is discovered before trial and an ethical violation is found, the communication should be held inadmissible so to balance the scales and protect the sanctity of the attorney-client relationship as well as the integrity of the profession.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   As to plaintiffs' \"constituents\" argument, Relators note Broussard is not a constituent, but an attorney who does not live in the town and who discussed the subject of the representation with a \"represented party.\" Simply put, plaintiffs cannot, with impunity, place the inactions of the Town Council at issue and then approach a member thereof in an effort to establish liability outside the presence and without consent of opposing counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Relators also challenge the trial court's\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   ruling, prohibiting defense counsel from communicating with the Town Council, a client, which Relators submit contradicts La.Rules Prof.Conduct, Rule 1.4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, it places defense counsel in an impossible position to defend any claims made against the Town Council\n   as a lawyer employed or retained by an organization, like the Town Council herein, represents the organization acting through its duly authorized constituents, who would be the aldermen in this matter. Citing La.Rules Prof.Conduct, Rule 1.13(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We find that this writ presents an issue that has not been directly addressed by this court, specifically whether a protective order excluding the testimony of a witness is the proper measure to take against allegedly unethical conduct in a proceeding before the trial court. It raises the question of what evidentiary consequences, if any, are wrought by an attorney's disregard for the ethical rules prohibiting communication with represented persons. Likewise, it brings to the court's attention the very abuses Rule 4.2 was enacted to prevent and poses a penalty to further the goals our supreme court sought to achieve in its enactment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   While this court has been silent, the fourth circuit in\n   <em>\n    Gilliam\n   </em>\n   suppressed a criminal defendant's statement that was elicited by an investigator without defense counsel's consent in violation of Rule 4.2.

Patterson, even if we believe that he went on his own, elicited the kind of liability-creating statement that Merritt kept in his file for further use for the benefit of Williams and to the detriment of Gilliam.

O.I.D.P. represented both Williams and Gilliam, at least until 11 July 1994. The very organization through its investigator and ultimately through its counsel, brought harm to a former client by using the statement which had been obtained by Merritt's agent without permission of the defendant's counsel. We do not wish to be considered as lending our approval to the practice, if indeed a practice exists, of interviewing accused represented persons in jail in the absence of counsel. The better, fairer and safer practice is to afford the defendant's attorney reasonable opportunity to be present. While we have found no cases on point, we hold that a case by case analytical approach is to be utilized by courts contemplating whether supervisory suppression is warranted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Gilliam\n   </em>\n   , 748 So.2d at 638.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The federal courts have also spoken on this issue, holding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Federal courts have authority to remedy litigation practices that threaten judicial integrity and the adversary processes.

In a criminal case, a Louisiana appellate court stated, with Rule 4.2 in mind: \"[W]here there is an improper communication discovered or considered before it is used at trial, and a violation of the ethical rule is found, it should be held inadmissible.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A related issue surfaced in\n   <em>\n    In re Shell Oil Refinery\n   </em>\n   , a class action case against Shell in which a group of plaintiffs' lawyers, organized as a \"Plaintiffs' Legal Committee,\" acquired confidential information about Shell through a Shell employee, outside the discovery process. Shell asked the court to order the plaintiffs' lawyers to reveal the identity of the employee, so that they could determine if there had been a violation of Rule 4.2. Shell also sought information about the documents that the employee had provided. The court was unable to determine, at that stage, whether there had been a violation of the rule, but said:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   The receipt of Shell's documents was more than informal fact-gathering. The PLC [Plaintiffs' Legal Committee] has effectively circumvented the discovery process and prevented Shell from being able to argue against production. Had the PLC sought to obtain these documents through the discovery process, Shell would have had the opportunity to seek a protective order pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court is concerned with preserving the integrity of this judicial proceeding. What matters is balancing the scales. That can be done by prohibiting the PLC from making any use of the documents, requiring the PLC to identify and produce the documents to Shell, and prohibiting the PLC from any further ex parte contact with any Shell employees other than those who are plaintiffs in this suit. That Shell may learn the identity of the source once it reviews the documents and perhaps retaliate against the employee is not this Court's concern.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The court entered an order in accordance with those conclusions. The case is interesting, in part, because it shows a court taking steps to protect against some of the abuses that Rule 4.2 is intended to prevent, and the court took those steps without concluding that Rule 4.2 had been violated. If the court had found a Rule 4.2 violation, one suspects that it would have done the same things, while perhaps reporting the offending lawyers to disciplinary authorities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   FRANK L.

TREATISE ,\n   <em>\n    Louisiana Lawyering\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9.3 (June 2017 update) (footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The exclusion or admissibility of evidence ultimately rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. As to the exclusion of Lacour's testimony, we find that Relators have not shown the abuse necessary to reverse the trial court's ruling, especially in the absence of any evidence that the judicial process has been or will be tainted. On this point, it is noteworthy that Relators stress the alleged inaction of the Town Council as giving rise to the liability in this matter, but in the petition, liability is based on Mayor Moore's unilateral action taken \"without obtaining the recommendation or consent of Police Chief Eddie Washington or the action of the Board of Aldermen for the Town of Boyce.\" Therefore, it follows that it is not the Town Council's failure to act, but rather, Mayor Moore's action in its absence that gives rise to liability in this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We agree with the proposition of defense counsel that he has the right to communicate with his client, the Town Council. The inappropriate action of Plaintiff's counsel should not be a basis for placing any limit on the ability of defense counsel to defend his client. We therefore hold that the trial court abused its discretion in limiting defense counsel's ability to communicate with his client.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Accordingly, the writ is granted to reverse the trial court's ruling prohibiting defense counsel from contact with his client, the Town Council. Otherwise, the application for supervisory writs is denied. The stay order issued by this court on June 26, 2017, is hereby recalled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     WRIT GRANTED IN PART AND MADE PEREMPTORY; WRIT DENIED IN PART.

The trial court excluded Lacour's affidavit. Lacour's testimony at trial is subject to cross-examination and the fear of artful lawyering suggesting or prompting \"liability-creating statements\" is not present here. I would further note that there has been no finding, nor would I find based on the evidence before us, that a Rule 4.2 violation has occurred.\n   <em>\n    Gilliam\n   </em>\n   supports a conclusion that an \"improper communication\"\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   a violation of a rule of ethics is necessary in order to find a statement is inadmissible at trial.
