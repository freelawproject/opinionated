After a bench trial, Vanessa Lynn Page was convicted of felony driving under the influence (DUI). Page appeals. Finding no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. On August 14, 2015, around 7:00 p.m., Page was arrested near her home in Cedar Lake trailer park in Biloxi, Mississippi, after a tipster identified by first and last name called 911 and reported Page. The tipster called 911 shortly after the tipster and Page left the same Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting. The tipster expressed concern for Page's driving, and the tipster included specific details about Page's identity, vehicle, and destination. The tipster also told the dispatcher that someone had offered Page a ride home, but Page refused. The tipster described Page as a slightly belligerent and extremely intoxicated white woman who was approximately five-feet tall with her hair pulled back into a ponytail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Biloxi Police Officer Robert McKeithen received the call from dispatch. McKeithen was familiar with the trailer park where Page lived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. When McKeithen approached the area of the trailer park, he immediately noticed the described car at an intersection in front of him. As he made a turn onto South Cedar Lake, he saw Page's grey Nissan Versa turn left into the trailer park. He later testified that the driver matched the description originally provided in the tip. McKeithen followed Page for about an eighth of a mile before pulling her over. Traveling at ten miles an hour, McKeithen trailed Page for roughly forty-five seconds before he stopped her. McKeithen testified he did not observe any traffic offenses while he followed Page. He made the stop based on the confirmation of information he received from dispatch and also for the safety of the children in the area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. Page pulled over immediately. When McKeithen approached, he noticed that Page smelled like alcohol, her eyes were glassy, and her speech was slurred. Once she got out of the car, Page had trouble keeping her balance and she was unsteady on her feet. McKeithen ran her driver's license, which came back as suspended because of a prior DUI from earlier that year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. Shortly after McKeithen stopped Page, Officer Jason Cummings, a DUI officer, arrived on the scene and took over to administer field sobriety tests. Cummings\n   noticed the same odor, appearance, and slurred speech that McKeithen observed. When Cummings attempted to administer the field sobriety tests, Page failed the first test. Citing a pre-existing injury, Page was physically unable to complete the remainder of the tests. Based on these observations, Cummings arrested Page for driving with a suspended license. After he properly Mirandized her, he took her to the police station to continue the DUI investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. At the station, Page agreed to an Intoxilyzer test, but she was unable to provide a sufficient breath sample. Page then verbally consented to provide a blood sample. She was taken to Merit Health Hospital, where she gave written consent in the presence of an officer and the phlebotomist who proceeded to draw her blood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. The blood samples were sent to the crime lab for testing. The results indicated that Page had a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.19 percent. Thomas Graham, a crime lab analyst, conducted the test and prepared the report, which was then reviewed by the lab's technical reviewer, Maury Phillips. At trial, Phillips testified regarding Graham's findings. Phillips also described the standard process of analyzing blood samples, and the roles of a technical reviewer. Phillips explained that he personally reviewed Graham's work and all data generated by the testing. Once Phillips verified the results, he signed Graham's report. According to Phillips, the results would have been the same had he conducted the tests himself. The prosecution never entered the report into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. However, the prosecution submitted evidence that Page had two previous DUI convictions within five years of the present case. The circuit court found Page guilty of felony DUI and sentenced her to five years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections, with three years suspended and two to serve, followed by three years of post-release supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    I.

The Mississippi Supreme Court has addressed reasonable suspicion in DUI cases in\n   <em>\n    Floyd\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cook\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Floyd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11474839\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/749/110/#p118\">\n    749 So. 2d at 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 4), an off-duty police officer received a tip from someone who had provided the officer with credible information in the past.

Because of the accuracy of the informant's tip, the off-duty officer's familiarity with the informant, and the fact that there was no reason \"to doubt the reliability or good faith of the informant,\" the supreme court found that the investigatory stop was justified.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11474839\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/749/110/#p118\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11474839\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/749/110/#p118\">\n    at 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13. Page argues that unlike the informant in\n   <em>\n    Floyd\n   </em>\n   , the tipster was essentially anonymous because the tipster had no prior working relationship with the Biloxi Police Department. However, there is no requirement that a tipster provide credible information in the past to be able to do so in the present. If that were the case, a first-time tipster could never establish credibility. Instead, as noted previously, the court takes a totality-of-the-circumstances approach when evaluating a tip and the tip's subsequent establishment of reasonable suspicion.\n   <em>\n    Alabama\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122945\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/325/#p330\">\n    496 U.S. at 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122945\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/325/#p330\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14. In\n   <em>\n    Cook\n   </em>\n   , a driver was pulled over and arrested for DUI after a police officer followed the driver based on a tip from an unknown source who said Cook had been driving erratically.\n   <em>\n    Cook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6888378\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/159/534/#p537\">\n    159 So.3d at 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 3).

Ultimately, the supreme court reversed the DUI conviction because the officers did not corroborate the criminal activity reported in the tip prior to stopping the driver.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6888378\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/159/534/#p537\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 18).

App. 1995), in which the Texas Court of Appeals noted that \"a tip by an unnamed informant of undisclosed reliability standing alone will rarely establish the requisite level of suspicion necessary to justify investigative detention.\" However, that is not what occurred in the present case. Here the tipster identified herself by name and reported that she had personally witnessed Page's behavior during an AA meeting just prior to calling in the tip. The tipster also provided specific facts regarding Page's car, physical appearance, and destination. McKeithen stopped Page based on his confirmation of those facts. The content of the tip was extremely specific and easily and visibly verifiable by McKeithen before he stopped Page. The fact that the tipster had been participating in the same AA meeting as Page and personally witnessed Page's behavior, speaks to the tip's reliability regardless of whether the tipster had provided credible information to the police in the past. The \"quantity and the quality\" of the information provided in the tip, when considered alongside the totality of the circumstances, was enough to establish reasonable suspicion.

Such is not the case here. Phillips was the technical reviewer of the lab report at issue, and he testified. The supreme court has held that a supervisor, reviewer, or other analyst may testify in lieu of the primary analyst where the surrogate witness was \"actively involved in the production of the report and had intimate knowledge of the analyses even though [he] did not perform the tests first hand.\"\n   <em>\n    McGowen v.

Here, Phillips was a court-accepted expert in the field of forensic toxicology. He was actively involved in the production of the report, he had intimate knowledge of the tests that were performed and the process that was used to confirm the findings, and he reviewed Graham's work to ensure that the conclusions were correct and accurate. Phillips testified that when an analyst has completed the analysis, his work packet is submitted for review. Phillips explained that all reports issued by an analyst must be technically and administratively reviewed before they are released. As the technical and administrative reviewer in this case, Phillips verified that Graham followed protocol and used the proper scientific methods of toxicology. Moreover, Phillips stated that he received Graham's work packet \"with all of the data\" and examined it to ensure that the policies were followed and that Graham's conclusions were accurate and correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 23. This case is consistent with\n   <em>\n    Jenkins v.

In both cases, technical reviewers who had reviewed data generated by testing, verified the results, and signed the lab reports were called to testify as to their opinions on the forensic findings.\n   <em>\n    Jenkins\n   </em>\n   , 102 So.3d at 1064 (\u00b6 1) ;\n   <em>\n    Grim\n   </em>\n   , 102 So.3d at 1075 (\u00b6 1). Our supreme court held that the testimony of an analyst who did not perform the test did not infringe the defendant's right to confrontation if the testifying analyst had \"intimate knowledge\" of the analysis and if the testifying analyst was \"actively involved in the production\" of the report at issue.\n   <em>\n    Jenkins,\n   </em>\n   102 So.3d at 1067, 1069 (\u00b6\u00b6 13, 19) ;\n   <em>\n    Grim,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7017133\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/102/1073/#p1081\">\n    102 So.3d at 1079, 1081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 16, 20) (quoting\n   <em>\n    McGowen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9051373\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/859/320/#p340\">\n    859 So.2d at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 13) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 24. While Phillips did not conduct the test himself, he was \"actively involved in the production of the report and had intimate knowledge of the analyses even though [he] did not perform the tests first hand.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McGowen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9051373\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/859/320/#p340\">\n    859 So.2d at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 68). Additionally, Phillips testified that he would have come up with the same result had he done the testing himself. Therefore, we find that Phillips, as the technical and administrative reviewer, was qualified to testify as a surrogate witness in lieu of the primary analyst. We find no merit to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 25.\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   LEE, C.J., IRVING, P.J., BARNES, CARLTON, FAIR, WILSON, GREENLEE, WESTBROOKS AND TINDELL, JJ., CONCUR.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
