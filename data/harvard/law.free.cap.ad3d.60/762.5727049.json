The appeal from the order of disposition brings up for review the fact-finding order.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-23\">Ordered that the order of disposition is affirmed, without costs or disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-24\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the agency <em>(see </em>Family preAct \u00a7 342.2 [2]; <em>Matter of David H., </em>69 NY2d 792 [1987]; <em>cf. People v Contes, </em>60 NY2d 620, 621 [1983]), we find that the evidence was legally sufficient to the findings of fact <em>sup</em>Penal Law \u00a7 120.15; <em>Matter (cf. Eric C., </em>281 AD2d 543, 544 [2001]).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-25\">In fulfilling our responsibility to conduct an independent review of the weight of the evidence <em>(see cf </em>CPL 470.15 [5]; <em>People v Danielson, </em>9 NY3d 342 [2007]), we nevertheless accord great deference to the factfinder\u2019s opportunity to view the hear the testimony, and observe demeanor <em>(see People v Mateo, </em>2 NY3d 383, 410 [2004], <em>cert denied </em>542 US 946 [2004]; <em>People v Bleakley, </em>69 NY2d 490, 495 [1987]). Upon reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>the record here, we are satisfied that the findings of fact were not against the weight of the evidence <em>(cf. People v </em>Romero, 7 NY3d 633 [2006]). Fisher, J.P., Covello, Angiolillo and Leventhal, JJ, concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
