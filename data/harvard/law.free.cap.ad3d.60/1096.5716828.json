County Court thereafter sentenced defendant consistent with the plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>bargain to 15 years in prison and five years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals, arguing only that the sentence imposed is harsh and excessive. We disagree, finding neither an abuse of discretion by County Court nor the existence of extraordinary circumstances warranting a modification of the sentence in the interest of justice <em>(see People v Frary, </em>29 AD3d 1223, 1226 [2006], <em>lv denied </em>7 NY3d 788 [2006]).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\">Cardona, P.J., Rose, Lahtinen, Kavanagh and McCarthy, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
