The section in question is simply a re-enactment of the provisions of the revised statutes, and the relief intended by the section was to establish an election already had, or to set aside that election and order a new one and the proceeding authorized is summary and not by mandamus. There is nothing in that section which authorizes the court to compel the inspectors of election to count votes which they have heretofore refused to count, although they may have acted erroneously. The only relief which could be afforded where the inspectors had acted improperly would be to order a new election in case justice requires such action. The proceeding for that purpose is prescribed by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The order appealed from should be reversed with costs of appeal and the proceedings dismissed with $20 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Van Brunt, P.

The general term of this department held upon the application for a mandamus that the 15th section of chapter 563 of the laws of 1890 is simply a re-enactment of the provisions of the Revised Statutes. Under the provisions of the Revised Statutes it was held that the corporation itself should be made a party and be served with notice of the presentation of the application to the court (See Matter of Pioneer Paper Co., 36 <em>How. Pr. </em>102 ; Schoharie Valley R. R. Co., 12 <em>Abb. N. S. </em>394).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
