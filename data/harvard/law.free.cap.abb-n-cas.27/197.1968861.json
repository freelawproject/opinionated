The material finding of the referee was as follows:\u2014\u201c I find that Gibson W. Fairman, the plaintiff, as a broker in the business carried on by and before the death of John McLaren, the defendant\u2019s testator, rendered services for the said John McLaren, to wit: soliciting customers as purchasers of the testator\u2019s goods, wares and merchandise, but that before the death of said John McLaren he paid said plaintiff in full, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>at the time' of his death was not indebted to him, said plaintiff, in any amount whatever.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-5\">On plaintiff\u2019s application an order to show cause was made why the referee should not be required to make further findings, as follows: ist.

Parties seeking to review a judgment have a right to know the precise grounds upon which an adverse decision is put (citing Rogers <em>v. </em>Beard, 20 <em>How. </em>282 ; Van Slyck <em>v. </em>Hyatt, 46 <em>N.

If the court has power, there is no reason shown why further findings should be directed (citing Smith <em>v. </em>Smith, 43 <em>Super. Ct.

These sections undoubtedly change the former practice, whereby findings, originally insufficient in form or indefinite in substance, might be clarified upon the settlement of the case. This was all that was decided in Gormerly <em>v. </em>McGlynn (84 <em>N. Y. </em>284), where the revisers\u2019 note to section 1023 was referred to, and their view was seemingly approved, that the method of proceeding by motion to compel findings, where the referee refuses to make them at all, has not been abolished.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Cases where the power in question has been denied have proceeded either upon a misapprehension of what was decided in Gormerly <em>v. </em>McGlynn, or upon a too narrow view of what was contemplated by sections. 1022 and 1023.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">We have no doubt that the special term has power,, in the interest of justice, to add to the findings made by it, and we think it equally clear that the court may remit his findings to a referee for a similar purpose. We, so held, in Schultheis <em>v. </em>McInerny (27 <em>Abb. N. C. </em>193), and we see no reason for altering the opinion there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>pronounced. This is a power which is so far inherent that it would' require an express prohibition to deprive the court of its exercise. It is analogous to the power always exercised by the court over its judgments, records and proceedings in the interest of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">In the present case the applicatioh should have been granted. The finding that the plaintiff rendered services for the testator, which the latter paid in full, is too indefinite to raise the questions presented. The referee should have found specifically on each of the items of the plaintiff\u2019s demand, and then he should have specifically found the amount paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The order should be reversed, with costs, and the motion granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Van Brunt, P. J., and Patterson, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
