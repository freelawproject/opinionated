The following were the allegations of the complaint:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-14\"><em>First. </em>That plaintiff is a physician and surgeon residing in London, England,and practising his profession there and elsewhere; that plaintiff, for his attainments and services in the cause of medical science, has been knighted and is widely known in England, America and elsewhere by his name and title of Sir Morell Mackenzie as a specialist in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>diseases of the throat, and as such is frequently consulted by physicians and others in and from the United States of America, where he has a widespread and well-established reputation as an authority upon the treatment of diseases of the throat.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-6\">, <em>Second. </em>That defendant, Soden Mineral Springs Company, Limited, is a domestic corporation, organized and existing under the laws of the State of New York, with a capital of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, and is extensively engaged in a manufacture and sale of a medicinal preparation known and described by it as \u201c Soden Mineral Pastilles\u201d as its sole business; and, upon information and belief, that the defendant, the Eisner and Mendelson Company, is a foreign corporation engaged in business in the city and county of New York, and that it is acting as the agent for the sale of the said Soden Mineral Pastilles.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-7\"><em>Third. </em>That the defendants, as an inducement to the public to purchase said pastilles and as evidence of their merits, have placed around each box of said pastilles a printed or written slip containing the words \u201cThe Soden Mineral Pastilles are specially beneficial in catarrhal diseases of the air passages, which include sore throat, coughs, bronchitis, and lung troubles,\u201d and after said words there is printed the plaintiff\u2019s name, \u201c Sir Morell Mackenzie,\u201d in pretended fac-simile of this plaintiff\u2019s signature ; that one of said printed slips, taken from a box of said pastilles, is annexed thereto and marked \u201c Exhibit A.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-8\"><em>Fourth. </em>That defendants have extensively advertised and are now extensively advertising said pastilles throughout the United States, and in such advertisements are setting forth that the same are approved and commended by this plaintiff, and stating among other things, in such advertisements, that \u201cthe genuine Soden Mineral Pastilles must have the testimonial and signature of Sir Morell Mackenzie around each box that a copy of one of said advertisements taken from the <em>New York Times </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>of March 18, 1891, is annexed hereto and marked <em>\u201c </em>Exhibit B.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-5\"><em>Fifth. </em>That defendants are also issuing with said pastilles a circular containing a printed letter purporting to be of this plaintiff, of which the following is a copy:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-6\">\u25a0\u201c 19 Harley Street,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-7\">\u201c Cavendish Square, W.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-8\">\u201c Sir Morell Mackenzie writes : <em>\u2018 </em>1 have watched the effects of the Soden Waters for a considerable period and regard them as extremely valuable in obstinate catarrhal affections of the throat.

That said defendants have offices together and are united in some manner, the particulars of which are unknown to plaintiff, in the sale of said Soden Mineral Pastilles, and in the publishing and circulation of said circulars, wrappers and advertisements calling attention to and commending the same, and both said defendants derive profit from such unauthorized use of plaintiff\u2019s name.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-5\"><em>Seventh. </em>The plaintiff has no knowledge of the merits or value of the said pastilles which are being made and sold by defendants, nor of their composition nor effect. That he does know of a preparation made of the Soden Waters evaporated, and has guardedly and, under certain circumstances, recommended the same; but this plaintiff has not at any time given to defendants any right or authority to use his name in commendation of their said pastilles or in any other manner whatever, nor to use any of the advertisements or statements purporting to come from plaintiff, and thus fraudulently held out to the public as being the plaintiff\u2019s.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-6\"><em>Eighth. </em>That plaintiff denies that the letters and statements attributed to him in said Exhibits \u201c A, \u201d <em>\u201c </em>B \u201d and \u201c C,\u201d or any of the other advertisements and circulars issued by defendants are true copies of any letters which he has at any time heretofore written. He denies that he has at any time written any letters whatever to these defendants, or either of them, and he avers that, if at any time any letters have been written by him to any person whomsoever in which he commended any pastilles or preparations made from the Soden mineral spring water, said letters were not for publication, and that whatever right of publication existed in such letters belonged to this plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-7\"><em>Ninth. </em>That said use of plaintiff\u2019s name by defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>ants, and trading upon his professional reputation in their said advertisements, circulars, wrappers and other publications is a fraud upon the public and upon this plaintiff ; is wholly unauthorized, and is injurious to plaintiff\u2019s professional standing and reputation, and offensive to his feelings. That, as it is part of the written and unwritten code of medical ethics in the civilized world that a practicing physician shall have no interest in any proprietary medicine or surgical instrument, and that he shall not recommend any medicines which are known as patent or proprietary medicines for general use by the public without their being recommended for the special case of the disease under the advice of the physician, any such ownership or recommendation by a physician does injury to the public, casts reproach upon him, the physician recommending the same indiscriminately injures his medical standing and reputation, and commits lasting and permanent injury to his standing with patients and his professional brethren, not only because such ownership or recommendation constitutes a breach of professional ethics, but because such recommendation implies a disregard of the scientific truth that no medicine of any kind can be safely recommended to the laity for general use without regard to the special circumstances of the patient\u2019s case. That, in addition to the breach of professional etiquette and duty thus committed by a physician who recommends proprietary medicines for purposes of advertisement and for general public consumption, a suspicion is cast upon the physician that he has a personal pecuniary interest in the medicine that he recommends or is thus recommended, to the great and irremediable loss of his professional prestige and personal standing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-5\"><em>Tenth. </em>That plaintiff has received many intimations and evidences of loss of esteem and practice arising from defendant\u2019s said publications, and has come to personal pecuniary loss thereby. That the continuation of these publications injures and has a tendency to injure more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>and more the professional standing of the plaintiff and the income which he derives from his profession; and that much injury in that regard had already resulted to plaintiff therefrom ; to his damage, as he is informed and verily believes, in the sum of more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-5\"><em>Eleventh. </em>That there is no other physician of the name of plaintiff having any repute as an authority on diseases of the throat, and that in the use of the name of Sir Morell Mackenzie in the said advertisements, circulars, wrappers and other publications, defendants refer to and mean this plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-6\"><em>Twelfth. </em>That plaintiff asks for an injunction <em>pendente lite, </em>and for a permanent injunction against said unwarranted and improper use of his name by these defendants. That plaintiff has no adequate and available remedy at law against said publications by apy action for damages, inasmuch as the injury is a continuous one and would involve endless litigation, and is furthermore of such a nature, affecting plaintiff\u2019s reputation in places far remote from each other throughout Great Britain and America, that its extent could not be measured or estimated, or proof of the full measure thereof procured, and that plaintiff is remediless at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-7\">Wherefore, plaintiff prays for judgment:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-8\">(1) That the defendants, their officers, agents, servants and sales agents, be forever enjoined and restrained from publishing or circulating any letter or part of a letter written by plaintiff or alleged to have been written by him, and from publishing or advertising any statement or opinion at any time expressed by plaintiff, or alleged or pretended to have been expressed by plaintiff regarding Soden Mineral Pastilles or any other medicinal preparation, and from in any manner using or publishing plaintiff\u2019s name in their business or in aid or furtherance thereof</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-9\">(2) That the said defendants, their agents and ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>vants, and all other persons circulating or publishing said advertisements, circulars or wrappers, or any other publication, circular, cut or device containing any recommendation by plaintiff of said Soden Mineral Pastilles, or having any such advertisement, circular, publication, cut or device in his or their possession or control, be required to surrender the same to be destroyed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-5\">(3) For a temporary injunction against the acts aforesaid during the pendency of this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-6\">(4) For such other and further relief as may be just in the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-7\">(5) For ten thousand dollars ($10,000) damages by reason of the acts aforesaid, together with the costs of this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-8\">The substance of the exhibits annexed are stated in the complaint.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b460-9\"><em>Simon Sterne, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"An7\">I. The acts complained of are an unwarrantable invasion of the reasonable right of privacy (Citing, <em>Article in Harvard Law Review, December, </em>1890, <em>on the Right of Privacy), </em>Prince Albert <em>v. </em>Strange, 2 <em>DeG. &amp; Sm. </em>652; Millar <em>v. </em>Taylor, 4 <em>Burr. </em>2378 ; Pollard <em>v. </em>Photographic Co., 40 <em>Chan.

C., </em>387.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b460-10\">II. The labels wrere injurious to plaintiff\u2019s professional reputation, and an injury to that reputation is an injury to property (Citing, Dixon <em>v. </em>Holden, <em>L. R. </em>7 <em>Eq. Cas. </em>488, 492); Rauth <em>v. </em>Webster, 10 <em>Beav. </em>561; Clark <em>v. </em>Freeman, 11 <em>Id. </em>112 ; Springhead Cotton Spinning Co. <em>v. </em>Riley, <em>L.

Charging an infraction of professional rules is an actionable wrong (Citing Hunter <em>v. </em>Sharpe, 4 <em>F. &amp; F. </em>983). The libel may be enjoined (Citing Quartz Hill G. M. Co. <em>v. </em>Beall, 20 <em>Chanc. Div. </em>501 ; Beddaw <em>v. </em>Beddaw, 9 <em>Id. </em>89 ; Thomas <em>v. </em>Williams, 14 <em>Id. </em>864; Loog <em>v. </em>Beam, 26 <em>Id. </em>306; Rollins <em>v. </em>Hinks, <em>L.

The publication of the false recommendation was a fraud on the plaintiff, and upon the public (Citing Perry <em>v. </em>Truefit, 6 <em>Beav. </em>66; Croft <em>v. </em>Day, 7 <em>Id. </em>84; Devlin <em>v. </em>Devlin, 69 <em>N. Y. </em>212 ; Blumthal <em>v. </em>Straus <em>N. Y. Sup. </em>393 ; Morgan <em>v. </em>Schuyler, 79 <em>N. Y. </em>490).</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-6\">IV. An individual has a property in his own name (Citing Hogg <em>v. </em>Kirby, 8 <em>Vesey, </em>215 ; Farmer\u2019s Loan &amp; Trust Co. <em>v. </em>Farmer\u2019s Loan &amp; Trust Co. of Kansas, 21 <em>Abb.
