Bigelow, in which the summonses were served by publication, and that Bigelow had not appeared in any of the actions but had made default; that letters testamentary had issued to the defendant in this action, William H. Kim-ball, as executor of the will of Pliny-Wright; that by the will certain real estate of testator was devised to Kimball in trust with power of sale to convert 'into money; that Bigelow was entitled [to share in the proceeds as legatee. It was also alleged that attachments had issued in the action's against Bigelow. The judgment demanded was \u201c that the interest of the said Rollin A. Bigelow in the property of said Pliny Wright, deceasedj be ascertained and determined, and that after the same shall have been ascertained and determined, and he shall be entitled to receive the same under the said will of the said Pliny Wright, deceased, that the same be paid over to this plaintiff to be applied by him in satisfaction of the judgments which m\u00e1y be obtained in the actions described in this complaint, and that an injunction may be granted herein enjoining and restraining the defendant herein from otherwise disposing of the interest of the said Rollin A.

The attachment debtor\u2019s interest in the testator\u2019s estate can be attached without resort to equity (Citing Rundle <em>v. </em>Allison, 34 <em>N.

The complaint does not show that there is no property of the attachment debtor on which a levy could be made without resort to equity (Dunlevy <em>v. </em>Tallmadge, 32 <em>N.

Pro. \u00a7 655, subd. 2, an action could not be bi'ought in aid of an attachment, to reach property the legal title to which had been fraudulently transferred by the attachment debtor (Thurber <em>v. </em>Blanck, 50 <em>N. Y. </em>80; Anthony <em>v. </em>Wood, 96 <em>Id. </em>180; Throop Grain Cleaner Co. <em>v. </em>Smith, 110 <em>Id. </em>83). Sections 649 and 655 were amended to provide a remedy in such cases (see note, 23 <em>Abb. N. C. </em>9).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number><em>George C.

Section 655 Code Civ. Pro. was amended in 1889 by adding thereto as follows: \u201c2. Where the summons was served without the state, or by publication, pursuant to an order obtained for that purpose, as prescribed in chapter fifth of this act; and where the defendant has not appeared in the action (otherwise than specially) but has made default and before entering final judgment, the sheriff may in aid of said attachment, maintain an action against the attachment debtor, and any other person or persons, or against any other person or persons to compel the discovery of any thing in action, or other property belonging to the attachment debtor; and of any money, thing in action, or other property due to him, or held in trust for him, or to prevent the transfer thereof, or the payment or delivery thereof, to him or any other person, and the sheriff may, in aid of said attachment, also maintain any other action against the attachment debtor and any other person or persons, or against any other person or persons, which may now be maintained by a judgment creditor in a court of equity, either before the return of an execution in aid thereof, or after the return of an execution unsatisfied. The judgment in any of the above mentioned actions must provide and direct that the said property shall be applied by the sheriff to the satisfaction of any judgment which the plaintiff may obtain in the attachment action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">But the case stated in the complaint is not within the mischief the amendment was intended to remedy. The plaintiff could levy the attachment without the help of this new provision. Bigelow, the attachment debtor, holds a claim against this defendant for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>legacy; he can enforce the claim by action under section 1819 of the Code, or by proceedings before the Surrogate under section 2717. This claim is therefore personal property incapable of manual delivery, and can be attached under subd. 3, of section 649, by leaving with the defendant a certified copy of the warrant, with a notice showing that the legacy is the property attached. If there are any facts which would prevent, impair or defeat such a levy or make it inexpedient or impracticable, the complaint does not disclose them.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The purpose of the amendment was to provide a remedy where it was necessary and proper, not to invite or authorize an unnecessary action.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">It had been held that an action could not be brought in aid of an attachment to reach property fraudulently, transferred by an attachment debtor (Thurber <em>v. </em>Blanck, 50 <em>N. Y. </em>80; Anthony <em>v. </em>Wood, 96 <em>Id. </em>180; Throop, etc. <em>v. </em>Smith, 110 <em>Id. </em>83). It followed from this holding that where a non-resident, owning property in this state, fraudulently transferred it, and then was sued for money upon contract, by service of the summons without the state, or by publication, pursuant to an order, and he did not appear in the action, but made default, no jurisdiction was acquired. The person of the defendant was not brought within the jurisdiction of the court of this state, for the laws of the state cannot reach beyond its territorial limits (Freeman <em>v. </em>Alderson, 119 <em>U. S. </em>185). The fraudulently transferred property could not be attached; the court had neither person nor thing within its power (Schwinger <em>v. </em>Hickok, 53 <em>N. Y. </em>280 ; Bartlett <em>v. </em>Spicer, 75 <em>Id. </em>528). The amendment enables the court to establish the non-resident debtor\u2019s title to the property and thereby to establish its jurisdiction of it. If the nonresident debtor holds the legal title, then jurisdiction of the property is acquired by levying the attachment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>by seizing it, or, if incapable of manual delivery, in the manner already pointed out.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The complaint states no facts constituting any equitable cause of action. The statute provides for an equitable action, but the provision is for those who have equities making the remedy appropriate, not for' those who have none. The law provided the plaintiff an ample remedy, and any action is needless. The plaintiff\u2019s case is within the letter, but without the spirit of the statute, and thus without the statute itself. \u201cThe letter killeth, while the spirit keepeth alive \u201d (Tracy <em>v. </em>Troy and Boston R. R. Co., 38 <em>N. Y. </em>437).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The interlocutory judgment reversed with costs,. and judgment directed for the defendant upon the demurrer with costs, with the usual leave' to plaintiff to amend the complaint upon payment of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Learned, P. J., Mayham, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
