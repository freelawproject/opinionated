The only reasonable interpretation, therefore, which could be given the language quoted is that it comprehended a possible desire on the part of McCreery to resume possession for the purpose of erecting buildings then remotely contemplated by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">This is its plain and obvious import, the sense in which it is most favorable to the lessees and therefore the sense which must be held to control (Lowber <em>v. </em>Le Roy, 2 <em>Sandf. </em>202; Dwight <em>v. </em>Germania Life Ins. Co., 103 <em>N. Y. </em>341 ; Hoffman et al. <em>v. </em>\u00c6tna Fire Ins. Co., 32 <em>Id. </em>405 ; White <em>v. </em>Hoyt, 73 <em>Id. </em>505 ; Johnsons v. Hathorn, 2 <em>Abb. Ct. App. Dec. </em>469). McCreery\u2019s desire to gain \u2022possession, not for himself, but for a third person, as .his subsequent lessee, who has covenanted to erect \"buildings which, upon the expiration of his lease, are to revert to the lessor, cannot be regarded as having been \u2022in the contemplation of the parties at the time when \u2022the lease between McCreery and the respondents was \u25a0entered into, except upon a distorted process of reasoning, and is not within the operation of the clause above mentioned. That McCreery did not desire possession dor himself to enable him to carry out his own building projects, was made conclusively apparent upon the trial \u00a1from the lease introduced in evidence, by which he granted a leasehold estate therein to the appellant for \u2022the term of forty-two years, commencing immediately \u2022upon the expiration of the term originally demised to the respondents, thus depriving himself of the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>\u25a0claim possession ; and from the further fact that the negotiations for that lease commenced in September, 1890, by which is manifested an absence of desire to resume possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Nor is there any force in the contention of appellant\u2019s \u25a0counsel that the evidence taken upon the trial in the \u25a0court below fails to show notice by respondents of their election to continue their lease for the additional year :as required, pursuant to its terms. The lease provided that should the lessees desire to remain in possession for a further year they \u201c <em>must advise the owner or his agents of their intention so to stay not later than November </em>1 <em>st, </em>1890.\u201d Both Metzger and Schiff, the respondents, testified that before November 1st, 1890, they gave oral notice of such election to one Louis Phillips, a clerk in the employ of L. J. and I. Phillips, the agents \u2022of McCreery, while upon the demised premises in the 'business of his employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">If Louis Phillips was \u25a0 authorized to receive notice for his employers, oral notice was sufficient, as no particular form of notice was prescribed by the lease (McEwen <em>v. </em>Montgomery Co. Mut. Ins. Co., 5 <em>Hill. </em>101). But appellant contends that this notice was ineffectual, first, because L. J. and I. Phillips could not delegate their authority to receive it to a clerk, and second, that, though the power to delegate be conceded, it does not appear that Louis Phillips was .authorized by his employers to receive such notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Both grounds are erroneous. The giving of notice by the respondents at once extended the existing lease \u25a0over the additional year; no further lease was needed ; no assent on the part of the lessor or his agents to the \u25a0extension was required, and the refusal by the lessor or his agents to receive notice could not have impaired the respondent\u2019s right to the extended term (House <em>v. </em>Burr &amp; Spencer, 24 <em>Barb. </em>525). The receipt of respondents\u2019 notice of election was thus an act purely mechani<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>cal, requiring the exercise of neither judgment or discretion, and it is well settled by authority that the. performance of such acts may be delegated by an agent, to another (Grinnell <em>v. </em>Buchanan, 1 <em>Daly, </em>538; Commercial Bank of Lake Erie <em>v. </em>Norton, 1 <em>Hill, </em>501 Weaver <em>v. </em>Carnall v. <em>American Rep. </em>22; Bodine <em>v. </em>Exchange Fire Ins. Co., 51 <em>N. Y. </em>117, 123; Powell <em>v. </em>Tuttle, 3 <em>N. Y. </em>396; Lewis <em>v. </em>Ingersoll, 3 <em>Abb. Ct. of App. Dec. </em>60, <em>Story on Agency, </em>\u00a7 14, etc). The law does not fail to recognize the fact that in the great variety of human affairs and the complex nature of business enterprises the execution of matters of detail must in a great, measure rest upon persons employed in subordinate-capacities, and the rule <em>delegatus non potest delegare </em>is, therefore, never extended tc the employment of servants in the performance of merely ministerial or mechanical duties <em>(Smith\u2019s Master and Servant, </em>299), and a <em>\u201c </em>clerk\u201d is a servant whose authority to act for his master is to be measured and ascertained by the law generally applicable to the relation of master and. servant <em>(Wood\u2019s Master and Servant, </em>\u00a72).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The evidence was abundant to show that. Louis Phillips was authorized by his employers to receive respondents\u2019 notice of election to extend their lease for the additional year, It was not necessary to establish that fact by specific instructions to Louis Phillips to receive the particular notice under consideration, but his authority to receive it can be inferred from the extent of his employment <em>(Smith's Master and Servant, </em>275 ; <em>Wood\u2019s Master and Servant, </em>\u00a7 267 ; <em>Story on Agency, </em>\u00a7 56). Louis Phillips, examined as a witness for appellant, says that in part performance of his duties he assumed \u201c general charge \u201d of the particular premises occupied by the respondents, and this implies that he was authorized to represent his employers in all matters connected with the premises to the extent to which they could lawfully delegate their own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>authority to him, including, as above shown, the receipt of respondent\u2019s notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">Again, the course of business dealing between L. J. &amp; I. Phillips and the respondents, clothed Louis Phillips with apparent general authority to represent his employers in all matters connected with the demised premises which could be lawfully delegated to him. In all their transactions concerning the demised premises and until some time after the oral notice to Louis Phillips, 'the respondents had never met the lessor or either of his agents. They were throughout represented by Louis Phillips. It was Louis Phillips with whom the negotiations for the lease under which respondents were in possession were had. It was from him they learned the conditions upon which the lessor had consented to make a lease to them, and it was to him they stated their assent to the terms finally agreed upon. He attended the execution of the lease by the respondents, received delivery of it for the lessor or his agents, and on behalf of the lessor or his agents made delivery of the copy executed by the lessor in exchange. He collected the rents. He received notice from the respondents of needed repairs, reported the same to his employers, and in turn informed the respondents of his employers\u2019 decision respecting the repairs, and at the notice Louis Phillips was upon the demised premises in the business of such repairs representing his employers. These facts fully justified the respondents in assuming that Louis Phillips was authorized to receive notices affecting the demised premises intended for his \"employers, and in the absence of all evidence tending to show that the respondents, at the time of giving the particular notice under consideration, had knowledge .that the authority of Louis Phillips did not extend to its receipt, his want of authority in that respect cannot \u25a0be subsequently asserted to effect a loss to the-respondents of the benefits intended to be secured by the notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>(Goodrich <em>v. </em>Thompson, 44 <em>N. Y. </em>333 ; Leslie <em>v. </em>Knickerbocker Life Ins. Co., 63 <em>Id. </em>27, 33).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">We have carefully examined the exceptions taken by appellant to the rulings upon the trial, as well as those to the justice\u2019s charge and refusals to charge, but as we-construe the material clauses of the lease to the respondents, and from the view which we entertain of the power of McCreery\u2019s agents to delegate their authority to-receive notice of respondents\u2019 election to Louis Phillips, their clerk, it does not appear that appellant has sustained any harm from the errors alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The verdict was in accord with justice and consistent with the law and the evidence, and the judgment is. affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Allen, P. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
