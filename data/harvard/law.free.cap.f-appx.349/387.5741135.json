Johnson contends the district court\u2019s reliance at sentencing on his pre-sentence investigation report, which includes police reports of unconvicted conduct, violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. Johnson further alleges the district court erred in relying on such hearsay evidence without balancing his confrontation rights against the government\u2019s reasons for denying confrontation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-20\">We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary decisions, as well as the revocation of supervised release, for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Novaton, </em>271 F.3d 968, 1005 (11th Cir.2001) (evidentiary decisions); <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>26 F.3d 110, 112 (11th Cir.1994) (revocation of supervised release). We review <em>de novo </em>the scope of a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>United States v. Cantellano, </em>430 F.3d 1142, 1144 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-21\">Johnson contends that <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), which defines pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>tections guaranteed by the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, should extend to testimonial hearsay evidence in supervised release revocation hearings. That argument fails. The Sixth Amendment right to confront adverse witnesses is guaranteed only in \u201ccriminal prosecutions.\u201d U.S. Const. Amend. VI. The Supreme Court has held that a parole revocation hearing does not constitute a \u201ccriminal prosecution,\u201d <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972), and we have found \u201cno significant conceptual difference between the revocation of probation or parole and the revocation of supervised release.\u201d <em>Frazier, </em>26 F.3d at 113-14. <em>Crawford </em>does not apply to non-capital sentencing proceedings, because the right to confrontation is a trial right, not a sentencing right. <em>Cantellano, </em>430 F.3d at 1146.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Johnson argues that before the district court could rely on hearsay evidence, it was required to balance his confrontation rights against the government\u2019s reasons for denying confrontation. He insists this requirement is independent of the <em>Craiv-ford </em>issue, but it is not. At his hearing Johnson promptly \u201cconceded the violation\u201d of the terms of his supervised release, and the district court relied on hearsay evidence only when sentencing him. In this context Johnson had no confrontation rights to balance against the government\u2019s reasons for denying confrontation. <em>See Cantellano, </em>430 F.3d at 1146 (\u201cThe right to confrontation is not a sentencing right.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Furthermore, the evidence within Johnson\u2019s PSR is uncontested and therefore reliable. It is clearly established that reliable hearsay evidence may be considered at sentencing. <em>See, e.g., </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661; <em>United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1253 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Zlatogur, </em>271 F.3d 1025, 1031 (11th Cir.2001); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a) (2004).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cFacts contained in a [PSR] are undisputed and deemed to have been admitted unless a party objects to them before the sentencing court \u2018with specificity and clarity.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Beckles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 844 (11th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 832 (11th Cir.2006)). \u201c \u2018It is the law of this circuit that a failure to object to allegations of fact in a [PSR] admits those facts for sentencing purposes\u2019 and \u2018precludes the argument that there was error in them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Bennett, </em>472 F.3d at 832); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(A) (stating that a sentencing court \u201cmay accept any undisputed portion of the presentence report as a finding of fact\u201d). Johnson\u2019s brief to this Court does not challenge the PSR\u2019s description of his prior arrests and uncon-victed conduct. Indeed, Johnson has <em>never </em>challenged those descriptions \u2014 not in 1998 when he was sentenced for the underlying drug offenses, and not with any specificity or clarity during his supervised release revocation hearing ten years later. Because Johnson\u2019s PSR must therefore be accepted as accurate, <em>Beckles, </em>565 F.3d at 844 (citations omitted), the district court was well within its discretion to rely on it. <em>See, e.g., Baker, </em>432 F.3d at 1253; <em>Zlato-gur, </em>271 F.3d at 1031.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b412-14\">. Johnson does not challenge the reasonableness of his sentence resulting from the revocation of his supervised release. Thus he has abandoned this claim, and we will not consider the district court's reasons for varying from the guideline range. <em>See United States v. Jernigan, 341 </em>F.3d 1273, 1284 n. 8 <em>(11th </em>Cir.2003) (noting that a claim not \"plainly and prominently\u201d raised is abandoned on appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b413-7\">. The Supreme Court decisions in <em>Crawford </em>and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), do not affect these conclusions. <em>See United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 833 (11th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Faust, </em>456 F.3d 1342, 1348 (11th Cir.2006); <em>United States v.
