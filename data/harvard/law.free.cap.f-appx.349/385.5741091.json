Chen\u2019s motion to reopen was based on her assertion that country conditions in China have changed because China has begun strongly enforcing its child control policy. Because Chen has two children, she argued that she would be subject to this stronger enforcement of the child control policy if she returned to China.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">On petition for review, Chen argues that the BIA failed to give sufficient weight to the documents that she submitted in support of her motion to reopen. Chen concludes that she met her burden of proof, and the BIA should have granted her motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">The BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005). Review \u201cis limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citation omitted). If the BIA fails to explicitly make an adverse credibility finding, then the petitioner\u2019s evidence must be deemed credible on appeal. <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-13\">A party may file only one motion to reopen removal proceedings, and that motion \u201cshall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (B). A motion to reopen must be filed no later than ninety days after the final administrative decision. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). There is an exception to the ninety-day and one-motion limits, which provides that the limits shall not apply if the motion to reopen is \u201cbased on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). To meet this exception, a movant must show \u201cthat evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d <em>Abdi, </em>430 F.3d at 1149 (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-14\">We recently addressed, in <em>Li v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 1371 (11th Cir.2007), the issue of whether to reopen a case in which a Chinese citizen feared sterilization upon being returned to China. In <em>Li, </em>the petitioner, a native of Lianjiang, Fujian Province, China, and the mother of two American-born children, provided, as a part of a motion to reopen, previously unavailable evidence that Fujian officials had intensified their persecution of parents of two children. <em>Id. </em>at 1373. In support of her motion, the petitioner sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>mitted: (1) her own affidavit reporting second-hand accounts of forced sterilization and abortion in Lianjiang in 2005; (2) her mother\u2019s affidavit reporting increased family planning enforcement in Lianjiang and the forcible sterilization of three women after each gave birth to a second child; (3) country reports and other State Department documents; (4) Congressional-Executive Commission evidence and congressional testimony; and (5) newspaper articles discussing forced abortions in Shandong Province. <em>Id. </em>at 1372-73. We determined that the petitioner\u2019s evidence of a recent campaign of forced sterilization in her home village, consistent with government reports, satisfied the criteria for a motion to reopen. <em>Id. </em>at 1375.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In <em>Zhang v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1316 (11th Cir.2009), we again considered the issue of whether to reopen a case based on changed country conditions when a Chinese citizen with multiple children feared returning to China. In <em>Zhang, </em>the petitioner submitted: (1) her own affidavit stating that she had two kids and that her mother was forcibly sterilized in China; (2) a document issued by her city\u2019s government stating that citizens with two children were subject to mandatory sterilization; and (3) a number of background documents about China\u2019s birth control policies. <em>Id. </em>at 1318-19. The BIA denied the petitioner\u2019s claims by concluding that her statement about her mother\u2019s situation was unsubstantiated, and the document from her city\u2019s government was unauthenticated. <em>Id. </em>at 1319. On appeal, we reversed, finding that the BIA failed to give proper consideration to the petitioner\u2019s evidence by failing to explain why it did not credit the documents in question in light of the other record evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 1320.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">In support of her motion to reopen, Chen submitted: (1) an affidavit stating that she has two children and describing second-hand reports of China\u2019s strengthened enforcement of its child control policies; (2) a letter from her cousin, who resides in Chen\u2019s home village of Qunxing in Fujian Province, stating that in 2007 she was forcibly sterilized after having a second child; (3) a 2005 notice from Chen\u2019s village government stating that parents with two children will be sterilized; and (4) various background information on China\u2019s birth control policies and their increased enforcement in recent years against two-child couples living in villages in Fujian Province. This evidence is similar to the evidence that we considered in <em>Zhang </em>and <em>Li, </em>and, as such, this evidence satisfies the criteria for a successful motion to reopen based on changed country conditions. Accordingly, we grant Chen\u2019s petition and vacate and remand this case back to the BIA to reopen Chen\u2019s case and to carefully consider all of the evidence that Chen has provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">PETITION GRANTED, VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
