On appeal, she challenges the loss calculation forming the basis of the district court\u2019s eight-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(E), and she argues that her sentence was unreason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>able. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">A federal grand jury returned an indictment, charging Edmondson and Winzell Bryant with conspiracy to commit credit card fraud from January 2005 to April 2006, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1029(a)(1), (3)-(4), and 371; possession of access device-making equipment with intent to defraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 1029(a)(4) and 2; and production or use of one or more counterfeit access devices with intent to defraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1029(a)(1) and 2. Edmondson pled guilty to the above charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The probation officer prepared a pre-sentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) and set out the offense conduct as follows. On April 30, 2006, an Alabama patrol officer pulled over a Chevrolet Tahoe driven by Bryant and occupied by Edmondson and another man. The officers arrested Bryant at the scene after determining that the vehicle was stolen from Nevada. Recovered from the vehicle was, <em>inter alia, </em>a laptop computer, an electronic credit card reader/skimmer, and two compact discs, one of which was labeled \u201c... Mag Stripe Reading Writing Software.\u201d The computer had been used only for storing and encoding access device numbers and software, and it contained 14 credit card account numbers, all of which appeared to have been skimmed. Also found in the vehicle was a receipt from an Alabama Wal-Mart in the amount of $151.51. A video surveillance tape from that store revealed that Edmondson had made this purchase on a credit card earlier that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">In calculating Edmondson\u2019s guideline range, the probation officer applied, <em>inter alia, </em>an 8-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(E) because the intended loss was more than $70,000, but less than $120,000. Specifically, the probation officer determined that the total intended loss was $119,740, because this figure \u201crepresent[ed] the total of the credit limits of the skimmed credit cards involved in the offense for those accounts the limits could be obtained and $500 for those accounts the limits could not be obtained.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(F)(i)) (providing that, in cases involving stolen or counterfeit credit cards, loss \u201cshall not be less than $500 per access device\u201d). Edmondson\u2019s total offense level was 13, which, when combined with her criminal history category of I, produced an applicable guideline range of 12 to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">Edmondson objected, <em>inter alia, </em>to the probation officer\u2019s loss calculation. The government responded that, according to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Nosrati-Shamloo, </em>255 F.3d 1290 (11th Cir.2001), the district court was permitted to base its loss calculation on the credit limits of the skimmed credit cards. Edmondson replied that <em>Nosrati-Shamloo </em>was distinguishable because, unlike the defendant in that case, she had not been convicted of similar offenses in the past and therefore did not have a sophisticated knowledge of the credit card industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">At the sentencing hearing, the court began by stating that it was required to impose a sentence that was sufficient but not greater than necessary to achieve the statutory purposes of sentencing. In this respect, it stated that, although advisory, it was also required to calculate and consider EDMONDSON\u2019S applicable guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">Despite stipulating that $119,740 represented the total credit limit of the skimmed credit cards, defense counsel reiterated his objection to the probation officer\u2019s loss calculation. In response, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>government called Special Agent Alton Story of the United States Secret Service. In accounting for Edmondson\u2019s small purchase at the Alabama Wal-Mart, Special Agent Story explained that \u201clarge purchases will tend to raise more eyebrows and be scrutinized more so than a smaller purchase.\u201d Story further pointed out that an individual will not likely know the credit limit of the skimmed card, and using a credit card beyond its credit limit will result in more scrutiny by the retailer. Special Agent Story also testified that, during the course of his investigation, he received an incident report from the Las Vegas Police Department providing that Edmondson had cashed two counterfeit checks in December 2004. In addition, Special Agent Story obtained an internal investigative report from Citigroup Financial Services providing that Edmondson was a suspect in an ongoing credit card skimming case involving a Las Vegas restaurant. Finally, Story testified that it was generally \u201cvery tough\u201d to uncover credit card skimming operations because they are covert, and that credit card fraud results in estimated losses of over one billion dollars each year.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">On cross examination, Special Agent Story acknowledged that, over the last ten years, Bryant had been investigated for credit card fraud in several different states, that he was a \u201ccareer accomplished credit card skimmer,\u201d and that his nickname, \u201cDiamond,\u201d was the password to the laptop computer found in the Tahoe. In this regard, both the government and the court acknowledged that Bryant was the \u201cmaster mind\u201d of the operation and had been implicated in several other credit card fraud cases as well. Special Agent Story also clarified that, although Edmondson used fraudulent credit cards in both the instant case and the Las Vegas case, there was no evidence that she skimmed credit cards. On this point, however, Story emphasized that Edmondson was present in a stolen vehicle that was \u201ca mobile credit card skimming plant,\u201d and he clarified on redirect examination that it was the use of a skimmed credit card, rather than the act of skimming, that caused the financial harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">In overruling Edmondson\u2019s loss objection, the court quoted from a portion of <em>Nosrati-Shamloo </em>permitting loss calculations based on credit limits. The court further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-8\">... [T]he defendant could have, has offered no evidence that they backed out, they were caught with the credit card access information, credit card numbers, devices, et cetera, gained access to the credit line and the theory is that they will continue to use it until they couldn\u2019t use it any more, thus reaching the credit limit. And that it\u2019s not very persuasive for a defendant to come in here and say I should only be charged with what I actually used when I really didn\u2019t even know what the credit limit was. It doesn\u2019t really make sense because it is apparent to me that but for being caught, this conspiracy of individuals, this group of individuals who had an operation going on where they were skimming credit card numbers, utilizing them, it has many sources that make the conspiracy happen. It has the people that skim, the people that input, the people that encode it onto credit cards, the people that take those credit cards and get money off them, et cetera, all being together to make the conspiracy work....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-9\">... [T]he circumstantial evidence is clear that she was a fully active participant in the conspiracy, that she was, because she was riding around in the plant, if you will, that had access to the computer[,] that she was more than just somebody who would be given a credit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>card and said go in and cash, do this and then we\u2019ll give you 20 dollars back. She actually was transported from Las Vegas apparently down here with this other guy, Diamond ... It\u2019s not just like they came down here and hired somebody on the street to go use a credit card to get 20 dollars back.... Circumstantial evidence makes it clear that she was far more important to the conspiracy, involved in the conspiracy, an integral part of it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">After dispensing with Edmondson\u2019s remaining objections, the court adopted the guideline calculations in the PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The court then invited the parties to address the appropriate sentence to be imposed. Defense counsel called Edmondson\u2019s brother, who stated that Edmondson had obtained a job since the time of her arrest, and he speculated that the absence of any family structure or support contributed to her criminal activity. Defense counsel then requested the court to vary downward to a sentence of probation, emphasizing that: Bryant preyed on Edmondson when she was at her most vulnerable, specifically, following her separation from her husband, upon whom she had been entirely dependent; Edmondson lacked a criminal history; and, since being arrested two years earlier, Edmondson had obtained a legitimate job and was living independently for the first time. After Edmondson briefly apologized to the court, the government responded by requesting the court to impose an upward variance to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment, emphasizing that, although Edmondson was less culpable than Bryant, she was involved in cashing counterfeit checks and credit card skimming in Las Vegas, thus demonstrating a pattern of activity, and that there was a strong need for general deterrence, as credit card skimmers are rational actors, remain difficult to detect, and cause massive financial harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">After the court reviewed the guideline calculations and noted that Bryant had previously been sentenced to 36 months\u2019 imprisonment, the court stated that it had considered all of the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), specifically mentioning the need for its sentence to \u201cafford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, protect the public from further crimes of this defendant, to reflect the seriousness of the offense, and to promote respect for the law and provide just punishment for the offense.\u201d The court then pronounced its sentence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-9\">The defendant \u2014 and, ma\u2019am, I understand that you are standing before me telling me how you\u2019ve changed and et cetera and how you are sorry for what you did, and I trust that you\u2019re absolutely correct. I trust that you are really sorry and that you are not going to do it again. I hope you don\u2019t. But I am also bothered by the fact this [went] on for a while, that you chose stealing, you chose traveling long distances to steal, not just stealing in a grocery store or shoplifting to get food. You sat out in a conspiracy to actively go cross country stealing. And that is not the kind of thing I think that somebody that they got divorced and they\u2019re either down on their luck all that kind of stuff, there is a lot of folks that happens to and they don\u2019t go and start stealing. It\u2019s not an excuse. I think that you were more involved. It shows the kind of conduct is just not, in my opinion, an 18 month sentence. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a 24 month sentence, but I do think it\u2019s a 22 month sentence.... The sentence, I think, is appropriate; it is not more than necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals when I consider the factors that I have delineated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQg\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">\u201c[A] sentence may be reviewed for procedural or substantive unreasonableness.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number><em>United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1182 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). The factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-4\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 786 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a))</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">A district court commits procedural error if it, <em>inter alia, </em>improperly calculates the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range or \u201cfail[s] to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). On the latter point, the district court \u201cmust adequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">\u201cAssuming that the district court\u2019s sentencing decision is procedurally sound, the appellate court should then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In conducing this review, we \u201ctake into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, we \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, \u201cwe will only reverse a procedurally proper sentence if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.... \u201d <em>United States v. McBride, </em>511 F.3d 1293, 1297-98 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">A. Loss Calculation</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">\u201cA district court\u2019s determination regarding the amount of loss for sentencing purposes is reviewed for clear error.\u201d <em>Nosrati-Shamloo, </em>255 F.3d at 1291. Under the Guidelines, \u201closs is the greater of actual loss or intended loss.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(A)). \u201c \u2018Intended loss\u2019 (I) means the pecuniary harm that was intended to result from the offense; and (II) includes intended pecuniary harm that would have been impossible or unlikely to occur....\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.3(A)(ii)). \u201cThe court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss. The sentencing judge is in a unique position to assess the evidence and estimate the loss based upon that evidence. For this reason, the court\u2019s loss determination is entitled to appropriate deference.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.3(C)).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-12\">In <em>Nosrati-Shamloo, </em>the defendant was convicted of stealing mail after opening credit card accounts in other peoples\u2019 names and removing the corresponding, incoming credit cards from their mailboxes. <em>See </em>255 F.3d at 1290-91. On appeal, we addressed whether the district court clearly erred in calculating intended loss based on the total credit limits of the credit cards \u201cwhen the actual charges made against the cards were less, the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>dence was circumstantial and unclear about whether defendant knew the actual credit limits on the cards, and when no evidence shows that Defendant\u2019s intent was something other than to make use of the full line of credit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1291. We answered that question in the negative, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">Today, we decide that once a defendant has gained access to a certain credit line by fraudulently applying for credit cards, a district court does not err in determining the amount of the intended loss as the total line of credit to which Defendant could have access, especially when Defendant presents no evidence that he did not intend to utilize all of the credit available on the cards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-6\"><em>Id. </em>Because the defendant in that case \u201cpresented no evidence that tended to show that he did not intend to use all of the credit available on the cards,\u201d we concluded that the district court did not clearly err in its intended loss calculation. <em>Id. </em>at 1292.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">In this case, the district court relied on <em>Nosrati-Shamloo </em>and calculated Edmondson\u2019s intended loss based on the total credit limits of the skimmed credit cards. On appeal, Edmondson does not explicitly attempt to distinguish <em>Nosrati-Shamloo,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but rather emphasizes that neither she nor Bryant likely knew what the credit limits were. While Special Agent Story\u2019s testimony at sentencing supports this fact, the evidence in <em>Nosrati-Shamloo </em>was similarly unclear as to whether the defendant knew the applicable credit limits. 255 F.3d at 1291 (noting that \u201cthe evidence was circumstantial and unclear about whether defendant knew the actual credit limit on the cards\u201d). Edmondson also emphasizes the fact that she charged only $151.51 on one skimmed credit card, but that fact also does not distinguish <em>Nos-rati-Shamloo, </em>as \u201cthe actual charges made against the cards were less\u201d than the credit limits in that case well. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">Under <em>Nosrati-Shamloo, </em>it was Edmondson\u2019s burden to present some other type of evidence \u201cthat tended to show that [s]he did not intend to use all of the credit available on the cards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1292; <em>see, e.g., United States v. Sowels, </em>998 F.2d 249, 251 (5th Cir.1993) (\u201cHad Sowels completed or withdrawn from his offense before being apprehended, he might have been able to rebut the evidence that he intended to charge the cards to their limit. Given that authorities cut short his plans, however, the district court did not clearly err.\u201d). Because she failed to present any such evidence, the district court did not clearly err in its intended loss calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">B. Miscellaneous Reasonableness Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">Edmondson argues that the district court\u2019s sentence was unreasonable for several additional reasons. First, she argues that the district court did not adequately explain the reasons for its upward variance, but the sentencing transcript indicates that the district court imposed an upward variance based on the nature of the conspiracy and Edmondson\u2019s participation therein. Specifically, the court emphasized that Edmondson was a \u201cfully active\u201d and \u201cintegral\u201d part of the conspiracy, as she traveled with Bryant from Nevada to Alabama in a \u201cmobile [credit card skimming] plant\u201d on a \u201ccross country stealing\u201d operation. Furthermore, and despite crediting the sincerity of Edmondson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>apology, the district court found that her primary argument in mitigation \u2014 namely, that she was in a vulnerable position after separating from her husband \u2014 did not excuse such behavior. Thus, the district court adequately explained the reasons for its variance, and its explanation, based on the particulars of Edmondson\u2019s case, belies her contention that the court generalized the sentencing process.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Edmondson next challenges the court\u2019s reliance on general deterrence on the ground that the best way to deter credit card fraud is by changing the way the system is regulated. However, the district court was not charged with overhauling the regulation of the credit card industry, but was rather required to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including general deterrence, and fashion a sentence that was appropriate under the current state of affairs. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B) (instructing the court to consider \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Edmondson next emphasizes that Bryant was the \u201cmaster mind\u201d of the conspiracy and a \u201ccareer accomplished credit card skimmer,\u201d yet only received a 36-month sentence. However, Edmondson fails to recognize that Bryant\u2019s 36-month sentence was substantially higher than her own 22-month sentence, thus reflecting his greater degree of culpability and criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Finally, Edmondson cites four cases in an attempt to show an unwarranted sentencing disparity. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) (instructing the district court to consider \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct\u201d). The only binding case that she cites is our decision in <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946 (11th Cir.2005), in which we vacated the district court\u2019s ten-month sentence and remanded for re-sentencing in light of <em>Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> Id. </em>at 947-49. However, Edmondson\u2019s reliance on <em>Paz </em>is unavailing because the defendant in that case, unlike Edmondson, pled guilty only to a single violation of \u00a7 1029(a)(1), was responsible for no more than $70,000 in losses, and had no apparent, prior involvement in fraudulent activity. 405 F.3d at 947-48. The three other decisions that Edmondson cites are all similarly distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">In light of the foregoing, Edmondson has not met her burden to show that the district court\u2019s sentence was unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Accordingly, we affirm her sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-8\">. In this respect, Edmondson has abandoned her argument, raised below, that <em>Nosrati-Shamloo </em>is distinguishable on the ground that, unlike the defendant in that case, she was a mere \"courier\u201d or \u201crunner.\u201d <em>See United States v. Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d 1343, 1344 (11th Cir.1998) (stating that arguments not raised on appeal are abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b542-7\">. <em>United States v.
