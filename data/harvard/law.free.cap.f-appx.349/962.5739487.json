New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Derrow also moves for the appointment of counsel. Derrow previously filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, challenging his conviction and sentence for conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute crack cocaine and possession with the intent to distribute crack cocaine. His \u00a7 2255 motion was denied, and his motion for a certificate of appeala-bility was denied by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">In order to obtain leave to proceed IFP, Derrow must show that he is a pauper, and he must raise a nonfrivolous issue. <em>See Jackson v. Dallas Police Dep\u2019t, </em>811 F.2d 260, 261 (5th Cir.1986). Derrow argues that his sentence is unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi, </em>his counsel was ineffective in failing to raise the issue on appeal, and the district court erroneously denied his motion. Derrow\u2019s motion filed in the district coui't was an unauthorized motion which the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994). Derrow\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">Accordingly, Derrow\u2019s request for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED. His motion for appointment of counsel is also DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b986-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
