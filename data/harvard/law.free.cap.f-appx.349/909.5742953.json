Xiao alleges that he will be forced to undergo a sterilization procedure upon his return to China because he fathered two children in the United States, and thus the BIA erred in denying his application.</p>\n<p id=\"AL5\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of an application for withholding of removal and protection under CAT under the substantial evidence test. <em>Zamora-Morel v. INS, </em>905 F.2d 833, 838 (5th Cir.1990). Under that standard of review, reversal is improper unless we decide \u201cnot only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but also that the evidence <em>compels </em>it.\u201d <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 306 (5th Cir.2005) (citing <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"AR9X\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B)(i), Xiao is entitled to withholding his removal if he can prove that his life or freedom would be threatened in China because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(2), Xiao is entitled to protection under CAT if he can establish that it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted in China on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"A4A\">In this case, Xiao offered no support for his assertion that he would be forcibly sterilized upon returning to China. The report by the U.S. Department of State entitled \u201cChina: Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions\u201d that Xiao offered into evidence highlights the general population and family planning laws in China, but as the Population and Family Planning Regulations of Fujian Province note, the penalty for not meeting the population and family planning regulations is a social maintenance fee, not sterilization. <em>See </em>Administrative Record (A.R.) at 35356. Xiao\u2019s testimony before the Immigration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>Judge establishes Xiao\u2019s fear in returning to China, but his testimony provides no evidence that his life or freedom would be threatened upon his return to China. <em>See </em>A.R. 16078. Based on the insufficient evidence presented by Xiao, it is clear that the BIA did not err in denying Xiao\u2019s application for withholding of removal and protection under CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">For the above reasons, we deny the petitioner for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b934-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
