He argues that the district court committed significant procedural error by imposing a sentence within the pertinent guidelines range without giving specific reasons for rejecting his nonfrivolous arguments in favor of a sentence below this range. He requests this court to vacate his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-11\">We review Sandoval-Rojas\u2019s argument for plain error because he raises it for the first time on appeal. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). To show plain error, Sandoval-Rojas must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but will do so only if the error substantially affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b962-20\">Even if the district court erred by not providing adequate reasons for rejecting Sandoval-Rojas\u2019s arguments, he still has not shown that he should receive relief on this claim. This is because Sandoval-Rojas has failed to show that a more extensive explanation for his sentence would have resulted in his receiving a different sentence. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 364. Additionally, Sandoval-Rojas\u2019s argument that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically-based, and therefore, his sentence should not be afforded the appellate presumption of reasonableness has consistently been rejected by this court. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530-31 (5th Cir. 2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009); <em>Mon-dragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 366-67. Because the district court imposed a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range, it is presumptively reasonable. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 346-47, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Sandoval-Rojas\u2019s assertions that his criminal history was overstated are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonable<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>ness. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, 523 </em>F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, 523 </em>F.3d 519, 526 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 616 (2008). Because Sandoval-Rojas has not shown that the sentence imposed was unreasonable, his sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b962-12\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
