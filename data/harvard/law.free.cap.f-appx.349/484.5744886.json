We granted a certificate of appealability on two issues: (1) \u201c[w]hether Lugo established that his counsel was ineffective for failing to communicate a plea offer to him,\u201d and (2) \u201c[w]hether Lugo established that his counsel was ineffective for acting under a conflict of interest.\u201d Lugo contends that his trial attorney failed to inform him of a plea offer from the government. He also contends that his court-appointed trial attorney had a financial conflict of interest because Lugo\u2019s family had refused his offer to retain him as private counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-15\">In a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding, we review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>Devine v. United States, </em>520 F.3d 1286, 1287 (11th Cir.2008). A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo. Id. </em>We give \u201csubstantial deference to the factfinder ... in reaching credibility determinations with respect to witness testimony.\u201d <em>United States v. McPhee, </em>336 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-16\">Under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), a defendant claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must show (1) that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Id. </em>A petitioner seeking relief under \u00a7 2255 on the basis of ineffective counsel must succeed on both prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>test. <em>Butcher v. United States, </em>368 F.3d 1290, 1293 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-17\"><em>Strickland </em>applies not only to trial performance, but also to counsel\u2019s advice on plea decisions. <em>Coulter v. Herring, </em>60 F.3d 1499, 1503-04 (11th Cir.1995) (citing <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 58, 106 S.Ct. 366, 370, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985)). In this case, the first prong of <em>Strickland </em>requires Lugo to show by a preponderance of the evidence that his decision not to plead guilty was not voluntary because he re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>eeived advice from counsel that was below the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases. <em>See Hill, </em>474 U.S. at 56-58, 106 S.Ct. at 369-70; <em>Gallo-Chamorro v. United States, </em>233 F.3d 1298, 1303 (11th Cir.2000) (stating a preponderance standard for proving deficient performance). The second prong requires Lugo to \u201cestablish that \u2018counsel\u2019s constitutionally ineffective performance affected the outcome of the plea process,\u2019 \u201d meaning that Lugo \u201c \u2018must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would have pleaded guilty and would not have insisted on going to trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Coulter, </em>60 F.3d at 1504 (quoting <em>Hill, </em>474 U.S. at 59, 106 S.Ct. at 370 (alteration omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Failing to communicate a plea offer is, at a minimum, inconsistent with counsel\u2019s duty to \u201cconsult with his client on important decisions and to keep him informed of important developments in the course of the prosecution.\u201d <em>Diaz v. United States, </em>930 F.2d 832, 834 (11th Cir.1991). But even if such a failure necessarily constitutes \u201cdeficient performance\u201d under <em>Strickland, see Johnson v. Duckworth, </em>793 F.2d 898, 900 (7th Cir.1986), Lugo\u2019s claim fails because he cannot show that he was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s alleged omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Although the district court never resolved the dispute over whether or not Lugo\u2019s counsel informed him of the government\u2019s written plea offer, the court found that counsel did in fact meet with Lugo to discuss in general terms the possibility of pleading guilty, and that Lugo refused and insisted on going to trial. The government\u2019s proposed deal offered little more than Lugo could have gotten by pleading guilty without any agreement. In either case Lugo would have been eligible for a three-level reduction in return for acceptance of responsibility and timely notification of intent to plead guilty. The government promised to recommend a sentence at the low end of the guidelines range, and Lugo actually received that same low-end sentence. The only additional benefit the government offered was the possibility of further reduction if Lugo provided \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d to the prosecution. While Lugo now claims he would have accepted that deal had he known about it, his attorney testified that Lugo not only refused to consider cooperating with the government but in fact became offended at any suggestion that he might do so. The district court, whose determinations of credibility are entitled to substantial deference, did not clearly err in finding that Lugo would have rejected the government\u2019s offer if counsel had told him about it. Because Lugo has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by his attorney\u2019s failure to inform him of the plea offer, he has failed to establish that his right to counsel was impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>a petitioner\u2019s contention that his attorney provided ineffective assistance due to a conflict of interest. <em>Caderno v. United States, </em>256 F.3d 1213, 1218 (11th Cir.2001). Under <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 348, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 1718, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980), the petitioner must prove both that (1) his attorney had an actual conflict of interest, and (2) the conflict adversely affected the attorney\u2019s performance. <em>Reynolds v. Chapman, </em>253 F.3d 1337, 1342 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Lugo argues that his counsel had a financial conflict of interest stemming from the refusal of Lugo\u2019s family to hire him as a private attorney. To satisfy the first prong of <em>Cuyler, </em>however, Lugo cannot merely show the \u201cpossibility\u201d of a conflict, but \u201cmust establish that an actual financial conflict existed by showing that his counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>actively represented his own financial interest.\u201d Cade<em>rno, </em>256 F.3d at 1218. Lugo must be able to point to specific evidence in the record showing that his attorney actually made decisions that benefitted the attorney but harmed the client. <em>See Reynolds, </em>253 F.3d at 1343 (quoting <em>Smith v. White, </em>815 F.2d 1401, 1404 (11th Cir.1987)). To meet the second prong of <em>Cuyler, </em>Lugo must show that the conflict adversely affected his attorney\u2019s performance by demonstrating that (1) his attorney could have pursued a plausible alternative strategy, (2) the alternative strategy was reasonable, and (3) the alternative strategy was not followed because it conflicted with the attorney\u2019s own interests. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">While Lugo did present evidence that his appointed trial counsel had unsuccessfully tried to solicit Lugo\u2019s family to retain him privately, he has not shown that his counsel\u2019s performance suffered as a result of that attempt. Aside from counsel\u2019s failure to inform him of the plea offer \u2014 which, the district court found, Lugo would have rejected anyway \u2014 Lugo makes no specific complaints about the quality of his representation. As the district court noted, Lugo\u2019s attorney put on a \u201cvigorous\u201d defense throughout the proceedings, moving to suppress evidence and successfully challenging a sentencing enhancement. Lugo offers nothing to suggest that his attorney gave the case anything less than his best efforts, and so he has failed to overcome the usual presumption that his counsel \u201csubordinate[d] his ... pecuniary interests and honor[ed] his ... professional responsibility to [his] client.\u201d <em>Caderno, </em>256 F.3d at 1219 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
