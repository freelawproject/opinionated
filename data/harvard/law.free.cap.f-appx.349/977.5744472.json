The presentence report (PSR) set De La Luz\u2019s offense level at 18 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6) based on a finding that \u201cthe offense involved intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person.\u201d De La Luz appeals the enhancement, asserting that the adjustment should not have been applied because the aliens had access to oxygen, were not exposed to extreme temperatures, and could exit the vehicle quickly if necessary. <em>See United States v. Zunigar-Amezquita, </em>468 F.3d 886, 889 (5th Cir.2006)(setting forth factors to be considered in applying this adjustment).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">Because the facts related to this adjustment are not in dispute, we review de novo the legal question of the applicability of the adjustment. <em>United States v. Solis-Garcia, </em>420 F.3d 511, 514 (5th Cir.2005). According to the PSR and the addendum, De La Luz was transporting 11 illegal aliens in a minivan rated for seven passengers. <em>See United States v. Mateo Garza, </em>541 F.3d 290, 294 (5th Cir.2008)(indicating in dicta that a vehicle carrying four people more than its rating would \u201c[pjrobably\u201d be considered \u201csubstantially more\u201d than the rated capacity of the vehicle). Additionally, the rear seats of the vehicle had been removed, and the deputy sheriff who had stopped the vehicle identified five unsecured cinder blocks in the rear of the minivan, on which some of the aliens were sitting. The blocks could overturn or become projectiles in the event of an accident, which could cause injuries to an individual sitting on a cinder block or to others in the vehicle. <em>See Zuniga-Amezquita, </em>468 F.3d at 890. Therefore, the aliens faced a greater \u201crisk of injury ... than that faced by an ordinary passenger, without a seatbelt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In light of these aggravating factors, the district court\u2019s imposition of the enhancement is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1002-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
