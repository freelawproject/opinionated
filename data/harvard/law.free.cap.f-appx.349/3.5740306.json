Buniff, Louisiana prisoner # 434890, was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to imprisonment for life. Buniff now seeks a certificate of ap-pealability (COA) to appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 application as time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-27\">A COA will issue only if Buniff has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Because his application was dismissed on procedural grounds, Buniff must show \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">The district court found that, for purposes of calculating the one-year federal limitations period, Buniffs conviction became final on May 9, 2003. The district court found that Buniffs timely motion for reconsideration in the Louisiana Supreme Court did not alter this conclusion. However, after the district court ruled in this case, we held that a timely filed motion for reconsideration should be considered in determining when an applicant\u2019s conviction became final. <em>See Wilson v. Cain, </em>564 F.3d 702, 706 (5th Cir.2009). When Buniffs timely motion for reconsideration is considered, we conclude that his \u00a7 2254 application was filed on the last day of the federal limitations period. Because Buniffs application was not time barred, reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s procedural dismissal to be debatable. <em>See Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">Buniff also must state a valid claim for the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595; <em>Houser v. Dretke, </em>395 F.3d 560, 562 (5th Cir.2004). Buniff argues that his trial counsel was ineffective in several respects. However, because the district court did not consider the substance of Buniffs claims, the record is insufficiently developed with respect to his claims that counsel was ineffective. <em>See Whitehead v. Johnson, </em>157 F.3d 384, 388 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Therefore, we grant Buniff a COA on the issue of the timeliness of his \u00a7 2254 application, vacate the judgment of the district court, and remand this case for consideration of the merits of Buniffs claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">COA GRANTED; VACATED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b27-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
