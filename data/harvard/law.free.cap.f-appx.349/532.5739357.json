No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">When a sentencing guideline is amended and given retroactive effect, the district court may reduce an already incarcerated defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under the amendment \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1). A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d \u2014 and is, therefore, unauthorized under section 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). Amendment 706 \u2014 which became retroactive on 3 March 2008, U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 713 (Supp. 1 May 2008) \u2014 reduced by two the base offense levels in crack cocaine sentences calculated pursuant to the drug quantity table, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Here, the district court denied Holsey\u2019s section 3582(c)(2) motion because he was not sentenced pursuant to the drug quantity table but, instead, was sentenced pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, the guideline for firearm offenses. Holsey was convicted on two crack cocaine counts and on one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(c), the drug counts were grouped with, and treated as separate offense characteristics of, the firearm count. Because section 2K2.1 yielded the higher guidelines range, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.3(a), it was used to calculate Holsey\u2019s range of 151 to 188 months. Holsey received a total sentence of 151 months, comprised of 151 months on the drug counts and 120 concurrent months (the statutory maximum) on the firearm count.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">On appeal, Holsey argues that his sentence was based on the drug quantity table. But the record shows clearly that Holsey\u2019s guidelines range was calculated under section 2K2.1. We conclude that the district court determined correctly that it lacked authority to reduce Holsey\u2019s sentence pursuant to Amendment 706 because his guidelines range was unaffected by the amendment. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009) (concluding that defendants sentenced as career offenders were ineligible for sentence reductions under Amendment 706 because their guidelines ranges were not based on the drug quantity offense levels that had been lowered by Amendment 706).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b557-8\">.
