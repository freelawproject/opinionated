No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Appellant, who is serving a 30-year sentence for a 1992 burglary offense, maintains that he is entitled to a \u201cbasic gain-time\u201d sentence reduction under Florida law. Appellant\u2019s efforts to obtain the reduction in state court were unavailing: the state determined that because Appellant was sentenced as an habitual offender, he was entitled to no basic gain-time award.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation denying Appellant habeas relief: (1) Appellant was eligible for no basic gain-time under Florida law; and (2) a challenge to a state court\u2019s interpretation and application of its own statutes and sentencing provisions is not cognizable on federal habeas corpus review.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Appellant argues that the district court erred in its interpretation and application of the Florida gain-time and habitual offender statutes. According to Appellant, the district court failed to recognize that Appellant had a liberty interest in a basic gain-time award and that the liberty interest implicated his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">Federal courts only may entertain a petition for habeas corpus relief filed by a state prisoner if it is based \u201con the ground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a). And under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, a federal court may grant no habeas relief on claims that were earlier adjudicated on the merits in state court, unless the state court\u2019s decision meets one of these tests: (1) it is \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court;\u201d or (2) it is \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">\u201c[S]tate statutes may create liberty interests that are entitled to procedural protections of the Due Process Clause,\u201d <em>Vitek v. Jones, </em>445 U.S. 480, 100 S.Ct. 1254, 1261, 63 L.Ed.2d 552 (1980). A due process constitutional deprivation subject to federal habeas remedy is stated, if at all, only when the petitioner shows \u201ca legitimate claim of entitlement ... through statutory language creating a protectable expectation.\u201d <em>Slocum v. Georgia State Bd. of Pardons &amp; Paroles, </em>678 F.2d 940, 941 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Florida determined that Appellant was statutorily ineligible to receive the basic gain-time credits he seeks; the state statutes upon which Appellant relies support no \u201clegitimate claim of entitlement\u201d and create no protectable expectation. That Appellant casts his quarrel with Florida\u2019s interpretation and application of Florida law in constitutional due process terms fails to transform a claimed violation of state statutes into a constitutional deprivation. No argument is made that Appellant was granted basic gain-time that the state later took away, that the procedures employed by the state failed to pass constitutional muster, or that acts of the state implicated the Ex Post Facto Clause. Appellant\u2019s due process claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Appellant\u2019s claim that the state forum interpreted and applied improperly its gain-time statute is not cognizable on federal habeas review. <em>See Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 112 S.Ct. 475, 480, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991) (\u201cit is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine state-court determinations on state-law questions\u201d); <em>see also, Branan v. Booth, </em>861 F.2d 1507, 1508 (11th Cir.1988) (\u201ca habeas petition grounded on issues of state law provides no basis for habeas relief\u2019 even when couched in due process terms). No error has been shown in the denial of federal habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b408-10\"> Fla. Slat. \u00a7 944.275 (as in effect when Appellant committed his offense) provided generally for two types of gain-time: (1) basic gain-time was to be awarded (subject to forfeiture) upon an eligible inmate\u2019s entrance into the system at the rate of 10 days for each month of the sentence imposed; and (2) incentive gain-time could be awarded on a monthly basis based on behavior and work performance. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 775.084 (as in effect when Appellant committed his offense) provided specifically that habitual offenders \u2014 such as Appellant \u2014 were ineligible for basic gain-time; incentive gain time could be earned. Florida has eliminated the award of basic gain-time altogether for offenses committed on or after 1 January 1994.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
