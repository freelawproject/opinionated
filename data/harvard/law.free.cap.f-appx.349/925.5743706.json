Finding that Martinez had a prior Texas conviction for indecency with a minor, the district court enhanced his base offense level on account of a felony conviction of a crime of violence and sentenced him to 36 months in prison, which was below the guidelines range.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because he did not object to the enhancement or the sentence, review is for plain error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-9\">Counsel for Martinez twice moved to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We denied both motions because of insufficient documentation in the record that would identify the statute that was the basis for Martinez\u2019s Texas conviction. The parties have now supplemented the record with appropriate documents from the state court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-15\">Martinez contends that the record did not establish definitively that he had been convicted of indecency with a child under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 21.11(a)(1). He asserts the state record equally supports a finding that he had been convicted of sexual assault under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 22.011(a)(2)(A), which he contends is not a conviction for a crime of violence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-16\">The jury instructions produced by the Government in response to our earlier order show that Martinez was charged with committing the crime of indecency with a child by engaging \u201cin sexual contact with a child younger than 17 years of age and not his spouse.\u201d The language of the instructions tracks the language of \u00a7 21.11(a)(1), which criminalizes conduct that this court has held constitutes a crime of violence for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2, specifically, the enumerated offense of sexual abuse of a minor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Given the language in the jury instructions, there is no longer any question that Martinez was convicted under \u00a7 21.11(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-17\">Martinez\u2019s Texas conviction was for a crime of violence. Accordingly there was no error and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b950-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm, R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b950-11\">. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b950-12\">. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009), petition for cert. filed (June 24, 2009) (No. 08-11099).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b950-13\">. 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b950-19\">. <em>See Shepard v.

Thus, a conviction under either subsection of \u00a7 21.11 would be for an offense that constitutes a crime of violence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
