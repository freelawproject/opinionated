Cu-Yanes argues that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-18\">In imposing sentence, a district court must properly calculate and consider the guidelines sentencing range, along with the sentencing factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The appellate court must determine whether the district court committed any significant procedural error, such as failing to to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b965-19\">For the first time on appeal, CuYanes asserts that the district court failed to properly consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Though he did argue that the sentence was greater than necessary, that contention did not raise an issue regarding the procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>reasonableness of a sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, we review the procedural reasonableness of Cu-Yanes\u2019s sentence for plain error only.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The record reflects that the district court acknowledged that Cu-Yanes was seeking a downward departure based on the facts underlying his prior conviction and indicated that counsel\u2019s argument was the reason that it was imposing a sentence at the low end of the guidelines range. Accordingly, the district court considered Cu-Yanes\u2019s arguments in imposing sentencing and provided a reasoned basis for its decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">The district court also considered Cu-Yanes\u2019s history of unlawfully entering the United States on several occasions without receiving any criminal penalty, as well as his three prior deportations; as a result, it determined that there was a need to impose a sentence adequate to deter Cu-Yanes from future illegal conduct and to protect the public. The record reflects that the district court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Even assuming that there was an omission by the district court that constituted \u201cerror,\u201d Cu-Yanes has not shown that his substantial rights were affected because he did not prove that the error affected the sentencing outcome.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district court indicated that, but for counsel\u2019s argument, it would have imposed a higher sentence, and it stated emphatically that it would not impose a sentence below sixty months. Cu-Yanes has not shown a procedural error that renders the sentence unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-12\">Cu-Yanes argues that the sentence was substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to effectuate the purposes of sentencing. He argues that the district court should have departed downward or made a downward variance because the sixteen-level enhancement of his offense level was only technically applicable in light of the mitigating circumstances surrounding his prior offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-13\">In reviewing a sentence, this court should \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The district court considered Cu-Yanes\u2019s arguments and, as discussed above, gave proper weight to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The decision to impose a within-the-guidelines sentence, along with the district court\u2019s reasons for denying the downward departure or variance, indicates that the district court determined that Cu-Yanes\u2019s case was a typical case in which the Guidelines provided the appropriate sentence in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Cu-Yanes has not rebutted the presumption that his sentence at the lower end of the guideline range was reasonable. Based on the totality of the circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the 60-month sentence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b966-14\">Cu-Yanes preserves an argument that the presumption of reasonableness should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>not apply to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) because the sixteen-level enhancement provided therein was not the result of empirical evidence or a study. He acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">The sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b965-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
