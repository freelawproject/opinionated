After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">In 1993, Sanders was convicted of drug offenses and sentenced to life imprisonment. This Court affirmed Sanders\u2019s convictions on direct appeal, and the Supreme Court denied Sanders\u2019s petition for certiorari. <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>No. 93-2476, 40 F.3d 388 (11th Cir. Nov. 9, 1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>514 U.S. 1008, 115 S.Ct. 1324, 131 L.Ed.2d 204 (1995). In December 2004 and January 2005, Sanders filed motions requesting permission from the district court to file an untimely motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court denied both motions because Sanders had made no showing to justify an untimely filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">In February 2008, Sanders filed the instant \u00a7 2241 petition challenging the legality of his confinement on numerous grounds. The district court dismissed Sanders\u2019s petition. The district court found that Sanders did not file a timely \u00a7 2255 motion and that there was no basis to equitably toll the one-year time period for filing a \u00a7 2255 motion. Further, the district court concluded that the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255 did not apply, and, therefore, Sanders could not seek relief under \u00a7 2241. Sanders filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-13\">Typically collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). However, under limited circumstances, a provision of \u00a7 2255 permits a federal prisoner to file a habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(a), 2255(e). That provision, known as the \u201csavings clause,\u201d permits a federal prisoner to file a \u00a7 2241 petition if an otherwise available remedy under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [a defendant\u2019s] detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). The savings clause does not permit a prisoner to circumvent the requirements for filing a \u00a7 2255 motion merely by filing a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1245 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-15\">In <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>we established that \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause applies only when: (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that decision established that the petitioner was convicted of a \u201cnonexistent offense\u201d; and (3) \u201ccircuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised at the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1244. In order for a prisoner to avail himself of the \u00a7 2241 remedy, all three <em>Wofford </em>criteria must be met. <em>See id. </em>at 1244. A petitioner may not argue issues raised in his petition until he has \u201copen[ed] the portal\u201d to \u00a7 2241 by demonstrating that the savings clause applies. <em>See id. </em>at 1244 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-16\">On appeal, Sanders has not made any argument that he meets even the first of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>the <em>Wofford </em>criteria. Sanders does not point to any retroactively applicable Supreme Court precedent, much less one that might establish that he was convicted of nonexistent offenses. Because Sanders had not shown the applicability of \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause, we, like the district court before us, do not consider the merits of his \u00a7 2241 petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And, because the savings clause does not apply, the district court properly dismissed Sanders\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-10\">. The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law we review <em>de novo. Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b491-16\">. Even if a petitioner claims the district court lacked jurisdiction in the underlying criminal trial, the petitioner may not avail himself of the \u00a7 2241 remedy under <em>Wofford </em>unless the savings clause criteria are met. <em>See Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1238, 1245 (applying the <em>Wofford </em>criteria to a claim that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over petitioner\u2019s underlying criminal conviction). Likewise, claims of actual innocence are not addressed unless the <em>Wof-ford </em>criteria are met. <em>See id. </em>at 1244 n. 3 (stating that \u201d[o]nce the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 applies to open the portal to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding,\u201d the court can address whether the petitioner can establish actual innocence). Thus, we do not address Sanders's claims of actual innocence or that the trial court lacked jurisdiction in his underlying criminal convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
