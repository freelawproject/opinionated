He argues that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), applies to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings and, as such, the district court was authorized to sentence him below the amended guidelines range. The Government has moved for summary affirmance and, alternatively, for an extension of time in which to file a brief, and the Federal Public Defender has moved to withdraw to allow Nelson to proceed pro se on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">The issue Nelson raises is foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 236-39 (5th Cir. 2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Sept. 21, 2009) (No. 09-6657), which held that <em>Booker </em>is inapplicable to sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582(c) and, thus, that a district court cannot reduce a sentence below the minimum provided in the amended guidelines range. As such, Nelson\u2019s judgment is affirmed, and the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is granted. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is denied. <em>Cf. United States v. Wagner, </em>158 F.3d 901, 902-03 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">AFFIRMED; MOTION FOR SUMMARY AFFIRMANCE GRANTED; MOTION FOR EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE BRIEF DENIED; MOTION TO WITHDRAW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b948-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except undet-the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
