A judgment of conviction and sentence followed. In 2007, the district court denied Rodriguez\u2019s motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-25\">Rodriguez was sentenced to 151 months after being given an enhancement under the career offender provision of the Sentencing Guidelines due to his previous aggravated assault and arson convictions. Rodriguez filed a Section 2255 motion alleging he received ineffective assistance of counsel at the pre-trial, plea, and sentencing phases of his trial because counsel failed to challenge the enhancement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Specifically, Rodriguez argues his previous arson conviction was not a crime of violence as defined by Section 4B1.2. The district court denied Rodriguez\u2019s motion after finding that the arson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>statute under which Rodriguez was convicted, Texas Penal Code \u00a7 28.02, qualifies as a crime of violence within the meaning of Section 4B1.2. Rodriguez appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">After the completion of briefing in this case, we resolved in a different case the exact issue that Rodriguez presents. We determined that the statute under which Rodriguez was convicted falls within the general contemporary meaning of arson and is therefore a crime of violence. <em>United States v. Velez-Alderete, </em>569 F.3d 541, 545 n. 4, 546 (5th Cir.2009). The question Rodriguez posed has now been answered. The challenged sentencing enhancement was properly applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">Rodriguez has moved for appointment of counsel for this appeal. In light of the fact that the very issue he raises has already been resolved, we find no need for appointed counsel in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">The district court\u2019s judgment denying Rodriguez\u2019s Section 2255 motion is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b919-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
