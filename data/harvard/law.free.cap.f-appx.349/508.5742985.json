Akins challenges the denial of his motion to suppress and the sentence he received as an armed career criminal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b533-16\">Officers of the Miami Dade Police Department received an anonymous tip that drugs were being sold and guns were seen during the transactions at a residence in Perrine, Florida. Four detectives on the Crime Suppression Team, Jorge Travieso, Jason Gamble, Alexis Hernandez, and Ricardo Rizzo, drove past the residence in two unmarked police cars and observed three or four men standing in the front yard. The detectives, who were wearing vests marked \u201cPolice\u201d and displaying police badges, parked the police cars in the driveway and approached the house to investigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-17\">As the detectives approached, Akins ran to the back yard with his right hand pressed against the front waistband of his pants. Detective Travieso chased Akins and saw him reach in his pants and pull out a silver object, at which point Detective Travieso yelled, \u201cGun!,\u201d to warn his fellow officers. Detective Rizzo tackled Akins, and a silver gun fell out of Akins\u2019s right hand. Detective Travieso seized and inspected the gun, which was a fully-loaded .44 caliber revolver. Detective Rizzo arrested Akins and seized from his right front pants pocket a white paper towel wrapped around 16 plastic bags of crack cocaine. Akins was transported to a hospital and treated for injuries to his right leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-18\">Akins was indicted for being a felon in possession of a firearm, possession with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>intent to distribute cocaine base, and carrying a firearm during and in relation to trafficking in drugs. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(c)(1)(A), 924(e)(1); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Akins moved to suppress the revolver and the drugs. Akins argued that the police lacked specific, ar-ticulable facts that would allow them to stop him or to seize the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">A magistrate judge held a hearing on Akins\u2019s motion to suppress. Detectives Travieso and Rizzo testified about Akins\u2019s flight, his apprehension, and the seizure of his revolver and the crack cocaine. The owner of the Perrine residence, Dixie Woodard, testified that before Akins\u2019s arrest, her son and some of his friends were holding a barbecue. Ms. Woodard admitted that she did not see Detective Travieso chase Akins and she came out of the house after she heard Akins \u201chollering\u201d that his leg was hurt. Ms. Woodard acknowledged on cross-examination that in the past police had arrested individuals with drugs in her yard.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Akins testified and denied that he had a gun or drugs. Akins testified that he fled from the unmarked cars, he stopped when he realized it was the police, and he was pistol-whipped and kicked by Detective Rizzo.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The magistrate judge recommended that the district court deny Akins\u2019s motion to suppress. The magistrate judge ruled that the combination of the anonymous tip, the high crime area, and Akins\u2019s decision to flee provided the detectives with reasonable suspicion to stop Akins. The magistrate judge also ruled that the detectives could seize both the revolver because it was in plain view and the cocaine because it was discovered during a search incident to Akins\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The district court denied Akins\u2019s motion to suppress. The district court found that the detectives \u201cacted reasonably\u201d by stopping Akins. The court ruled that the detectives acquired reasonable suspicion to further investigate after Akins fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">A jury found Akins guilty of the firearms and drug crimes. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(c)(1)(A), 924(e)(1); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The presentence investigation report listed Akins\u2019s base offense level at 24 because he possessed between 5 and 20 grams of cocaine base. The report listed Akins\u2019s long criminal history and stated that Akins was an armed career criminal because of his three prior convictions in Florida courts for burglary of an unoccupied dwelling, possession with intent to sell or deliver cocaine, and battery on a police officer. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(a). According to the report, Akins battered an officer by striking him on the left knee with a moving vehicle. With a total offense level of 33 and a criminal history of VI, the report listed a sentencing range for Akins between 235 and 293 months of imprisonment, and a consecutive 60-month term for carrying a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">Akins objected to his classification as an armed career criminal. Akins argued that his conviction for battery of a police officer did not qualify as a violent felony under state law. Akins alleged that Florida courts did not consider the crime to be a \u201cforcible felony\u201d because the statute could be violated for an unwanted touching.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court overruled Akins\u2019s objection to his classification. The district court ruled that Akins\u2019s argument was foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>528 F.3d 1318 (11th Cir.2008). The district court sentenced Akins to 293 months for his possession of a firearm, a concurrent sentence of 240 months for his possession of cocaine, and a consecutive sentence of 60 months because Akins was carrying a firearm during his drug crime. The district court explained that it calculated Akins\u2019s sentence based on his long crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>nal history and stated that, \u201ceven if [Akins] were not treated as a career criminal, I think [the time imposed] would be the just sentence under the facts of this case based upon his history.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">On denial of a motion to suppress, we review findings of fact for clear error and the application of law to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Gordon, </em>231 F.3d 750, 753-54 (11th Cir.2000). We construe all facts in the light most favorable to the government. <em>Id. </em>at 754. We apply harmless error review to the sentence imposed and we will not remand if the record establishes that the district court would have imposed the same sentence absent the error. <em>See Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 1121, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Akins presents two arguments for our consideration. First, Akins argues that the police lacked reasonable suspicion to stop him. Second, Akins argues that his prior conviction in Florida for battery on a police officer does not qualify as a violent felony. These arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">The district court did not err by denying Akins\u2019s motion to suppress. The detectives were allowed to approach the Perrine house and investigate the validity of an anonymous tip about cocaine and weapons at a home located in a high crime area and known to host individuals who possess drugs. <em>See United States v. Franklin, </em>323 F.3d 1298, 1301 (11th Cir.2003). At the sight of the police, Akins withdrew a silver object from his pants, and the detectives reasonably interpreted his action as indicia that Akins was engaged in an unlawful activity. <em>See United States v. Heard, </em>367 F.3d 1275, 1280 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201c[A] suspect\u2019s <em>adverse </em>reaction to police may independently <em>corroborate </em>information provided by an anonymous informant.\u201d). Akins\u2019s flight was also suggestive of guilt. <em>Franklin, </em>323 F.3d at 1302; <em>Gordon, </em>231 F.3d at 756-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">Any error in sentencing Akins as an armed career criminal was harmless. The district court stated that, regardless of whether the sentence enhancement applied, it would have imposed the same sentence because of Akins\u2019s long criminal history. <em>See United States v. Keene, </em>470 F.3d 1347, 1348-19 (11th Cir.2006). That sentence was reasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 1349; <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court considered the sentencing factors and explained that a long sentence was necessary to \u201cprotect the public from future crimes [by] [Akins], to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"AFF\">We AFFIRM Akins\u2019s convictions and sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
