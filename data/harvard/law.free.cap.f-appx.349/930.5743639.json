SMITH, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b955-17\">This case concerns the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>Abduction, Oct. 25, 1980, T.I.A.S. No. 11,-670 (the \u201cConvention\u201d), a treaty implemented by the International Child Abduction Remedies Act (\u201cICARA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 11601-11611. The district court held that Anne Dietz had met her burden of proof to make out a claim under the Convention and that John Dietz had not met his burden of proof to assert affirmative defenses. On appeal, John contends that the court erred in rejecting two of those defenses \u2014 the \u201cone year/well settled\u201d exception and the \u201cchild objects/age and maturity\u201d exception. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">John and Anne Dietz were married in New Mexico in 1990. They had two children: Albert in 1994 and Angus in 1998. Throughout the 1990\u2019s, the family lived in various places throughout the American Southwest before moving to Mexico in 1999. Soon after that, the marriage soured, and the couple divorced. The Mexican divorce decree granted Anne custody of both children and John visitation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">At first, John continued to live and work in close proximity to Anne, so the children saw both parents regularly. Later, the children lived at various times with each parent, though more often with their father. The boys would often accompany John on his frequent business trips to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">In January 2006, Anne permitted Albert, who was attending class through an internet school, to travel with his father to the United States and to reside temporarily with his paternal grandparents in Louisiana. John then sued for full custody of Albert and Angus in Mexican court in March 2006. In May 2006, fearing for his life, John abandoned the custody suit, removed Angus from school, and fled with his new family to Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">After pursuing criminal charges against John in a Mexican court in the summer of 2006, Anne, in May 2007, filed in Louisiana state court an application for return of the children under the Convention; John removed the action to federal court. After a bench tidal, the district court, applying the Convention, determined that Albert and Angus had been wrongfully removed from Mexico and that John had failed to meet his burden of proof for any of the Convention\u2019s affirmative defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">John claims that the district court erred when it determined that he did not make out a successful defense under the Convention\u2019s \u201cone year/well-settled\u201d exception with respect to his oldest son, Albert. That exception comes from article 12 of the Convention: At the \u201ccommencement of the proceedings ... [if] a period of less than one year has elapsed from the date of the wrongful removal or retention, the authority concerned shall order the return of the child forthwith.\u201d Additionally, it instructs that \u201ceven where the proceedings have been commenced after the expiration of the period of one year ... [the authority] shall also order the return of the child, unless it is demonstrated that the child is now settled in its new environment.\u201d Convention, art. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-11\">We review conclusions of law <em>de novo </em>and findings of fact for clear error. <em>See, e.g., England v. England, </em>234 F.3d 268, 270 (5th Cir.2000). \u201cA factual finding is not clearly erroneous if it is plausible in light of the record read as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 (5th Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-12\">The district court found that John took Albert from Mexico to Louisiana in January 2006, that John took Angus from Mexico to Louisiana in May 2006, and that Anne sued in state court on July 13, 2007. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>The court also found that the boys had become \u201cwell-settled\u201d in their new environment. If the case consisted merely of these bare facts, it would seem the court erred in failing to give effect to John\u2019s article 12 defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">The court determined, however, that what appeared to be a late filing from Anne was in fact timely, because the one-year period should be equitably tolled. Both ICAEtA and the Convention make no mention of equitable tolling, yet it is well established in caselaw that it applies. <em>See, e.g., Van Driessche v. Esezeoboh, </em>466 F.Supp.2d 828, 850 (S.D.Tex.2006). The district court found that, despite attempts to locate her sons, Anne Dietz did not know definitively where they were until August 2006, meaning that her July 13, 2007, filing was within Article 12\u2019s one-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">John does not attack the use of equitable tolling as such. Indeed, he does not appear to question the court\u2019s application of tolling to the summer of 2006.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather, he argues, because the record reflects that Anne knew where Albert was during the first part of 2006, that period should not be tolled under the court\u2019s stated rationale that Anne could not locate the boys. And thus, even by tolling the one-year requirement from the time Angus was removed on May 19, 2006, until August 2006, the time period between Albert\u2019s removal (January 2006) and Anne\u2019s filing (July 13, 2007) still exceeds one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">John is correct that the record shows that Anne knew that Albert was residing with his grandparents in Louisiana from January 2006 until May 21, 2006. But the record shows just as plainly that Albert was in Louisiana during that period, because Anne consented to his being there. She did not have reason to believe that what was a temporary visit would in fact become permanent until Angus was removed, without her consent, on May 21, 2006.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is, therefore, that date \u2014 not January 2006 \u2014 on which the clock began to run on the article 12 one-year period. The district court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">John claims that the district court erred by failing to give effect to Albert\u2019s and Angus\u2019s stated preference to remain with their father in the United States. Article 13(b) of the Convention provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[t]he judicial or administrative authority may also refuse to order the return of the child if it finds that the child objects to being returned and has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of its views.\u201d ICARA provides that the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>ty opposing the child\u2019s return must establish the child\u2019s maturity by a preponderance of the evidence. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11603(e)(2)(A) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">At the time of trial, Albert was thirteen years old and Angus was nine. After reviewing the report of the child psychologist, Dr. Bouillion, and observing Albert\u2019s and Angus\u2019s testimony at trial, the district court concluded that neither had attained the age and degree of maturity required by article 13(b) to take his views into account. That was a factual determination. <em>See England, </em>234 F.3d at 272. And, given the reliance on live oral testimony, \u201cthe clearly erroneous standard is particularly strong because the judge had the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses].\u201d <em>United States v. Santiago, </em>410 F.3d 193, 197 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">With regard to Albert, the court found him to be \u201chighly defensive,\u201d noting that he spoke in a \u201cshort\u201d and \u201ccurt\u201d manner in a \u201clow monotone\u201d and kept his \u201ceyes cast downward.\u201d Obviously, these are characteristics that a trial court judge, armed with the contemporaneous powers of sight and sound, is better suited to observe than is an appellate panel armed only with a transcript. Nevertheless, the record lends support to the district court\u2019s observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">For instance, the report of Dr. Bouillion, who examined Albert and Angus and testified in court as to his observations, noted that Albert \u201cdemonstrated anxiety during the interview.\u201d Bouillion also observed that despite showing \u201chigh average to superior intelligence,\u201d Albert displayed \u201conly average verbal skills,\u201d performed poorly in school, had been involved in psychotherapy, \u201cneeds help in addressing his self-esteem and mood problems,\u201d and \u201cclearly demonstrates social and emotional immaturity compared to his same age peers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">The district court\u2019s conclusion that Albert was immature for purposes of the Convention\u2019s article 13 defense is in keeping with precedent. For example, in <em>England, </em>we concluded that whether a child is of sufficient age and maturity is a fact-intensive process, and we declined to hold, as a matter of law, that any particular age is sufficient or insufficient to meet the defense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We also noted the \u201cnarrowness of the age and maturity exception to the Convention\u2019s rule of mandatory return,\u201d going so far as to <em>reverse </em>the trial court\u2019s determination that a 13-year old girl was of sufficient age and maturity where the record showed signs of an unstable home life, learning disabilities, and confusion. <em>England, </em>234 F.3d at 272-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-11\">The district court did not credit Angus\u2019s preference, because it found that his views were \u201cunduly influenced by his father.\u201d The court credited Anne\u2019s testimony that Angus said to her, \u201cDaddy\u2019s told me this is all about money and the house, and you want to take this all away from us and put us in foster care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On the witness stand, Angus stated as much himself, adding that he had obtained the information about his mother\u2019s supposed motives from his father, who would show him e-mails from Anne\u2019s brother.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-12\">The district court\u2019s ability to conclude that Angus\u2019s views were unduly influenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>by his father finds ready support in law. \u201cA child\u2019s objection to being returned may be accorded little if any weight if the court believes that the child\u2019s preference is the product of the abductor parent\u2019s undue influence over the child.\u201d Pub. Notice 957, 51 Fed.Reg. 10,494, 10,509 (1986). In <em>In re Robinson, </em>983 F.Supp. 1339, 1344 (D.Colo.1997), the court concluded that an eleven-year-old child\u2019s casually referring to being \u201csettled\u201d (a legal term under the Convention), in response to questions from the court, evidenced undue influence. Similarly, in <em>Hazbun Escaf v. Rodriquez, </em>200 F.Supp.2d 603, 615 (E.D.Va.2002), the court found the thirteen-year old child, \u201clike all adolescents[,] ... susceptible to suggestion and manipulation,\u201d noting that \u201csome of his statements regarding reasons for staying in the United States appeared] to be the product of suggestion, echoing the preferences of his father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">This case is the reverse of <em>England: </em>We are asked whether to defer to the conclusion that the children are immature. \u201cGiven the fact-intensive and idiosyncratic nature of the inquiry, decisions applying the age and maturity exception are understandably disparate.\u201d <em>DeSilva v. Pitts, </em>481 F.3d 1279, 1287 (10th Cir.2007). It is therefore not surprising that there are eases in which children as young as eight have been found to be of sufficient age and maturity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But that does not preclude contrary results in other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">Here, the district court was better positioned to judge the children\u2019s maturity than are we. The court\u2019s factual determination that Albert and Angus were not sufficiently mature to take account of their views is not clearly erroneous, and there is no ground for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b955-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b957-7\">. To the extent, if any, that John does question equitable tolling, the court's determination is not clearly erroneous. This conclusion is based on (1) the fact that Anne could not definitively locate the boys until August 2006 in light of her inability to establish contact with the boys despite repeated attempts to do so before that date; (2) the refusal of John's family in Gueydan to provide information about John's current whereabouts despite requests; and (3) John's history of taking frequent, prolonged business trips with the boys throughout the American Southwest, where he had business and property interests. Nor is the application of the law to these facts incorrect. <em>See, e.g., Furnes v. Reeves, </em>362 F.3d 702, 723-24 (11th Cir.2004); <em>Van Driessche, </em>466 F.Supp.2d at 852; <em>Giampaolo v.

Andrews, 2 </em>F.Supp.2d 134, 140 (D.Mass. 1998) (\u201cUntil he knew that Andrews would not return, it would be unfair to require Zuker to file a petition based on alleged wrongful retention.'').</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b958-7\">. <em>See England, </em>234 F.3d at 272 n. 4 (\"We do not hold that as a matter of law a 13 year-old is not sufficiently mature for her views to be considered.

In his report for the court based on interviews with the children, Bouillion notes that \u201c[Angus] feels that the mother is more interested in the money and the house than he and his brother.\" Though silent about Angus\u2019s involvement, Bouillion mentions that Albert \u201cis too involved in adult issues and focused on the only reason the mother wants them back in Mexico is so she can sell the family home.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b959-7\">. <em>See, e.g., Anderson v.

She was able to point to New Zealand on a globe.... She appeared to understand the court\u2019s questions, and also indicated her understanding of the difference between truth and falsehood.... The court saw no reason to conclude that Beth\u2019s answers to the court\u2019s questions were the product of any coercion or undue influence on the part of respondent.
