California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Rosas-Lopez has filed a response. The record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration at this time of Rosas-Lopez\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel; such a claim generally \u201ccannot be resolved on direct appeal when [it has] not been raised before the district court since no opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>omitted). Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Rosas-Lopez\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. <em>42.2.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Rosas-Lopez\u2019s motion to proceed pro se and for the <em>Anders </em>brief to be stricken are DENIED. <em>See United States v. Wagner, </em>158 F.3d 901, 902-03 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b942-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
