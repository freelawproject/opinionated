We review a district court\u2019s determinations regarding its subject-matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Sweet Pea Marine, Ltd. v. APJ Marine, Inc., </em>411 F.3d 1242, 1247 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Federal courts have limited jurisdiction. This means that they only have the power and authority to hear certain categories of cases. A district court must determine that a case falls into one of these categories before it can consider the arguments brought by the parties. It cannot simply decide any dispute that comes before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Ms. Williams argues that this case falls into two categories of federal jurisdiction. First, she argues that the defendant violated a federal statute \u2014 this falls within the court\u2019s federal question jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. Second, she argues that she is a citizen of a different state than the defendant \u2014 this could potentially put the dispute within the federal court\u2019s diversity jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a). We will address each of Ms. William\u2019s two arguments separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">Ms. Williams points to only one federal statute, which is a law passed by the United States Congress. She claims that the defendant violated the Privacy Act. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a. However, the Privacy Act of 1974 applies only to government agencies. <em>See Schwier v. Cox, </em>340 F.3d 1284, 1287-88 (11th Cir.2003). The defendant is a private corporation, not a government agency. Therefore, any claim under the Privacy Act is \u201cwholly insubstantial.\u201d A claim may be dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction if it is \u201cwholly insubstantial and frivolous.\u201d <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Ala. v. Sanders, </em>138 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.1998) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">Now we will turn to Ms. Williams\u2019 second argument. In order to establish diversity jurisdiction, Ms. Williams must show, <em>inter alia, </em>that she is a citizen of a different state than the defendant. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(1). Ms. Williams is a citizen of Alabama. ALFA is a private corporation. A corporation is a citizen of both the state where it is incorporated and the state where it has its principal place of business. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(c). The district court made the following findings. ALFA is incorporated in Alabama and has its principal place of business in Alabama. ALFA is a subsidiary of ALFA Corporation. ALFA Corporation is incorporated in Delaware but has its principal place of business in Alabama. A district court\u2019s determination of a corporation\u2019s principal place of business is reviewed for clear error. <em>Id. </em>Ms. Williams has not challenged these findings. Therefore, there is no clear error. For purposes of diversity jurisdiction, Ms. Williams, ALFA and ALFA Corporation are all citizens of Alabama. Accordingly, the parties are not citizens of different states \u2014 meaning that there is no diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">In conclusion, this case does not fall within a category over which the federal courts have the ability to hear the claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>brought by Ms. Williams.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A0R2\">The opinion of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"AKC\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-17\">. Ms. Williams also argues that she has a constitutional right to a trial where she can call witnesses. Without jurisdiction, the federal courts do not have the ability to hear this case. We note that most state courts are courts of general jurisdiction. 13 Wright, Miller, Cooper &amp; Freer, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3521 (2009). Contract disputes are typically matters of state law. 32 Am. Jur.2d Federal Courts \u00a7 338 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b401-29\">.
