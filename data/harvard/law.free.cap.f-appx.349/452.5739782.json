No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-13\">At his original sentencing, Howard received an offense level of 38. The district court granted Howard a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b)(1) downward departure on his criminal history category from III to II. Howard\u2019s resulting guidelines range was 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment; and the district court imposed a 262-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-14\">In his section 3582(c)(2) motion, Howard sought a sentence reduction pursuant to Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which retroactively reduced the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. The district court reduced Howard\u2019s offense level to 36 under Amendment 706, kept his criminal history category at III, and calculated an amended guidelines range of 235 to 293 months. But the court granted Howard no sentence reduction because his original sentence fell within the amended guidelines range and was the product of a downward departure and because Howard was responsible for a large quantity of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-15\">On appeal, Howard argues that the district court\u2019s amended guidelines\u2019 calculations should have reflected the original downward departure on his criminal history category. He also argues that the court failed to consider the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under pection 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-16\">When a sentencing guideline is amended and given retroactive effect, the district court, \u201cafter considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable,\u201d may reduce a previous sentence under the amendment \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applica-</p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>ble policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). Amendment 706 \u2014 which became retroactive on 3 March 2008, U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 713 (Supp. 1 May 2008) \u2014 reduced by two the base offense levels in crack cocaine sentences calculated pursuant to the drug quantity table, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">If, as here, an amendment applies to a defendant, a \u201cdistrict court must make two distinct determinations before deciding whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under\u201d section 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir. 1998). First, the court must determine the sentence it would have imposed, given defendant\u2019s amended guidelines range and keeping constant all other guideline determinations made at the original sentencing hearing. <em>Id. </em>Then, the court must consider the factors in section 3553(a) and determine, in its discretion, whether to reduce defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>Id. </em>The court need not present particular findings on each section 3553(a) factor as long as the court clearly considered the factors and set forth adequate reasons for refusing to reduce a prisoner\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>104 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">About the first step, the district court calculated correctly the amended guidelines range. Howard\u2019s original base offense level of 38 was based on 1,916 grams of crack cocaine; and after Amendment 706, this drug quantity corresponds to a base offense level of 36. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(2). Howard\u2019s contention that the district court should have departed to a criminal history category of II is unavailing: the district court had discretion on whether to impose its previous departure. <em>See Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 761 (explaining that in a section 3582(c)(2) proceeding, \u201cwhether to consider a downward departure in determining what sentence the court would have imposed under the amended guideline remains discretionary, and the court is not bound by its earlier decision at the original sentencing to depart downward from the sentencing guidelines range\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">About the second step, we conclude that the district court adequately considered the section 3553(a) factors and abused no discretion in refusing to reduce Howard\u2019s sentence. The court explained why a sentence reduction was unwarranted: Howard\u2019s original sentence already reflected a downward departure and he had been held accountable for a large quantity of drags. That the district court\u2019s order was short and failed to articulate specifically that it had considered the section 3553(a) factors is not reversible error. <em>See United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997) (explaining that the record must demonstrate that the district court took the pertinent factors into account). And the drug amount bore on the nature and circumstances of the offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">Because the district court calculated properly the amended sentencing range, and the record indicates that the district court considered the section 3553(a) fae-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>tors, we conclude that no abuse of discretion occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-6\">. Even if the court had imposed its previous downward departure, Howard\u2019s original 262-month sentence still would have been within the amended guidelines range of 210 to 262 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b478-11\">. On appeal, Howard points out that the Sentencing Commission determined that a defendant responsible for less than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine is eligible for a sentence reduction. But whether to grant that reduction remains within the discretion of the district court. <em>See Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 760.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
