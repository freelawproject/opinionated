Gibson had 3 prior felony convictions, which enhanced the statutory mandatory minimum to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Gibson argues that his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated when the district court applied the enhanced penalty because the prior convictions on which the enhancement was based were neither alleged in the indictment nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>a constitutional challenge to a sentence. <em>United States v. Cantellano, </em>430 F.3d 1142, 1144 (11th Cir.2005). Pursuant to \u00a7 924(e)(1), any person who commits the offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm and has 3 prior convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense shall be imprisoned not less than 15 years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">A district court does not err by relying on prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 244-46, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1231-32, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that prior convictions could be considered and used to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence without having been alleged in the indictment or proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Subsequent decisions, namely <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), have not disturbed the holding of <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1329. \u201cAlthough recent decisions, including <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), may arguably cast doubt on the future prospects of Almendarez-Torres\u2019s holding regarding prior convictions, the Supreme Court has not explicitly overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>As a result, we must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres.\u201d United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1316 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-14\">Gibson\u2019s argument that his prior felonies must be alleged in the indictment or found by a jury is contrary to binding precedent. The district court did not err when it enhanced Gibson\u2019s sentence based on his prior convictions, even though they were not alleged in the indictment or proven to a jury. Because the decision in <em>Almenda-rez-Torres </em>remains good law, the district court did not err, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-15\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b396-9\">.
