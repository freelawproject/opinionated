Hernandez argues, for the purpose of preserving the issue for possible Supreme Court review, that his within-guidelines sentence should not be presumed reasonable because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based and thus is flawed under <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). He argues that his sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of \u00a7 3553(a) because the Sentencing Guidelines account for his prior conviction both to increase his offense level and to calculate his criminal history score. Hernandez further contends that the guidelines range overstated the seriousness of his offense because his conduct was not violent and that the guidelines range did not properly account for his personal history and characteristics, including his work history and his motive for reentering.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-20\">In reviewing a sentence, we \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Hernandez did not raise in the district court his arguments that \u00a7 2L1.2 lacked empirical support, that his prior offense was \u201cdouble counted\u201d in calculating his advisory guidelines range, or that the guidelines range overstated the seriousness of his offense and did not properly account for his personal history and characteristics. We therefore review these arguments for plain error. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number><em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">This court has rejected the argument that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply to within-guidelines sentences, when the guidelines range was calculated pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2, an \u201callegedly non-empirically-grounded provision[] of the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009); <em>see also United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). Hernandez\u2019s argument that his sentence is unreasonable because the guidelines range was greater than necessary to meet \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s goals as a result of \u201cdouble counting\u201d also is unavailing. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-11\">Hernandez has not shown an abuse of discretion by the district court. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596-97. Because Hernandez has not shown that his sentence is unreasonable, he has not shown error, plain or otherwise. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b937-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
