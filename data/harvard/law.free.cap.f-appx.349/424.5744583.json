Mosley\u2019s motion was based on Amendment 706, which lowered the base offense levels applicable to certain crack cocaine sentences. The district court denied the motion, finding that Mosley was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. On appeal, Mosley argues that the district court did not sentence him as a career offender because his sentence of 274 months\u2019 imprisonment was below the mandatory minimum 300-month sentence found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(b)(B), and therefore he was eligible for a sentence reduction. Mosley contends that the district court also erred in refusing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Finally, Mosley argues that if the district court originally sentenced him as a career offender, that classification was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-16\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment \u201cin the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Amendment 706, which has been made retroactive, amended the drug quantity table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(e) \u201cto provide a two-level reduction in base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1325 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009). However, if a defendant is a career offender, his base offense level is determined under the career offender guideline in \u00a7 4B1.1(b) and not the drug quantity guideline in \u00a7 2D1.1(c). <em>Id. </em>at 1327-28. Therefore, Amendment 706 has no effect on a career offender\u2019s applicable guideline range. <em>Id. </em>The offense level for a defendant who qualifies as a career offender is determined according to the statutory maximum for his underlying crime. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(b). In <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005), we explained that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>under section 3582(c)(2), all \u201coriginal sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Because the district court sentenced Mosley as a career offender, Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines did not lower his guidelines range, and he was not entitled to resentencing under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). As such, the district court did not have authority to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Additionally, Mosley\u2019s challenge to his original designation as a career offender is misplaced because, during a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, the district court may not disturb any of its original factual findings. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Mosley a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
