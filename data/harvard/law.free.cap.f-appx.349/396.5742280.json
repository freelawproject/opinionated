Del Mazo contends the BIA erred by finding that he failed to show past persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground. He maintains that Shining Path guerrillas attacked and threatened him be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>cause of his political opinions. He also contends that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution because Shining Path remains active in Peru.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Any alien who is physically present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1256 (11th Cir.2007). To qualify for asylum, the alien must show that he is unable to return to his home country because of \u201cpersecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d Immigration and Nationality Act \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The alien bears the burden to demonstrate \u201c(1) past persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground or (2) a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Mejia, </em>498 F.3d at 1256.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Because the BIA neither adopted nor rejected the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, we do not address Del Mazo\u2019s arguments on that point. The BIA dismissed the appeal on the alternate ground that even if Del Mazo testified credibly, he failed to establish he was persecuted because of his political opinions. Instead, the BIA found, Shining Path targeted Del Mazo mainly in order to extort money from him and to force his then-girlfriend to divulge security information about the bank at which she worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Our review is limited to whether the BIA\u2019s finding was \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 890 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cTo reverse the [BIA\u2019s] fact findings, [we] must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, in order to reverse the BIA\u2019s finding that Del Mazo failed to demonstrate persecution based on a protected ground, we must be compelled to find that he was or will be persecuted <em>\u201cbecause of\u201d </em>his political opinion. <em>Rodriguez Morales, </em>488 F.3d at 890 (emphasis in original). \u201c[I]t is not enough to show that [the alien] was or will be persecuted or tortured due to [the alien\u2019s] refusal to cooperate with the guerrillas.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Specifically, persecution on account of an alien\u2019s refusal to pay a \u201cwar tax\u201d does not itself establish the required nexus between the guerrillas\u2019 acts and the victim\u2019s political beliefs. <em>Rivera v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 815, 822-23 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cAlthough other inferences about the guerillas\u2019 motives may be drawn, it is not our task to do so as long as substantial evidence supports the [BIA\u2019s] conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 823. \u201c[E]ven if the evidence could support multiple conclusions, we must affirm the agency\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">Here, there is substantial evidence that although Del Mazo had previously been politically active, his problems with Shining Path began only after he became involved with his then-girlfriend. That supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Del Mazo was targeted not because of his own political beliefs, but instead because of his girlfriend\u2019s position at the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">Because Del Mazo has failed to establish past persecution within the meaning of the INA, he does not receive a presumption in favor of his claim regarding future persecution. <em>See Mejia, </em>498 F.3d at 1257. To show that he has a well-founded fear of persecution, Del Mazo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>must demonstrate \u201ca reasonable possibility of suffering such persecution if [he] were to return to [Peru].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1256 (emphasis omitted). The fear of future persecution must be both \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir.2006). A well-founded fear of persecution can be established by \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that [the alien] will be singled out for persecution\u201d on account of a protected ground. <em>Id. </em>at 1258. Alternatively, an alien may show a pattern or practice in the subject country of persecuting members of a statutorily defined group to which the alien belongs. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii). However, Del Mazo fails by either measure. Evidence in the record indicates that security conditions in Peru have greatly improved in the seventeen years since Del Mazo left, and Shining Path\u2019s violence is now largely confined to a few rural provinces. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Del Mazo is unlikely to face any danger returning to the capital city of Lima after such a long absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">To qualify for withholding of removal, an alien must demonstrate a \u201cclear probability\u201d of persecution, a showing more stringent than that required for asylum. <em>Rodriguez Morales, </em>488 F.3d at 891. Because Del Mazo could not show a well-founded fear of persecution based on a protected ground, he necessarily fails to meet the higher standard required for withholding of removal. <em>Id. </em>To qualify for relief under the Convention Against Torture, Del Mazo must prove not only that he is likely to be tortured if he returns to Peru, but also that the torture would be inflicted at the hands of the government or at least with its acquiescence. <em>See id. </em>The evidence does not compel such a conclusion. Instead, it indicates that the Peruvian government has vigorously and effectively fought against Shining Path, and the group\u2019s capacity for the sort of violence feared by Del Mazo has been greatly diminished.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
