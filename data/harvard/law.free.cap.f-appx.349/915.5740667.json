Reynolds filed a motion for a reduced sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) in which he sought a reduction in his sentence based on Amendment 706 to the crack cocaine Guidelines. Reynolds appeals the district court\u2019s denial of that motion. The Government has filed a motion for summary affir-mance or, alternatively, for an extension of time to file a brief on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">Although the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence ordinarily is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, a court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Sept. 21, 2009) (No. 09-6657). Because the district court\u2019s denial of Reynolds\u2019s motion was based on its determination that Reynolds\u2019s sentence remained the same under the amended Guidelines, review is de novo. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence where the sentencing range is later lowered by the Sentencing Commission, \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). Sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582 are thus governed by the policy statements of the Guidelines. <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-10\">Under the amended guidelines, however, Reynolds\u2019s guidelines range of imprisonment remained the same. The district court was thus correct in concluding that a reduction was not permitted under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). Reynolds\u2019s argument that the district court had the discretion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582 in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is unavailing because \u201cthe concerns at issue in <em>Booker </em>do not apply in an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.\u201d <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238. Although the Guidelines must be treated as advisory in an original sentencing proceeding, <em>Booker </em>does not prevent Congress from incorporating a guideline provision \u201cas a means of defining and limiting a district court\u2019s authority to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239 (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-11\">The district court thus did not err in denying Reynolds\u2019s motion for a reduction of sentence. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED; the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED; and the Government\u2019s motion for an extension of time is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b940-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
