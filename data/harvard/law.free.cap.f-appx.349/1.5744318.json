After sentencing, Castillo-Lucio appealed his sentence, specifically the eight-level aggravated felony enhancement based on an earlier conviction for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle under Texas law. Recognizing that circuit precedent foreclosed his argument, Castillo-Lucio moved for summary affirmance so that he could seek review in the Supreme Court. We granted the motion and affirmed the district court. <em>See United States v. Castillo-Lucio, </em>256 Fed.Appx. 720 (5th Cir.2007) (per curiam). After he petitioned for a writ of certiorari, the Supreme Court vacated our decision and remanded the case for consideration in light of <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), and <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 687, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009). <em>See Castillo-Lucio v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 993, 173 L.Ed.2d 288 (2009) (mem.). As the parties now agree, the district court committed a procedural error in sentencing Castillo-Lucio, and we must therefore vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing. <em>See United States v. Armendariz-Moreno, </em>571 F.3d 490, 491-92 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b25-25\">On remand, the district eourt may also consider Castillo-Lucio\u2019s request for reformation of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-26\">SENTENCE VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b25-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
