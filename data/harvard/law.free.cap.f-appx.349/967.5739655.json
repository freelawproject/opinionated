For the following reasons, we deny his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b992-11\">Petitioner, a native and citizen of India, entered the United States on September 8, 2001, as a non-immigrant visitor with authorization to remain in the United States for a temporary period not to exceed December 7, 2001. He remained in the United States subsequent to that date. On February 1, 2006, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) issued Petitioner a Notice to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d), charging him with being removable as an alien who had \u201cremained in the United States for a time longer than permitted,\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B). Marediya admitted to the factual allegations in the NTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-16\">On June 26, 2006, Petitioner filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection. In his application, he stated that he \u201csuffered religious persecution\u201d and feared \u201cthat if [he] returned [to India, he] could be killed by the Hindus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b992-17\">On June 6, 2007, the Immigration Judge issued an oral decision denying Marediya\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection. On July 5, 2007, Marediya appealed the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision to the BIA. On October 22, 2008, the BIA affirmed the decision of the Immigration Judge. Marediya filed the instant Petition for Review within the thirty days of the date of the BIA\u2019s final order of removal. Consequently, the review Petitioner now seeks is timely before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-18\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b992-19\">A. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b992-20\">\u201cWe review the Board\u2019s factual findings to determine if they are supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Rojas v. I.N.S., </em>937 F.2d 186, 189 (5th Cir.1991). \u201cThe substantial evidence standard requires only that the [BIA\u2019s] conclusion be based upon the evidence presented and be substantially reasonable.\u201d <em>Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 350 (5th Cir. 2002) (citation omitted). As a result, \u201cthe administrative findings of fact are conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>sive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude the contrary.\u201d <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 137-138 (5th Cir.2004) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B)). \u201cUnder the substantial evidence standard, reversal is improper unless we decide not only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but also that the evidence compels it.\u201d <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir. 2006) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">\u201cWhen, as here, the BIA affirms the immigration judge and relies on the reasons set forth in the immigration judge\u2019s decision, this court reviews the decision of the immigration judge as well as the decision of the BIA.\u201d <em>Ahmed v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 433, 437 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">B. WHETHER SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE BIA\u2019S DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">Petitioner argues that we should reverse the BIA\u2019s decision because \u201cthe BIA and Immigration Judge\u2019s decision finding that the government has met its burden in overcoming the presumption of persecution is not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d We find, however, that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision to affirm the Immigration Judge\u2019s denial of Petitioner\u2019s withholding of removal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">\u201cTo be eligible for withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate a clear probability of persecution upon return.\u201d <em>Roy, </em>389 F.3d at 138. \u201cA clear probability means that it is more likely than not that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened by persecution on account of either his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[Persecution is an extreme concept that does not include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive.\u201d <em>Arif v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 677, 680 (5th Cir.2007). To establish \u201cpersecution,\u201d Marediya must demonstrate that \u201charm or suffering will be inflicted upon [himjin order to punish h[im] for possessing a belief or characteristic a persecutor sought to overcome.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b993-11\">In the present case, however, past persecution has been established because the Immigration Judge concluded that Maredi-ya suffered persecution in India in 1993\u2014 when Hindu fundamentalists attacked him on account of his religion, burning down his shop and leaving him with a broken leg and collarbone. Thus, because past persecution has been established, \u201cit is presumed that the life or freedom of [Petitioner] would be threatened in the future in the country of removal on the basis of th[is] original claim\u201d of past persecution. <em>Id. </em>at 680-681 (internal quotations omitted). \u201cThe government may rebut this presumption by demonstrating that there has been a fundamental change in the circumstances of the country of removal, or that the applicant could avoid a future threat to his life or freedom by reasonably relocating to a different part of the country of removal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 681 (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(l)(i)). Consequently, the question before the Court is whether substantial evidence on the record supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the government adequately rebutted Marediya\u2019s presumption of persecution resulting from the incident he suffered in India in 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>Upon review of the record, we conclude that substantial evidence does support the administrative decision that the government adequately rebutted the presumption created by the 1993 event of past persecution. To rebut this presumption, the Government presented reports documenting the fundamental changes that have occurred in India, the country of removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(l)(i)(A). In her decision issued on June 6, 2007, the Immigration Judge noted that while the Government had presented recent documents demonstrating fundamental changes in the circumstances in India, the documents \u201csubmitted by [Marediya we]re fairly outdated\u201d \u2014 the most recent was dated 2003. In contrast, the Government presented two State Department reports, the International Religious Freedom Report and the Report on Human Rights Practices for India, both of which were dated 2006. The evidence the Government put forth in these reports documented that the \u201cvast majority of Indians of every religious faith lived in peaceful coexistence, however tensions between religious groups were a problem in some areas.\u201d Although there had been outbreaks in the past, the Immigration Judge considered the evidence and concluded that the \u201cconditions in India have changed significantly since 1993 [because] the [Indian] government is taking steps to improve the conditions in India on an ongoing basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">Further, the Immigration Judge noted that although he suffered from an act of persecution in 1993, during his administra-five hearing, Marediya \u201ctestified that he did not have any significant problems after the riots in 1993 involving Hindus.\u201d That is, following the incident he suffered in 1993, Marediya continued to live in India for eight years before he came to the United States in 2001. During that time, he suffered no religious persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">Given the more recent State Department Reports the Immigration Judge considered, coupled with the fact that Petitioner continued to live in India for eight years after the first incident of persecution and suffered no further persecution, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That is, the substantial evidence on record demonstrates that the Government put forth sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of future persecution based on the 1993 event of past persecution, and as a result, Marediya has not met his burden of establishing a \u201cclear probability\u201d of persecution in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">Consequently, we cannot conclude that \u201cthe evidence compels\u201d the reversal of the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1134. For the aforementioned reasons, Petitioner\u2019s Petition for Review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b992-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b993-9\">. In his brief before this Court, Petitioner states that he requests review of \"the denial of withholding of removal.\u201d Nowhere in his brief does he discuss the BIA's decision in regards to his application for asylum or his application for relief under CAT. Thus, because Petitioner limits his request for review to the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of removal, we will not address the denial of his application for asylum or the denial of his application for relief under CAT. Those issues are not presently before us, and consequently, warrant no further discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b994-5\">. Because we conclude that substantial evidence supports the conclusion that the Government presented sufficient evidence regarding the fundamental changes in circumstances in India to rebut the Petitioner's presumption of persecution, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(l )(i)(A), we do not reach the question of whether substantial evidence in the record exists to support the conclusion that the Government presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate that Marediya could avoid future threat by moving to another area of the country. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(l)(i)(B). Instead, we limit our holding to a finding that substantial evidence supports the administrative decision that the Government presented adequate evidence to rebut the presumption of persecution pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(l)(i)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
