The district court dismissed Brennan\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction, and Brennan appealed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Brennan pled guilty to and was convicted of conspiracy to defraud and bank fraud in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. He was sentenced to serve 180 months. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed his sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Brennan is currently an inmate at the Federal Correctional Institute in Yazoo City, Mississippi.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Brennan, appearing pro se, filed a \u00a7 2241 habeas petition in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. He requested \u201crelief from a void judgment ... through the immediate dischargement of the Petitioner from federal custody.\u201d Brennan claimed that he was convicted of crimes that were not set forth in his indictment, rendering his sentence invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">The district court found that it did not have jurisdiction to consider Brennan\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition because Brennan\u2019s petition challenged \u201calleged errors that occurred during his federal sentencing by the Northern District of Georgia, which is not properly pursued in a \u00a7 2241 petition,\u201d but instead should be raised in a \u00a7 2255 petition. The court then considered whether the savings clause in \u00a7 2255 would permit it to consider the \u00a7 2241 petition. The court determined that Brennan did not meet the requirements of the savings clause because he had failed to show that the \u00a7 2255 remedy was inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. The court dismissed Brennan\u2019s petition with prejudice as to the jurisdictional issue and without prejudice as to all other issues. Brennan appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b912-16\">On appeal, Brennan argues that the district court incorrectly found that it did not have jurisdiction over his \u00a7 2241 petition. We conduct a de novo review of a district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition on the pleadings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-17\">Section 2255 provides the primary means of collaterally attacking a federal conviction and sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A \u00a7 2255 petition must be filed in the sentencing court, and \u201c[rjelief under section 2255 is warranted for errors cognizable on collateral review that occurred \u2018at or prior to sentencing.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In contrast, a \u00a7 2241 petition \u201cattacks the manner in which a sentence is carried out or the prison authorities\u2019 determination of its duration, and must be filed in the same district where the prisoner is incarcerated.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cHowever, \u00a7 2241 may be utilized by a federal prisoner to challenge the legality of his or her conviction or sentence if he or she can satisfy the mandates of the so-called \u00a7 2255 \u2018savings clause.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under the savings clause, a federal prisoner may bring a writ of habe-as corpus under \u00a7 2241 if the \u00a7 2255 remedy is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The savings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>clause thus applies to a claim \u201c(i) that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Brennan argues that his \u00a7 2241 petition is not a collateral attack on his sentence or a challenge to the imposition of his sentence. Instead, Brennan argues that \u201cthe essence of the claim was directed to the Appellee \u2014 the custodian and an administrative employee or officer \u2014 and the fact that the Appellee \u2018does not have constitutional authority or license by law to deprive the petitioner of his liberty.\u2019 \u201d Therefore, Brennan argues, he may pursue his claim in a \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">The crux of Brennan\u2019s claim is that the Northern District of Georgia sentenced him based on offenses that were not included in his indictment and that this renders his judgment void and entitles him to release from custody. Thus, Brennan\u2019s claim is based on errors that occurred \u201cat or prior to sentencing,\u201d and is not an \u201cattack[ on] the manner in which [his] sentence is carried out or the prison authorities\u2019 determination of its duration.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court correctly concluded that Brennan\u2019s claims were not properly pursued in a \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">Furthermore, Brennan has not met the requirements of the \u00a7 2255 savings clause. Brennan bears the burden of demonstrating that the \u00a7 2255 savings clause applies because \u201cthe section 2255 remedy is inadequate or ineffective.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On appeal, Brennan presents no arguments that the \u00a7 2255 remedy is inadequate or ineffective. Therefore, Brennan\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition does not fall within the savings clause of \u00a7 2255, and the district court properly dismissed Brennan\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">Therefore, for the reasons discussed above, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b911-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
