Huskey argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The presentence investigation report detailed Huskey\u2019s crimes, which are heinous and despicable. The report stated that Huskey had sexually abused his daughter between the ages of six and nine by subjecting her to anal and oral sodomy and vaginal sex. Photographs and videotapes established that, over time, Huskey\u2019s abuse became more violent and that he had pressed a knife to his daughter\u2019s face, neck, and genitals, and she had appeared \u201cdistressed\u201d in the encounters. Huskey admitted to federal agents that he had penetrated his daughter with objects to condition her for vaginal sex and that the molestation had become more violent over time. Huskey also admitted that he had photographed and videotaped the abuse to trade for other child pornography. Hus-key\u2019s daughter told federal agents that she knew the abuse had been recorded and distributed on the internet because Hus-key had shown her pictures and videos.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">The presentence report listed a base offense level of 32. The report increased that level by 14 points for Huskey\u2019s involvement as a parent, his daughter\u2019s age, his use of violence, his distribution of the child pornography, and the sadistic conduct portrayed, and the report reduced the level by 3 points for Huskey\u2019s acceptance of responsibility and timely plea of guilt. With a criminal history of I, the report listed an advisory guidelines sentence of life imprisonment. Because that term exceeded the maximum statutory sentences of 360 months for manufacturing child pornography and 240 months for distribution and receipt of child pornography, the Sentencing Guidelines provided that the statutory sentences run consecutively. United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 5G1.1(d) (Nov.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">At the sentencing hearing, Huskey asked the district court to order that his sentences run concurrently for a term of 30 years of imprisonment. The district court, after \u201chav[ing] looked at [Huskey\u2019s case] hard and long,\u201d sentenced Huskey to 840 months of imprisonment, which the court \u201cacknowledge^] and [didn\u2019t] have any qualms\u201d that was \u201cin effect ... a life sentence.\u201d The court stated that it had \u201cconsidered Section 3553 in this matter and all of its parts\u201d and found \u201ca need to incapacitate this defendant and to prevent any further criminal activity on his part\u201d and \u201cthat the public needfed] to be protected from Huskey.\u201d The court explained that Huskey\u2019s sentence was based on \u201cthe serious\u201d and \u201cviolent nature of [Huskey\u2019s] offenses,\u201d the length of the sexual abuse, the age of the victim, the distribution of the pornography, and Huskey\u2019s \u201ccollection of digital images.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">We review the reasonableness of a criminal sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2008). Because the standard is deferential, \u201cwhen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cAfter <em>[United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number><em>States </em>v.] <em>Booker, </em>[543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) ], our ordinary expectation still has to be measured against the record, and the party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Huskey argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court applied perfunctorily the Sentencing Guidelines and failed to consider the sentencing factors, but we disagree. Although <em>Booker </em>rendered the Guidelines advisory, it did not give district courts the unfettered discretion to ignore them. On the contrary, district courts remain obliged to \u201cconsult\u201d the Guidelines and apply them if the circumstances warrant. <em>See United States v. Sarras, </em>575 F.3d 1191, 1220 (11th Cir.2009). Huskey argues for concurrent sentences on the ground that \u201cmanufacturing child pornography necessarily presumes the eventual disti\u2019ibution of that pornography,\u201d but he acknowledges that \u201c[i]t is not legally required that the sentences merge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Huskey\u2019s sentence is reasonable. The district court considered the section 3553(a) factors and found that a sentence of 840 months was necessary to deter Hus-key from future similar conduct, protect the public, reflect the seriousness of his offenses, promote respect for the law, and provide a just punishment. Huskey perpetrated sadistic acts on his young and impressionable daughter, forced her to recount those events, and traded images of the abuse to amass more obscene materials to satisfy his sexual appetite. The district court reasonably found that a term that was \u201cin effect ... a life sentence\u201d was necessary to punish Huskey and prevent him from inflicting similar abuses on other children. The district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">Huskey\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
