The petitioners also argue that the IJ and BIA erred in finding that they did not experience past persecution or have a well-founded fear of returning to Peru, as threats alone can establish well-founded fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">\u201cWe review only the [BIA\u2019s] decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. Insofar as the Board adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Al Naj-jar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (citations omitted). In the instant case, the BIA issued its own opinion with analysis and also adopted some of the IJ\u2019s reasoning. Therefore, we review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">We review the IJ\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence test. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotations and citations omitted). We must \u201caffirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284 (internal quotations omitted). We do not consider issues not raised in a party\u2019s appellate brief. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">An alien may obtain asylum if he is a refugee. INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). A refugee is a person who is unable or unwilling to return to his home country because of persecution or a</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular group, or political opinion. INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(A)(42)(A). \u201cTo establish asylum [eligibility] based on past persecution, the applicant must prove (1) that she was persecuted, and (2) that the persecution was on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cTo establish eligibility for asylum based on a well-founded fear of future persecution, the applicant must prove (1) a subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable fear of persecution that is (2) on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal and quotation marks omitted). A showing of past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">To establish a well-founded fear of future persecution, an alien must establish a fear that is both \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. An alien must establish a nexus between his political opinion and the feared persecution. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (addressing asylum) (quotation omitted). \u201cIf an applicant is unable to meet the well-founded fear standard for asylum, [he] is generally precluded from qualifying for either asylum or withholding of deportation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232-33 (quotation and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">To qualify for withholding of removal under the INA, an alien must show that if returned to his country, the alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>INA \u00a7 241(b)(3); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). If a petitioner is unable to meet the standard of proof for asylum, he is generally precluded from qualifying for withholding of removal. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The IJ found that Yaya-Araujo\u2019s fighting of the terrorist groups Shining Path and Tupac Amaru, as a part of his job, was not the same as having a political opinion for which he would be harmed. The BIA further concluded that Yaya-Araujo had failed to establish past persecution, or a well-founded fear or likelihood of future persecution, on account of a protected ground. However, in their appellate brief, the petitioners argue only that the IJ and BIA erred in finding that: (1) Yaya-Arau-jo was a persecutor; and (2) Yaya-Araujo did not have a well-founded fear of persecution if he returned to Peru based on past persecution. As such, the petitioners have abandoned the issue of whether they were persecuted because of their political opinion. Because the petitioners have abandoned this issue, they are not entitled to relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">PETITION DENIED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-8\">. Because the petitioners do not raise any issues regarding their claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\") in their opening brief, they have abandoned any challenge to the denial of CAT relief on appeal. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (\"When an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b513-8\">. Alternatively, even if the issue were not abandoned, substantial evidence supports the finding of the IJ and BIA that Yaya-Araujo failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. Thus, the decision of the BIA and IJ with respect to asylum and withholding of removal are not erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b513-20\">. Petitioners\u2019 request for oral argument is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
