The Aranas argue that the district court erred in concluding that an insurance policy issued by Century covered only $25,000 of Seductions\u2019s liability for injuries Mauricio suffered as a patron at Seductions\u2019s adult nightclub. Following a brief recitation of the relevant facts, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">Mauricio Arana was injured in 2006 when Seductions employees allegedly beat and threw him out of the company\u2019s nightclub after he refused to leave at closing time. The Aranas subsequently sued Seductions in state court to recover damages for Mauricio\u2019s injuries, medical expenses alleged to exceed $1 million, and loss of consortium. The Aranas\u2019 complaint alleged that Seductions had negligently hired, retained, trained, and supervised the employees responsible for the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">Seductions tendered defense of the lawsuit to Century, its insurer under a commercial general liability policy in effect at the time of Mauricio\u2019s injuries. The policy covered losses incurred by Seductions due to \u201cbodily injury\u201d arising from \u201coperations necessary or incidental to\u201d its nightclub. The policy also provided coverage for \u201cpersonal and advertising injury,\u201d which was defined to include the \u201cwrongful eviction from, wrongful entry into, or invasion of the right of private occupancy of a room, dwelling or premises that a person occupies, committed by or on behalf of its owner, landlord or lessor.\u201d The policy\u2019s declarations page established a $2 million \u201cGeneral Aggregate Limit,\u201d $1 million \u201cPersonal and Advertising Injury\u201d and \u201cEach Occurrence\u201d limits, and a $2,000 per person \u201cMedical Expense Limit\u201d on coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-13\">In addition, two endorsements to the policy, forms CGL 1704 and CGL 1717, limited coverage for losses arising from assault and battery. Through Century\u2019s inadvertence, however, CGL 1704, which explicitly excluded coverage for assault, battery, and any related negligence claims, was neither attached to the policy nor listed on the policy\u2019s schedule of forms and endorsements. Nevertheless, CGL 1717, entitled \u201cLimited Coverage \u2014 Assault &amp; Battery,\u201d was attached. CGL 1717 provided that \u201c[t]he specific coverage excluded under CGL 1704 is reinstated on a limited basis\u201d and purported to establish a $25,000 per occurrence sublimit for \u201ccovered loss arising from an assault and battery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-14\">Because of Mauricio\u2019s allegations that he had been \u201cattacked and beaten,\u201d Century offered $25,000 to settle the Aranas\u2019 claims against Seductions, in accordance with CGL 1717\u2019s sublimit on injuries arising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>from assault and battery. The Aranas rejected Century\u2019s offer and demanded a $2 million \u201cpolicy limits\u201d settlement in its place. Century then filed this action in federal court, seeking a declaration that its duty to indemnify Seductions on the Ara-nas\u2019 claims was limited to $25,000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment with the district court. The Aranas contended that the policy was ambiguous and should be construed in favor of Seductions, the insured, to provide coverage in the amount of $2 million. Specifically, they argued (1) that the policy did not limit coverage for assault and battery claims, (2) that Mauricio\u2019s injuries arose from Seductions\u2019s negligence rather than any assault or battery, (3) that the policy provided full coverage because the injuries arose from the necessary and incidental operations of Seductions\u2019s nightclub, (4) that Mauricio had suffered separately covered \u201cpersonal and advertising injury\u201d because Seductions had wrongfully evicted him from its premises, and (5) that the policy\u2019s cap on medical expenses was ambiguous and therefore did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The district court rejected the Aranas\u2019 arguments and entered summary judgment in Century\u2019s favor. The court concluded, first, that CGL 1717 effectively limited coverage for assault and battery claims to $25,000 and, second, that Mauricio\u2019s injuries arose from an assault and battery. Third, it concluded that assault and battery were not necessary or incidental to the operation of Seductions\u2019s nightclub. Fourth, the court held that Mauricio could not have been wrongfully evicted from the nightclub because he lacked a possessory interest in the premises. Finally, the court concluded that the policy\u2019s $2,000 Medical Expense Limit applied to Mauricio\u2019s medical expenses. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Steinberg, </em>393 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2004). We likewise review the district court\u2019s determination of coverage under an insurance policy <em>de novo. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. v. Tropical Shipping &amp; Constr. Co., </em>254 F.3d 987, 1003 (11th Cir.2001). Because our subject matter jurisdiction in this case is based on diversity of citizenship, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, Florida law governs the determination of the issues on appeal. <em>Steinberg, </em>393 F.3d at 1230. Under Florida law, \u201cinsurance contracts are construed according to their plain meaning,\u201d but any ambiguities must be construed in favor of the insured. <em>Taurus Holdings, Inc. v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>913 So.2d 528, 532 (Fla.2005). Policy provisions are only ambiguous if \u201csusceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, one providing coverage and the [ ]other limiting coverage.\u201d <em>Auto-Owners Ins. Co. v. Anderson, </em>756 So.2d 29, 34 (Fla.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-12\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">On appeal, the Aranas repeat the arguments made before the district court, and we address them in turn. First, we agree with the district court that the policy unambiguously limited coverage for losses arising from assault and battery. Even in the absence of form CGL 1704\u2019s explicit exclusion of coverage, CGL 1717\u2019s provision of \u201cLimited Coverage \u2014 Assault &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Battery\u201d clearly limited Century\u2019s indemnification obligation to $25,000 per occurrence of injury \u201carising from an assault and battery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">We also conclude that CGL 1717\u2019s $25,000 sublimit applies to Mauricio\u2019s injuries because they arose from an assault and battery. We find unpersuasive the Aranas\u2019 arguments that CGL 1717 narrowly encompassed intentional acts and that Mauricio\u2019s injuries arose instead from acts of negligence. The Florida Supreme Court has held that the words \u201carising out of\u2019 in an insurance policy are unambiguous and broad in scope: \u201cThe term \u2018arising out of is broader in meaning than the term \u2018caused by\u2019 and means \u2018originating from,\u2019 \u2018having its origin in,\u2019 \u2018growing out of,\u2019 \u2018flowing from,\u2019 \u2018incident to\u2019 or \u2018having a connection with.\u2019 \u201d <em>Taurus Holdings, </em>913 So.2d at 539 (citation omitted). CGL 1717\u2019s \u201carising from\u201d language is entitled to the same broad interpretation. <em>Cf. Church &amp; Tower of Fla., Inc. v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., </em>936 So.2d 40 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2006) (applying <em>Taurus Holdings </em>to a coverage provision including the term \u201carising from\u201d). The Aranas\u2019 artful pleading of claims sounding in negligence does not change the fact that Mauricio\u2019s injuries arose directly from an allegedly intentional attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Our interpretation of CGL 1717\u2019s application to the Aranas\u2019 negligence claims is consistent with the general approach Florida courts have taken when considering negligence claims related to assault and battery. <em>See Miami Beach Entm\u2019t, Inc. v. 1st Oak Brook Corporate Syndicate, </em>682 So.2d 161, 162 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1996) (\u201cAlthough the complaint was couched in terms of the bar owner\u2019s negligence ... for purposes of determining insurance coverage, the injuries arose from the assault and battery.\u201d); <em>Britamco Underwriter\u2019s, Inc. v. Zuma Corp., </em>576 So.2d 965, 965 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1991) (\u201cAppellee concedes that the patron was injured by an assault and battery but contends that coverage is nevertheless available because the legal theory upon which the patron obtained a judgment was negligence in failing to provide adequate security. We agree with the appellant that the policy excludes coverage for this claim, which clearly arises out of an assault and battery.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the court in one Florida case refused to apply an assault and battery exclusion to a negligent retention claim, its decision relied on the fact that the exclusion at issue \u201ccover[ed] a number of intentional torts,\u201d and the court construed the lengthy list of excluded torts as ambiguous with respect to acts of negligence. <em>Mactown, Inc. v. Cont'l Ins. Co., </em>716 So.2d 289, 291 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1998). In this case, by contrast, CGL 1717 refers only to injuries arising from assault and battery, and we agree with the district court that this limitation on coverage unambiguously extends to the Aranas\u2019 negligence claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">We accordingly reject the Aranas\u2019 argument that CGL 1717\u2019s sublimit does not apply here because Mauricio\u2019s injuries were caused by the negligent provision of security services \u201cnecessary or incidental to\u201d the operation of Seductions\u2019s nightclub. \u201cUnder Florida law, insurance contracts are construed according to their plain meaning,\u201d <em>Taurus Holdings, </em>913 So.2d at 532, and courts may consult dictionaries to supply the accepted meanings of words, <em>Garcia v. Fed. Ins. Co., </em>969 So.2d 288, 291-92 (Fla.2007). Common definitions of <em>incidental </em>include \u201coccurring merely by chance or without intention or calculation,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>\u201cbeing likely to ensue as a chance or minor consequence,\u201d and \u201cmet or encountered casually or by accident.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1142 (1986). Although negligence in the provision of security services might qualify as \u201cincidental to\u201d the operation of an adult nightclub under other circumstances, the Seductions employees\u2019 alleged attack did not occur merely by chance, without intention, or by accident. The assault and battery Mauricio suffered thus were not \u201cincidental\u201d to the operation of Seductions\u2019s business. Nor were they \u201cnecessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The Aranas next argue that the policy provided coverage for Mauricio\u2019s injuries because Seductions wrongfully evicted him from its nightclub. At issue is whether his lack of a possessory interest in the premises meant that he could not have been wrongfully evicted. Although we previously have noted, applying Florida insurance law, that \u201c[b]oth \u2018wrongful entry\u2019 and \u2018eviction\u2019 imply an interference with possessory rights,\u201d <em>City of Delray Beach v. Agric. Ins. Co., </em>85 F.Sd 1527, 1534 (11th Cir.1996), no Florida court has directly confronted the issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Courts in many jurisdictions with decisions on point have required at least a temporary possessory interest in the premises before finding a wrongful eviction, but other courts have disagreed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Ultimately, however, CGL 1717\u2019s sub-limit on assault and battery coverage applies regardless of whether Mauricio was wrongfully evicted from Seductions\u2019s nightclub.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Aranas\u2019 wrongful eviction argument relies on the assumption that \u201cpersonal and advertising injury\u201d is not subject to CGL 1717\u2019s sublimit, but no language in the policy supports such a restrictive interpretation of the endorsement\u2019s scope. On the contrary, CGL 1717 simply states that a $25,000 sublimit is \u201capplicable to a covered loss arising from an assault and battery.\u201d In the absence of ambiguity, Florida law \u201cdoes not allow courts to rewrite contracts, add meaning that is not present, or otherwise reach results contrary to the intentions of the parties.\u201d <em>Excelsior Ins. Co. v. Pomona Park Bar &amp; Package Store, </em>369 So.2d 938, 942 (Fla.1979). There is no ambiguity here; Seductions\u2019s insurance policy \u201ccovered\u201d losses due to \u201cbodily injury\u201d and \u201cpersonal and advertising injury\u201d alike, and CGL 1717\u2019s $25,000 sublimit applies by its terms to both.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">Finally, we conclude that the policy\u2019s $2,000 Medical Expense Limit applies to the Aranas\u2019 claims. They argue that the policy is ambiguous because, although the declarations page provides for a $2,000 limit on medical expenses, \u201cSection Ill-Limits of Insurance\u201d states, \u201cThe [$2 million] General Aggregate Limit is the most we will pay for the sum of ... [m]edical expenses.\u201d We conclude, however, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>these two provisions are unambiguous and entirely consistent with one another. On one hand, Section III explains that \u201cthe Medical Expense Limit is the most [Century] will pay ... for all medical expenses because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 sustained by any <em>one </em>person\u201d (emphasis added). The policy's $2 million General Aggregate Limit, on the other hand, is the most Century will pay for the <em>sum </em>of medical expenses, including those incurred by multiple persons across multiple occurrences. Mauricio Ar-ana is one person seeking medical expenses arising from a single occurrence, and the policy caps coverage for said expenses at $2,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">In light of our conclusion that the policy in this case unambiguously limited Century\u2019s indemnification obligation for Mauricio Arana\u2019s injuries to $25,000, with a $2,000 limit on coverage for his medical expenses, the district court\u2019s summary judgment in Century\u2019s favor is</p>\n<p id=\"Arm\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-7\">. Century also sought reformation of Seductions's insurance policy to incorporate CGL 1704's explicit exclusion of coverage for assault and battery claims. Century has not appealed the district court's denial of its motion for summary judgment on the reformation count.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b482-6\">. The Aranas argue that <em>Miami Beach Entertainment </em>and <em>Britamco Underwriter's </em>involved policies that explicitly excluded negligence claims related to assault and battery, but neither decision relied on that fact in determining whether the claims at issue arose from an assault and battery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b483-7\">. The Aranas cite <em>Accredited Bond Agencies, Inc. v. Gulf Insurance Co., </em>352 So.2d 1252 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1977), but that case involved a child allegedly assaulted in the doorway of his own home. Although the court concluded that the claims in that case fell within the defendant company\u2019s insurance coverage for \"wrongful eviction,\u201d it did not discuss the legitimacy or significance of the child's pos-sessory interest in the home.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b483-8\">. <em>Compare, e.g., Zelda, Inc. v. Northland Ins. Co., </em>56 Cal.App.4th 1252, 66 Cal.Rptr.2d 356, 363-64 (1997) (rejecting an injured restaurant patron\u2019s argument that an employee's assault and battery constituted a \"wrongful eviction\u201d under the restaurant's liability insurance policy), <em>with Z.R.L.

Dunham, </em>352 U.S. 280, 281, 77 S.Ct. 307, 1 L.Ed.2d 314 (1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
