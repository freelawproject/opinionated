He appeals the denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained after police entered his home without a warrant. We conclude that the warrantless entry into defendant\u2019s home was not justified by the emergency aid exception to the warrant requirement. We also reject the state\u2019s alternative argument that defendant consented to the entry. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, and reverse and remand the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress evidence, we review the facts on which the denial was based for any evidence, and the trial court\u2019s ruling based on those facts for legal error. <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 75, 854 P2d 421 (1993); <em>see also State v. Freund, </em>102 Or App 647, 651, 796 P2d 656 (1990) (\u201cWe are not bound by the trial court\u2019s conclusions, if the historical facts do not meet the constitutional standards for a valid consent to search.\u201d). Where findings of fact are not made on all issues and there is evidence from which such facts could be decided more than one way, we presume that the facts were decided in a manner consistent with the trial court\u2019s ultimate conclusion. <em>Ehly, </em>317 Or at 75. We state the facts in accordance with that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The state\u2019s evidence at the hearing on the motion to suppress consisted of the testimony of Officers Burnum and Hill, who responded to a 9-1-1 call from the victim, defendant\u2019s then-girlfriend, reporting a domestic disturbance. The officers testified that they were informed by dispatch that the victim had been attacked by defendant; that at one point, defendant had taken her phone to prevent her from calling 9-1-1; that defendant had broken down the door to a bathroom to \u201cget at her\u201d; and that there was a gun in a safe somewhere inside the home. The officers were also told that the victim was upstairs and \u201cfelt safe\u201d there, and that defendant was outside waiting for police to arrive.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Burnum, Hill, and a third officer arrived and found defendant sitting on the front porch of the house. Both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Burnum and Hill testified that defendant was calm and compliant and that the encounter was \u201ccasual.\u201d The officers determined that the house belonged to defendant and that the victim was inside with her dog. Hill then told defendant, \u201cI\u2019m going to go in and check on [the victim].\u201d Defendant said something like, \u201cGo on ahead. She\u2019s inside.\u201d Neither officer recalled asking for defendant\u2019s consent to enter the house, but Hill believed that defendant had consented to the entry through his reply. When questioned at the suppression hearing regarding the basis for entering without a warrant, Burnum testified that the entry was necessary \u201cto investigate if there was a crime, in fact, that happened,\u201d to see \u201cif anybody was injured inside,\u201d and because, under the circumstances, there was \u201ca person [who] was potentially injured.\u201d Additionally, Hill testified that it was her understanding that, pursuant to the community caretaker function, police are \u201cmandated\u201d to enter the home in domestic violence situations whenever \u201cthere may be somebody injured or hurt inside\u201d to ensure the safety of the individual. Thus, according to Hill, a warrantless entry into defendant\u2019s home was necessary \u201cto make sure that [the victim] was okay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Hill and the other officer entered the house to locate the victim, while Burnum continued interviewing defendant. The victim showed the officers the damaged door to the upstairs bathroom. She was upset and her right ear and side of her face were red. While inside, the officers also took photos of the bathroom door and of the victim\u2019s injuries, which were later admitted into evidence at trial. Defendant was subsequently charged with one count each of harassment and interference with making a police report.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Before trial, defendant moved to suppress all evidence obtained after the officers entered his home on the ground that the warrantless entry violated Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant argued that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>warrantless entry was not justified by any exception to the warrant requirement and that he did not consent to the entry, but had merely acquiesced to Hill\u2019s declaration that she intended to enter the home. The state responded that the entry was justified under the emergency aid exception, or, alternatively, that defendant had consented. The trial court agreed with the state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-4\">\u201cI am going to deny the motion to suppress the going into the house for several different reasons: one, the information that the police officers had was a victim had been attacked, felt safer upstairs, had the phone taken away, there was a gun somewhere in the house, maybe it was upstairs, whatever, and under the circumstances, I believe that they had the right to go in and assist * * * a person who had allegedly been attacked; secondarily, you know, his gesture to go ahead smacks to me of permission. When they indicated that, you know, they wanted to do that, certainly if he didn\u2019t want them to do it, he could have said so[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pA12\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-5\">\u201c* * * And so I think under the community caretaking exception, this clearly was allowable for them to come in.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Following a bench trial, the court convicted defendant on both counts. At sentencing, the court imposed a single $500 fine and a $60 \u201cUnitary Assessment\u201d on each count as part of defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">On appeal, defendant raises two assignments of error. In his first assignment, defendant contends that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to suppress because neither reason cited by the court justified the war-rantless entry into defendant\u2019s home. Specifically, defendant argues that the emergency aid exception is unavailing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>because officers lacked a subjective belief, or objectively reasonable grounds for a belief, that the victim had suffered a \u201cserious physical injury or harm\u201d requiring immediate assistance. Defendant further argues that he did not consent to the warrantless entry because the officer\u2019s statement\u2014\u201cI\u2019m going to go in and check on [the victim]\u201d\u2014was not a request for consent and did not give defendant an opportunity to deny officers entry into the home. In his second assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court plainly erred by imposing the $60 \u201cUnitary Assessment\u201d fees because the statute authorizing such assessments, <em>former </em>ORS 137.290 (2009), was repealed before sentencing in this case. Or Laws 2011, ch 597, \u00a7 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">We begin with defendant\u2019s arguments regarding the emergency aid exception. Under Article I, section 9, war-rantless entries and searches are <em>per se </em>unreasonable unless they fall within one of the few well-delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement. <em>State v. Baker, </em>350 Or 641, 647, 260 P3d 476 (2011) (citing <em>State v. Davis, </em>295 Or 227, 237, 666 P2d 802 (1983)). One such exception is the emergency aid exception, which applies \u201cwhen police officers have an objectively reasonable belief, based on articulable facts, that a warrantless entry is necessary to either render immediate aid to persons, or to assist persons who have suffered, or who are imminently threatened with suffering, serious physical injury or harm.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>350 Or at 649 (footnotes omitted). Stated another way, in order for the emergency aid exception to apply, the state must prove that, at the time of the warrantless entry, the officers held a subjective belief that there was an immediate need to assist a person who has suffered (or is imminently threatened with suffering) \u201cserious physical injury or harm,\u201d and that that belief was objectively reasonable. <em>State v. Hamilton, </em>285 Or App 315, 321, 397 P3d 61 (2017); <em>State v. McCullough, </em>264 Or App 496, 502-03, 336 P3d 6 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">In this case, it is unnecessary to address whether objectively reasonable grounds existed for the officers to believe that the victim had suffered serious physical injury because we conclude that there is no evidence in the record that the officers <em>subjectively </em>held such a belief. The record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>of the motion-to-suppress hearing reveals that neither Burnum nor Hill testified to having an actual belief that the victim was seriously injured and in need of immediate assistance. Burnum testified only that she needed to see <em>\u201cif </em>there was a crime, in fact, that happened,\u201d <em>\u201cif </em>anybody was injured inside,\u201d and that the victim was \u201ca person [who] was <em>potentially </em>injured.\u201d (Emphases added.) Similarly, Hill testified to her knowledge that there had been a \u201cdomestic situation\u201d and that defendant had \u201cattacked\u201d the victim and taken her phone, and that, under the community caretaking exception, a warrantless entry was required \u201cto <em>make sure </em>that [the victim] was okay.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">That testimony establishes that the officers were, instead, acting out of a concern to find out <em>whether </em>the victim was injured, and a belief that they were required to do so in situations involving reported domestic violence. Our recent case law makes clear, however, that the emergency aid exception requires more than a speculative concern that someone may need assistance; rather, police must actually have a subjective belief that a person <em>is </em>seriously injured and in need of immediate assistance. <em>See, e.g., Hamilton, </em>285 Or App at 322 (explaining that \u201c[t]he subjective belief required for the emergency aid exception to apply is the belief that a search is necessary because there is \u2018an immediate need to aid or assist a person who has suffered * * * serious physical injury or harm,\u2019 not the belief that a search is necessary <em>to discover </em>\u00bf/there is an immediate need to aid or assist a seriously injured person\u201d) (emphasis in original). \u201cA speculative belief that someone <em>might </em>require aid does not justify a war-rantless search under the emergency aid exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 323 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Here, the state argues that the officers\u2019 knowledge that defendant and the victim had had a physical altercation, in addition to their knowledge that defendant had at least momentarily taken the victim\u2019s phone and that there was a gun in the house, was sufficient to support an inference that a \u201cphysical act of violence\u201d had occurred that \u201ccould have escalated\u201d into something more serious. According to the state, the officers\u2019 belief that emergency aid was required could have been based on that inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>We agree that an officer\u2019s subjective belief that emergency aid is required may be based on reasonable inference from other facts. The problem here, however, is not the state\u2019s reliance on inference; it is that the record does not reflect that either Burnum or Hill ever formed the requisite subjective belief that the victim <em>had </em>suffered a serious physical injury or harm requiring immediate aid. According to their own testimony, the officers did not have a belief one way or another as to whether the victim was injured or in need of immediate assistance; Hill entered the home to find out. Without an actual, subjective belief that the victim needed their immediate assistance, and without any evidence that defendant continued to pose a threat to the victim\u2019s safety, the officers could not act under the emergency aid exception. <em>See McCullough, </em>264 Or App at 504 (officer\u2019s testimony that his intention in entering the trailer was \u201cto make sure that defendant was okay and to check on his well-being\u201d based on the officer\u2019s belief that the defendant had been injured in a car crash, though revealing \u201cwell-founded speculation that perhaps not all was well with defendant,\u201d fell short of a subjective belief that intervention was necessary to protect the defendant from the effects of serious physical injury or harm).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">We turn to whether defendant consented to the war-rantless entry into his home. When relying on the consent exception to the warrant requirement, the state must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that someone having the authority to do so voluntarily consented to the entry. <em>State v. Jepson, </em>254 Or App 290, 294, 292 P3d 660 (2012). \u201cThe test for voluntariness is whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the consent was given by an act of a defendant\u2019s free will, as opposed to resulting from express or implied coercion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Defendant argues that his statement to Hill (\u201cGo on ahead. She\u2019s inside.\u201d) was not an expression of consent but, rather, acquiescence to Hill\u2019s declaration that she was <em>\u201cgoing to </em>go in and check on [the victim].\u201d (Emphasis added.) According to defendant, Hill\u2019s statement communicated \u201cin no uncertain terms\u201d that a warrantless entry was inevitable, leaving defendant with no meaningful choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>A defendant\u2019s \u201cmere acquiescence\u201d to police authority does not constitute voluntary consent. <em>State v. Berg, </em>223 Or App 387, 392, 196 P3d 547 (2008), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>228 Or App 754, 208 P3d 1006, <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 361 (2009). \u201c[Acquiescence occurs when an individual is not given a reasonable opportunity to choose to consent or when he or she is informed that a search will occur regardless of whether consent is given.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In determining whether a particular interaction between police and a defendant amounts to consent, courts pay close attention to the words used by the officer requesting consent. <em>State v. Briggs, </em>257 Or App 738, 742, 307 P3d 564, <em>rev den, </em>354 Or 386 (2013). \u201cWhen those words do not provide the listener with a reasonable opportunity to choose to consent, or when those words leave the listener with the impression that a search is inevitable, absent strong countervailing factors, we have consistently found acquiescence rather than consent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 742-43; <em>see, e.g., Jepson, </em>254 Or App at 296 (the officer\u2019s statement that \u201c\u2018we\u2019re going to have to take the firearms,\u2019 *** was not a request to obtain consent, but rather, an unconditional statement, which did not invite a response other than acquiescence\u201d); <em>Freund, </em>102 Or App at 652 (officer\u2019s statement \u201cthat \u2018he was there\u2019 to pick up the marijuana and \u2018he wanted\u2019 to do it calmly\u201d was unconditional and communicated to the defendant that she had \u201cno choice whether a search would occur\u201d); <em>cf. State v. Ry/Guinto, </em>211 Or App 298, 306-07, 154 P3d 724, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 224 (2007) (officer\u2019s \u201cdogged persistence\u201d in trying to obtain consent to search a vehicle, despite the defendant\u2019s repeated statements that there were no weapons in the vehicle, did not render the defendant\u2019s consent to search involuntary where the officer\u2019s requests expressed both his desire to receive consent to search and his understanding that he could not search without consent); <em>Briggs, </em>257 Or App at 743-44 (holding that the state met its burden of proving that consent was voluntary where, despite the officer\u2019s declaratory statement\u2014\u201cI need to talk to the person that just ran in\u201d\u2014the officer\u2019s words did not convey to the listener that she had no choice as to whether a search would occur). \u201cThere is, in ordinary social intercourse, a world of difference between saying \u2018I\u2019d like to come in,\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019m coming in.\u2019\u201d <em>Ry/Guinto, </em>211 Or App at 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>In this case, we agree with defendant that Hill\u2019s declaratory statement was not a request for consent to enter the house and invited no response other than acquiescence. Hill told defendant, unconditionally, that she was \u201cgoing to go in\u201d to check on the victim. Moreover, unlike certain declaratory statements which we have interpreted as requests for consent, <em>see Briggs, </em>257 Or App at 743-44, Hill\u2019s statement conveyed neither a choice between allowing or denying entry, nor the idea that the officers would not\u2014and could not\u2014enter without defendant\u2019s consent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rather, defendant\u2019s only options were to agree to the war-rantless entry or to challenge an officer\u2019s plainly articulated intent to enter the home. <em>See Freund, </em>102 Or App at 652 (\u201c [Defendant was likely to conclude that the choice merely was between cooperating or not cooperating with a search that was bound to occur.\u201d). Under those circumstances, we conclude that the state failed to meet its burden of proving that defendant\u2019s response amounted to anything more than passive acquiescence to Hall\u2019s stated intent to enter the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">In sum, we conclude that the trial court erred when it denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result of the warrantless entry into his home.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Furthermore, we reject the state\u2019s contention that the admission of that evidence\u2014which included photographs of the broken bathroom door and the victim\u2019s injuries\u2014was harmless. A trial court\u2019s evidentiary error is harmless only if we can say that there was there was \u201clittle likelihood\u201d that the error affected the verdict. <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003). As defendant points out, the state referred to the wrongly admitted evidence in closing argument, remarking that the photographs and injuries were \u201cconsistent with [the victim\u2019s] description of events.\u201d The trial court found the victim to be more credible, explaining in its speaking verdict that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>evidence, and specifically the victim\u2019s injuries (which were documented through photographs taken inside the home), was consistent with the victim\u2019s version of the events. Under the circumstances of this case, which was essentially a credibility contest between the victim and defendant, we cannot conclude that there was little likelihood that the erroneously admitted evidence had an effect on the court\u2019s verdict.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-3\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b422-6\"> Article I, section 9, provides, in part, that \u201c[n]o law shall violate the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure.\u201d Similarly, the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in part, that \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b423-8\"> Although the trial court stated that the warrantless entry was permissible under the \u201ccommunity caretaking exception,\u201d it is apparent from the parties\u2019 arguments below that the issue was whether the entry was permissible under the emergency aid exception to the warrant requirement. <em>See State v. Martin, </em>222 Or App 138, 146, 193 P3d 993 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 690 (2009) (holding that, in order for a warrantless community-caretaking search of a home to be lawful, the search must also fall under one of the constitutional exceptions to the warrant requirement).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b428-5\"> Although it is not part of our analysis as to whether Hill\u2019s statement could reasonably be interpreted as a request for consent, we note that, at the suppression hearing, when asked what she would have done if defendant had told her that she could not come in, Hill answered that she \u201cstill would have gone inside.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b428-6\"> The state does not dispute that, if the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress, all of the evidence obtained as a result of the warrantless entry into defendant\u2019s home\u2014including the photographs and the victim\u2019s statements to officers\u2014was subject to suppression.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b429-4\"> In light of our conclusion, we need not address defendant\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
