J.</author>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Defendant appeals judgments of conviction for multiple domestic-violence offenses. He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s failure to sustain defense objections or grant a mistrial in response to the state\u2019s closing argument, in which the prosecutor made comments critical of defense counsel and asserted that the defense was \u201cnot asking for justice.\u201d We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s statements crossed the boundary of permissible argument and prejudiced defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion, and we reverse and remand the judgments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The relevant facts are procedural and undisputed. The convictions underlying this appeal arose from two criminal cases against defendant. In the first case, defendant was charged with one count of felony fourth-degree assault, ORS 163.160(3), and one count of strangulation, ORS 163.187. In the second case, defendant was charged with second-degree kidnapping, ORS 163.225; two counts of first-degree burglary, ORS 164.225; unlawful use of a weapon, ORS 166.220(l)(a); three counts of felony fourth-degree assault, ORS 163.160(3); two counts of strangulation, ORS 163.187; and menacing, ORS 163.190. The two indictments alleged that all of the counts for assault, strangulation, and menacing were offenses constituting domestic violence. ORS 132.586(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The cases were consolidated and tried to a jury. The state\u2019s case was based largely on the testimony of defendant\u2019s then-wife, C, along with testimony from police officers who had spoken with C and observed her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">During cross-examination, defense counsel highlighted incongruities in C\u2019s testimony and questioned C about contradictions between her trial testimony and her earlier statements to police. In the course of the cross-examination, the trial court prohibited defense counsel from using the word \u201csupposedly\u201d to refer to the events at issue on the ground that the word was argumentative, although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>court allowed defense counsel to use the term \u201callegedly.\u201d The court ruled that both words would be allowed during closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">In closing argument, defense counsel again emphasized the inconsistencies and incongruities in C\u2019s description of events. Consistent with the trial court\u2019s earlier ruling, defense counsel used the term \u201csupposedly\u201d multiple times during closing argument to describe the allegations. She also emphasized that defendant had no obligation to put on evidence to dispute C\u2019s version of the events, stating that \u201cthe burden is not on [defendant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">During the state\u2019s rebuttal argument, the prosecutor made several comments that are the subject of this appeal. The prosecutor asserted that defense counsel \u201csays that this victim can\u2019t be believed because basically her story doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d arguing that \u201cthat\u2019s what happens to these victims, they get pummeled so often that it all runs together and then defense attorneys come into Court and say don\u2019t believe them, they\u2019re dishonest, they\u2019re making it up.\u201d The prosecutor stated that C had \u201cto come into this courtroom [to] basically be mocked,\u201d characterizing the defense as portraying C as a \u201cmoron,\u201d \u201cmistaken,\u201d and \u201cconfused.\u201d The prosecutor proceeded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">\u201c [C] is uncontradicted in her testimony. Uncontradicted. Meaning that she\u2019s the one that told you what happened during these assaults, she\u2019s the one who told you how her pain was, she was the one who told you what her injuries were, and there was no evidence to contradict what she said he did. Did she have any inconsistencies? Yes, she did. * * * She did her very best to do everything that she could to tell you what happened to her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">\u201cWe told you that this case was about power, rage and ' control, and we\u2019ve seen that over and over again in everything that happened to her. And the defense, what have they told you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">At that point, defense counsel objected, arguing that the prosecutor had impermissibly \u201cshift [ed] the burden.\u201d The court disagreed, and the prosecutor continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-9\">\u201cWhat this attorney has done during the course of this trial is use the words \u2018allegedly\u2019 and \u2018supposedly.\u2019 We\u2019ve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>heard her for two days now. \u2018Allegedly\u2019 and \u2018supposedly.\u2019 The acts allegedly happened, it supposedly happened, she gets up here and makes those statements. You know who can take those words away from her? You guys. You can take those words away from her. There\u2019s no \u2018alleged\u2019 about this; there is no \u2018supposed\u2019 about this. This victim was beat to a pulp on at least three occasions, on at least three that we\u2019re talking about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-3\">\u201cAnd the thing about this case that is just amazing is that the defense believes that you\u2019re not going to find the victim credible and that you\u2019re going to let him walk. They\u2019re here today, they\u2019re not asking for justice, they\u2019re asking for\u2014\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Defense counsel then moved for a mistrial. The trial court permitted the prosecution to conclude its rebuttal and excused the jury before hearing argument on defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Defense counsel argued that the prosecutor had shifted the burden of persuasion, had \u201cpersonally attack [ed] \u201d and mischaracterized the constitutional role of defense counsel, and had inappropriately commented on defendant\u2019s right to remain silent. The court expressed concern about the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cjustice\u201d comment and described the prosecutor\u2019s comment as being \u201cclose to some lines of civility,\u201d but denied the motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The trial court provided standard jury instructions that the jury should not regard attorneys\u2019 arguments as evidence and that the jury should decide the case without \u201cbias, sympathy or prejudice,\u201d but the court gave no instruction specifically regarding the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cjustice\u201d comment or any other statement that was made during rebuttal. The jury acquitted defendant on the burglary counts, failed to reach a verdict on the kidnapping and unlawful use of a weapon counts, and convicted defendant on the remaining eight counts, with a nonunanimous guilty verdict on one of those counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">On appeal, defendant renews his argument that his right to a fair trial was compromised by the prosecutor\u2019s statements during rebuttal, and that the trial court should have, at a minimum, sustained defendant\u2019s objection to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>prosecutor\u2019s statement that defense counsel was \u201cnot asking for justice.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">Control of counsel\u2019s argument is within the trial court\u2019s discretion, but \u201c\u2018that discretion is not unbounded.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Farokhrany, </em>259 Or App 132, 137, 312 P3d 584 (2013) (quoting <em>State v. Lundbom, </em>96 Or App 458, 461, 773 P2d 11, <em>rev den, </em>308 Or 382 (1989)). A trial court abuses its discretion when it overrules a defendant\u2019s objection to a prosecutor\u2019s improper argument if the argument is \u201clikely to prejudice the jury unfairly,\u201d and the trial court does not take action sufficient to cure the prejudice. <em>State v. Logston, </em>270 Or App 296, 303, 347 P3d 352 (2015) (quoting <em>State v. Bolt, </em>108 Or App 746, 749, 817 P2d 1322 (1991)); <em>cf. State v. Worth, </em>231 Or App 69, 79, 218 P3d 166 (2009), <em>rev den, </em>347 Or 718 (2010) (finding an abuse of discretion where the trial court \u201cerred in overruling defendant\u2019s objections to the prosecutor\u2019s misstatements in closing about the presumption of innocence, the court failed to recognize that it had erred, and the court did not sufficiently correct the error\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Here, defendant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were improper in that they criticized defendant\u2019s counsel for merely holding the state to its burden, questioning C\u2019s credibility, and alluding to the presumption of defendant\u2019s innocence. In defendant\u2019s view, the prosecutor\u2019s argument improperly suggested that defense counsel had further victimized C and that defense counsel\u2019s efforts were not in furtherance of justice. In response, the state argues that the prosecutor was merely criticizing the defense counsel\u2019s closing argument and not defense counsel personally, and that, even if the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cjustice\u201d comment was improper, the statement was \u201cisolated\u201d and unlikely to prejudice the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">When a prosecutor attempts to influence the jury by making \u201cunwarranted personal attacks\u201d on defense counsel, that conduct is \u201cnot only unfair, but it impugns the integrity of the system as a whole\u201d because such conduct \u201cdangerously overshadow [s] what a defendant\u2019s case is really about.\u201d <em>Lundbom, </em>96 Or App at 461-62. Our case law defines prose-cutorial misconduct as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\">\u201cany activity by the prosecutor which tends to divert the jury from making its determination of guilt or innocence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>by weighing the legally admitted evidence in the manner prescribed by law. It commonly involves an appeal to the jurors\u2019 prejudices, fears, or notions of popular sentiment by presenting to them inadmissible evidence; or urging them to make inferences not based on the evidence; or to disregard the evidence altogether and base their determination on wholly irrelevant factors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-4\"><em>State v. James Edward Smith, </em>4 Or App 261, 264, 478 P2d 417 (1970) (citation omitted). Here, viewing the prosecutor\u2019s statement that the defense was \u201cnot asking for justice\u201d within the context of the state\u2019s entire rebuttal argument, we conclude that the prosecutor improperly urged the jury to find defendant guilty based, not exclusively on the strength of the state\u2019s evidence, but on a desire to punish defense counsel for C\u2019s treatment at trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Throughout rebuttal, the prosecutor conveyed to the jury that defense counsel had somehow acted improperly by attempting to undermine C\u2019s credibility. At one point, the prosecutor criticized \u201cdefense attorneys\u201d for challenging complainants\u2019 testimony at trial. (\u201c[T] hat\u2019s what happens to these victims, they get pummeled so often that it all runs together and then <em>defense attorneys </em>come into Court and say don\u2019t believe them, they\u2019re dishonest, they\u2019re making it up.\u201d (Emphasis added.)). Following that statement, the prosecutor suggested that defense counsel had \u201cmocked\u201d C and had portrayed C as a \u201cmoron.\u201d Then, despite the trial court\u2019s earlier rulings to the contrary, the prosecutor implied that defense counsel\u2019s use of the terms \u201callegedly\u201d and \u201csupposedly\u201d was somehow improper, asking the jury to \u201ctake those words away from her\u201d\u2014referring specifically to defense counsel. (Emphasis added.) Some of the prosecutor\u2019s statements were properly directed at defendant\u2019s theory of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number><em>case\u2014i.e., </em>those statements that attempted to explain why a domestic-violence victim may provide inconsistent accounts of particular instances of abuse. Nevertheless, when the state\u2019s rebuttal culminated in the prosecutor\u2019s statement that defense counsel was \u201cnot asking for justice,\u201d the prosecutor, whether inadvertently or not, invited the jury to find defendant guilty in part to punish defense counsel. <em>Cf. Lundbom, </em>96 Or App at 461 (reversing conviction based on prosecutor\u2019s attack on defense counsel\u2019s integrity that \u201ccould only have been calculated to elicit an emotional response from the jury\u201d). That invitation created a risk that the jury would be motivated to find defendant guilty not because the state had proven every element of the charged offenses beyond a reasonable doubt, but based on animosity toward \u201cdefense attorneys\u201d who \u201cmock[]\u201d domestic-violence victims who choose to testify against their abusers. <em>See Farokhrany, </em>259 Or App at 137 (a prosecutor engages in misconduct when she appeals to \u201c\u00a3the jurors\u2019 prejudices, fears, or notions of popular sentiment by presenting to them inadmissible evidence\u2019\u201d or when she urges the jury \u201c\u2018to disregard the evidence altogether and base their determination on wholly irrelevant factors\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Smith, 4 </em>Or App at 264)). The argument was improper, and the trial court should not have allowed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\">We turn to whether there is \u201c\u2018little likelihood that the particular error affected the verdict.\u2019\u201d <em>See Logston, </em>270 Or App at 307 (quoting <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003)) (applying harmless-error standard after concluding that the trial court erred in overruling the defendant\u2019s objection to the prosecutor\u2019s improper argument).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">As discussed above, the prosecutor\u2019s statements improperly attacked defense counsel for testing C\u2019s account of the events. The trial court\u2019s subsequent failure to take ameliorative action then effectively gave the prosecutor\u2019s comments an unjustified air of validity. <em>See Worth, </em>231 Or App at 79 (observing that, when the trial court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection, it \u201cgave the jury reason to think that the prosecutor\u2019s statement was, in fact, a correct statement of the law\u201d); <em>Maney v. Angelozzi, </em>285 Or App 596, 616, 397 P3d 567 (2017) (reasoning that, by \u201cpotentially discrediting [defense] counsel,\u201d the trial court \u201cmay well have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>closed [the jurors\u2019] minds to counsel\u2019s argument\u201d); <em>State v. Seeger, </em>4 Or App 336, 339, 479 P2d 240 (1971) (reasoning that the court\u2019s failure to recognize the prosecutor\u2019s comment as improper \u201cwas tantamount to judicial approval of the statement\u201d). The state\u2019s case turned in large part on C\u2019s credibility, and, despite the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments, the jury acquitted defendant on two counts, could not reach a verdict on two counts, and failed to reach unanimity on one other count. <em>See Logston, </em>270 Or App at 307 (taking into account the fact that the jury was not unanimous in analyzing whether the error was harmless). Under those circumstances, we cannot conclude that the error was harmless. <em>See id. </em>(reasoning that, \u201cin light of the central role of the complainant\u2019s credibility,\u201d and the fact that the prosecutor\u2019s improper argument related to the defendant\u2019s efforts to undermine that credibility, the error was not harmless); <em>Seeger, </em>4 Or App at 339-40 (the prosecutor\u2019s comment that the defendant was going to \u201cmake up a story\u201d was prejudicial because, had \u201cthe jury believed the defendant and his witnesses, the state\u2019s case would have failed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-8\"> In light of our disposition, we do not reach defendant\u2019s other assignments of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b208-6\"> The state argues that we must consider the prosecutor\u2019s statement that defense counsel was \u201cnot asking for justice\u201d in isolation because defendant did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s earlier statements as personal attacks on defense counsel. We disagree. The prosecutor\u2019s earlier statements provide context for determining what message the prosecutor in fact conveyed to the jury; therefore, we consider the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal in its entirety. <em>Cf. State v. Werder, </em>112 Or App 179, 183-84, 828 P2d 474 (1992) (concluding that the prosecutor\u2019s statement that \u201cthe defense in this case has absolutely no integrity whatsoever\u201d was not improper because the context made clear that the prosecutor was referring to \u201can inconsistency in the arguments advanced by the defense and was not an attack on the integrity of defense counsel himself\u2019).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
