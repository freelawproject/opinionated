Among the terms of defendant\u2019s sentence, the judgment ordered defendant to pay, in addition to fines, a monetary award of $60 to the state on each conviction as a \u201cMandatory State Amt.\u201d On appeal, defendant challenges the imposition of that monetary award, arguing that the trial court erred because imposing the award separately from the imposed fines was not authorized by any statute. The state concedes that imposing the monetary award was reversible trial court error. <em>See State v. Machado, </em>278 Or App 164, 373 P3d 1224 (2016) (portion of judgment imposing $60 \u201cMandatory State Amt\u201d reversed because the trial court lacked statutory authority to impose it). We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession. We therefore reverse the portion of the judgment that imposes a $60 \u201cMandatory State Amt\u201d on each of defendant\u2019s convictions. We reject without written discussion defendant\u2019s remaining 10 assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Portion of judgment requiring defendant to pay $60 \u201cMandatory State Amt\u201d for each conviction reversed; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
