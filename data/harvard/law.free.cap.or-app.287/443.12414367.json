J.</author>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The issue presented in this post-conviction appeal is whether a defense lawyer exercising reasonable professional skill and judgment would have challenged the evidence at petitioner\u2019s criminal trial as insufficient to establish that he was armed with a deadly weapon during his commission of a burglary. To resolve that issue, we must determine whether an unloaded firearm qualifies as a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d when the firearm is contained in a closed, zippered carrying case and is possessed together with a separate bag that contains ammunition for the firearm. As we will explain, we conclude that those circumstances do not satisfy the statutory meaning of deadly weapon for purposes of first-degree burglary. We further conclude that, because petitioner\u2019s criminal trial counsel did not challenge the sufficiency of the state\u2019s evidence, petitioner was denied reasonably competent counsel and was prejudiced by the greater sentence he received based on his possession of a deadly weapon in committing the burglary. The post-conviction court therefore erred in denying post-conviction relief, and we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The relevant facts are not disputed. Petitioner was charged by indictment with burglary in the first degree, theft in the first degree (five counts), felon in possession of a firearm (four counts), and aggravated theft in the first degree. The first-degree burglary charge alleged that petitioner had \u201cunlawfully and knowingly enter [ed] or remain [ed] in a dwelling *** with the intent to commit the crime of theft therein, while armed with a deadly weapon [.] \u201d Petitioner waived his right to a jury and was tried by the court. At trial, the state presented evidence that petitioner had unlawfully entered an unoccupied dwelling; once inside, he stole four of the victim\u2019s 14 firearms and all of the victim\u2019s ammunition. One of the stolen firearms was a Smith and Wesson AR-15. According to the victim, the AR-15 was fully functional, unloaded, and inside a closed, zippered, black \u201ccarry bag.\u201d The victim kept the ammunition for his various firearms in a separate bag. That bag included ammunition for the AR-15, but not for any of the other three firearms stolen in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>the burglary. The ammunition for the AR-15 consisted of \u201c25 P-mags fully loaded.\u201d The victim explained that a \u201cP-mag\u201d is \u201ca magazine that fits in the bottom of the AR-15 that holds the rounds so you can shoot\u2014every time you pull the trigger, it loads one in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">The principal issue at petitioner\u2019s criminal trial was identity\u2014that is, whether petitioner was the person who had entered the dwelling and taken the victim\u2019s firearms and ammunition. In closing argument, the state, in urging that the allegations relevant to first-degree burglary were satisfied, pointed to the fact that four operational firearms were taken, together with the ammunition; beyond that, the state focused on evidence that petitioner was the person who committed the burglary. Defense counsel did not, by motion for judgment of acquittal or through closing argument, challenge the evidence as insufficient to show that petitioner possessed a deadly weapon. <em>Cf. State v. McCants/Walker, </em>231 Or App 570, 576, 220 P3d 436 (2009), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds by State v. Baker-Krofft, </em>348 Or 655, 239 P3d 226 (2010) (in bench trial, sufficiency of evidence may be challenged either by formal motion for judgment of acquittal or by clearly raising issue in closing argument).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the conclusion of the evidence, the trial court found petitioner guilty of all charges, including first-degree burglary. In sentencing petitioner on that charge, the trial court ranked the burglary as a crime category 9, rather than a 7, based on petitioner\u2019s possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of the crime.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under that crime category ranking, the trial court imposed an upward departure sentence of 144 months incarceration, followed by 36 months post-prison supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Petitioner brought this action for post-conviction relief, alleging that he was denied adequate and effective assistance of criminal trial counsel under the state and federal constitutions. In particular, petitioner claimed that the evidence was insufficient to show that he possessed a deadly weapon when he committed the burglary, and that competent counsel would have moved for a judgment of acquittal and challenged petitioner\u2019s burglary sentence on that ground. Petitioner relied on ORS 161.015(2), which defines \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d as \u201cany instrument, article or substance specifically designed for and <em>presently capable </em>of causing death or serious physical injury.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The evidence at petitioner\u2019s criminal trial established that the AR-15, the only stolen firearm for which there was ammunition, was unloaded and in a carry bag, while the loaded magazines for it were in another bag. Such a firearm, petitioner argued, was not \u201cpresently capable\u201d of causing death or serious physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">In response, the state<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> argued that \u201c[a] 11 that\u2019s required is that a weapon be operable and that there be ammunition for that weapon.\u201d The ammunition in this instance, the state stressed, \u201cwas loaded in a PMAG, which means essentially you just have to slip it into the weapon and the weapon is ready to fire.\u201d According to the state, the fact that the AR-15 was in a case was \u201cnot enough to stop \u00e1 weapon from being deadly\u201d and was at most a \u201cminor hurdle to loading a weapon.\u201d Petitioner replied by emphasizing that the AR-15 and the ammunition were not \u201ctogether\u201d in such a way that loading the AR-15 required simply slipping an ammunition magazine into the rifle. Instead, the AR-15 was in one case, while the ammunition for it was in a separate bag, mixed in with ammunition for firearms that petitioner had not stolen. According to petitioner, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of steps that [would] need to be taken before the AR-15 is presently capable, one of which [is] figuring out which ammunition would even go into that gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The post-conviction court denied relief. In explaining its ruling, the court noted that the dispute raised an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>\u201cinteresting issue,\u201d no case law was directly on point, and the issue was one that \u201cthe Court of Appeals can take a look at * * * and probably give us some more guidance.\u201d Factually, the post-conviction court found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-4\">\u201c[petitioner] entered and took numerous unloaded weapons but took ammunition that fit one of them. It would have taken only seconds to load that gun. [Petitioner] therefore [had] an easily loaded gun inside someone else\u2019s home.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">In the post-conviction court\u2019s view, such a circumstance fell within the danger that the legislature sought to <em>avoid\u2014i.e., </em>the risk to an occupant posed by someone who unlawfully enters and remains in a home while having the capability of using a weapon. The court concluded that a motion for judgment of acquittal challenging the sufficiency of the evidence on the deadly weapon allegation would have failed, and petitioner therefore was not denied adequate representation by counsel. Petitioner then brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">To prevail on a post-conviction claim for inadequate assistance of counsel under Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution, a petitioner must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, facts demonstrating that counsel failed to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment and that the petitioner suffered prejudice as a result. <em>Trujillo v. Maass, </em>312 Or 431, 435, 822 P2d 703 (1991). As to the first part of the test, \u201c[i]f a lawyer exercising reasonable professional skill would have recognized the existence of an issue and would have concluded under the circumstances that the benefits of raising it outweighed the risks of doing so, failing to raise the issue may constitute inadequate assistance.\u201d <em>Krieg v. Belleque, </em>221 Or App 36, 40, 188 P3d 413 (2008). As to the second part of the test, \u201ca petitioner must show that his or her trial counsel\u2019s deficiency had a tendency to affect the verdict.\u201d <em>Short v. Hill, </em>195 Or App 723, 729, 99 P3d 311 (2004), <em>rev den, </em>338 Or 374 (2005).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>On appeal, petitioner essentially renews the arguments he made to the post-conviction court. Petitioner claims, first, that his criminal trial counsel was constitutionally inadequate for failing to move for a judgment of acquittal challenging the evidence as insufficient to show that he possessed a deadly weapon. Petitioner argues that he was prejudiced by that failure, because such a motion would have resulted in his acquittal on the burglary charge. Second, petitioner claims that his criminal trial counsel was constitutionally inadequate for failing to object to his sentence on the burglary charge, which was based on a higher crime classification due to his possession of a deadly weapon while committing the offense. On that claim, he asserts prejudice based on the greater sentence that he received on the burglary conviction due to the finding that he possessed a weapon during the crime\u2019s commission. Both claims turn on the same threshold legal <em>issue\u2014viz., </em>the meaning of \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d for purposes of burglary in the first degree. We therefore begin with that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">A. <em>The Meaning of \u201cDeadly Weapon\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">To resolve the meaning of \u201cdeadly weapon,\u201d we follow the familiar interpretative methodology set out in <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 206 P3d 1042 (2009) (refining analysis articulated in <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 859 P2d 1143 (1993)). Our task is to determine the legislature\u2019s intent, which we do by examining a statute\u2019s text, context, and any pertinent legislative history. <em>Gaines, </em>346 Or at 171-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Under Oregon\u2019s statutory scheme, burglary is either a first-degree or second-degree offense, depending on whether certain aggravating factors are involved in the commission of the crime. The baseline offense, burglary in the second degree, is committed if a person \u201centers or remains unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein.\u201d ORS 164.215. Burglary in the second degree elevates to first degree if any of several specified circumstances are involved in the crime\u2019s commission. If, for example, the building involved is a dwelling, that circumstance alone elevates the crime to first-degree burglary. ORS 164.225(1). Other circumstances that elevate second-degree burglary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>to first-degree burglary do so regardless whether the building involved is a dwelling or nondwelling. <em>See </em>ORS 164.225 (l)(a)-(c) (second-degree burglary elevates to first-degree burglary if \u201cthe building is a dwelling, or if in effecting entry or while in a building or in immediate flight therefrom\u201d other aggravating circumstances exist). As relevant here, when an offender commits what would otherwise be second-degree burglary while armed with a \u201cdeadly weapon,\u201d the offense elevates to first-degree burglary. ORS 164.225(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">For purposes of first-degree burglary, as well as for the criminal code more generally, \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d is defined as \u201cany instrument, article or substance specifically designed for and <em>presently capable </em>of causing death or serious physical injury.\u201d ORS 161.015(2) (emphasis added). The pivotal question here is not what it means for a weapon to be \u201ccapable\u201d of causing death or serious physical injury, but what it means for a weapon to be \u201cpresently\u201d capable of causing those harms. More specifically, and casting the issue in terms of the facts that this case presents, the question is whether a fully operational firearm, when carried unloaded in a closed case, along with ammunition in a separate bag, is \u201cpresently\u201d capable of causing death or serious physical injury in the sense that the legislature contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Because \u201cpresently\u201d is a word of ordinary usage, both parties look to dictionary definitions to aid in determining the legislature\u2019s intent. Petitioner relies on one definition set out in <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1793 (unabridged ed 2002): \u201cwithout delay or hesitation : FORTHWITH, IMMEDIATELY.\u201d Drawing on that definition, petitioner argues that possessing an unloaded firearm in a closed carrying case, and ammunition in a separate bag, precludes a conclusion that the firearm can cause death or injury immediately and without delay. The state, however, relies on an alternative definition of \u201cpresently\u201d from Webster\u2019s: \u201cafter a little while : before long : after a short time[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1793.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Drawing on that alternative meaning, the state argues that where, as here, a factfinder could conclude that the firearm could be loaded in a short time, the statutory requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>that the firearm be \u201cpresently\u201d capable of causing death or serious physical injury is met.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Both petitioner\u2019s and the state\u2019s proffered meanings of \u201cpresently\u201d are plausible when the definition of \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d is viewed in isolation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Petitioner\u2019s position, however, is bolstered by the broader statutory context in which the term \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d appears. The criminal code generally, and the first-degree burglary statute in particular, distinguish between \u201cdeadly\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d weapons. A \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d is defined as one \u201cwhich under the circumstances in which it is used, attempted to be used or threatened to be used, is <em>readily capable </em>of causing death or serious physical injury.\u201d ORS 161.015(1) (emphasis added). As pertinent to our analysis here, the key distinction between a deadly and a dangerous weapon is the difference between being \u201cpresently\u201d versus \u201creadily\u201d capable of causing death or serious physical injury. <em>Webster\u2019s </em>defines \u201creadily\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>\u201c[I]n a ready manner : with readiness: as a: with prompt willingness : without hesitating, quibbling, or delaying : with alacrity : WILLINGLY *** b: with fairly quick efficiency : without needless loss of time : reasonably fast : SPEEDILY * * * c: with a fair degree of ease : without much difficulty : with facility : EASILY * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-4\"><em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 1889. Thus, both \u201creadily\u201d and \u201cpresently\u201d could mean, as the state urges, in a short time. But \u201cpresently,\u201d unlike \u201creadily,\u201d potentially can mean something else: immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The overlap in the meaning of the two terms favors petitioner\u2019s position. Ordinarily, when the legislature uses different terms, we assume that the legislature intends those terms to have different meanings. <em>Dept. of Transportation v. Stallcup, </em>341 Or 93, 101, 138 P3d 9 (2006). That assumption is particularly warranted when, as here, the terms appear together in the same statutory scheme and give rise to different legal consequences. For the crime of burglary, being armed with a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d while committing a burglary elevates the offense to a first-degree crime. ORS 164.225(l)(a). Merely being armed with a \u201cdangerous\u201d weapon, however, is not an aggravating factor at all. Instead, a person must use or threaten to use the dangerous weapon to elevate conduct that would otherwise be second-degree burglary to a first-degree crime. ORS 164.225(l)(c). If we were to construe \u201cpresently\u201d to mean \u201cafter a short time,\u201d little, if any, meaningful difference would seem to remain between a deadly and dangerous weapon, at least in the context of an operable firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Text, together with context, therefore supports a conclusion that the legislature meant \u201cpresently\u201d to mean immediately, as in without hesitation or delay, while \u201creadily\u201d could allow for a short passage of time. For an operable firearm, the fact that the firearm is loaded and accessible would seem to suffice to make it \u201cpresently capable\u201d of causing death or serious physical injury, barring an unusual factual circumstance that would frustrate its immediate use. On the other hand, if the firearm is unloaded and cannot be fired without taking \u201ca short time\u201d to load it, those circumstances better fit with the idea that the firearm is \u201creadily\u201d capable of causing death or serious physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Our analysis need not stop with text and context, however. We may also consider pertinent legislative history. Here, that legislative history confirms the meaning that the statutory text and context suggest.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\">The definitions of deadly weapon and dangerous weapon in ORS 161.015(1) and (2) were adopted as part of the 1971 Legislative Assembly\u2019s comprehensive revision of the Oregon Criminal Code. Or Laws 1971, ch 743, \u00a7 3. The official commentary to the revision explains that the preexisting law in Oregon treated the terms \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cdeadly\u201d interchangeably. Commentary to Criminal Law Revision Commission Proposed Oregon Criminal Code, Final Draft and Report \u00a7 3, 3 (July 1970). Also under preexisting law, an unloaded firearm did not qualify as a dangerous weapon. <em>Id. </em>Although a factfinder could infer that a firearm used to threaten a victim is loaded, if that inference were not available or the evidence otherwise established that the firearm was in fact unloaded, use of that unloaded firearm in committing a robbery was not armed robbery. <em>Id. </em>at 3-4 (discussing proposition and citing cases). That posed a problem for the crime of burglary as well as robbery. <em>Id. </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">The commission sought to solve that problem by defining \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d as one \u201creadily capable\u201d of causing death or serious injury, which would include an unloaded firearm, because it can be \u201creadily adapted to [the purpose of producing serious bodily injury] by loading it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. Simultaneously, the commission proposed that burglary and robbery be elevated to first-degree offenses not only when the offender is armed with \u201ca deadly weapon,\u201d but also when the offender \u201cuses or attempts to use\u201d a dangerous weapon (burglary) or \u201cuses or threatens to use\u201d a dangerous weapon (robbery). Commentary \u00a7 137 at 145 (elements of first-degree burglary) and \u00a7 150 at 154 (elements of first-degree robbery). The commission\u2019s proposed definition of \u201cdangerous weapon,\u201d together with the proposed changes to the elements of first-degree burglary and robbery, thus ensured that use or attempted/threatened use of an unloaded weapon to commit a burglary or robbery would be a first-degree offense and placed that conduct on par with mere possession of a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d during those crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>As for what qualified as a \u201cdeadly weapon,\u201d the commission wanted to \u201ccontinue the necessity of the firearm being loaded before it would be considered a \u2018deadly\u2019 weapon within the meaning of the \u2018armed robbery\u2019 statute.\u201d Commentary \u00a7 3 at 4. One way to accomplish that would have been to define \u201cdeadly weapon,\u201d as other states had done, as \u201cany loaded weapon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. But the commission was concerned that such a definition could \u201cdisturb\u201d existing case law, which permitted (and still permits) a factfinder to infer that a firearm was loaded from its threatened use within \u201ccarrying distance of the threatened victim.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 3-4 (citing cases permitting inference); <em>see also State v. Mustain, </em>66 Or App 367, 371, 675 P2d 494, <em>rev den, </em>297 Or 83 (1984) (factfinder may infer firearm was loaded if it was pointed at victim within firing range). The commission therefore opted for a \u201cmore general definition\u201d by defining \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d as one \u201cpresently capable\u201d of causing death or serious physical injury. The commission explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-4\">\u201cThe requirement of \u2018present capability\u2019 resolves the problem of an \u2018unloaded\u2019 gun. If a gun has a shell in firing position it is \u2018loaded\u2019 and presently capable of causing death or serious physical injury and, hence, a deadly weapon. Likewise, a gun that has a shell in the magazine or chamber would be within the purview of the definition of deadly weapon because, for all practical purposes, the weapon is \u2018loaded\u2019 and has the same present capability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Commentary \u00a7 3 at 4.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>That history both clarifies and confirms the meaning suggested by text and context. <em>See State v. Woodley, </em>306 Or 458, 462, 760 P2d 884 (1988) (unless contrary indication exists, court assumes that commission\u2019s explanations for its drafting choices reflect legislature\u2019s intent). The words \u201cpresently capable\u201d were intended to describe firearms loaded with a round in the firing position and those with \u201cthe same present capability\u201d of being fired. \u201cReadily capable,\u201d on the other hand, was intended to include unloaded operable firearms on the theory that such a firearm could be loaded in a short time. The definition of \u201cpresently\u201d on which petitioner relies comports with that legislatively intended meaning, while the definition on which the state relies better comports with what the legislature intended \u201creadily capable\u201d to mean in the definition of \u201cdangerous weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">B. <em>Counsel\u2019s Exercise of Reasonable Professional Skill and Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">With that understanding of the meaning of \u201cdeadly weapon,\u201d we turn to the first part of the test of the constitutional adequacy of petitioner\u2019s representation by trial counsel. Framed in the context of this case, the question is whether reasonably competent counsel, in defending petitioner on the burglary charge, would have challenged the state\u2019s evidence as insufficient to show that petitioner was armed with a deadly weapon during the commission of the burglary. As earlier described, petitioner argues that a reasonably competent defense lawyer would have moved for a judgment of acquittal on the charge of burglary in the first degree, and that the motion, if resolved correctly, would have resulted in his acquittal on that charge. Relatedly, also as earlier described, petitioner argues that reasonably competent defense counsel would have objected to the higher crime ranking that the post-conviction court used in sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>him on the burglary conviction, which was based on petitioner\u2019s possession of a deadly weapon in committing the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\">We agree that a lawyer exercising reasonable professional skill and judgment would have challenged the evidence as insufficient to show that petitioner possessed a deadly weapon during his commission of the burglary. At the time of petitioner\u2019s trial, it was an open question whether possession of an operable but unloaded firearm, together with the ammunition for that firearm, could be found to be \u201cpresently capable\u201d of causing death or serious physical injury, as the definition of deadly weapon in ORS 161.015(2) requires. Indeed, the question was not just an open one, but had been identified in several of our cases. In past cases, we had held that a firearm used in a robbery that was either shown to have been loaded or could be inferred to have been loaded qualifies as a \u201cdeadly weapon.\u201d <em>State v. Armstrong, </em>52 Or App 161, 171, 628 P2d 1206, <em>rev den, </em>291 Or 662 (1981). We also had held that an unloaded firearm does not qualify as a \u201cdeadly weapon,\u201d while suggesting that the answer might differ under circumstances not presented by that case, such as the presence of ammunition that would permit the firearm to be \u201creadily loaded.\u201d <em>Mustain, </em>66 Or App at 371. The latter observation was <em>dicta, </em>however. Until now, no reported case has presented any of those different circumstances. <em>See generally State v. Kuester, </em>275 Or App 414, 421, 364 P3d 685 (2015) (noting that \u201cno precedent\u201d supports view that unloaded gun qualifies as \u201cpresently\u201d or even \u201creadily\u201d capable of causing death or serious physical injury and \u201ccase-specific\u201d circumstances may be important in analysis). Also, until now, no reported decision had undertaken an examination of the meaning of \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d pursuant to the interpretative methodology of <em>Gaines/PGE. </em>Thus, at the time of petitioner\u2019s criminal trial, the issue that this case presents had been identified in the reported cases, but not resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">Given the state of the law and the evidence presented in petitioner\u2019s burglary trial, reasonably competent counsel would have recognized that petitioner\u2019s case presented that unresolved issue. <em>See Krummacher v. Gierloff, </em>290 Or 867, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>875, 627 P2d 458 (1981) (task of criminal defense lawyer is to \u201cprepare himself on the law to the extent appropriate to the nature and complexity of the case\u201d). Reasonably competent counsel would have also recognized the potential for the issue to be resolved favorably to petitioner, which would have had \u201cobvious potential benefits\u201d to petitioner on the burglary charge (as we discuss in the next section) without any \u201cnegative strategic impact on the defense\u201d on either the burglary or the other charges that petitioner faced. <em>See Lamb v. Coursey, </em>238 Or App 647, 652-53, 243 P3d 130 (2010), <em>rev den, </em>350 Or 230 (2011) (discussing when reasonable counsel could be expected to raise unsettled question of law). We therefore agree with petitioner that his defense counsel, by not challenging the sufficiency of the state\u2019s proof that he was armed with a \u201cdeadly weapon,\u201d failed to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment in defending petitioner on the first-degree burglary charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">C. <em>Prejudice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The next question in determining the constitutional adequacy of petitioner\u2019s trial counsel is whether petitioner was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to challenge the sufficiency of the state\u2019s evidence. We agree that petitioner was prejudiced. But, as we will explain, the nature of that prejudice is narrower than petitioner contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">First and foremost, we conclude that, had petitioner\u2019s trial counsel challenged the sufficiency of the state\u2019s \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d evidence, petitioner would have prevailed as a matter of law, either at the trial court level or eventually on appeal. The interpretation that we have given to \u201cpresently capable\u201d was not satisfied by the evidence in petitioner\u2019s criminal trial. Specifically, there was no evidence that the AR-15 was loaded, and no basis on which to infer that it was loaded. To the contrary, the only evidence on the point\u2014the victim\u2019s testimony\u2014was that the AR-15 was unloaded at the time of the burglary. A reasonable factfinder could not have found otherwise. Neither could a reasonable factfinder have found that, with the AR-15 contained in a closed carry bag, and the ammunition in a separate bag, the AR-15 could have been so immediately loaded as to have the \u201csame present capability\u201d as a firearm with a round in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>firing position. Given the state of that evidence, a challenge to the sufficiency of the state\u2019s proof, if correctly resolved, would have prevailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">But we are not satisfied that, as petitioner asserts, he would have been entitled to an acquittal on the burglary charge. As we earlier outlined, conduct that would otherwise be burglary in the second degree is elevated to a first-degree offense by any of several aggravating circumstances. One is burglary of a dwelling. ORS 164.225(1). Another is use of a deadly weapon during the burglary, regardless whether the building burglarized is a dwelling or a nondwelling. ORS 164.225(l)(a). Here, it was undisputed in petitioner\u2019s bench trial that, as the indictment alleged, the building from which the firearms were stolen was a dwelling. The evidence therefore established petitioner\u2019s guilt on the charge of first-degree burglary, with or without proof that he possessed a deadly weapon during the crime\u2019s commission.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>State v. O\u2019Quinn, </em>151 Or App 168, 947 P2d 1135 (1997) (where indictment charged defendant with first-degree burglary based on unlawful entry of a dwelling, and further alleged defendant was armed with deadly weapon, failure of proof on deadly weapon allegation required resentencing, not vacation of conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">A motion for judgment of acquittal would have served another purpose, however: It would have prevented enhancement of petitioner\u2019s burglary sentence on the basis that he was armed with a deadly weapon.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>described, in sentencing petitioner on the burglary conviction, the trial court ranked the burglary as a crime category 9, rather than a 7, based on petitioner\u2019s possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of the crime. That ranking, as earlier described, in turn resulted in a lengthier sentence (144 months incarceration followed by 36 months post-prison supervision) than petitioner otherwise could have received on the burglary conviction. Trial counsel\u2019s failure, through a motion for judgment of acquittal or otherwise, to challenge the \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d evidence therefore prejudiced petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">For those reasons, we conclude that petitioner was denied constitutionally adequate assistance of counsel, contrary to the guarantee of Article I, section 11. Petitioner is entitled to relief in the form of resentencing on his first-degree burglary conviction. <em>See </em>ORS 138.520 (relief in post-conviction proceeding may include modification of sentence).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b465-5\"> Defense counsel argued that the trial court should decline to \u201cmake a finding\u201d that petitioner \u201cwas armed during this burglary,\u201d but on a different ground. Specifically, counsel urged that petitioner had already broken into the residence with the intent to commit theft before he found and stole the firearms. According to defense counsel, the burglary was \u201ccomplete\u201d at that point; any later possession of the firearms and ammunition was insufficient to prove that petitioner (if the trial court found he was the person who committed the crime) was armed with a deadly weapon \u201cduring\u201d the burglary. The trial court rejected that argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b465-6\"> <em>Compare </em>OAR 213-018-0025(1) (first-degree burglary ranked at crime category 9 if offender was armed with a deadly weapon) <em>with </em>OAR 213-018-0025(2) (first-degree burglary ranked at crime category 8 if offense was committed in an occupied dwelling) <em>and </em>OAR 213-018-0025(3) (first-degree burglary ranked at crime category 7 if it cannot be ranked at either crime category 8 or 9).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b466-6\"> In our description of the post-conviction proceedings, we use \u201cthe state\u201d to refer to defendant, the superintendent of the correctional facility where petitioner is incarcerated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b467-8\"> Because we decide this case under Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution, we need not address petitioner\u2019s argument under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>Lichau v.

In the context of dictionary definitions, \u201carchaic\u201d conveys that an ascribed meaning is an older one and is no longer used except sporadically or \u201cin special contexts.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 17a; <em>see also American Heritage Dictionary </em>at xxiii (\u201carchaic\u201d designates terms that \u201chave largely fallen out of use since around 1950 or are associated with an earlier era\u201d). Dated meanings, however, are frequently settled and familiar ones, and the use of words with settled meanings can have virtue in the law, even if dictionaries deem those meanings \u201carchaic.\u201d Although other terms (such as \u201cnow\u201d) may be common in daily conversation or other fields to convey the more \u201carchaic\u201d meaning of \u201cpresently,\u201d the term \u201cpresently\u201d remains prevalent in law to convey immediately or in the present moment rather than soon or after a short while. <em>See, e.g., </em>ORS 743.049(1) (exempting from execution certain annuity benefits \u201cpresently due and payable\u201d); <em>see also </em>ORS 25.100(1) (certain judgments subject to modification by court in another county if party to judgment is \u201cpresently\u201d in that county); ORS 471.302(l)(a) (authorizing OLCC to grant temporary off-premises sales license if applicant is located in area \u201cpresently zoned\u201d for commercial use); ORS 813.430(1) (requiring increase in time for suspending driving privileges for any person \u201cpresently participating\u201d in DUII diversion program). We therefore do not consider petitioner\u2019s proffered \u201carchaic\u201d meaning implausible in this context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b473-6\"> The example in the quote of \u201ca gun that has a shell in the magazine or chamber\u201d was added to the commentary after a hearing on May 15,1970, in which the commission finalized the definitions. During that hearing, Frank Knight, a member of the commission, voiced concern that in the \u201cball and powder\u201d firearm days, a firearm was time consuming to load. But modernly, he observed, \u201ca gun could have a shell in the chamber that was not in firing position but which could be placed in firing position by the flick of a lever.\u201d Minutes, Criminal Law Revision Commission, May 15, 1970, 55. Knight noted that \u201cthe commentary as written stated that Oregon followed the rule that the gun had to be loaded in order to be a deadly weapon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Knight did not urge the commission to change its essential approach, which was to \u201cresolve!] the problem of an \u2018unloaded gun\u2019\u201d by defining deadly weapon in a way that would exclude an unloaded firearm. <em>See </em>Commentary \u00a7 3 at 4 (referring to \u201cthe problem of\u2018an unloaded gun\u2019\u201d).

As we earlier noted, defense counsel unsuccessfully took the position that the trial court should not \u201cmake a finding\u201d that petitioner was armed with a deadly weapon at the time of the burglary, because the burglary was \u201ccomplete\u201d by the time that petitioner found and took possession of the firearms and ammunition. <em>See </em>287 Or App at 445 n 1. As that argument recognized, any deficiency in the state\u2019s \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d evidence was important for its bearing on the sentencing enhancement finding that the court was being asked to make, not for its bearing on guilt of the first-degree burglary charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b477-7\"> The legislature has not specified a procedural way to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on factors that increase a sentence.

But this court and practitioners in the bar have proceeded on the assumption that a motion for judgment of acquittal is at least an adequate procedural way to test the adequacy of the evidence on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>sentencing enhancement factor. <em>See, e.g., State v.
