The trial court ruled that the items were discovered as the result of questioning that violated defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights, but it concluded that the evidence inevitably would have been discovered as part of a search incident to arrest. For the reasons that follow, we agree with defendant that the state failed to develop a sufficient record to support the trial court\u2019s ruling on inevitable discovery, and we therefore reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">We review a trial court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s motion to suppress for errors of law, and we are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of fact, provided that they are supported by constitutionally sufficient evidence. <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 74-75, 854 P2d 421 (1993). In this case, the relevant chronology of events is mostly undisputed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In December 2013, Douglas County Sheriffs Deputy Dorland responded to a 9-1-1 call about a possible heroin overdose. When Dorland arrived, defendant, who was the subject of the call, was standing and talking with an ambulance crew. Defendant appeared to Dorland to be intoxicated from alcohol; he displayed red, watery eyes and slurred speech, and he was swaying while talking to Dorland.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Defendant told Dorland that he was not having a medical issue but had just had too much to drink. Thereafter, Dorland contacted police dispatch and asked them to run defendant\u2019s name for \u201cwants and warrants.\u201d Dorland learned from dispatch that defendant was \u201con probation with a no alcohol clause\u201d and that defendant\u2019s probation officer wanted him to be detained. At that point, Dorland intended to arrest defendant based on the probation violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Dorland asked defendant whether he had \u201canything illegal\u201d on him, and defendant responded that he did not. Dorland followed up by asking whether he could search him to make sure, and defendant refused to consent. Defendant\u2019s family members, who were gathered at the scene, began urging defendant to allow a search.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">Eventually, defendant admitted that he possessed drug paraphernalia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dorland took defendant into custody and asked him where the illegal paraphernalia was located, and whether there were any needles that would poke him. Defendant then disclosed that there was a \u201ccapped needle in his front left sweatshirt pocket,\u201d and that \u201che had a cooker in his pants pocket and some cleaning swabs.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Dorland searched defendant and located those items in the places that defendant had identified: There was a capped but used syringe in the left pocket of his sweatshirt, the bottom of a Pepsi can with a dark residue in his right pants pocket, and a plastic baggie filled with unused cotton swabs. The Pepsi can and a small piece of plastic in the baggie later tested positive for heroin, and the syringe was apparently destroyed but not tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">After locating those items, Dorland asked defendant how long it had been since he used heroin, and defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>admitted that he had used within the hour. Dorland then read defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights and placed him in the back of his patrol car. Dorland subsequently asked defendant how much alcohol he had consumed. Defendant stated that he had not had much but again admitted to recently using heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Defendant was subsequently charged with one count of unlawful possession of heroin, and he filed a motion to suppress \u201c[a] 11 the physical evidence and statements obtained after [his] arrest.\u201d Defendant argued that Dorland did not have reasonable suspicion to detain him to investigate his alcohol use; he also argued that he had been interrogated by Dorland before being <em>Mirandized, </em>and that \u201cstatements made in response to this interrogation * * *, as well as any physical evidence which was found as a result of those statements, should be suppressed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The state, in response, argued that Dorland had reasonable suspicion to stop defendant from the time that he arrived on the scene of the possible overdose, and that, regardless of any <em>Miranda </em>violation, the physical evidence would have been discovered as part of a lawful search incident to arrest on the probation violation. The state argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">\u201cOn a probation violation, not a drug charge, at this point in time. He\u2019s going to be searched now incident to arrest. That is going to happen. The fact that the officer asked him permission to [search] does not make it so that he is no longer allowed to search him. The, also the fact that the, he asks him is there anything illegal on you doesn\u2019t make it an improper search. If the officer had said nothing, the officer indicated that he would have been searched incident to arrest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">The state\u2019s argument relied on the following testimony from Dorland, in which he was asked about the sequence of the search in relation to his questioning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-8\">\u201cQ. [PROSECUTOR] Okay. And then you take him in, then you ask again, whether you can search him, or do you simply ask about paraphernalia?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-9\">\u201cA. [DORLAND] Well at, at the point, when he\u2019s in custody, he\u2019s going to get searched before he gets into our car because we\u2019re not gonna\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>\u00ab\u215c\u2021\u215c\u2021\u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-4\">\u201cQ. What\u2019s the reason for that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-5\">\u201cA. <em>Just officer safety. We\u2019ve gotta make sure they don\u2019t have any, any drugs, weapons, anything like that on them before they enter our patrol car and go to the jail.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">\u201cQ. Okay. And is it, and is it typical to ask before you pat them down whether they have anything sharp?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-7\">\u201cA. Yep.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-8\">\u201cQ. Okay. And did you do that in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-9\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-10\">\u201cQ. And what was his response?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-11\">\u201cA. <em>He said that he had a capped needle in his pocket and he told me he had a cooker in his pants pocket also.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-12\">\u201cQ. Okay. And did you seize those items?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-13\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-14\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-15\">Based on that testimony (as clarified by Dorland\u2019s later acknowledgement on cross-examination that he had not simply asked about needles, but had also asked \u201cwhere the illegal paraphernalia was at\u201d), the state argued \u201cthere\u2019s nothing unlawful about this search. It was part [of] a valid search incident to arrest. The small amount of conversation prior to <em>Miranda </em>was an officer safety conversation in the sense that he\u2019s asking is anything gonna poke me. And yes, he did say additional words, but the answer was essentially that yes, there\u2019s some stuff on me including a needle, which is exactly why the officers ask.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-16\">In the course of the arguments, the trial court signaled that it agreed with defendant that his <em>Miranda </em>rights had been violated by Dorland\u2019s questioning, which was \u201ctoo intrusive,\u201d but that \u201c[t]he drugs, however, the physical items were going to be found inevitably as part of the discovery in taking him into custody as a search incident to arrest. The physical items are admissible. The questioning and the answers are inadmissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Defendant then asked for an opportunity to further develop his argument regarding inevitable discovery and explained that the arrest was for a probation violation, not drug crimes, so a search incident to arrest would not extend to a search for drugs or drug paraphernalia. <em>See State v. Mazzola, </em>356 Or 804, 811-12, 345 P3d 424, 430 (2015) (explaining that a warrantless search incident to arrest \u201ccan be made for any of three purposes: (1) to protect a police officer\u2019s safety; (2) to prevent the destruction of evidence; or (3) to discover evidence of the crime of arrest\u201d). He further argued that \u201cit\u2019s not clear that inevitably they are going to find evidence of drug use, especially when we\u2019re talking about a baggie. We\u2019re not talking about only a sharp, we\u2019re talking about other items that were found.\u201d He noted that Dorland\u2019s testimony about his typical practice actually described an <em>illegal patdown\u2014i.e., </em>a search not only for weapons but drugs in general, regardless of the reason for the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">At that point, the court clarified its \u201cinevitable discovery\u201d ruling, but it did not directly address defendant\u2019s argument that Dorland had described an illegal search protocol as his typical practice. The court explained that Dorland would have found the syringe as part of a search incident to arrest based on officer safety concerns and that the syringe, in turn, would have given the officer probable cause to expand the search to look for drugs and drug paraphernalia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-5\">\u201cWell, the needle was, the testimony was that the needle was going to be found. It, the officer has reason to, for his own safety, to be concerned about that. Once the needle is found he has reason to go ahead and search, in addition to that, for other items related to that drug and drug paraphernalia. And there\u2019s no indication that it would not have been found. He has reason to protect himself from those sharp objects that could be used as a weapon against him and for his own safety, he has reason to search for them. I am denying the Motion to Suppress as to the physical objects and granting the Motion to Suppress as to the statements and <em>Miranda </em>should have been given and it wasn\u2019t <em>given.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Following the denial of his motion to suppress the physical evidence, defendant was tried on stipulated facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>and convicted on one count of possession of heroin, and he was sentenced to 18 months\u2019 probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">On appeal, defendant advances a single assignment of error, challenging the court\u2019s conclusion that the physical evidence\u2014the syringe, cooker, and baggie and its contents\u2014 inevitably would have been discovered regardless of the preceding <em>Miranda </em>violation. Specifically, defendant argues that the record fails to establish that Dorland would have conducted a <em>lawful </em>patdown that would have revealed the syringe, let alone the cooker or baggie found in defendant\u2019s pockets, had defendant not disclosed the existence and location of those items in response to unlawful interrogation. We agree with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">When an officer fails to give the requisite <em>Miranda </em>warnings, a court must suppress not only the statements that a suspect makes in direct response to unwarned questioning but also evidence that derives from that constitutional violation. <em>State v. Vondehn, </em>348 Or 462, 476, 236 P3d 691 (2010). In this case, the trial court ruled that the physical evidence was the product of a preceding <em>Miranda </em>violation, and the state does not challenge that aspect of the court\u2019s ruling. Thus, the only issue before us is the trial court\u2019s application of the inevitable discovery doctrine, a doctrine that \u201cpermits the prosecution to purge the taint of illegally obtained evidence by proving * * * that such evidence inevitably would have been discovered, absent the illegality, by proper and predictable investigatory procedures.\u201d <em>State v. Miller, </em>300 Or 203, 226, 709 P2d 225 (1985), <em>cert den, </em>475 US 1141 (1986) (emphasis in original); <em>State v. Musser, </em>356 Or 148, 155, 335 P3d 814 (2014) (\u201c[E]vidence should not be excluded on exploitation grounds if it inevitably would have been discovered or if the police discovered the evidence though a source independent of the illegality.\u201d). Or, as the state frames it, the question is \u201cwhether Deputy Dorland would have discovered defendant\u2019s capped syringe and \u2018cooker\u2019 had defendant not admitted to their possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">To satisfy its burden under the inevitable discovery doctrine, the state was required to show by a preponderance of evidence \u201c(1) that certain proper and predictable investigatory procedures would have been utilized in the instant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>case, and (2) that those procedures inevitably would have resulted in the discovery of the evidence in question.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>300 Or at 226. In other words, it is not enough that the state <em>might </em>have discovered the evidence lawfully; rather, the state must prove that it <em>would </em>have. <em>See id. </em>(explaining that it is not sufficient for the state to simply show that evidence \u201cmight or could have been otherwise obtained\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>State v. Taylor, </em>250 Or App 90, 95, 279 P3d 254 (2012) (holding that the state had \u201cfailed to show that those procedures [to discover the evidence at the jail] would have been 'proper and predictable,\u2019 because the Umatilla County Jail inventory policy authorizing those procedures is unconstitutional\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">In this case, the state argues that the \u201cproper and predictable\u201d procedure of a search incident to arrest would have led to the discovery of the syringe and cooker. According to the state, \u201c[a] pat-down or limited search for weapons to protect the officer is <em>always </em>justified\u201d as part of a search incident to arrest. (Citing <em>State v. Owens, </em>302 Or 196, 200, 729 P2d 524 (1986) (emphasis in state\u2019s brief).) And, the state contends, the \u201crecord clearly establishes\u201d that \u201cDorland planned to pat defendant down for weapons prior to placing him in the back of the patrol car and knew that defendant possessed drug paraphernalia.\u201d The state then asserts that, because the capped syringe and the bottom of the Pepsi can are \u201citems of distinct shape and size and readily identifiable as drug paraphernalia,\u201d and because it is common knowledge that both are sharp and can be used as weapons, the \u201crecord sufficiently supports the trial court\u2019s ruling that Dorland would have discovered and seized both items of paraphernalia even without asking defendant where they were.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The state\u2019s position in this case requires impermissible speculation. Even assuming Dorland would have conducted a lawful patdown for weapons as a search incident to defendant\u2019s arrest on the probation violation, there is no evidence in the record that Dorland, in that hypothetical patdown, would have believed that the object in defendant\u2019s sweatshirt was a capped needle, or that the \u201ccooker\u201d in his pants was a weapon of some kind, such that he could have reached into defendant\u2019s pockets. <em>Cf. State v. Sopiwnik, </em>176 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Or App 127, 133, 30 P3d 430 (2001) (\u201c[T]he fact that [the officer] reaches into the pockets of everyone he arrests did not necessarily make his decision to search the interior of <em>this defendant\u2019s </em>pockets unreasonable. The decisive questions are whether, irrespective of his normal practice, [the officer] believed that defendant posed a threat to officer safety and whether such a belief was reasonable.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)). As defendant points out, Dorland reached into defendant\u2019s pockets only after defendant told him that those items were there. Dorland did not provide <em>any </em>testimony about how a patdown of <em>this arrestee </em>would have proceeded without those admissions, such as describing the size and shape of the capped syringe or cooker, the thickness of the defendant\u2019s clothing, or what the discovered items might have felt like through the defendant\u2019s clothing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Accord State v. Musalf, </em>280 Or App 142, 158-59, 380 P3d 1087 (2016) (holding that, where the officer \u201cdid not describe the object\u2019s dimensions or shape, nor did he explain what other particular circumstances supported a suspicion that the object was a weapon,\u201d the \u201chardness of the object alone\u201d did not justify removing it from the defendant\u2019s pocket on officer safety grounds).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">Thus, the trial court could only speculate as to whether Dorland <em>would have </em>seized a capped syringe or cooker based on a reasonable belief that those items were weapons. This record supports, at most, a conclusion that Dorland <em>might </em>have lawfully discovered the physical evidence during a patdown of defendant. The inevitable discovery doctrine requires more than that.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-7\"> To the extent that the parties offer slightly different versions of the trial court\u2019s factual findings regarding this chronology, or there is a lack of clarity in the record, we note those issues later in this opinion. <em>See </em>287 Or App at 77 n 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b97-7\"> It is not clear from the record whether defendant stated that he possessed drug paraphernalia as a direct response to a question from Dorland or in response to his family\u2019s subsequent urging. Rather than set out the conflicting testimony in detail, we note that there is considerable confusion in this record as to when precisely defendant was taken into custody and whether defendant first disclosed that he possessed drug paraphernalia before or after that happened, and there is some question as to how the court resolved those competing factual issues. Defendant argues that, because the trial court ultimately suppressed all of defendant\u2019s statements, including his admission that he possessed drug paraphernalia, on the ground that his <em>Miranda </em>rights were violated, we must presume that defendant made those incriminating statements <em>after </em>he was in custody and <em>in response to </em>Dorland\u2019s questions. The state points out that it is unclear what statements were actually suppressed; and, moreover, we note that there is some suggestion in this record that the court was operating (at defense counsel\u2019s urging) under an erroneous impression that a defendant is in custody for purposes of <em>Miranda </em>at the moment that the officer has the <em>subjective </em>intent to arrest\u2014an impression that would affect what statements were suppressed and what facts the court implicitly found when suppressing those statements. However, the parties appear to agree that defendant revealed that the \u201cdrug paraphernalia\u201d in his possession included a capped needle and \u201ccooker\u201d only <em>after </em>he had been unlawfully interrogated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b97-8\"> Dorland explained that a \u201ccooker\u201d refers to a can used for cooking heroin.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b103-6\"> The syringe, as noted previously, was apparently destroyed, and the witnesses did not describe it at the suppression hearing. The state asserts that a capped syringe and cooker are of \u201cdistinct shape and size and readily identifiable as drug paraphernalia,\u201d but we will not make that kind of assumption on matters that are the state\u2019s burden to prove.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">We also note that the state does not defend the trial court\u2019s reasoning that the discovery of the syringe would have given Dorland probable cause to expand the search for evidence of drug crimes, such as the cooker. Rather, the state argues that the cooker itself would have been inevitably discovered as part of a patdown for weapons. Thus, under the state\u2019s argument, even if we were to assume that Dorland would have identified a capped syringe as a possible weapon, we would be required to take an even greater leap to presume that the \u201ccooker,\u201d which contained drug residue, would have been identifiable as a possible officer safety concern during a patdown.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
