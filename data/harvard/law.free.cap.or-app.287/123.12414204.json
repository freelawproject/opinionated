J.</author>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Petitioner unsuccessfully sought post-conviction relief from his convictions for rape and other crimes. He raises three assignments of error on appeal. In his first two assignments, petitioner asserts that the post-conviction court erred when it precluded petitioner from testifying about the content of certain documents and photographs that were not, themselves, admitted as exhibits. We reject those two assignments of error without further discussion. In his third assignment of error, petitioner argues that the post-conviction court\u2019s judgment does not comply with the clear-statement rule of ORS 138.640(1), as construed in <em>Datt v. Hill, </em>347 Or 672, 227 P3d 714 (2010). We agree that the judgment does not satisfy the requirements of ORS 138.640(1) and <em>Datt </em>with respect to petitioner\u2019s second and third claims for post-conviction relief. Accordingly, we reverse and remand as to those claims for entry of a judgment that meets those requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Following a jury trial, petitioner was convicted of first-degree rape, first-degree sodomy, fourth-degree assault, strangulation, and menacing. After his convictions were affirmed on direct appeal, petitioner sought post-conviction relief. Petitioner\u2019s first amended petition for post-conviction relief included three claims. In his first claim for relief, petitioner alleged that he had been deprived of constitutionally adequate assistance of trial counsel. Petitioner identified 20 alleged failings of his lawyer, ranging from failure \u201cto conduct an adequate investigation which would have yielded exculpatory witnesses and evidence [,] \u201d to failure to impeach various state witnesses, through failure to adequately cross-examine the victim. In his second and third claims for relief, petitioner alleged prosecutorial misconduct, asserting (among other things) that prosecutors committed <em>Brady </em>violations by withholding exculpatory evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Following a bench trial, the post-conviction court announced that it would enter judgment in favor of the defendant superintendent. The court explained that petitioner had not proved that his trial lawyer committed any \u201cerror\u201d and that, even if petitioner had shown any such error, petitioner had not proved that \u201csubstantial prejudice\u201d had resulted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>The court subsequently entered a judgment that denied the first amended petition for post-conviction relief and included findings and conclusions that expressly addressed, and rejected, most of petitioner\u2019s claims about ways in which he believed his lawyer had performed inadequately. The judgment also included these more general statements about the court\u2019s reasons for denying post-conviction relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-4\">\u201cPetitioner has not proven that any error was committed by trial counsel. Nor has he proven that any alleged error had occurred that there is a reasonable probability that the result would have been different.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-5\">\u00ab\u2021 \u215c\u2021\u2021\u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">\u201cAll other claims made by Petitioner are either unintelligible, or are so without merit as to be unworthy of further comment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\">\u00ab\u2021\u2021\u215c\u2021\u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-8\">\u201cThe court also relies on any statements made at the end of the trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">In addition, the judgment stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-10\">\u201cWith regard to any issues not specifically addressed above, the Court relies upon and adopts the facts and law in * * * Defendant\u2019s Trial Memorandum as the Court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. Petitioner has * * * failed to meet his burden of proof. Except as specifically provided herein, this judgment determines all issues presented.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">As noted, petitioner asserts on appeal that the post-conviction judgment does not comply with the requirements of ORS 138.640(l).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As explained in <em>Datt, </em>that statute imposes a clear-statement rule, requiring judgments denying relief in post-conviction cases to do at least three things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-12\">\u201c(1) identify the claims for relief that the court considered and make separate rulings on each claim; (2) declare, with regard to each claim, whether the denial is based on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>petitioner\u2019s failure to utilize or follow available state procedures or a failure to establish the merits of the claim; and (3) make the legal bases for denial of relief apparent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><em>Datt, </em>347 Or at 685. A post-conviction judgment can meet the first requirement by referring to the petition and stating that \u201c\u2018all questions were presented and decided.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 685-86 (quoting judgment of the post-conviction trial court).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Here, petitioner contends that the judgment fails to comply with each of the three <em>Datt </em>requirements. First, petitioner contends that the judgment does not \u201cmake separate rulings on each claim\u201d because it does not identify \u201cthe basis for the court\u2019s ruling on each of the 20 separate reasons why petitioner\u2019s trial attorney was inadequate and ineffective.\u201d Petitioner observes that the court appeared to dispose of multiple specifications of inadequate assistance by rejecting only <em>some </em>of them for particular reasons, then stating that \u201c[a] 11 other claims made by Petitioner are either unintelligible, or are so without merit as to be unworthy of further comment.\u201d Second, petitioner contends that the judgment improperly fails to \u201cdeclare, with regard to each claim,\u201d whether the claim was rejected on procedural grounds or because it lacked merit. According to petitioner, a post-conviction court\u2019s rejection of a claim as \u201cunintelligible\u201d may reflect \u201ca procedural flaw.\u201d Third, petitioner argues that the judgment does not \u201cmake the legal bases for denial of relief apparent\u201d with respect to his claims of prosecutorial misconduct. \u201c[BJecause the court did not explain its rationale,\u201d petitioner contends, \u201ca reviewing court cannot determine from the judgment what petitioner failed to prove\u201d with respect to those claims of prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Petitioner\u2019s first argument fails in light of our decision in <em>Soderstrom v. Premo, </em>274 Or App 624, 360 P3d 1272 (2015), <em>rev den, </em>358 Or 550 (2016). There, as here, the petitioner\u2019s first claim for post-conviction relief was based on several specifications of inadequate performance by trial counsel. The judgment \u201cexplicitly addressed several of petitioner\u2019s specifications of trial counsel inadequacy and ineffectiveness\u201d and then rejected the remainder as \u201c\u2018without merit\u2019\u201d and \u201c\u2018not worthy of further comment.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 627. And there, as in this case, the judgment stated that, except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>as otherwise provided, the judgment \u201cdetermines all issues presented.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held that those statements \u201cclearly communicate [d] that the post-conviction court considered \u2018all\u2019 claims,\u201d satisfying the first requirement of <em>Datt. </em>The same is true here.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Petitioner\u2019s second argument fares little better. Petitioner focuses on the post-conviction court\u2019s statement that some of petitioner\u2019s specifications of trial counsel inadequacy were \u201ceither unintelligible, or * * * so without merit as to be unworthy of further comment.\u201d Petitioner argues that the post-conviction court may have meant, by using the word \u201cunintelligible,\u201d that he had not fairly presented those claims of inadequate representation, thus presenting \u201ca procedural flaw that could prevent petitioner from successfully raising the issue in federal habeas review.\u201d We disagree. Throughout the litigation of this case, neither defendant nor the court has suggested that any of petitioner\u2019s claims were barred for a procedural reason. Rather, we agree with defendant that a more reasonable reading of the post-conviction court\u2019s judgment results in viewing the word \u201cunintelligible,\u201d in context, as emphasizing the post-conviction court\u2019s determination that some of petitioner\u2019s specifications of inadequate performance utterly lacked merit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Petitioner is correct, however, that the post-conviction court\u2019s judgment does not comply with the third <em>Datt </em>requirement because it fails to make apparent the legal bases for denying relief on petitioner\u2019s second and third claims of relief. Those claims raise allegations of prosecuto-rial misconduct, including <em>Brady </em>violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">We perceive nothing in the judgment that expressly addresses the post-conviction court\u2019s reasons for denying relief on petitioner\u2019s prosecutorial misconduct claims. Defendant argues to the contrary, asserting that those claims are resolved by the court\u2019s \u201cfinding that petitioner failed to adduce any exculpatory evidence.\u201d We disagree. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Read in context, that finding relates directly to the first specification of petitioner\u2019s inadequate-assistance claim, which was based on an allegation that his lawyer failed \u201cto conduct an adequate investigation which would have yielded exculpatory witnesses and evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">The judgment\u2019s failure to address the court\u2019s reasons for denying relief on the prosecutorial misconduct claims is not remedied by the judgment\u2019s statement that, with regard to issues not expressly addressed in the judgment, \u201cthe Court relies upon and adopts the facts and law in * * * Defendant\u2019s Trial Memorandum as the Court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law.\u201d As we explained in <em>Soderstrom, </em>\u201c[arguments by lawyers are not rulings by courts,\u201d and that kind of reference\u2014which does not identify precisely <em>which </em>of defendant\u2019s arguments the post-conviction court has accepted\u2014does not satisfy <em>\u201cDatfs </em>directive that, with respect to each claim, the judgment explain what elements the post-conviction court found were not met.\u201d 274 Or App at 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Nor can the judgment be saved by its reference to relying on \u201cany statements made at the end of the trial.\u201d True, a post-conviction judgment may satisfy <em>Datt </em>through \u201coral findings that the post-conviction court makes on the record and incorporates into the judgment by reference.\u201d <em>Asbill v. Angelozzi, </em>275 Or App 408, 413, 365 P3d 587 (2015), <em>rev den, </em>358 Or 794 (2016). But that can suffice only when the trial court actually has made express findings on the record that, themselves, meet the <em>Datt </em>requirements. Defendant has not identified any statements that the post-conviction court made on the record that explain the legal bases for the court\u2019s rejection of petitioner\u2019s second and third claims for relief, and we are not aware of any. Accordingly, the judgment does not meet the third <em>Datt </em>requirement with respect to petitioner\u2019s second and third claims for relief, and remand is necessary so the court may enter a judgment that fully complies with <em>Datt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Reversed and remanded as to the second and third claims for relief, for entry of judgment including the findings required by ORS 138.640(1); otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-13\"> ORS 138.640(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-14\">\u201cAfter deciding the issues raised in the [post-conviction] proceeding, the court shall enter a judgment denying the petition or granting the appropriate relief. The judgment may include orders as provided in ORS 138.520. The judgment must clearly state the grounds on which the cause was determined, and whether a state or federal question was presented and decided.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b147-7\"> We observe that the claims in petitioner\u2019s first amended petition for post-conviction relief are not literally unintelligible.
