On appeal, defendant asserts that the state failed to present legally sufficient evidence that he \u201cinterfered\u201d or attempted to \u201cinterfere\u201d with the person protected by the FAPA order. We agree with defendant and, therefore, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">When a defendant challenges the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting a finding of contempt, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state to determine whether a rational trier of fact could find the elements of contempt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Trivitt, </em>247 Or App 199, 203, 268 P3d 765 (2011). The relevant facts, which we state in accordance with that standard, are few and undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Defendant\u2019s then-current wife obtained a FAPA order against defendant pursuant to ORS 107.718. Under that statute, a petitioner may obtain a restraining order against a respondent if the petitioner shows that \u201cthe petitioner has been the victim of abuse committed by the respondent within 180 days preceding the filing of the petition, that there is an imminent danger of further abuse to the petitioner and that the respondent represents a credible threat to the physical safety of the petitioner.\u201d ORS 107.718(1). For the purposes of FAPA, \u201cabuse\u201d is defined by ORS 107.705(1), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-7\">\u201c\u2018Abuse\u2019 means the occurrence of one or more of the following acts between family or household members:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-8\">\u201c(a) Attempting to cause or intentionally, knowingly or recklessly causing bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-9\">\u201c(b) Intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly placing another in fear of imminent bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-10\">\u201c(c) Causing another to engage in involuntary sexual relations by force or threat of force.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">A FAPA order may restrain the respondent \u201cfrom intimidating, molesting, interfering with or menacing the petitioner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>or attempting to intimidate, molest, interfere with or menace the petitioner!.]\u201d ORS 107.718(l)(e). \u201cThe purpose of a FAPA restraining order is to protect a victim of domestic abuse from further abuse.\u201d <em>Trivitt, </em>247 Or App at 206; <em>see also State ex rel Halthaway v. Hart, </em>300 Or 231, 236, 708 P2d 1137 (1985) (\u201c[T]he essence of [FAPA] is to prevent acts of family violence through restraining orders\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-3\">The FAPA order at issue in this case restrained defendant from \u201cintimidating, molesting, interfering with or menacing Petitioner, or attempting to intimidate, molest, interfere with or menace Petitioner directly or through third parties.\u201d (Boldface omitted.) While the FAPA order was in effect, defendant sent an email to petitioner\u2019s employer. In the email, defendant asserted that petitioner had committed theft and fraud, and he expressed concern that she might use her position to steal personal information from other employees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">Based on the email, the state charged defendant with contempt under ORS 33.015(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the subsequent court trial, the sole issue was whether defendant \u201cinterfered\u201d with petitioner, in violation of the FAPA order, by sending the email to her employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The state argued that the email constituted \u201cinterference\u201d for the purposes of FAPA. The state contended that, if defendant had a genuine concern about petitioner\u2019s future conduct, he should have reported that to the police, and that by going \u201cstraight to her employer\u201d he interfered with her \u201cability to stay gainfully employed,\u201d and that \u201cpart of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>why the protection orders exist\u201d is to protect against such interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">Defendant did not dispute that he had sent the email, but he argued that his conduct was analogous to that at issue in <em>Trivitt, </em>which we held did not constitute \u201cinterference\u201d for the purposes of FAPA. 247 Or App at 206. In <em>Trivitt, </em>the trial court found the defendant in contempt for violating a FAPA order, which prohibited her from interfering with the petitioner, her former boyfriend. The trial court\u2019s finding was based on the defendant\u2019s posting of a sign in the front yard of the petitioner\u2019s current girlfriend stating that the petitioner had genital herpes. The defendant appealed and we reversed. For reasons discussed in greater detail below, 287 Or App at 682-84, we concluded that, although the defendant\u2019s conduct was offensive, it was not the type of direct interference with a person that FAPA prohibits. 247 Or App at 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">In response, the state argued that <em>Trivitt </em>was not controlling because it did not rule out the possibility of \u201cnonphysical interference.\u201d The state also argued that <em>Trivitt </em>was distinguishable because, unlike defendant\u2019s email, the conduct at issue in <em>Trivitt </em>did not involve the petitioner\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">After the parties\u2019 arguments, the trial court concluded that defendant\u2019s email constituted \u201cinterference\u201d for the purposes of FAPA and found defendant in contempt of court. The trial court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-7\">\u201cThe question before this Court is whether or not [the email] is an interference and is in direct conflict with the restraining order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-8\">\u201cI do find that [defendant\u2019s] actions were for the * * * following reasons: the definition of interfere is to interpose in a manner that would reasonably be expected to hinder or impede a person in the petitioner\u2019s situation. This is clearly a situation where this was a non-physical interference.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">On appeal, the parties renew the arguments they made in the trial court. Consequently, our task, as framed by the parties\u2019 arguments, is to interpret the term \u201cinterference\u201d for the purposes of FAPA by applying the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>interpretation method established in <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 859 P2d 1143 (1993), and <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). We undertook that specific task in <em>Trivitt, </em>analyzing the text, context, and relevant legislative history of the term \u201cinterference\u201d as used in FAPA. Because it is on point, we recount the <em>Trivitt </em>analysis here.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">As mentioned, in <em>Trivitt, </em>the defendant was found in contempt for violating a FAPA order by posting a sign in the front yard of the petitioner\u2019s current girlfriend stating that the petitioner had genital herpes. On appeal, the issue was whether the defendant\u2019s actions constituted \u201cinterference\u201d for the purposes of FAPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">To resolve the issue, we turned first to the legislative history of the term. We noted that in <em>State ex rel Emery v. Andisha, </em>105 Or App 473, 805 P2d 718 (1991), which was decided before the statutory definition of interfere was enacted in ORS 107.705, we defined \u201cinterfere\u201d as \u201c\u2018to interpose in a way that hinders or impedes\u2019 or <em>\u2018to take part in the concern of others\u2019.\u201d Trivitt, </em>247 Or App at 204 (quoting <em>Andisha, </em>105 Or App at 476) (emphasis in <em>Trivitt). </em>We found it significant that, in 1995, when the legislature did enact a statutory definition for \u201cinterfere,\u201d Or Laws 1995, ch 637, \u00a7 2, it defined the term as \u201cto interpose in a way that hinders or impedes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 204-05. \u201cThat is,\u201d we explained, \u201cthe legislature did <em>not </em>include in its definition of\u2018interfere\u2019 the notion of \u2018tak[ing] part in the concern of others.\u2019 Rather, it limited its definition to the \u2018hinder or impede\u2019 portions of the definition that we had set forth in <em>Andisha\u201d Id. </em>at 205 (emphasis and brackets in original). We further explained that, because \u201cwe presume that the legislature is aware of our case law interpreting statutes,\u201d the legislative history of the definition demonstrated that \u201cthe legislature intended a narrower definition than we had given the term in <em>Andisha\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Then, to determine whether the narrower statutory definition\u2014\u201cto interpose in a way that hinders or impedes\u201d\u2014 encompassed conduct like the defendant\u2019s, we reviewed the dictionary definitions of \u201cinterpose,\u201d \u201chinder,\u201d and \u201cimpede.\u201d <em>See PGE, </em>317 Or at 611 (when a term is not statutorily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>defined, we presume that the legislature intended the term to have its plain, natural, and ordinary meaning). We noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-3\">\u201cCommon definitions of \u2018interpose\u2019 are \u2018to place between or in an intermediate position\u2019 or \u2018to put (oneself) between.\u2019 <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1182 (unabridged ed 2002). \u2018Hinder\u2019 is defined as \u2018to do harm to: impair, damage\u2019 or \u2018to make slow or difficult the course or progress of.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 1070. And finally, \u2018impede\u2019 is commonly defined as \u2018to interfere with or get in the way of the progress of: hold up: block.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 1132.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-5\"><em>Trivitt, </em>247 Or App at 205. We stated \u201cwe cannot say that it is wholly implausible that the statutory definition could not also suggest nonphysical interference!,]\u201d but reasoned that the plain meanings of \u201cinterpose,\u201d \u201chinder,\u201d and \u201cimpede\u201d suggest \u201ca direct interference with the person protected under a FAPA order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We explained that the defendant\u2019s conduct, placing a sign that communicated personal information about the petitioner on a third party\u2019s lawn, was \u201cmore akin to the legislatively rejected understanding of \u2018interfere\u2019 as \u2018takfing] part in the concern of others.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(brackets in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">We also explained that construing \u201cinterfere\u201d to include</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-8\">\u201csimply revealing personal information about another person to a third party would potentially run afoul of the avoidance cannon, which holds that, when one plausible construction of a statute is constitutional and another plausible construction of a statute is unconstitutional, courts will assume that the legislature intended the constitutional meaning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 206 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">Finally, we noted that our interpretation of \u201cinterfere\u201d was consistent with the purpose of FAPA, which was \u201cto protect a victim of domestic abuse from further abuse!,]\u201d rather than to protect people from conduct, like the defendant\u2019s, \u201cwhich did not constitute more than offensive behavior.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">Our analysis in <em>Trivitt </em>produces the same result here. Under <em>Trivitt, </em>\u201cinterfere\u201d does not include \u201ctak[ing] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>part in the concern of others,\u201d even if it constitutes \u201coffensive behavior.\u201d Here, defendant did not have any direct physical or verbal contact with petitioner. As in <em>Trivitt, </em>defendant communicated negative personal information about petitioner to a third party in an attempt to affect petitioner\u2019s relationship with that third party. And, as in <em>Trivitt, </em>that conduct is more akin to \u201ctak[ing] part in the concern of others\u201d than \u201cdirect interference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\">The state argues that defendant\u2019s conduct is distinguishable from the conduct at issue in <em>Trivitt. </em>Specifically, the state asserts that defendant\u2019s email constituted <em>\u201cdirect </em>interference with [petitioner\u2019s] employment situation\u201d because defendant \u201c\u2018interposed\u2019 himself between [petitioner] and her employer[,]\u201d and because the email \u201cwould reasonably be expected \u2018to do harm to\u2019 [petitioner] by inducing the city to take action against her.\u201d (Citing <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 1182) (\u201cinterpose\u201d means \u201cto place between or in an intermediate position\u201d or \u201cto put (oneself) between\u201d); quoting <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 1070 (\u201chinder\u201d can mean \u201cto do harm to: impair, damage\u201d); (emphasis in state\u2019s brief). The state\u2019s argument is unavailing for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">First, the state fails to explain <em>how </em>defendant\u2019s conduct was qualitatively different from the conduct at issue in <em>Trivitt. </em>In <em>Trivitt, </em>the defendant\u2019s conduct was no less \u201cdirect\u201d than defendant\u2019s conduct here. By placing a sign on the petitioner\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s lawn, the defendant in <em>Trivitt </em>also \u201cinterposed\u201d herself \u201cbetween\u201d the petitioner and a third party, his girlfriend. Similarly, the message on the sign in <em>Trivitt </em>could also \u201creasonably be expected \u2018to do harm to\u2019\u201d the petitioner, specifically, to his romantic relationship and reputation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Second, without a narrower understanding of the term \u201charm,\u201d the state\u2019s proposed interpretation would \u201cpotentially run afoul of the avoidance canon\u201d in the same way as in <em>Trivitt. </em>Under the state\u2019s proposed interpretation, a person could \u201cinterfere\u201d with a petitioner in violation of a FAPA order if, acting in good faith, he or she told the police information about a petitioner that would lead the police to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>believe the petitioner committed a crime. Similarly, a person could \u201cinterfere\u201d with a petitioner if he or she told the petitioner\u2019s employer that the petitioner, a food-service worker, had a communicable disease, resulting in the petitioner being suspended or fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">Accordingly, we hold that there was insufficient evidence to show that defendant interfered or attempted to interfere with petitioner within the meaning of the FAPA order. As a result, the trial court erred in finding defendant in contempt of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-6\"> The full text of the email is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-7\">\u201cDear [Employer],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">\u201cI would like to inform you of a [sic] employee that works [in one of your departments].
