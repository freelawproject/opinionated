He assigns error to, among other things, the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal on the disorderly conduct charge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Defendant\u2019s convictions are associated with events that occurred at a protest outside of a private residence, in which defendant participated in chanting as part of a group of 30-40 protesters, and briefly yelled on his own. He was charged with disorderly conduct under ORS 166.025(l)(b). As an element of that offense, the state was required to prove that defendant made \u201cunreasonable noise.\u201d Defendant argued in a motion for judgment of acquittal that the state had presented insufficient evidence that he personally had made \u201cunreasonable noise.\u201d <em>See State v. Rich, </em>218 Or App 642, 647, 180 P3d 744 (2008) (interpreting the term \u201cunreasonable noise\u201d in ORS 166.025(l)(b), \u201cinsofar as it might refer to noise caused by speech, to refer only to its noncom-municative elements,\u201d such as its \u201cvolume, duration, etc.\u201d). The state concedes that the evidence was insufficient to prove that defendant made \u201cunreasonable noise\u201d within the meaning of ORS 166.025(l)(b). We agree, accept the state\u2019s concession, and reverse the conviction for disorderly conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Conviction for disorderly conduct reversed; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b618-7\"> We reject without written discussion defendant\u2019s second and third assignments of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
