J.</author>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">This case involves a dispute between a general contractor (plaintiff) and a subcontractor (defendant) on a construction project for Lane Community College (LCC). Plaintiff filed an action claiming that defendant breached the contract between the parties (the subcontract) by not performing or completing certain specified work in accordance with the subcontract\u2019s requirements. In response, defendant counterclaimed that plaintiff breached the subcontract by failing to pay defendant the amounts due and owing under it and by acting in bad faith. After a bench trial, the trial court found in defendant\u2019s favor on both the claim and counterclaim for breach of contract and entered a judgment awarding defendant $51,786 in damages on its counterclaim. On appeal, plaintiff purports to raise four assignments of error; however, as explained below, plaintiff does not identify a ruling of the trial court that it seeks to have reversed, nor does plaintiffs briefing demonstrate that the legal theories underlying those assignments were ever cohesively presented to the trial court for decision, as required by the Oregon Rules of Appellate Procedure. Because of those deficits, we do not consider plaintiffs arguments. See <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 384, 823 P2d 956 (1991) (a plaintiffs failure to either preserve or properly raise an argument on appeal \u201cnormally will preclude its consideration on appeal\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">For background purposes, we briefly describe the facts leading up to this appeal. LCC selected plaintiff to be the general contractor for a construction project that involved a major renovation of two buildings and the construction of an outdoor space (the Building 10/11/Breezeway Renovation). The contract between LCC and plaintiff was a standard AIA<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> form contract that provided, among other things, that LCC\u2019s architect had the authority to \u201creject Work that does not conform to the Contract Documents,\u201d and to \u201cinterpret and decide matters concerning performance under, and requirements of, the Contract Documents.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Plaintiff, in turn, contracted with defendant, a \u201cpaintings and coatings specialty subcontractor,\u201d to do the painting and coating work on the LCC project. That subcontract included a requirement that \u201c[defendant] assume[] toward [plaintiff] all obligations and responsibilities that [plaintiff] assumes toward [LCC] under the Contract Documents, to the extent those obligations and responsibilities apply to the Work.\u201d It also provided that plaintiff was not obligated to make final payment to defendant until (1) the work was \u201cfully performed\u201d according to the subcontract and accepted by plaintiff and LCC; (2) defendant was not in \u201cdefault\u201d under the subcontract, and (3) plaintiff has received full payment from LCC with respect to the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-3\">Defendant began its work in May of 2011, and it progressed smoothly for several months. At some point during late summer and early fall, however, the architect circulated several \u201cpunch lists,\u201d identifying work that needed to be corrected or completed before the architect would certify that the project was complete and LCC would make final payment to plaintiff. Defendant performed work on the punch-list items, but plaintiff and defendant disagreed about whether all of it was completed, in a satisfactory manner, and whether some items were within the scope of the subcontract. In addition, around that time, it was also discovered that defendant had not yet applied the intumescent coating that the subcontract required.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant began that application in December, during the school\u2019s holiday break, but plaintiff and the architect became concerned that the coating was being applied outside of the manufacturer\u2019s recommended range of temperature, and defendant did not complete it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiff eventually completed the work using its own employees and a substitute painting subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Plaintiff subsequently brought this action against defendant, alleging that defendant had breached the subcontract \u201cby failing to perform all of [the] work in accordance with the requirements of the subcontract\u201d in several particulars, including, as narrowed on appeal, by refusing to remove overspray from certain surfaces, failing to paint certain ducts and conduits, failing to properly prepare and seal masonry surfaces, and failing to properly prepare and apply intumescent coatings .and \u201crefusing to complete\u201d that work. As a result, plaintiff alleged, it was entitled to damages of $57,365.74 for the cost of repairing and completing defendant\u2019s work, less \u201capplication of all appropriate credits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">In response, defendant counterclaimed for breach of contract against plaintiff, alleging that plaintiff breached the parties\u2019 subcontract by failing to pay progress payments owed to defendant when they were due, failing to pay the total amount due under the subcontract and change orders, and acting in bad faith.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendant sought $51,655 in damages for that counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The parties waived jury and tried their case to the court, telling the court that it was \u201ca punch list case.\u201d After five days of trial, which included a visit to the work site, the court ruled in defendant\u2019s favor on both the claim and counterclaim. Announcing its decision from the bench, the court first concluded that plaintiff had failed to prove that defendant breached the subcontract in any of the particulars alleged by plaintiff. The court stated that it was relying on its assessment of the credibility of the parties\u2019 respective witnesses; the court explained that it found plaintiffs witnesses to be generally not credible and, on the other hand, that it believed defendant\u2019s witnesses\u2019 testimony regarding the work that defendant had done. Thus, the court apparently considered the dispute to depend on resolution of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>factual matter\u2014specifically, did defendant fail to complete the work of the subcontract in the manner alleged by plaintiffs complaint? The court\u2019s answer to that question apparently turned, at least in part, on a finding that the evidence that defendant put on about its performance under the contract was more credible than the evidence that plaintiff put on about defendant\u2019s lack of performance. The court also concluded that plaintiff had not proved damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-3\">Next, the court concluded that defendant had proved its counterclaim for breach of the subcontract by plaintiff, finding that \u201cplaintiff did in fact fail to pay payments that were due and owing to the defendant for work covered by the contract itself.\u201d It declined, however, to find that defendant was entitled to payment for \u201cextra work\u201d\u2014that is work outside the scope of the contract\u2014that defendant had also claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The court subsequently entered judgment in defendant\u2019s favor on plaintiffs claim for breach of contract and on defendant\u2019s counterclaim for breach of contract, and it awarded defendant damages of $51,786 on its counterclaim. Plaintiff appeals that judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Before turning to plaintiffs specific arguments, we review the prerequisites for obtaining appellate review of an asserted trial-court error. We do so because, as explained below, those prerequisites have not been met in this case. Moreover\u2014and most importantly\u2014the deficiencies (in preserving claims of error and in identifying purportedly erroneous rulings on appeal) are such that no issue is properly before us for resolution on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">For a party appealing a trial court\u2019s judgment, the first challenge\u2014and requirement\u2014is to \u201cidentify\u201d in each assignment of error \u201cprecisely the legal, procedural, factual, or other ruling that is being challenged.\u201d ORAP 5.45(3). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>addition to identifying a specific ruling that is challenged, each assignment of error must \u201cspecify the stage in the proceedings when the question or issue presented by the assignment of error was raised in the lower court, the method or manner of raising it, and the way in which it was resolved or passed on by the lower court,\u201d ORAP 5.45(4)(a)(i), and set out pertinent quotations of the record where the issue was raised and the ruling was made, ORAP 5.45 (4)(a) (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">That requirement\u2014that the appellant precisely identify the ruling that is being challenged\u2014is not a mere matter of form, or simply a hoop to be jumped through on the way to briefing the merits of an appeal. In our system of justice, the purpose of an appeal is not to give the appellant an opportunity to pursue a new theory that it did not rely on below. Rather, \u201cthe function of appellate review\u201d is \u201cto correct errors of the trial court.\u201d <em>Falk v. Amsberry, </em>290 Or 839, 843, 626 P2d 362 (1981). The appellant must identify a specific ruling before we are able to determine whether that ruling was erroneous and requires correction. <em>See Faverty v. McDonald\u2019s Restaurants, </em>133 Or App 514, 527-28, 892 P2d 703 (1995), <em>rev dismissed, </em>326 Or 530 (1998) (\u201cOur function is to determine whether the trial court made an error of law about issues actually raised below and properly assigned as error on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Thus, the appellant\u2019s proper assignment of error enables this court to determine, among other things, the precise nature of the trial court\u2019s ruling and the basis for it, the standard of review that we apply when reviewing that kind of ruling, and (as discussed below) whether the arguments that form the basis for the appellant\u2019s challenge to that ruling were adequately preserved. <em>See Migis v. AutoZone, Inc., </em>282 Or App 774, 805, 387 P3d 381 (2016), <em>adh\u2019d to in part on recons, </em>286 Or App 357, 396 P3d 309 (2017) (\u201cCompliance with ORAP 5.45 is not a matter of mere form; it is crucial to our ability to review trial court rulings for error and to determine whether the appellant\u2019s claims of error were preserved below.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)); <em>Hayes Oyster Co. v. Dulcich, </em>170 Or App 219, 224, 12 P3d 507 (2000) (\u201c[T]he information the rules require enables the court and the opposing party to identify the specific ruling the appellant assigns as error, determine whether an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>objection was properly preserved, and understand the basis for the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d). Moreover, proper assignment of error (or the appellant\u2019s inability to meet that requirement) may reveal that the appellant failed to secure a ruling on an issue presented for decision on appeal, indicating that the trial court never had the opportunity to consider it. <em>See Falk, </em>290 Or at 843 (\u201c[N]o error has occurred where no ruling has been made by the court or requested by the litigant[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\">Once the appellant has identified the specific ruling that it challenges, and has explained the basis for the challenge on appeal, the appellant then must demonstrate that the claim of error was adequately preserved in the trial court. The general rule of preservation is familiar: \u201c [B] efore an appellate court may address whether a trial court committed an error in any of the particulars of the trial of a case, the adversely affected party must have preserved the alleged error in the trial court and raised the issue on appeal by an assignment of error in its opening brief.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Ailes, </em>312 Or at 380; <em>see </em>ORAP 5.45(1) (\u201cNo matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claim of error was preserved in the lower court and is assigned as error in the opening brief in accordance with this rule[.]\u201d). To demonstrate preservation, the appellant must show that the argument it makes on appeal is one that was presented to the trial court, giving that court \u201cthe chance to consider and rule on a contention, thereby possibly avoiding an error altogether or correcting one already made, which in turn may obviate the need for an appeal.\u201d <em>Peeples v. Lampert, </em>345 Or 209, 219, 191 P3d 637 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Thus, the requirement that an appellant have preserved the claim of error that it presents on appeal is a fundamental principle of appellate jurisprudence, serving the important policy goals of fairness to the parties and the efficient administration of justice. As the Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>explained in <em>Peeples, </em>in addition to ensuring that the lower court had an opportunity to avoid the claimed error, the preservation requirement also ensures that the opposing party had a fair opportunity in the trial court \u201cto respond to a contention\u201d; the requirement is meant to prevent \u201ctaking the opposing party by surprise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And, importantly, the preservation requirement \u201cfosters full development of the record, which aids the trial court in making a decision and the appellate court in reviewing it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 219-20. Thus, the reason for the rule is \u201cnot merely to promote form over substance but to promote an efficient administration of justice and the saving of judicial time.\u201d <em>Shields v. Campbell, </em>277 Or 71, 77-78, 559 P2d 1275 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-3\">Lack of compliance with ORAP 5.45 may render a claim of error unreviewable on appeal. ORAP 5.45(4)(a) (providing that we may decline to review an assignment of error that requires us \u201cto search the record to find the error or to determine if the error properly was raised and preserved\u201d); <em>see Migis, </em>282 Or App at 804-06 (declining to review assignment of error because appellant\u2019s failure to comply with ORAP 5.45 impaired our review of the assignment); <em>Strawn v. Farmers Ins. Co., </em>228 Or App 454, 475, 209 P3d 357 (2009), <em>aff'd in part and rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>350 Or 336, 258 P3d 1199, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>350 Or 521, 256 P3d 100 (2011), <em>cert den, </em>565 US 1177 (2012) (declining to reach claims of error because noncompliance with ORAP 5.45 left the court unable to determine what rulings were being challenged and whether the bases for the challenges were preserved below); <em>Benjamin v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>185 Or App 444, 464, 61 P3d 257 (2002), <em>rev den, </em>335 Or 479 (2003) (\u201cIf a party does not identify a specific legal, procedural, factual, or other ruling by the trial court, ORAP 5.45(3), there is nothing for this court to review.\u201d); <em>cf. Drake v. Alonso, </em>285 Or App 620, 625, 625 n 3, 396 P3d 961 (2017) (exercising discretion to review appellant\u2019s assignment of error that failed to comply with ORAP 5.45(4)(a) where purposes of preservation requirement were otherwise satisfied and our ability to review the argument was not impaired).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">In this case, plaintiff articulates its assignments of error as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>(1) \u201cThe trial court erred in considering a challenge to the Architect\u2019s decisions when Defendant failed to plead an appropriate defense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-3\">(2) \u201cThe trial court erred in considering a challenge to the Architect\u2019s decisions when Defendant failed to join LCC as a party.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-4\">(3) \u201cThe trial court erred in rejecting the Architect\u2019s decisions and instructions using a \u2018reasonableness,\u2019 rather than subjective good faith, standard.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">(4) \u201cThe trial court erred in placing the burden of proving the propriety of the Architect\u2019s Decisions on [plaintiff].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">None of those assignments identifies a \u201clegal, procedural, factual, or other ruling that is being challenged,\u201d as required by ORAP 5.45(3). Plaintiff does not, for example, identify a dismissal, summary judgment, or other motion that presented the underlying legal issues to the trial court for decision; relatedly, plaintiff does not identify any rulings on such motions that would give plaintiff something to challenge on appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Rather, it seems that plaintiff is attempting to challenge the court\u2019s final judgment, based on rulings that plaintiff <em>assumes </em>the court made. Plaintiff summarizes its appellate arguments this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">\u201cBecause the trial court applied an incorrect legal standard, its rulings must be reversed. Because Defendant did not plead a defense challenging the Architect\u2019s actions and no evidence supports a finding that the Architect acted in subjective bad faith, and Defendant admitted that it refused to perform work required by its Subcontract, this court should remand for entry of judgment in [plaintiffs] favor [.] \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Similarly, under a heading entitled \u201cCorrect Result\u201d (boldface omitted), plaintiff states, \u201cThe undisputed evidence here required a finding that the Architect acted in subjective good faith, enforcement of the relevant terms of Defendant\u2019s Subcontract, and an award to [plaintiff].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">Thus, as we understand it, the general theory underlying plaintiffs appeal is that, because, according to plaintiff, the subcontract required defendant to complete the work to the architect\u2019s satisfaction, and the undisputed evidence demonstrated defendant\u2019s failure to perform all of the work that the architect required, plaintiff was entitled as a matter of law to prevail on both claims\u2014that is, plaintiff was entitled to recover its costs for completing the work (plaintiffs claim for breach of contract) and plaintiff was excused from paying defendant unpaid amounts under the contract (defendant\u2019s counterclaim for breach of contract). In other words, plaintiff contends generally that the trial court was required\u2014as a legal matter\u2014to decide in its favor on both claims, and its assignments of error attempt to challenge legal rulings that plaintiff assumes that the court <em>implicitly </em>made in coming to a contrary decision on those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">In particular, plaintiffs theory necessarily assumes that the court decided that the architect did not accept certain of defendant\u2019s work under the subcontract; that defendant challenged the architect\u2019s decisions; that defendant did not need to raise that challenge as an affirmative defense; that an objective \u201creasonableness\u201d standard\u2014rather than a subjective, \u201cgood faith\u201d standard\u2014applied to the architect\u2019s decisions; that the architect\u2019s decisions were not objectively reasonable\u2014and plaintiff did not prove otherwise; and, consequently, that the provisions of the subcontract that conditioned payment to defendant on the architect\u2019s approval of the work were \u201cineffective.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">On appeal, plaintiff challenges most of those assumed aspects of the trial court\u2019s decision. The problem for plaintiff is that it has not shown that it clearly presented those legal issues to the trial court for decision, and our review of the record suggests that plaintiff did not do so. Unsurprisingly, then\u2014and as we explain in more detail below\u2014plaintiff has not demonstrated to our satisfaction that the court ever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>ruled on the legal questions plaintiff now contends entitle it to judgment in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\">With respect to its first and second assignments of error, plaintiff contends that it preserved its arguments in its \u201ctrial brief and motions for a directed verdict\u201d (directed-verdict motion), pointing specifically to a footnote in that 41-page document. The gist of plaintiffs first assignment is that the unreasonableness or bad faith of the architect\u2019s decisions is an affirmative defense to plaintiffs breach of contract claim that defendant was required to plead and prove, and that the trial court erred in implicitly deciding otherwise. In its second, related, assignment of error, plaintiff argues that defendant was required to join LCC as an additional counterclaim defendant. The footnote on which plaintiff relies for preservation provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-4\">\u201cDefendant did not plead any defense based on the Architect\u2019s lack of good faith in the Architects\u2019 decisions to reject Defendant\u2019s work and require correction, except perhaps indirectly through Defendant\u2019s \u2018impossibility\u2019 defense[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] * * *. <em>If Defendant wanted to challenge the Architects\u2019 rejections of its work, it needed to file a Claim and, if it did not like the Architect\u2019s decision, appeal through the dispute resolution process set out in the General Conditions. In other words, Defendant had to join LCC in this action and litigate the appropriateness of those decisions. </em>It is way too late to do that now and, without LCC as a party, Defendant cannot collaterally attack those decisions under the guise of asserting a \u2018defense\u2019 against [plaintiff].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Initially, we note that the footnote appears to be contradictory. The first emphasized sentence says that defendant was required to file a \u201cClaim\u201d and follow an extrajudicial process (the \u201cdispute resolution process\u201d described in the contract between LCC and plaintiff) if it disagreed with any of the architect\u2019s decisions. Then, in the next sentence, it refers to joining LCC and litigating those questions <em>\u201cin this </em>action.\u201d (Emphasis added.) But, in any event, that footnoted discussion was insufficient to alert the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>to plaintiffs appellate contention, which is fundamentally different\u2014essentially that, under the terms of the subcontract, plaintiff was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on both claims because defendant was required to, and did not, plead and prove the unreasonableness of the architect\u2019s decisions as an affirmative defense to plaintiffs breach of contract claim or join LCC as a party to defendant\u2019s own counterclaim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And plaintiff never attempted to clarify that position at the hearing on its directed-verdict motion. Accordingly, we decline to address plaintiffs first and second assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">Similarly, plaintiff contends that it preserved its third and fourth assignments of error \u201cin its complaint, reply, trial brief, opening statement, and closing argument.\u201d We have examined the excerpts of those pleadings, documents, and transcript pages that plaintiff contends support preservation and nowhere is it clear that the trial court was presented with\u2014-and ruled on\u2014the legal arguments that plaintiff raises in those assignments. Plaintiff argues, in its third assignment, that the court erred in \u201capparently finding\u201d that the architect\u2019s demands were unreasonable\u2014thus excusing defendant\u2019s failure to \u201ccomplete the intumescent coating work, apply the second coat of masonry sealant required by the specifications, and fix the items remaining on the punch-lists\u201d\u2014because the court should have applied the law of \u201csatisfaction contracts,\u201d which, according to plaintiff, requires that a \u201csubjective, good faith\u201d standard, rather than an \u201cobjective reasonableness\u201d standard, apply to the architect\u2019s decisions. And, plaintiff contends in its fourth assignment, the trial court implicitly required plaintiff to prove the propriety of the architect\u2019s decisions when, in plaintiffs view, that burden belonged to defendant. However, plaintiff never argued those legal points to the trial court; indeed, plaintiff never raised the law of \u201csatisfaction contracts\u201d or addressed with the trial court the appropriate burden of proof.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Nor is it clear to us from the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>ruling that the trial court decided the case on the basis that the architect\u2019s demands were unreasonable and plaintiff failed to prove otherwise, as plaintiff would have us assume.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\">Rather, the parties indicated to the court that the case was a \u201cpunch-list\u201d case and much of the evidence presented by the parties focused on the quality and quantity of defendant\u2019s work and plaintiffs purported damages. From its discussion on the record, the trial court appears to have ruled, based on its assessment of the credibility of the parties\u2019 respective witnesses, that plaintiff had not proved its allegations of breach (or of damages) <em>as a factual matter, </em>and defendant had, not because the court determined that the architect acted unreasonably and plaintiff failed to prove otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Plaintiff did not request summary judgment based on the legal issues it now raises or otherwise focus the court\u2019s attention on those issues. <em>See Peeples, </em>345 Or at 219 (\u201c\u2018A party owes the trial court the obligation of a sound, clear and articulate motion, objection or exception, so as to permit the trial judge a chance to consider the legal contention or to correct an error already made.\u2019\u201d (Quoting <em>Shields, </em>277 Or at 77.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">We acknowledge that glimpses of plaintiffs legal theory can be found in its closing argument. For example, in discussing \u201cstandard of performance,\u201d plaintiff argued that the contract required defendant to \u201c [d] o whatever is necessary to get final acceptance of your work by the architect.\u201d And, after discussing the evidence in some detail\u2014and in the midst of arguing that defendant had breached the subcontract by failing to apply the intumescent coating according to the manufacturer\u2019s specifications\u2014plaintiff argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">\u201cNow, that\u2019s on the merits, but I really want to convey to you that the merits are a bit irrelevant here in the sense is that it\u2019s the architect. We have to\u2014we have to satisfy the architect. All the subcontractors have to satisfy the architect. So we have no choice but to do what the architect says when the architect gives an order like shutting this down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>\u201cAnd this lawsuit is not the right forum to second guess the merits of the architect\u2019s decision, because the contract process\u2014the contract says: Do what the architect says. If you\u2019re entitled to more money, file a claim. Give the notice. See if you get more money. If you don\u2019t, follow the dispute resolution procedure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">That statement, however, was immediately followed by plaintiffs contention that defendant not applying the coating \u201caccording to specs\u201d was \u201ca breach and entitles us to relief\u2019\u2014an evidence-based argument entirely distinct from plaintiffs legal arguments on appeal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, the types of arguments plaintiff raises on appeal did not provide the trial court with enough clarity to permit the court to consider and correct any error, if warranted.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Cf., State v. Geyer, </em>287 Or App 25, 33-34, 401 P3d 1259 (2017) (issue not preserved for appeal where the defendant\u2019s presentation of the issue for the first time in closing argument did not fairly apprise the trial court that the defendant sought a ruling on the question and deprived the state of a fair opportunity to address it). As we said in <em>State v. Blasingame, </em>267 Or App 686, 691, 341 P3d 182 (2014), <em>rev den, </em>357 Or 299 (2015), \u201c[although there is some degree of liberality to the preservation requirement, the requirement is not meant to be \u2018a cursory search for some common thread, however remote, between an issue on appeal and a position that was advanced at trial.\u2019\u201d (Quoting <em>State v. Stevens, </em>328 Or 116, 122, 970 P2d 215 (1998).) The policies of fairness and efficiency underlying the preservation requirement\u2014that is, to ensure that \u201ca party provides sufficient information to enable opposing parties to meet an objection and the trial court to avoid error,\u201d <em>State v. Walker, </em>350 Or 540, 550, 258 P3d 1228 (2011)\u2014were not satisfied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>In sum, because plaintiffs appellate arguments were neither preserved in the trial court nor properly raised on appeal in accordance with ORAP 5.45, we do not consider them. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b487-6\"> AIA refers to \u201cAmerican Institute of Architects.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b487-7\"> The architect\u2019s interpretations and decisions were required to be \u201cconsistent with the intent of, and reasonably inferable from, the Contract documents,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>and the architect\u2019s decisions \u201con matters relating to aesthetic effect\u201d were to be final \u201cif consistent with the intent expressed in\u201d those documents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b488-6\"> The subcontract specifications required defendant to apply intumescent coating\u2014a fire retardant\u2014on exterior exposed steel columns and beams, sufficient to provide two hours of fire protection. The trial court found that both parties had apparently forgotten about that aspect of the project until November.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b488-7\"> The parties dispute the circumstances of defendant\u2019s failure to complete the intumescent coating: plaintiff contends that defendant \u201cabandoned the [project\u201d; defendant asserts that plaintiff \u201cshut the project down\u201d and \u201cordered\u201d defendant off the job site.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b489-6\"> Defendant also asserted several affirmative defenses and pleaded additional counterclaims for unjust enrichment, <em>quantum, meruit, </em>\u201cOpen Account\u2014 Extra Work,\u201d \u201cOpen Account\u2014Entire Project,\u201d and attorney fees. With the exception of defendant\u2019s counterclaim for attorney fees, and its \u201coffset\u201d defense to plaintiff\u2019s breach of contract claim, the court rejected those additional counterclaims and defenses on plaintiff\u2019s motions for directed verdict, made at the close of defendant\u2019s case-in-chief. The court denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for directed verdict on defendant\u2019s counterclaim for breach of contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b490-7\"> In its opening brief, plaintiff indicated that it also intended to appeal from a supplemental judgment awarding defendant attorney fees, but, at the time that plaintiff filed its brief, that judgment had not been entered. According to the trial court register, the court issued an order awarding defendant attorney fees of $40,198 and instructing defense counsel to prepare a supplemental judgment to that effect; however, the register does not reflect that any such judgment was ever submitted or entered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b492-5\"> As an exception to that general rule, the appellate court also has discretion to review an error that is \u201cplain.\u201d ORAP 5.45(1). To be \u201cplain,\u201d the error must (1) be an error of law; (2) be apparent, meaning the legal point is not reasonably in dispute; and (3) appear on the record, meaning the court need not go outside the record or choose between competing inferences to identify it. <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355,800 P2d 259 (1990). Plaintiff makes no argument that that exception to the preservation requirement is applicable in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b494-9\"> As explained below, the directed-verdict motion that plaintiff combined with its trial memorandum did not adequately call the trial court\u2019s attention to the issues that plaintiff raises on appeal, nor did it seek a ruling from the trial court on those points.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">We have previously observed that a directed-verdict motion may not be apt in a court trial, <em>see Dillard and Dillard, 179 </em>Or App 24, 28 n 2, 39 P3d 230, <em>rev den, </em>334 Or 491 (2002) (\u201c[T]here can be no directed verdict in a case tided to the court.\u201d). However, there was no objection to plaintiff\u2019s motion in the trial court, and we have no need to consider on appeal whether it was a proper motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b496-7\"> The trial court ultimately struck defendant\u2019s \u201cimpossibility\u201d defense, on the ground that it was not a legal defense, but, rather, went to the question of breach.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b497-5\"> Plaintiff cited no law to support its theory that unreasonableness/bad faith was required to be raised as an affirmative defense in a breach of contract action or for the proposition that defendant was required to join LCC as a party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b497-6\"> To the extent that plaintiffs third and fourth assignments of error implicate the trial court\u2019s ruling in favor of defendant on defendant\u2019s counterclaim for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>breach of contract, we further note that the trial court denied plaintiffs motion for directed verdict on that claim, and plaintiff does not assign error to that ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b499-6\"> To the extent plaintiff is challenging the evidentiary basis for the trial court\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff did not prove its allegation of breach related to application of the intumescent coating, we also reject that challenge. The trial court apparently found that plaintiff prevented defendant from completing that work, and there is evidence in the record to support that finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b499-7\"> Nor did plaintiff raise any objection or otherwise dispute the court\u2019s fact-based reasoning when it announced its ruling from the bench. <em>Cf.
