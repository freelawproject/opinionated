Shockey, </em>285 Or App 718, 398 P3d 444 (2017), in which we held that the statutory civil penalty for the unlawful taking of a raptor authorized by ORS 496.705 did not establish that the victim of defendant\u2019s crime, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW), had suffered economic damages so as to permit the award of restitution that the trial court ordered defendant to pay. We remanded for resentencing based on our determination that no other evidence supported the award of restitution to ODFW. Defendant points out that we concluded that there is no evidence to support a finding that ODFW suffered any economic damages as a result of defendant\u2019s conduct and argues that that determination forecloses the trial court from imposing either restitution or a compensatory fine on remand. Thus, in defendant\u2019s view, the proper disposition is to reverse the restitution award and remand for entry of an amended judgment omitting restitution. The state has not opposed the petition. Under those circumstances, we agree with defendants, allow reconsideration, and modify our opinion to provide for the following disposition: \u201cAward of restitution reversed; remanded for entry of amended judgment omitting restitution award; otherwise affirmed.\u201d To the extent our opinion refers to a remand for resentencing in other places, we disavow those references.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Reconsideration allowed; former disposition withdrawn; former opinion modified and adhered to as modified; award of restitution reversed; remanded for entry of amended judgment omitting restitution award; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
