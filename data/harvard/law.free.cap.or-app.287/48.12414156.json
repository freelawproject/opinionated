Defendant counterclaimed for financial elder abuse, ORS 124.100, ORS 124.110,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs\u2019 litigation against her was unfounded. Plaintiffs moved to dismiss and for a directed verdict on the elder abuse counterclaim but the trial court allowed the counterclaim to go to the jury, which found for defendant. The trial court then found for plaintiffs on their contract claim and awarded declaratory relief. On appeal, plaintiffs assign error to the trial court\u2019s failure to dismiss the elder abuse counterclaim, and, alternatively, to the trial court\u2019s failure to grant their motion for a directed verdict. Plaintiffs argue that defendant\u2019s counterclaim fails as a matter of law because, even assuming that unfounded litigation can serve as a predicate for an elder abuse claim, defendant failed to demonstrate any \u201ctakfing] \u201d of defendant\u2019s money or property as required by ORS 124.110(l)(a). We agree with plaintiffs. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment as to defendant\u2019s counterclaim and otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Defendant cross-appeals the judgment in favor of plaintiffs on the breach-of-contract and declaratory relief claims. We reject defendant\u2019s arguments without written discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The facts pertinent to our resolution are not in dispute. At the relevant time, plaintiffs lived on property adjacent to a parcel owned by defendant and her son. Part of defendant\u2019s property was accessed via an easement over plaintiffs\u2019 property. Defendant was in her mid-seventies.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Plaintiffs hired defendant\u2019s son, a licensed contractor, to perform work on their home. Dissatisfied with the results of the work, they brought a construction-defect action against the son. That litigation led to negotiations that culminated in a settlement agreement whereby (1) the son would pay plaintiffs $6,000 and (2) both he and defendant would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>release their interests in the easement over plaintiffs\u2019 property. After a conversation with her son, defendant signed the settlement agreement. However, although the son later formally released his interest in the easement, defendant refused to, claiming that she had only signed the agreement to approve it \u201cas to form,\u201d never intending to agree to release her interest in the easement. Plaintiffs brought this action against her, alleging claims for breach of contract, declaratory relief, and, significant to this appeal, fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">Defendant counterclaimed for financial elder abuse under ORS 124.100. That statute provides, as relevant here, that a \u201cvulnerable person,\u201d defined as someone who is 65 years of age or older, \u201cwho suffers injury, damage or death by reason of physical abuse or financial abuse may bring an action against any person who has caused the physical or financial abuse.\u201d The definition of \u201cfinancial abuse\u201d is set out in ORS 124.110(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-5\">\u201cAn action may be brought under ORS 124.100 for financial abuse in the following circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">\u201c(a) <em>When a person wrongfully takes or appropriates money or property of a vulnerable person, </em>without regard to whether the person taking or appropriating the money or property has a fiduciary relationship with the vulnerable person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Defendant\u2019s elder abuse counterclaim alleged the following wrongful conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-9\">\u201cPlaintiffs wrongfully coerced defendant into signing the settlement agreement approving it as to form and thereafter began to seek to enforce it against the defendant and threatened to cut off defendant\u2019s only reasonable access to her property. Plaintiffs thereafter submitted documents to defendant insisting defendant sign a release of defendant\u2019s easement to her property and plaintiffs further filed the instant litigation to coerce defendant into releasing the access to her property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">Defendant also alleged that, as a result of the abuse, she incurred noneconomic damages in the amount of $10,000 for \u201cemotional and mental distress, aggravation and annoyance,\u201d as well as attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Plaintiffs moved, unsuccessfully, under ORCP 21 A(8) for dismissal of the elder abuse counterclaim. Later, they moved for a directed verdict, arguing that defendant had failed to establish either wrongful conduct or that anything had been \u201ctaken\u201d from her. The trial court granted plaintiffs\u2019 directed verdict motion in part, reasoning that, to the extent that defendant\u2019s counterclaim was based on \u201ccoercion\u201d regarding the signing of the settlement agreement, any such coercion was applied by defendant\u2019s son, not by plaintiffs. But the court ruled that defendant\u2019s counterclaim could proceed on the theory that plaintiffs\u2019 <em>fraud </em>claim\u2014which, by that time, had been dismissed on defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment\u2014constituted \u201cunfounded litigation,\u201d which could satisfy the \u201cwrongful\u201d element of a financial elder abuse claim. The court further reasoned that defendant had demonstrated that plaintiffs\u2019 fraud claim resulted in a \u201ctaking\u201d of defendant\u2019s money or property, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-4\">\u201c[T]he taking can occur when [defendant] is put on guard to defend against an allegedly unfounded litigation, and that taking is a taking of her own time, trouble, psyche, the expense that it needs to be taken to defend against that, the annoyance and inconvenience. It\u2019s taken. And that\u2019s something that\u2019s taken from her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The jury found in favor of defendant on her elder abuse counterclaim and awarded defendant $10,000 in non-economic damages, which was trebled to $30,000 by statute. ORS 124.100(2)(b). The court then found in favor of <em>plaintiffs </em>on their breach of contract claim, and also granted plaintiffs\u2019 request for declaratory relief to enforce the terms of the settlement agreement. The trial court reconciled the two seemingly inconsistent decisions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">\u201cI recognize that [the court\u2019s ruling on plaintiffs\u2019 contract and declaratory relief claims] may be said to be quite at odds with the jury\u2019s decision [on defendant\u2019s elder abuse counterclaim]. I reconcile the two by making [the] following observations: It is a common tactic for litigants, when involved in litigation, to make claims * * * to the maximum extent that they can to place the other side at risk. It\u2019s perceived, and probably accurately perceived to some extent, that by doing so and by placing people at risk that some leverage is gained as a result of doing that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>\u201cWhat I believe the jury verdict stands for is the fact that in the jury\u2019s opinion the fraud claim was overreaching on the part of the [plaintiffs]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-3\">On appeal, plaintiffs argue that they were entitled to a directed verdict or dismissal of defendant\u2019s counterclaim for a number of reasons, including that defendant failed to present any evidence of a \u201ctaking\u201d or appropriation of her money or property by plaintiffs. As it is dispositive, we address only plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the trial court erred by denying their motion for a directed verdict. We review the denial of a motion for a directed verdict by considering the evidence, and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from it, in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party to determine whether the moving party is entitled to a verdict as a matter of law. <em>Roop v. Parker Northwest Paving Co., </em>194 Or App 219, 245, 94 P3d 885 (2004), <em>rev den, </em>338 Or 374 (2005). A verdict cannot be set aside unless we can affirmatively say that there is \u201cno evidence\u201d from which a jury could have found the facts necessary to establish each element of the claim. <em>Brown v. J.C. Penney Co., </em>297 Or 695, 705, 688 P2d 811 (1984); <em>Ballard v. City of Albany, </em>221 Or App 630, 639, 191 P3d 679 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">As noted, an action for financial elder abuse may be brought \u201c [w]hen a person wrongfully takes or appropriates money or property of a vulnerable person[.]\u201d ORS 124.110 (l)(a); <em>see also </em>ORS 124.100(l)(g)(A), (l)(b) (\u201cvulnerable person\u201d includes an elderly person, meaning a person 65 years of age or older). Accordingly, the elements of a statutory claim for financial elder abuse are (1) a taking or appropriation, (2) of money or property, (3) that belongs to an elderly person, and (4) the taking must be wrongful. <em>Church v. Woods, </em>190 Or App 112, 117, 77 P3d 1150 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">ORS chapter 124 does not define \u201cwrongfully\u201d or \u201ctakes.\u201d In a previous case construing ORS 124.110, however, we applied well-established meanings for both terms. In <em>Church, </em>we gave \u201ctake\u201d its \u201cordinary meaning,\u201d which is \u2018\u201cto transfer into one\u2019s own keeping [or to] enter into or arrange for possession, ownership, or use of [.] \u2019 \u201d 190 Or App at 117 (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>2330 (unabridged ed 1993) (brackets in <em>Church)). </em>With respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>the \u201cwrongful\u201d element, we observed that that term \u201chas a well-understood meaning in the law of torts with regard to interference with legal interests. \u215c * * Conduct generally is \u2018wrongful\u2019 if it is carried out in pursuit of an improper motive or by improper means.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 118 (citations omitted). We noted that \u201cimproper means\u201d must be \u201cindependently wrongful by reason of statutory or common law, beyond the mere fact of the injury complained of.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We went on to explain that \u201cimproper means\u201d could include \u201c\u2018violence, threats, intimidation, deceit, misrepresentation, bribery, <em>unfounded litigation, </em>defamation and disparaging falsehood.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Conklin v. Karban Rock, Inc., </em>94 Or App 593, 601, 767 P2d 444, <em>rev den, </em>307 Or 719 (1989) (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">As plaintiffs point out, the incidental language in <em>Church </em>suggesting that unfounded litigation can satisfy the \u201cwrongful\u201d element of an elder abuse claim is arguably <em>dictum </em>because it was not necessary to the holding of that case, and was included as an example of an independent statutory or common law \u201cwrong.\u201d Nonetheless, even assuming that a claim for elder abuse may be based on the prosecution of unfounded litigation, and assuming that plaintiffs\u2019 fraud claim was \u201cunfounded,\u201d we conclude that plaintiffs were entitled to judgment on defendant\u2019s counterclaim as a matter of law. That is so for the simple reason that defendant failed to present any evidence from which a jury could find that there had been a \u201ctaking\u201d of her money or property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Defendant\u2019s argument, as we understand it, is that, when a claim for financial elder abuse is based on the prosecution of \u201cunfounded litigation,\u201d the requirement that the claimant must prove a \u201ctaking\u201d of money or property is different than when the abuse is perpetrated by some other, wrongful means. That is so because, in defendant\u2019s view, \u201cunfounded litigation\u201d is, by definition, unsuccessful. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>according to defendant, the only \u201ctaking\u201d that can exist where an elder abuse claim is based on \u201cunfounded litigation\u201d is the time, emotional distress, and legal fees incurred in defending against that litigation. Here, defendant argues that she presented evidence of such a \u201ctaking,\u201d and the trial court found that she had met her burden, because defending against plaintiffs\u2019 fraud claim took \u201ctime, effort, attorney fees\u201d and resulted in \u201cphysical and emotional costs.\u201d Defendant also argues that plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit was an \u201carrangement to take\u201d money or property from defendant to which plaintiffs were not entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Defendant misapprehends the nature of the required \u201ctaking\u201d for purposes of the financial elder abuse statute. Again, assuming for purposes of this appeal that \u201cunfounded litigation\u201d may be the predicate for an elder abuse claim, it can satisfy, at most, only the \u201cwrongful conduct\u201d element of such a claim. <em>See Church, </em>190 Or App at 118 (conduct is \u201cwrongful\u201d if it is carried out by improper means, such as \u201cunfounded litigation\u201d). Contrary to defendant\u2019s position on appeal, nothing in the text or context of ORS 124.110 suggests that the requirement to prove a \u201ctaking\u201d of money or property belonging to an elderly person changes based on the means that are used to perpetrate the abuse. Defendant must still establish a \u201ctaking,\u201d and, here, defendant fails to explain how the negative effects that she suffered as a result of plaintiffs\u2019 litigation equate to a \u201ctaking\u201d under the definition ascribed to the term in <em>Church. </em>That is, the alleged damages incurred by defendant\u2014the time, effort, stress, and expense incurred in defending against plaintiffs\u2019 fraud claim\u2014do not involve a transfer of defendant\u2019s money or property into plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cown keeping.\u201d <em>Church, </em>190 Or App at 117. Nor can it be reasonably said that a lawsuit, even if unfounded, is \u201can arrange[ment] for possession, ownership, or use of\u2019 defendant\u2019s money or property. <em>Id. </em>(brackets and emphasis added). To \u201carrange\u201d means to \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cmake preparations for,\u201d or \u201ccome to an agreement, understanding, or settlement.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int'l Dictionary </em>120 (unabridged ed 2002). The term simply has no application in the context of a \u201ctaking\u201d accomplished by asserting an adversarial legal claim, the outcome of which is far from certain.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>In sum, we conclude that defendant failed to present any evidence of a \u201ctaking\u201d of her money or property, as is required for a claim for financial elder abuse under ORS 124.110. The trial court therefore erred by denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a directed verdict and submitting defendant\u2019s counterclaim to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">On appeal, reversed as to financial elder abuse counterclaim; otherwise affirmed. Affirmed on cross-appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b70-8\"> ORS 124.100 creates a civil cause of action for damages resulting from the financial abuse of \u201cvulnerable person[s],\u201d which includes persons who are 65 years of age or older. ORS 124.100(l)(b), (g). Under ORS 124.110(l)(a), an action for financial abuse may he brought \u201c[w]hen a person wrongfully takes or appropriates money or property of a vulnerable person!.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b74-6\"> A claim for financial elder abuse may be brought when a person wrongfully \u201ctakes <em>or </em>appropriates\u201d money or property of an elderly person.

Moreover, on appeal, neither party offers separate argument as to whether or not plaintiffs \u201cappropriate [d]\u201d defendant\u2019s money or property. We limit our analysis accordingly.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
