J.</author>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction, entered after a conditional guilty plea, for one count of murder with a firearm, ORS 163.115, ORS 161.610. Defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s exclusion of expert testimony that defendant had been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, which he offered in support of a defense of extreme emotional disturbance (EED). We conclude that the trial court erred in excluding expert testimony that defendant had been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The facts, which are largely procedural, are undisputed. Defendant was indicted on one count of intentional murder with a firearm for killing his wife, Lisa. Defendant filed notice under ORS 163.135 of his intention to raise the affirmative defense of EED and to offer expert testimony in support of the defense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In response, the state moved to have defendant examined by a psychologist, which motion the court granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Defendant was first examined by Dr. Hulteng at the request of the defense. Hulteng prepared a written report that described the details of the examination and his findings. Defendant reported to Hulteng that he and Lisa had been experiencing marital problems for several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>weeks before the shooting. Lisa had told defendant that she wanted a divorce and, although he had been told by others that there was \u201cprobably somebody else,\u201d defendant pleaded with Lisa to stay with him and to attend marriage counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">One morning, defendant looked at Lisa\u2019s phone and discovered that Lisa had been exchanging text messages with her coworker, Jeff. The messages indicated that Lisa had gone out for a drink with Jeff the night before, which contradicted her statement to defendant that she had been at a client meeting and had then stayed at a bar to drink alone. When defendant confronted Lisa about the text messages, she told him that there was nothing going on with Jeff. However, defendant then examined Lisa\u2019s phone records and discovered hundreds of text messages between Lisa and Jeff. That night, defendant and Lisa attended a marriage-counseling session. When the counselor asked the couple what they hoped to achieve through counseling, Lisa stated, \u201cNothing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">On the Sunday morning before the shooting, defendant accessed Lisa\u2019s email account and discovered romantic email exchanges between Jeff and Lisa. Defendant \u201cfelt physically ill\u201d when he read through the messages. That evening, when defendant confronted Lisa about the emails, Lisa admitted to having an affair with Jeff. She told defendant that she wanted to leave him and to plan a future with Jeff. Later, after defendant found more romantic emails between Lisa and Jeff, he called Jeff\u2019s wife to tell her about the affair and forwarded one of the emails to Lisa\u2019s boss and coworkers.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Defendant and Lisa got into an argument and, after it escalated, Lisa left the home. Defendant called Lisa and accused her of being with Jeff. Defendant told Hulteng that, at that moment, he \u201cliterally wanted to die.\u201d At some point that night, he got his handgun and pointed it at his head, but he stopped himself because he did not want his daughter to be the one who found him dead. Lisa returned home in the middle of that night. Defendant put his arm around her and told her that he loved her. She \u201cgrunted, was very annoyed,\u201d and asked him if he was serious.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>The next morning, defendant woke up and saw Lisa sitting on their daughter\u2019s bed, text messaging with Jeff. Defendant was \u201cat [his] wits end\u201d and got into the shower. When defendant got out of the shower, he tried to give Lisa a hug, but she shook her head in disgust.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-3\">Defendant told Hulteng that he could not explain how he felt at that moment, but that all he could hear in his head was that he was \u201cweak and spineless.\u201d As he left the bathroom to get a drink of water, he passed by his closet. Instead of going to get the glass of water, defendant went into the closet, grabbed his gun, and returned to the bathroom. He looked at Lisa, raised the gun, and pulled the trigger. Defendant told Hulteng that he felt like it was a dream, and that he did not feel like he was in control. Defendant said that he was telling himself, \u201cno, no, don\u2019t do this,\u201d but that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t stop it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">After the shooting, defendant put the gun down, got dressed, and dropped his daughter off at her carpool. He once again had thoughts of suicide. Defendant called his mother and asked her to come look after his daughter. He then went to the police station to get help for Lisa. When officers arrived at defendant\u2019s home, they found Lisa dead on the bathroom floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">During the psychological examination, defendant told Hulteng about his personal life, including his military experience and alcohol use, and he described his emotional state both before and after the shooting. Hulteng observed, \u201c[Defendant] exhibits some depressive symptoms, which appear to be a reaction to his present circumstances.\u201d He also noted that, although defendant had been \u201cexposed to traumatic events while in combat during the First Gulf War,\u201d the \u201cdiagnostic criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder do not appear to be met.\u201d Hulteng diagnosed defendant, under the <em>American Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders </em>(DSM-IV-TR),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with three Axis I disorders: adjustment disorder with depressed mood; anxiety disorder, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>otherwise specified; and alcohol abuse. He also diagnosed defendant with narcissistic personality traits under Axis II.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Hulteng also provided an opinion regarding the EED defense. He opined that, although there was no indication that defendant \u201csuffered from a mental condition or cognitive impairment rendering him <em>inherently </em>incapable of controlling himself [,] \u201d there were \u201cindications that he was experiencing intense emotional distress.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Hulteng noted that whether defendant\u2019s disturbance was reasonable from the standpoint of an ordinary person, as required under ORS 163.135 for the EED defense to apply, was a question of fact for a jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Defendant was then examined by Dr. Duncan, first at the request of the state and then at defendant\u2019s request. In addition to speaking with defendant, Duncan reviewed Hulteng\u2019s report, defendant\u2019s history, and police reports. He described his findings in a written report. Duncan diagnosed defendant with two Axis I disorders: anxiety disorder, not otherwise specified; and alcohol abuse. Duncan also diagnosed defendant with Axis II obsessive-compulsive personality traits. Duncan explained that, \u201c[b]ased on the totality of the data, it [was his] professional opinion that, at the time of the alleged murder of his wife Lisa on January 11, 2011, [defendant] was experiencing heightened stress, increased despair, and hopeless, catastrophic, and rigid thinking.\u201d Duncan also reported that, during both his and Hulteng\u2019s examinations of defendant, defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-6\">\u201cendorsed anxiety symptoms associated with initial combat related trauma, including recurring nightmares, potential avoidance symptoms, and a heightened startle response. Although he does not appear to have full blown PTSD, [defendant\u2019s] ongoing anxiety symptoms during the days leading up to the alleged murder of his wife likely placed him at heightened risk for developing extreme distress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">Although Duncan stated that he could not \u201cethically opine on the ultimate EED issue because that is up to the jury or Judge to decide,\u201d it was his \u201cprofessional opinion that [defendant] continued to exhibit signs of extreme distress, impaired judgment, and poor behavioral controls at the time of the alleged murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>The state filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to limit Hulteng\u2019s and Duncan\u2019s expert testimony. Specifically, the state moved to exclude testimony about \u201cdefendant\u2019s anxiety, where it stems from, how it manifests, and how his additional personality traits factor into and affect his thinking.\u201d The state also moved to exclude testimony \u201cregarding defendant\u2019s thought process or state of mind on the days surrounding the murder,\u201d and \u201cwhether his personality characteristics or traits put him at heightened risk for experiencing \u2018extreme distress.\u2019\u201d The state explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-3\">\u201cAn extensive examination of the development of the EED defense reveals that the determination for the \u2018reasonableness of the explanation for the disturbance\u2019 is to be made from the objective perspective of the \u2018ordinary\u2019 person: i.e., not someone with defendant\u2019s personality traits, characteristics, or thought processes. The subjective component remains the actor\u2019s situation, or the events and circumstances leading up to the incident. To permit the defense to elicit the defendant\u2019s specific personality characteristics and traits would improperly remove the objective component that was purposefully retained by the legislature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">Defendant opposed the state\u2019s motion, arguing that the experts should be permitted to testify about \u201cdefendant\u2019s military history, defendant\u2019s mental disease or defect, the link between his military history and mental disease or defect, and the link between his mental disease or defect and his commission of the homicide.\u201d Defendant argued that evidence of his mental disorders did not \u201cconstitute evidence of a personality trait or characteristic\u201d but, rather, should be \u201cconsidered as a component of the actor\u2019s situation\u201d and relevant to the subjective element of the EED defense. Defendant argued that the state\u2019s interpretation of the statute would \u201csanitize defendant and strip away any subjective factors that could prove to be favorable to his case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">The trial court granted the state\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>making the following findings and conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-6\">\u201c1. Mental illness is not to be considered or elicited through expert testimony, with respect to any aspect or element of the EED defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>\u201c2. Axis I and Axis II diagnoses should not be part of the EED defense and should not be utilized in the EED testimony. Specifically, Axis I diagnoses are not relevant to any aspect or element of the EED defense. Axis I diagnoses are not relevant to a) the \u2018actor\u2019s situation\u2019 under ORS 163.135; or b) the issue whether \u2018the disturbance is not the result of the person\u2019s own intentional, knowing, reckless or criminally negligent act\u2019 under ORS 163.135.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-3\">\u201c3. Personality disorders, traits and characteristics are to be excluded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-4\">\u201c4. The <em>State v. Wille, </em>317 Or 487 [, 858 P2d 128] (1993), construct at page 497 in the opinion is appropriate to be used in this case where the expert may report facts that were provided to the expert primarily by the defendant that seem to present an extremely stressful situation for the defendant. Thus, although an expert may not provide testimony that defendant suffers from an Axis I or Axis II diagnosis, an expert may testify as to historical facts from defendant\u2019s past (e.g.\u2014war zone deployment, exposure to graphic experiences and images attendant to that deployment), and how an ordinary person with those experiences would have found the circumstances at issue extremely stressful, and how those experiences may have impacted whether \u2018the disturbance is not the result of the person\u2019s own intentional, knowing, reckless, or criminally negligent act.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-5\">\u201c5. The expert may give an opinion that an ordinary person operating under the facts as relayed by the defendant in that same situation would be stressed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-6\">\u201c6. The defendant\u2019s beliefs and facts of his situation in life can be stated as in the <em>Wille </em>model.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-7\">\u201c7. Phrases such as rigid, obsessive, heightened risk, thought processes, impaired judgment, and poor behavioral controls are personal value judgments and do not meet the standard of a legal defense. Testimony shall not include whether the defendant was suffering from an \u2018extreme emotional disturbance.\u2019 Such phrases shall not be offered by an expert. Those phrases and that type of presentation by the expert witnesses would undercut the objective component which these cases clearly establish in Oregon law. The Legislature has determined that the objective criteria is very important to the EED construct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>Following the court\u2019s ruling, defendant entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving his right to appeal the trial court\u2019s ruling on the state\u2019s motion <em>in limine. </em>On appeal, defendant argues that evidence of his anxiety disorder is relevant to the subjective component of the EED defense\u2014 that is, to \u201cthe actor\u2019s situation.\u201d He argues that the trial court therefore erred in limiting Hulteng\u2019s and Duncan\u2019s expert testimony to exclude evidence of defendant\u2019s anxiety disorder.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state reprises its argument that the expert testimony about defendant\u2019s anxiety disorder was properly excluded as irrelevant because \u201cthe actor\u2019s situation\u201d does not encompass a defendant\u2019s personality traits, including evidence of mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">Thus, the issue before us is one of statutory construction. Specifically, we must determine the meaning of the phrase \u201cthe actor\u2019s situation\u201d and whether evidence of a defendant\u2019s anxiety disorder comes within it.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">We begin with a brief discussion of the history of ORS 163.135 and, in particular, the history of the reasonableness standard in the statute, which was described in great detail in <em>State v. Ott, </em>297 Or 375, 686 P2d 1001 (1984). Oregon\u2019s affirmative defense of EED constitutes a mitigating circumstance that reduces the crime of intentional murder to first-degree manslaughter. <em>See </em>ORS 163.118(l)(b). The defense requires proof that (1) \u201cthe homicide was committed under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance,\u201d (2) \u201cthe disturbance is not the result of the person\u2019s own intentional, knowing, reckless or criminally negligent act,\u201d and (3) \u201cthere is a reasonable explanation for the disturbance.\u201d ORS 163.135(1). \u201cThe reasonableness of the explanation for the disturbance must be determined from the standpoint of an ordinary person in the actor\u2019s situation under the circumstances that the actor reasonably believed them to be.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A defendant may present expert testimony in support of the defense only if he has given notice to the state of his intention to offer such testimony. ORS 163.135(2). After such notice is served, \u201cthe state may have at least one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>psychiatrist or licensed psychologist of its selection examine the defendant in the same manner and subject to the same provisions as provided in ORS 161.315.\u201d ORS 163.135(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">In <em>Ott, </em>the Supreme Court explained that Oregon\u2019s EED defense derived from the common-law \u201cheat of passion\u201d defense, which for centuries employed an entirely objective \u201creasonable man test\u201d to determine whether a defendant was justifiably provoked to commit homicide. 297 Or at 381 (\u201c[The reasonable man test] has been said to be an objective test, meaning that neither the mental nor physical peculiarities of the accused are evaluated in determining whether his loss of self-control was reasonable.\u201d). However, critics of the heat-of-passion defense observed that the reasonable man test was at odds with the more subjective concept of <em>mens rea. Id. </em>at 382. Among those critics were the drafters of the Model Penal Code, who sought to make the defense more subjective:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-5\">\u201c\u2018Though it is difficult to state a middle ground between a standard which ignores all individual peculiarities and one which makes emotional distress decisive regardless of the nature of its cause, we think that such a statement is essential. For surely if the actor had just suffered a traumatic injury, if he were blind or were distraught with grief, if he were experiencing an unanticipated reaction to a therapeutic drug, it would be deemed atrocious to appraise his crime for purposes of sentence without reference to any of these matters. They are material because they bear upon the inference as to the actor\u2019s character that it is fair to draw upon the basis of his act.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 385 (quoting Model Penal Code Tentative Draft No. 9 \u00a7 201.3, at 48).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">The 1971 Oregon Criminal Law Revision Commission was \u201cgreatly influenced by the work of the drafters of the Model Penal Code.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 386. However, the commission also recognized \u201ca need for establishing a standard to fix an average conduct to protect the general welfare.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The commission \u201cproposed to the Oregon legislature the Model Penal Code concept of viewing the matter from the standpoint of a person in the actor\u2019s situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 395. The commission explained that that \u201c\u2018requirement *** inserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>some objectivity into a highly subjective standard,\u2019\u201d and noted that the \u201c\u2018old provocation formula [was] much too narrow; it [did] not recognize modern understanding of personalities.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387 (quoting Minutes, Senate Criminal Law &amp; Procedure Committee, Feb 16, 1971, at 8-9 (testimony of George Platt)).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">Ultimately, the legislature opted for a more objective test than the commission had proposed, thus requiring the jury to determine the reasonableness of the explanation for the disturbance \u201cfrom the standpoint of an <em>ordinary person </em>in the actor\u2019s situation under the circumstances that the actor reasonably believed them to be.\u201d ORS 163.135 (emphasis added). As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Ott,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-5\">\u201c[t]he juxtaposition of these two requirements for determining the adequacy of the explanation prevents the adequacy from being determined on either wholly objective or subjective grounds. The words \u2018ordinary person\u2019 and \u2018reasonableness of the explanation\u2019 recall the reasonable man standard of the heat of passion defense, which is an objective test, while the requirement of taking into account the actor\u2019s situation suggests a more subjective analysis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">297 Or at 393-94. The current statute, therefore, considers both objective and subjective factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">At issue in <em>Ott </em>was the propriety of jury instructions regarding the EED defense. Among other things, the jury had been instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-8\">\u201c[W]hen you consider the reasonableness of the explanation for an extreme emotional disturbance and its resulting homicidal act, you are not to use the defendant\u2019s scheme of moral values or the [d] efendant\u2019s personality characteristics. You may only use the scheme of moral values and personality characteristics which would be possessed by an ordinary person in our society today [.] \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 389. In discussing that portion of the jury instructions, the court drew a distinction between a defendant\u2019s <em>personal </em>characteristics\u2014such as gender, sexual orientation, pregnancy, or physical disability\u2014and a defendant\u2019s <em>personality </em>characteristics\u2014such as bad temperament. <em>Id. </em>at 395. The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>\u201cOne must conclude that the Commission envisioned that the actor\u2019s situation included the actor\u2019s personal characteristics. A fair conclusion from the legislative treatment of the Commission\u2019s proposal is that the legislature was aware of this injection of subjectivity, yet the legislature made no change in that part of the Commission\u2019s proposal. The 1971 statute, originally and now, makes the test depend on the actor\u2019s situation. We have found nothing to indicate that this does not include those \u2018personal\u2019 characteristics noted by the drafters of the Model Penal Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 395-96 (footnote omitted). However, the court also concluded that the legislature did not intend for the actor\u2019s situation to extend to a defendant\u2019s <em>personality </em>characteristics because \u201csuch an interpretation would permit the acquittal of a bad-tempered person of murder and the conviction of an even-tempered person of murder in precisely the same situation and circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Wille, </em>317 Or at 499 (the trial court did not err in excluding expert testimony that the defendant suffered from a personality disorder because \u201cthe defendant\u2019s \u2018personality characteristics\u2019 or \u2018personality traits\u2019 are not relevant\u201d to the actor\u2019s situation).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The Supreme Court revisited the meaning of the statutory phrase \u201cthe actor\u2019s situation\u201d in <em>State v. Counts, </em>311 Or 616, 816 P2d 1157 (1991). At issue in <em>Counts </em>was whether the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect under ORS 161.295<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the affirmative defense of EED are mutually exclusive. After recounting the legislative history of ORS 163.135, the court concluded that \u201cthe legislature did not intend that an individual\u2019s mental disease or defect (as defined by ORS 161.295) should be included within\u201d the phrase \u201cthe actor\u2019s situation.\u201d <em>Counts, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>311 Or at 628. The court explained, \u201cTo take such a factor into account would eliminate the objective checks intentionally maintained in the defense. What circumstance, for example, would not be reasonable as viewed from the standpoint of an \u2018ordinary insane person?\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, the court\u2019s focus was solely on the mental disease or defect contemplated by ORS <em>161.295(1)\u2014viz., </em>insanity. The court left open the \u201cissue as to whether lesser mental infirmities may be taken into account in the \u2018actor\u2019s situation.\u2019\u201d 311 Or at 628 n 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">We turn to the question at issue here, which is whether evidence of defendant\u2019s diagnosis of anxiety disorder is relevant to the \u201cactor\u2019s situation\u201d and, thus, admissible to support his defense of EED. Defendant contends that a diagnosis of anxiety disorder is a personal characteristic akin to a person\u2019s age, gender, or physical disability. Thus, defendant argues, it is relevant to \u201cthe actor\u2019s situation\u201d and should not have been excluded. The state argues that, to the contrary, the \u201cactor\u2019s situation\u201d does not encompass a defendant\u2019s \u201cpersonality characteristics or thought processes\u201d but concerns only \u201cthe events and circumstances that led up to the homicide.\u201d The state urges that \u201c[t]o conclude otherwise would eliminate the objective component that the legislature expressly chose to retain.\u201d We agree with defendant for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">First, defendant\u2019s diagnosis of anxiety disorder more closely resembles the personal characteristics that the legislature intended to be relevant to \u201cthe actor\u2019s situation\u201d than it does to the type of personality traits that the Supreme Court has concluded are irrelevant to the EED defense. Anxiety disorder, not otherwise specified, is categorized in the DSM-IV-TR under Axis I, which includes mental disorders and other conditions that may be a focus of clinical attention. DSM-IV-TR at 27. Like schizophrenia, eating disorders, and at least some other Axis I clinical disorders, anxiety disorder is a condition that can involve acute symptoms and that is susceptible to psychological and medical treatment. Defendant\u2019s anxiety disorder, as explained in this case, bears a closer resemblance to physical illness or disability than it does to nonclinical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>personality traits like ill temperament, dishonesty, or stubbornness.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-3\">The state argues that this case presents the same type of evidence deemed inadmissible in <em>Witte. </em>However, the evidence sought to be admitted in <em>Witte </em>was that the defendant suffered from a <em>personality </em>disorder. 317 Or at 496. The trial court excluded that evidence on the basis that the diagnosis would have been \u201c\u2018intertwined\u2019\u201d with evidence of the defendant\u2019s personality traits, which were deemed irrelevant to the EED defense in <em>Ott. Id. </em>In affirming that ruling, the Supreme Court characterized the trial court\u2019s ruling as excluding evidence of the defendant\u2019s <em>personality </em>traits. <em>Id. </em>at 497. The evidence here is unlike the proffered evidence in <em>Witte. </em>Personality disorders\u2014like narcissistic, antisocial, or borderline personality disorder\u2014are coded in the DSM-IV-TR under Axis II and are expressly distinguished from Axis I clinical disorders like defendant\u2019s anxiety disorder. We have observed that personality disorders \u201care more resistant to treatment than Axis I disorders because Axis II disorders generally involve a more enduring and pervasive set of maladaptive behaviors, perceptions, and beliefs.\u201d <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. R. N. L., </em>218 Or App 188, 192 n 3, 180 P3d 704 (2008). Here, defendant did not offer expert testimony that would be inextricably intertwined with evidence of his personality. That is, the testimony offered by defendant was not about an \u201cenduring and pervasive set of maladaptive behaviors, perceptions, and beliefs.\u201d Rather, defendant offered expert testimony regarding how his Axis I anxiety disorder contributed to his experience of \u201cheightened stress,\u201d \u201cincreased despair,\u201d and \u201crigid thinking\u201d at the time of the shooting. Thus, it is distinguishable from the testimony deemed irrelevant in <em>Witte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Second, contrary to the state\u2019s view, nothing in the text, context, or legislative history of ORS 163.135 indicates that the actor\u2019s situation is limited to the events and circumstances leading up to the homicide. As already discussed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>personal characteristics, such as gender, age, and physical disability, are relevant to the actor\u2019s situation. <em>Ott, </em>297 Or at 395-96. Subsections (2) and (5) of the statute also support the conclusion that the legislature intended the actor\u2019s situation to encompass more than just external circumstances. ORS 163.135(2) requires a defendant seeking to present expert testimony in support of an EED defense to provide notice to the state. After such notice is served, \u201cthe state may have at least one psychiatrist or licensed psychologist of its selection examine the defendant in the same manner and subject to the same provisions as provided in ORS 161.315.\u201d ORS 163.135(5). Those provisions indicate that the legislature contemplated the admission of expert psychological and psychiatric evidence on the EED defense, much like the expert evidence admitted to support an insanity defense. <em>See also State ex rel Johnson v. Woodrich, </em>279 Or 31, 35, 566 P2d 859 (1977) (discussing the state\u2019s right to a psychiatric examination of a defendant seeking to plead not guilty by reason of insanity or to introduce expert testimony on EED: \u201cIt was neither our intent nor that of the legislature to attempt to undercut the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. It was our intent to make the best use of modern psychiatric expertise consistent with the privilege as we understand it.\u201d (Footnote omitted.))</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">The state acknowledges that ORS 163.135 contemplates the admission of expert psychological testimony but argues that the legislature did not intend to allow that testimony to extend to evidence of mental illness. Once again, the state attempts to draw a parallel between this case and <em>Wille. </em>In <em>Wille, </em>the Supreme Court noted that the trial court had not excluded the expert testimony in its entirety; rather the court had merely precluded the expert from testifying about (1) the defendant\u2019s personality traits, (2) his opinion that the murder was or was not an intentional act, and (3) his opinion that the defendant had acted under extreme emotional disturbance. 317 Or at 497. The court observed that the expert was not barred from providing other testimony, such as the defendant\u2019s account of what happened, the expert\u2019s opinion that the circumstances leading up to the homicide (including the defendant\u2019s impending divorce and financial problems) presented an extremely stressful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>situation for the defendant, and the expert\u2019s opinion that an ordinary person would have found those circumstances very stressful as well. <em>Id. </em>at 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\">We are not persuaded that the court\u2019s observations regarding the <em>scope </em>of the trial court\u2019s ruling in <em>Wille </em>support a conclusion that the legislature intended to limit expert psychological testimony to the subjects identified in <em>Wille. </em>To confine expert testimony to the defendant\u2019s statements and to opinions on the defendant\u2019s level of stress would arguably eliminate the need for expert psychological testimony altogether. <em>See </em>OEC 702 (\u201cIf scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\u201d). We therefore conclude that the actor\u2019s situation encompasses more than simply the events and circumstances that the defendant faced before the homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Third, we reject the state\u2019s argument that admitting evidence of a diagnosis of anxiety disorder eliminates the objective component of the EED defense. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Ott, </em>the legislature intended ORS 163.135 to encompass both subjective and objective considerations: \u201cThe words \u2018ordinary person\u2019 and \u2018reasonableness of the explanation\u2019 recall the reasonable man standard of the heat of passion defense, which is an objective test, while the requirement of taking into account the actor\u2019s situation suggests a more subjective analysis.\u201d 297 Or at 393-94. We see no reason to conclude that evidence of a defendant\u2019s anxiety disorder is incompatible with this hybrid approach. Just as a jury is capable of determining reasonableness from the standpoint of an ordinary blind person, a jury is capable of determining reasonableness from the standpoint of an ordinary person suffering from an anxiety disorder, as explained through expert psychological evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">We therefore conclude that evidence of defendant\u2019s anxiety disorder is relevant to the affirmative defense of EED under ORS 163.135. Thus, the trial court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>limiting the expert testimony to exclude evidence of defendant\u2019s diagnosis of an anxiety disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b791-7\"> ORS 163.135 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-8\">\u201c(1) It is an affirmative defense to murder for purposes of ORS 163.115 (l)(a) that the homicide was committed under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance if the disturbance is not the result of the person\u2019s own intentional, knowing, reckless or criminally negligent act and if there is a reasonable explanation for the disturbance. The reasonableness of the explanation for the disturbance must be determined from the standpoint of an ordinary person in the actor\u2019s situation under the circumstances that the actor reasonably believed them to be.
