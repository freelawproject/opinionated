Mother raises a single assignment of error, arguing that the trial court legally erred in its application of the statutory factors that govern child custody awards under ORS 107.137. We disagree; the court correctly applied the statutory factors under ORS 107.137 and its \u201cbest interests\u201d determination was not contrary to the evidence or reason. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">Neither party requests <em>de novo </em>review. \u201cAccordingly, we state the facts consistently with the trial court\u2019s express and implied findings, to the extent there is evidence in the record to support them[.]\u201d <em>Miller and Miller, </em>269 Or App 436, 437, 345 P3d 472 (2015). Mother and father have one child together, born in 2009. During their marriage, mother and father lived in the parties\u2019 marital home in Stayton, Oregon. Mother and father divorced when child was 18 months old, and mother and child moved in with mother\u2019s parents in Stayton. Following the divorce, father moved to Salem and, eventually, to Donald, where he resided at the time of this custody hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Up until the present hearing, mother and father shared joint legal custody, and the most recent parenting plan awarded father parenting time on his days off of work. Father had Mondays and Tuesdays off of work and child stayed with father, father\u2019s wife, and child\u2019s younger half-sister from 6:30 p.m. on Sunday until 10:00 a.m. on Wednesday. Mother is a teacher who has weekends, summers, and other public school breaks off of work. In March 2014, mother moved from her parents\u2019 home in Stayton to Albany, Oregon, and filed this proceeding to seek the court\u2019s assistance in selecting child\u2019s school and to modify the parenting plan and custody arrangement to accommodate child starting kindergarten.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">At the custody hearing, mother argued that she \u201cshould be awarded custody of the parties\u2019 5 year old child <em>*** </em>and be allowed to register [child] in the [Spanish immersion] school she has chosen near her residence in Albany because she has been [child\u2019s] primary caretaker.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>Mother continued, stating that \u201cthere is no good way to accommodate Father\u2019s current \u2018work weekend\u2019 of Mondays and Tuesdays.\u201d Mother proposed that \u201c[f]ather should have [child] every other weekend beginning Friday after school and ending Sunday night.\u201d Mother also contended that \u201c[i]t does not necessarily make sense\u201d for child to be with father \u201cmore of the summer * * * to \u2018make up\u2019 for lost time during the school year,\u201d because \u201c[m] other is consistently available\u201d during the summer because of her employment as a teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">Father responded, arguing that \u201c[m] other\u2019s choice of school would effect a major disruption and change of the parenting plan that has been in place for three years, dramatically altering] the balance of time between father and mother\u201d with child and that father \u201cseeks custody simply because the court cannot order the continuation of joint custody over either party\u2019s objection.\u201d Father asserted that he should be given custody and the court should adopt his parenting plan because that \u201callows equal access to the child\u201d in conformity with Oregon\u2019s policy regarding parenting to \u201c[a]ssure minor children frequent and continuing contact with parents who have shown the ability to act in the best interests of the child\u201d and to \u201c[e]ncourage such parents to share in the rights and responsibilities of raising their children after the parents have separated or dissolved their marriage.\u201d ORS 107.101. Under father\u2019s proposed parenting plan, \u201c[d]uring the school year, the child would be with father during the school week, and with mother every weekend with a Monday morning return\u201d and \u201c[t]he inequality of time during the school year would be \u2018made up\u2019 during the summer with an alternating four weeks with mother and one week with father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The trial court set forth its ruling in a supplemental judgment modifying custody, parenting time, and support. In that judgment, the court stated that it \u201chas applied the evidence to and taken into consideration all the relevant factors set forth in ORS 107.137, as more fully enunciated in the ruling from the bench on July 16, 2014,\u201d and, \u201c[b]ased thereon, it is in the best interests and welfare of [child] that legal custody be awarded to [father].\u201d At that July 16 custody hearing, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>\u201cBecause of school coming up, I believe there is a substantial change that warrants a different custody arrangement, a lot of it doing with logistics.

When I consider all the factors, and primary caregiver is a factor that I would give to mom, and willingness and ability of each parent to facilitate, encourage close and continuing relationship, I give a slight edge to dad. But does that mean anything? No. Other than [that] the rest of them are even and I have to find a way to go forward with this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-6\">\u201cUltimately, it comes down to the best interests of the child, and there are a lot of other factors that go into that.

Father responds, arguing that \u201c[t]he trial court properly considered statutory factors, *** [m]other\u2019s singular emphasis on \u2018primary caretaker\u2019 is misplaced,\u201d and \u201c[t]he trial court did not engage in \u2018lifestyle\u2019 reasoning in its analysis, or misapply statutory provisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">Under ORS 107.137, \u201cwhether the trial court applied the correct legal standard in making the challenged \u2018best interests\u2019 determination presents a question of law that we review for legal error.\u201d <em>Finney-Chokey and Chokey, </em>280 Or App 347, 360, 381 P3d 1015 (2016), <em>rev den, </em>361 Or 100 (2017). \u201c [I]f we determine that the trial court applied the correct legal standard, we review the court\u2019s \u2018best interests\u2019 determination for abuse of discretion\u201d and will \u201cuphold the trial court\u2019s decision unless it exercises its discretion in a manner that is unjustified by, and clearly against, reason and evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>ORS 107.137 provides, in part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-3\">\u201c(1) *** [I]n determining custody of a minor child under ORS 107.105 or 107.135, the court shall give primary consideration to the best interests and welfare of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-4\">In determining the best interests and welfare of the child, the court shall consider the following relevant factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-5\">\u201c(a) The emotional ties between the child and other family members;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-6\">\u201c(b) The interest of the parties in and attitude toward the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-7\">\u201c(c) The desirability of continuing an existing relationship;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-8\">\u201c(d) The abuse of one parent by the other;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-9\">\u201c(e) The preference for the primary caregiver of the child, if the caregiver is deemed fit by the court; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-10\">\u201c(f) The willingness and ability of each parent to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing relationship between the other parent and the child * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-11\">\u201c(2) The best interests and welfare of the child in a custody matter shall not be determined by isolating any one of the relevant factors referred to in subsection (1) of this section, or any other relevant factor, and relying on it to the exclusion of other factors * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-12\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-13\">\u201c(4) In determining custody of a minor child under ORS 107.105 or 107.135, the court shall consider the conduct, marital status, income, social environment or lifestyle of either party only if it is shown that any of these factors are causing or may cause emotional or physical damage to the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-14\">We reject mother\u2019s argument that \u201c[t]he trial court legally erred in awarding custody to father after finding that mother was the primary caregiver.\u201d At oral argument, mother contended that, under <em>Turner and Muller, </em>237 Or App 192, 238 P3d 1003 (2010), the primary caregiver preference outweighs a finding that the other parent is more willing to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing relationship between the other parent and the child. In <em>Turner, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>on <em>de novo review, </em>we concluded that the father \u201cappears to be more willing and able to facilitate and encourage [the child\u2019s] relationship with mother than mother would be with respect to facilitating a relationship between [the child] and father,\u201d and that the mother was the primary caregiver. <em>Id. </em>at 203-04. In addition, the custody evaluator, Carr, when asked about the effect of placing the child with the father, stated, \u201cI think that would have serious psychological effects on this child, who\u2019s *** very significantly attached to her mother. Her mother was her * * * primary psychological parent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200. We acknowledged the significance of Carr\u2019s assessment that a change in custody \u201c\u2018would have serious psychological effects\u2019 on [the child], who \u2018would feel extremely disconnected from her mother\u2019 and whose \u2018sense of safety and well-being would be *** incredibly threatened,\u201d\u2019 and concluded that, <em>\u201c[u]nder those circumstances, </em>the preference for the primary caregiver weighs in favor of mother and, on balance, indicates that it is in [the child\u2019s] best interests to remain in mother\u2019s custody.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 204 (emphasis added). <em>Turner </em>has notable differences from this case. First, it was a decision in which we independently reviewed the facts <em>de novo. </em>Second, the circumstances differed significantly in this case. Here, the trial court did not find that placing child with father would have any serious psychological effects on child. Moreover, the trial court determined that ORS 107.137(l)(a), child\u2019s emotional ties to her half sister, in addition to ORS 107.137(l)(f), the willingness and ability of father to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing relationship between mother and child, favored father.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">No single factor, including the \u201cpreference for the primary caregiver of the child,\u201d ORS 107.137(l)(e), is dispos-itive. ORS 107.137(2) provides that \u201c[t]he best interests and welfare of the child in a custody matter shall not be determined by isolating any one of the relevant factors referred to in subsection (1) of this section, or any other relevant factor, and relying on it to the exclusion of other factors.\u201d Under that statutory directive, it would be legal error for the court to find that mother was the primary caregiver of child and to isolate and rely on that factor to the exclusion of the other factors that it found in favor of father. <em>See Gomez and Gomez, </em>261 Or App 636, 637-38, 323 P3d 537 (2014) (the primary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>caregiver is afforded a statutory preference, but that factor \u201cis not dispositive\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">Mother\u2019s argument that the trial court \u201cfailed to consider the \u2018preference\u2019 that the law requires be given to such a finding and, instead, simply recited it as a factor,\u201d is not well taken. In making this argument, mother focuses on a single statement of the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-5\">\u201cWhen I consider all the factors, and primary caregiver is a factor that I would give to mom, and willingness and ability of each parent to facilitate, encourage close and continuing relationship, I give a slight edge to dad. <em>But does that mean anything? No. </em>Other than [that] the rest of them are even and I have to find a way to go forward with this.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">(Emphasis added.) Mother reads too much into that statement and fails to consider the context in which it was made and the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">In making that statement, the trial court found that the primary-caregiver and ability of each parent to facilitate a relationship factors did not answer the question of what custody arrangement would be in child\u2019s best interests. Once the trial court had determined that those two factors did not resolve the issue, it continued to evaluate other criteria. As noted, the trial court also found that \u201c[t]he sibling relationship is important\u201d and that child cares for her half sister. The court incorporated that \u201cadditional finding, which [was] stated on the record herein,\u201d into the supplemental judgment as a statutory factor that it considered in favor of father.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">Moreover, when that statement is viewed in context, it is evident that the trial court had, as it stated in its supplemental judgment, \u201capplied the evidence to, and taken into consideration all the relevant factors set forth in ORS 107.137.\u201d The court repeatedly emphasized, \u201cI\u2019ve considered the factors,\u201d and even went as far as stating that \u201cI have a little cheat sheet that I work with all the time, and I\u2019ve evaluated them all.\u201d On this record, we conclude that the trial court did more than simply recite the primary caregiver preference as a factor; it weighed that statutory factor against the other statutory factors that it found in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>father to determine what custody arrangement would be in \u201cthe best interests and welfare of the child.\u201d ORS 107.137.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Mother next argues that, in evaluating other criteria, \u201c[t]he court impermissibly considered inappropriate factors in determining custody.\u201d Mother relies on ORS 107.137(4) and <em>Miller, </em>269 Or App 436. ORS 107.137(4) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-5\">\u201cIn determining custody of a minor child under ORS 107.105 or 107.135, the court shall consider the conduct, marital status, income, social environment or lifestyle of either party only if it is shown that any of these factors are causing or may cause emotional or physical damage to the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">In <em>Miller, </em>in discussing ORS 107.137(4),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we stated that \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s decision to grant custody to father was based on mother\u2019s choices to move the children 15 miles away from their former home to live with a trusted friend, to continue her college education, and to have a baby with her boyfriend, who did not have a visible means of support or a driver\u2019s license.\u201d 269 Or App at 443. \u201c[T]he trial court\u2019s ruling was based on disapproval of mother\u2019s recent choices\u2014 particularly becoming pregnant by her boyfriend\u2014and d[id] not reflect an attempt to articulate how those choices might <em>damage </em>the children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444 (emphasis in original). Because of that, we concluded that \u201cit was legally impermissible for the trial court to consider mother\u2019s reasons for her move, her financial situation, her personal situation with her boyfriend and pregnancy, and her decision to continue schooling.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">Additionally, in <em>Miller, </em>we concluded that the trial court legally erred in finding ORS 107.137(l)(f) in favor of the father because \u201cthe only finding that the court made that remotely relates to that factor was that mother\u2019s move and concomitant change in the school that the children attend made it more difficult for father to spend additional time with the children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 445. We noted, however, that \u201cthat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>is a circumstance that is true for every noncustodial parent where the father and mother do not live in close proximity, and it is not a circumstance, in and of itself, that bears on whether the custodial parent is willing and able to foster a positive relationship with the noncustodial parent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 446. Because the \u201centire backbone\u201d of the trial court\u2019s ultimate conclusion rested on those impermissible considerations, we reversed for legal error. <em>Id. </em>at 445-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">In this case, the trial court was careful not to fault either parent for the parent\u2019s choice of employment or place of residence. It stated that both mother and father \u201chave a right to pursue separate lives.\u201d Specifically, the trial court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-5\">\u201ca) Because of [child] beginning school, there is a substantial change that warrants a different custody arrangement, a lot of it doing with logistics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-6\">\u00ab\u215c \u215c\u215c\u215c\u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-7\">\u201cg) The court cannot change the rigidity of either parents\u2019 work schedules. Mother\u2019s work schedule is just as rigid as father\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-8\">\u201ch) The court understands that father moved away [from Stayton], but Mother could have just as easily chosen to move to Keizer [instead of Albany] to be closer to Father\u2019s new residence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">The court was not interested, as both parties seemed to be, in assessing blame for either of those choices. The court simply recognized that it had to consider the work schedules of both parents and the distance between their residences created by their respective moves to come to a determination of what was in the best interests of child. The court did not impermissibly hold lifestyle choices against either party like the court in <em>Miller </em>did and, as discussed below, it could consider both parents\u2019 work schedules and the distance between their homes in recognizing \u201cthe value of close contact with both parents.\u201d ORS 107.105(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">Mother next argues that \u201cthe court impermissi-bly balanced \u2018parenting time criteria\u2019 under ORS 107.105 (l)(b)\u201d in making its custody determination because \u201cOregon law sets forth the time at which the factor of \u2018quality time\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>should enter into the court\u2019s analysis, and it is in the creation of a parenting plan rather than in the determination of custody.\u201d We disagree; the broader context of the statutory provisions demonstrates that, often times, there is a substantial amount of interplay between custody determinations and parenting plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">ORS 107.105(l)(a) provides that, when the court renders a judgment of marital dissolution, the court may provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1q\">\u201cFor the future care and custody, by one party or jointly, of all minor children of the parties born, adopted or conceived during the marriage and for minor children born to the parties prior to the marriage, as the court may deem just and proper under ORS 107.137. The court <em>may </em>hold a hearing to decide the custody issue prior to any other issues. <em>When appropriate, the court shall recognize the value of close contact with both parents and encourage joint parental custody and joint responsibility for the welfare of the </em>children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">(Emphases added.) In making a custody determination, or a modification of a prior custody determination, the court considers the factors listed in ORS 107.137. However, ORS 107.137(2) provides that the court can consider <em>\u201cany other relevant factor\u201d </em>not listed in subsection (1) so long as it does not isolate and rely on it to the exclusion of other factors. (Emphasis added.) Such \u201cother relevant factor\u201d can include the parenting plan the parties were required to submit to the court in this case because mother sought to modify a judgment providing for parenting time with child. <em>See </em>ORS 107.102(1) (requiring parties to submit a parenting plan to \u201cmodify a judgment providing for parenting time with a child\u201d). Nothing in ORS 107.105(l)(a) or (b), or ORS 107.137, prohibits a trial court from considering the interplay between a proposed parenting plan and a custody determination in modifying its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">The trial court\u2019s consideration of the parties\u2019 parenting plans and its efforts to foster strong contacts with father and mother was permissible. As noted, ORS 107.105(l)(a) provides that, \u201c[w]hen appropriate, the court shall recognize the value of close contact with both parents\u201d in making a custody determination. Moreover, ORS 107.105(l)(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>provides that \u201c[t]he court shall recognize the value of close contact with both parents\u201d when reviewing a parenting plan that \u201chas been developed as required by ORS 107.102.\u201d Those provisions are consistent with \u201cour stated goal to promote a strong relationship between children and their noncustodial parents by the creation of parenting plans.\u201d <em>McArthur and Paradis, </em>201 Or App 530, 536, 120 P3d 904, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 609 (2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, ORS 107.101(1) provides that it is the policy of this state to \u201c[a]ssure minor children frequent and continuing contact with parents who have shown the ability to act in the best interests of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">Under the circumstances of this case, where \u201c [t] he court did not hear anything about either party being a bad parent,\u201d it was appropriate for the trial court to evaluate how its custody determination and the associated parenting plan would affect child\u2019s ability to have \u201cclose contact with both parents.\u201d ORS 107.105(l)(a), (b). In light of the foregoing discussion, we conclude that the trial court applied the correct legal standard in making its custody determination under ORS 107.137.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">As noted, when the trial court applies the correct legal standard, we will \u201cuphold the trial court\u2019s decision unless it exercises its discretion in a manner that is unjustified by, and clearly against, reason and evidence.\u201d <em>Finney-Chokey, </em>280 Or App at 360 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Although the court found that the primary caregiver factor weighed in mother\u2019s favor, the court also found that two other enumerated factors favored father\u2014the emotional ties between child and her half-sister, and father\u2019s willingness to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing relationship between mother and child. Moreover, the trial court was concerned that if it awarded custody to mother and accepted her parenting plan that it would \u201ceffectively cut[] Father out of [child\u2019s] life.\u201d In sum, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion because the trial court\u2019s \u201cbest interests\u201d determination was \u201cnot contrary to the evidence or reason.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b833-13\"> In. her brief, mother asserts that \u201c[t]he only articulated statutory factor that the court found to be more favorable to father was a \u2018slight edge\u2019 regarding facilitating the relationship with a non-custodial parent\u201d because, during its oral ruling, the court stated that \u201cthe rest of the[] [statutory factors] are even\u201d other than the primary caretaker factor which favored mother. However, later on during its oral ruling, the court found that \u201c[t]he sibling relationship [with child\u2019s half-sister] is important,\u201d and it decided to incorporate that finding into the supplemental judgment before finding that \u201c[t]he rest of the applicable custodial factors are \u2018even\u2019 as to both parents.\u201d Thus, contrary to mother\u2019s assertion, the court also found that child\u2019s relationship with her half-sister is a factor that weighs in favor of awarding custody to father. <em>See Dillard and Dillard, </em>179 Or App 24, 29, 39 P3d 230, <em>rev den, </em>334 Or 491 (2002) (\u201c[W]ritten orders control over oral judicial statements.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b838-8\"> ORS 107.137 was amended by Oregon Laws 2013, chapter 72, section 1, to add another subsection, which resulted in renumbering subsections in the statute.
