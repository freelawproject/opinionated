In the underlying criminal case, petitioner entered a guilty plea and, in 2011, the trial court entered a' judgment sentencing him to a term of probation. Soon thereafter, petitioner appeared before the court for a probation violation hearing and, in February 2012, the court revoked petitioner\u2019s probation and sentenced him to a term of imprisonment. The trial court\u2019s judgment was affirmed on direct appeal and petitioner later sought post-conviction relief, which was denied. Petitioner then filed the petition for post-conviction relief at issue in this case. In his petition for post-conviction relief, petitioner alleged that (1) his trial counsel was inadequate for failing to ensure that petitioner\u2019s criminal history was correctly calculated; (2) the state engaged in prosecutorial misconduct in compiling petitioner\u2019s criminal history; and (3) the state committed a Brady<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> violation by failing to produce certain evidence at his probation revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">The superintendent moved for summary judgment asserting that petitioner\u2019s claims relating to inadequate assistance of counsel and prosecutorial misconduct were untimely and successive. However, the superintendent did not challenge petitioner\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim, stating that he did \u201cnot take issue with the timeliness or initial appearance\u201d of that claim and did \u201cnot ask that [that claim] be dismissed by way\u201d of his summary judgment motion. The post-conviction court determined that the petition was time barred and successive, granted the superintendent\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and entered judgment against petitioner on all of his claims, including the <em>Brady </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">On appeal from the resulting judgment, petitioner contends that the post-conviction court erred in granting summary judgment on any of his claims. We reject without discussion petitioner\u2019s contentions regarding his ineffective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>assistance of counsel and prosecutorial misconduct claims. As to his <em>Brady </em>claim, petitioner asserts that he sufficiently alleged a <em>Brady </em>claim that was properly raised in post-conviction, and that the post-conviction court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the superintendent on that claim. The superintendent observes that he did not seek summary judgment on petitioner\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim, and concedes that the post-conviction court erred in <em>sua sponte </em>granting summary judgment and entering judgment against petitioner on that claim. We agree and accept the concession. Accordingly, we reverse and remand as to that claim and otherwise affirm the post-conviction court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Reversed and remanded as to <em>Brady </em>claim; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b325-6\"> <em>Brady v.
