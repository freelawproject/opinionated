On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion for judgment of acquittal on the burglary count, asserting that the state\u2019s evidence, which was that she entered her mother\u2019s house with permission and then committed the crime of harassment against her sister, was insufficient to establish that, as required for the crime of burglary, she \u201centered or remained unlawfully\u201d in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">In support of her motion for judgment of acquittal, defendant pointed out that the evidence showed that that she had an \u201cabsolute and long-standing privilege to enter\u201d her mother\u2019s house and defendant argued that the privilege did not automatically terminate upon the commission of a crime. The state did not dispute that defendant\u2019s entry into the house was lawful, but argued that her presence became unlawful when she committed the harassment. The trial court denied the motion, and jury convicted defendant of both charged counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">On appeal, defendant renews the argument that she made in the trial court and relies on <em>State v. Werner, </em>281 Or App 154, 168, 383 P3d 875 (2016), <em>rev den, </em>361 Or 312 (2017), which issued after the trial in this case. In <em>Werner, </em>we held that \u201cthe commission of a crime does not, in and of itself, convert a lawful entry into an unlawful remaining!)]\u201d The state concedes that, under <em>Werner, </em>the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal. We agree with the parties that the trial court erred, and, therefore, we reverse defendant\u2019s burglary conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Conviction for first-degree burglary reversed; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
