In its order, the board postponed petitioner\u2019s parole release date for 10 years after finding that he suffered from a \u201cpresent severe emotional disturbance such as to constitute a danger to the health or safety of the community,\u201d ORS 144.125(3)(a), and that it was \u201cnot reasonable to expect that [petitioner] would be granted parole\u201d before 2023, the new date set by the board, ORS 144.280 (l)(b). Petitioner raises two assignments of error. First, he argues that substantial evidence does not support the board\u2019s order. Second, he contends that, because the board acted pursuant to statutes enacted after he committed his crime of conviction, the board\u2019s decision to postpone his parole for 10 years violated the state and federal constitutional prohibitions against <em>ex post facto </em>laws. We review the board\u2019s conclusions for legal error, as well as for substantial evidence and reason. <em>See Morrison v. Board of Parole, </em>277 Or App 861, 863, 374 P3d 948, <em>rev den, </em>360 Or 465 (2016); ORS 144.335(3) (providing that ORS 183.482(8) applies to parole board decisions). For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that the board did not err and, accordingly, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">In 1980, petitioner was convicted for a murder committed on November 3,1977.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was sentenced to life in prison and, as required by ORS 144.120,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the board set an initial parole release date. In 1997, shortly before petitioner\u2019s scheduled release on parole, the board conducted an \u201cexit interview\u201d under ORS 144.125 to review whether petitioner was suitable for release.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The board found that petitioner suffered from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>present severe emotional disturbance (PSED) \u201csuch as to constitute a danger to the health or safety of the community.\u201d ORS 144.125(3)(a). As a result, the board postponed petitioner\u2019s parole for two years and scheduled a new exit interview for 1999. In 1999, the board again postponed petitioner\u2019s parole for two years, as it did following hearings held every two years thereafter until 2013, when the board postponed petitioner\u2019s parole for 10 years rather than two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Petitioner\u2019s challenge arises from his 2013 exit interview. At that 2013 hearing, the board found, as it had at each of petitioner\u2019s previous parole review hearings, that he suffered from a PSED such as to constitute a danger to the health or safety of the community. In a \u201cBoard Action Form\u201d (BAF), the board explained that, in making that finding, it was relying upon the reports of two psychologists who had examined petitioner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-5\">\u201cBased on the doctors\u2019 reports and diagnos [e] s, coupled with all the information that the Board is considering, the Board concludes that the inmate suffers from a present severe emotional disturbance that constitutes a danger to the health or safety of the community. The Board has considered this matter under the substantive standard in effect at the time of the commitment offense (s) and all other applicable rules and laws.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">Having once again found that petitioner suffered from a disqualifying PSED, the board deferred petitioner\u2019s parole, this time for 10 years, pursuant to ORS 144.125(3)(a), which provides, as to a parole deferral based on a PSED:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-7\">\u201cThe board may not postpone a prisoner\u2019s scheduled release date to a date that is less than two years, or more than 10 years, from the date of the hearing * * * The board shall determine the scheduled release date, and the prisoner may petition for interim review, in accordance with ORS 144.280.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>The cross-referenced statute, ORS 144.280, limits the board\u2019s authority to postpone parole for more than two years to inmates for whom the board has found that \u201cit is not reasonable to expect that the prisoner would be granted parole before the date of the subsequent hearing.\u201d ORS 144.280(l)(b). The board is required to \u201cdetermine the date of the subsequent hearing pursuant to rules adopted by the board.\u201d ORS 144.280(l)(c). The applicable board rules include OAR 255-062-0016, which lists 14 \u201cFactors to be Considered in Establishing a Deferral Period Longer Than Two Years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">The BAF explained the board\u2019s finding \u201cthat it is not reasonable to expect that [petitioner] will be granted a firm release date before 10 years from the current projected release date.\u201d Specifically, that finding was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-5\">\u201cbased on, but not limited to the following factors in OAR 255-062-0016:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-6\">\u201c(2) Infractions of institutional rules and discipline:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-7\">\u201cThe Board found inmate had several disciplinary violations, with the most recent occurring in February 2012. The 2012 violation was concerning based on * * * inappropriate comments to staff, but more concerning was inmate\u2019s lack of understanding as to why he was held accountable for his behavior. Inmate did not take accountability for his actions, and demonstrated a disregard of the institution rules as well as [dis] respect for the female officer to whom he showed [a] rape-themed \u2018joke.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-8\">\u201c(5) Inmate\u2019s demonstrated lack of effort to address criminal risk factors of psychological or emotional problems:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-9\">\u201cThe Board found inmate could not identify or adequately discuss psychological or emotional growth even though he has had the benefit of many years of programming. Inmate had made efforts to address alcoholism, but had not addressed other factors leading to criminality. Inmate maintained he was innocent not only of his crime of conviction, but of his disciplinary violations and previous crimes, and hiding behind this innocence, inmate appeared to only superficially engage in self-improvement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-10\">\u201c(9) Inmate\u2019s inability to experience or demonstrate remorse or empathy:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>\u201cThe Board did not find that inmate demonstrated remorse for his crime, as he maintained his innocence. Even taking his claim of innocence, inmate did not demonstrate remorse for the circumstances surrounding the death of the seven-year-old child. Inmate claimed to be the target of conspiracies, lies, and wrongdoing, and in so doing appeared to try to establish himself as the victim in this case. Inmate also failed to demonstrate remorse for his disciplinary rule violations, especially the 2012 violation. His lack of empathy for the staff person in that situation was also a serious concern.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-4\">\u201c(10) Demonstrated poor planning and foresight:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-5\">\u201cThe Board questioned inmate regarding his finances, and though he is receiving significant sums of money, he has saved nothing. He does not believe he needs to save because he has not had a firm release date. Such poor planning and judgment does not bode well for inmate\u2019s ability to handle life outside of prison.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-6\">\u201cEach of these factors is an adequate and independent basis for our decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">(Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">Petitioner timely sought administrative review of the board\u2019s decision. In relevant part, he argued that there was not substantial evidence to support the board\u2019s conclusion that he suffered from a PSED such as to constitute a danger to the health or safety of the community; that the board had not adequately explained the connection between the evidence and its conclusion; and that the board\u2019s application of 2009 statutory amendments constituted an <em>ex post facto </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">The board upheld its decision in an Administrative Review Response (ARR). The board explained to petitioner that it had \u201cconsidered your entire record when it made its decision in your case, including the crime of murder of which you were convicted, your institutional record, the diagnoses and conclusions offered by the psychological examiners, and the information presented at your hearing.\u201d The ARR highlighted aspects of the psychologists\u2019 reports as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-10\">\u201cIn his evaluation, Dr. Colistro reviewed your institutional history and previous psychological evaluations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>Dr. Colistro noted that in 2005 Dr. David Starr evaluated you and found that on the PCL-R (Psychopathy Checklist-Revised) you scored in the high category relative to the presence of psychopathy. Dr. Colistro also scored the PCL-R and found that you score in the moderate range as compared to other male inmates. He administered the Mill\u00f3n Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-II (MCMI-II), a psychological assessment tool intended to provide information on psychopathology, including specific personality disorders. The test portrayed you as \u2018an interpersonally threat-sensitive, inadequate, socially avoidant individual, who based on these test results alone, would be expected to have substantial difficulties establishing and maintaining interpersonal relations.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-3\">\u201cYou placed in the low to moderate risk category on the HCR-20 (Historical, Clinical, Risk Management 20), an instrument for the assessment of violence risk. From the Board\u2019s perspective, a \u2018moderate\u2019 risk of future violence is extremely concerning in an inmate who has been convicted of the murder of a child. Dr. Colistro gave a diagnosis of, among other things, a \u2018Personality Disorder with Paranoid and Antisocial Traits.\u2019 He commented that your personality disorder was \u2018severe\u2019 in 2006, but in his opinion is now \u2018viewed as being partially in remission.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-4\">\u201cDr. McGuffin utilized, among other tools, the MMPI-2 (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory) and the MCMI-III, empirically-validated standardized personality tests. Your MMPI-2 profile was valid with indicators that \u2018suggest moderate denial of common, ordinary faults and imperfections, as well as moderate overall defensiveness,\u2019 a pattern that \u2018suggests much tendency to minimize problems and a possible motivational distortion in an effort to present a positive image.\u2019 Individuals with profiles similar to yours \u2018exhibit significant difficulties arising from the presence of hostile and aggressive feelings,\u2019 are \u2018generally uncooperative and self-centered.\u2019 They tend to be \u2018very defensive, sensitive, and intolerant\u2019 and lack insight. The profile is characterized by a high level of antisocial and histrionic characteristics. Dr. McGuffin noted that on the MCMI-III you produced a profile of a person who is gloomy and pessimistic and has \u2018difficulty expressing anger and aggression in an appropriate manner.\u2019 Dr. McGuffin provided a diagnosis of \u2018Mixed Personality Disorder with Antisocial, and Paranoid Features.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>The board then summarized various other concerns unrelated to the psychological reports. Of \u201cparticular concern\u201d to the board was petitioner\u2019s continued denial that he had committed the murder and his belief that he had been unjustly convicted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That, the board reasoned, indicated that petitioner had \u201cnot accepted responsibility for [his] crime, and therefore [has] not gained the self-knowledge that would operate to prevent [him] from killing again.\u201d The board explained that some of the factors that it had noted in the BAF \u201cweighed heavily with the Board in [its] deliberations.\u201d Those factors included petitioner\u2019s failure to understand why he had been held accountable for the inappropriate \u201cjoke\u201d that he had shared with a female corrections officer, his \u201cinability to experience or demonstrate remorse or empathy,\u201d and his \u201cdemonstrated poor planning and foresight.\u201d The ARR summarized the board\u2019s conclusions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-4\">\u201cIn sum, the Board did not find that credible evidence outweighed evidence that you have a present severe emotional disturbance such as to constitute a danger to the health or safety of the community, and concludes that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the Board\u2019s decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">The board rejected petitioner\u2019s <em>ex post facto </em>argument, but did not specifically address the aspect of that argument that petitioner raises on judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">We turn to petitioner\u2019s assignments of error. We begin with petitioner\u2019s second assignment, in which he contends that the board\u2019s decision deferring his parole date for 10 years rather than two violated the <em>ex post facto </em>clauses of the Oregon and United States constitutions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>ORS 144.280 and OAR 255-062-0016\u2014on their face and as applied to him\u2014are unconstitutional under those clauses, because they were enacted after the date of his offense and \u201cexpand the reasons available to the board to set the deferral period, as well as grant the board greater discretion in setting deferral periods.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The board disputes that characterization, and argues that those newly enacted provisions neither changed the substantive standard for deferring parole nor allowed for a lengthier deferral period.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">\u201c[A] person raising an <em>ex post facto </em>challenge to a change in parole procedure [under the Oregon Constitution or the United States Constitution] must demonstrate in a non-speculative way that the change has resulted in a significant risk that the person\u2019s punishment will be increased.\u201d <em>Morrison, </em>277 Or App at 866 n 3 (citing <em>Smith v. Board of Parole, </em>343 Or 410, 419-20, 171 P3d 354 (2007); <em>Butler v. Board of Parole, </em>194 Or App 164, 171-73, 94 P3d 149, <em>rev den, </em>337 Or 555 (2004)). When the change in law \u201cdoes not by its own terms show a significant risk, the [petitioner] must demonstrate, by evidence drawn from the rule\u2019s practical implementation ***[,] that as applied to [the petitioner\u2019s] own sentence the law created a significant risk of increasing his punishment.\u201d <em>Garner v. Jones, </em>529 US 244, 255, 120 S Ct 1362, 146 L Ed 2d 236 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Before 2009, ORS 144.125(3)(a) did not dictate the allowable deferral period. It simply provided that, \u201c[i]f the board finds the prisoner has a present severe emotional disturbance such as to constitute a danger to the health or safety of the community, the board may order the postponement of the scheduled parole release until a specified future date.\u201d The 2009 legislature specified that the board could defer release for between two and 10 years, subject to ORS 144.280 and its implementing rules.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Or Laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>2009, ch 660, \u00a7\u00a7 2-3. As we understand petitioner\u2019s <em>ex post facto </em>argument, he contends that, by dictating what the board must consider in exercising its discretion to choose a new release date, ORS 144.280 and OAR 255-062-0016 have \u201cresulted in a significant risk that [petitioner\u2019s] punishment will be increased.\u201d <em>Morrison, </em>277 Or App at 866 n 3. For the reasons that follow, we disagree that those provisions have the effect that petitioner posits.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-3\">We recently rejected an analogous claim involving the frequency of parole-consideration hearings for prisoners who were sentenced as dangerous offenders. <em>See id. </em>at 865-66. In the same bill that amended the exit-interview procedures at issue in this case, the 2009 legislature made identical changes regarding the timing of parole-consideration hearings for dangerous offenders. <em>See </em>Or Laws 2009, ch 660, \u00a7 4. As with exit interviews, the board must now schedule subsequent parole-consideration hearings between two and 10 years in the future, but may set the new hearing more than two years in the future only if it finds \u201cthat it is not reasonable to expect that the prisoner would be granted a release date before the date of the subsequent hearing.\u201d ORS 144.228(l)(b)(A), (B). And, as with prisoners serving life sentences, a dangerous offender may request an interim hearing, but only after \u201ctwo years from the date of the previous hearing and at intervals of not less than two years thereafter.\u201d ORS 144.228(l)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">In <em>Morrison, </em>following a parole-consideration hearing, the board had declined to set a parole date for the petitioner and, relying on the 2009 changes in the law, scheduled his next hearing six years in the future. 277 Or App at 863. At the time of the petitioner\u2019s offense, however, a subsequent parole-consideration hearing could be set \u201cno later than two years from the date of the previous hearing\u201d and was subject to the offender\u2019s right to request an interim hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 863-64 (citing ORS 144.228(l)(b), (c) (1987), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 1991, ch 318, \u00a7 2; Or Laws 1993, ch 334, \u00a7 3; Or Laws 2009, ch 660, \u00a7 4). The petitioner argued that, on their face and as applied to him, the amendments resulted in an <em>ex post facto </em>violation, because they deferred his next hearing for six years rather than two, and curtailed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>previously unlimited right to request an interim hearing to no more than every two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-3\">We concluded that the amendments to ORS 144.228 did not, on their face, create a risk of increased punishment. \u201c[Njothing in them changes the substantive standard for determining whether a dangerous offender qualifies to have the board set a parole release date, or otherwise purports to extend the applicable term of incarceration for a dangerous offender.\u201d <em>Morrison, </em>277 Or App at 866. And, as applied to the petitioner, we found it \u201cspeculative ([or even] affirmatively unlikely) that the change in procedure gave rise to any risk of increasing petitioner\u2019s term of incarceration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 867. That was because the board had found that it was not reasonable to expect that the petitioner would be granted a release date before the date of the subsequent hearing, and the record supported that finding. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">Here, as in <em>Morrison, </em>the substantive standard governing parole deferrals has not changed. First, contrary to petitioner\u2019s apparent contention, OAR 255-062-0016 does not give the board additional reasons to defer parole. The factors listed under that rule guide the board\u2019s decision as to <em>when </em>to set the next exit interview; they do not change the substantive standard for <em>whether </em>to release the inmate or to defer parole. As relevant here, the decision to postpone parole remains subject to the requirement that the board first find that the prisoner \u201chas a present severe emotional disturbance such as to constitute a danger to the health or safety of the community.\u201d ORS 144.125(3)(a). Only then does the board turn to ORS 144.280 and OAR 255-062-0016 to determine the appropriate length of deferral.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Second, neither ORS 144.280 nor OAR 255-062-0016 grants the board authority to defer petitioner\u2019s parole for longer than it could at the time of his offense. In fact, whereas the board\u2019s current authority to defer parole is capped at 10 years and subject to potential interim review every two years, at the time of petitioner\u2019s offense, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>board had complete discretion as to when the next hearing would be set, <em>see </em>ORS 144.125(3) (1977) (requiring only that the board set a hearing for a \u201cspecified future date\u201d), and inmates were allowed review only \u201cafter four years have elapsed since the first board hearing and every three years thereafter.\u201d <em>Former </em>OAR 254-040-0005 (Oct 4, 1977). Thus, the 2009 changes in the law do not create a significant risk that petitioner\u2019s punishment will be increased. <em>See also Garner, </em>529 US at 254 (rejecting facial <em>ex post facto </em>challenge to Georgia law that increased the time between parole hearings from three to eight years if it was \u201cnot reasonable to expect that parole would be granted during the intervening years\u201d and allowed for interim review based on new information or changed circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">Petitioner\u2019s as-applied <em>ex post facto </em>argument fairs no better. As in <em>Morrison, </em>the board in this case found that it was \u201cnot reasonable to expect\u201d that petitioner would be released before the subsequent hearing. Furthermore, petitioner remains able to request, every two years until the scheduled hearing, that the board hold an interim hearing to consider his release. If, based upon such a request, the board finds \u201cthat there is reasonable cause to believe that [petitioner] may be granted parole,\u201d then the board must conduct a hearing \u201cas soon as is reasonably convenient.\u201d ORS 144.280(2). And, if petitioner has reason to believe that a request for an interim hearing has been wrongly denied, he may seek judicial review of that decision. <em>See </em>ORS 144.280(3) (requiring board to memorialize denial of a petition for interim hearing by issuing a final order); ORS 144.335(l)(a) (allowing a prisoner to \u201cseek judicial review of a final order of the board\u201d if the prisoner is \u201cadversely affected or aggrieved\u201d by the order). Although petitioner will not automatically receive a hearing every two years, he has not demonstrated a significant risk, either facially or as applied to himself, that the 2009 amendments will increase his period of incarceration. We conclude, therefore, that the board\u2019s reliance on those provisions in deferring petitioner\u2019s parole did not constitute an <em>ex post facto </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">We now turn to petitioner\u2019s remaining assignment of error, in which he argues that the board\u2019s finding of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>PSED is not supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Under ORS 183.482 (8)(c), we must \u201cset aside or remand the order\u201d if we conclude that it is not supported by substantial evidence. Substantial evidence \u201cexists to support a finding of fact when the record, viewed as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make that finding.\u201d <em>Id.', see </em>ORS 144.335(3) (providing that we \u201cmay affirm, reverse or remand the order on the same basis as provided in ORS 183.482(8)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">Petitioner\u2019s first contention is that substantial evidence does not exist to support the board\u2019s order, because the board relied extensively on the psychologists\u2019 written reports, which are hearsay. Petitioner asserts that <em>Reguero v. Teacher Standards and Practices, </em>312 Or 402, 418-19, 822 P2d 1171 (1991), supports that argument, but we disagree. <em>Reguero </em>instructs us to consider case-specific, nonexclusive factors to determine whether substantial evidence supports an agency\u2019s findings when those findings rely, in part, on hearsay. <em>Reguero </em>does not, however, hold \u201cthat a hearsay written report can never rise to the level of substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Smith v. Board of Parole, </em>284 Or App 226, 231, 391 P3d 807 (2017). And, for exit interviews conducted under ORS 144.125, the relevant statutes expressly contemplate that the board will typically base its decisions more on written reports than live testimony. <em>See </em>ORS 144.125(1) (before releasing an inmate on parole, the board may \u201cinterview the prisoner to review the prisoner\u2019s parole plan and psychiatric or psychological report, if any, and the record of the prisoner\u2019s conduct during confinement\u201d); ORS 144.185(3) (before making its final decision, the board may obtain \u201ccurrent records and information regarding the prisoner, including * * * [t]he reports of any physical, mental and psychiatric examinations of the prisoner\u201d). Moreover, the board obtained and reviewed the psychologists\u2019 reports in the exact manner authorized by statute. <em>See </em>ORS 144.223 (permitting board to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>require a prisoner to undergo a psychological or psychiatric examination, after which the examining doctor must \u201cfile a written report of the findings and conclusions,\u201d which must be provided to the board, the prisoner, and the prisoner\u2019s attorney). In light of those provisions, petitioner\u2019s substantial evidence challenge must rest on the content of the psychologists\u2019 reports and the other evidence presented at the hearing, not on the fact that the reports are hearsay.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">We turn, then, to whether the record as a whole provides substantial evidence to support the board\u2019s finding that petitioner suffers from a PSED such as to constitute a danger to the health or safety of the community. The thrust of petitioner\u2019s argument is that the board erred in failing to account for evidence that weighed against that finding. Although couched primarily as a substantial-evidence argument, we understand petitioner\u2019s contention to go beyond an assertion that a reasonable person could not make the same finding as the board, and to encompass a substantial-reason argument as well. That is, petitioner argues that the board\u2019s failure to acknowledge certain countervailing evidence or to explain its finding in terms of the whole record deprived its decision of substantial reason. We consider each contention in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">When evaluating whether substantial evidence supports an agency\u2019s finding, we ask whether \u201cthe record, viewed as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make that finding.\u201d ORS 183.482(8)(c). We consider both the evidence that supports and detracts from the board\u2019s findings, <em>see Castro v. Board of Parole, </em>232 Or App 75, 83, 220 P3d 772 (2009), but defer to the board\u2019s reasonable inferences without reweighing the evidence in the record ourselves, <em>see Bandon Pacific v. Environmental Quality Commission, </em>273 Or App 355, 362, 359 P3d 394 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Viewing the record in that light, we conclude that it would permit a reasonable person to make the finding that the board made regarding petitioner\u2019s PSED. That finding comprises four elements: (1) an emotional disorder that is (2) present, (3) severe, and (4) such that petitioner is a danger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>to the health or safety of the community. <em>See </em>ORS 144.125(3); <em>Edwards v. Board of Parole, </em>272 Or App 183, 190, 355 P3d 166, <em>rev den, </em>358 Or 70 (2015). The PSED assessment under ORS 144.125(3) presents a legal\u2014rather than medical\u2014standard for the board to apply, but a formal diagnosis \u201cmust provide the foundation for the Board\u2019s finding that the emotional disturbance in question is \u2018present\u2019 and \u2018severe.\u2019\u201d <em>Christenson v. Thompson, </em>176 Or App 54, 61, 31 P3d 449 (2001). Here, both psychologists provided formal diagnoses, each concluding that petitioner exhibited a \u201cpersonality disorder\u201d or \u201cmixed personality disorder,\u201d with paranoid and antisocial traits. And, in finding that petitioner suffered from an emotional disorder, the board expressly considered the summaries of assessments and tests provided by those psychologists, each of whom explained that petitioner\u2019s psychological profile suggested significant difficulties with interpersonal relations, defensiveness, and sensitivity. Based upon that evidence, a reasonable person could find that petitioner presently suffers from an emotional disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">The board\u2019s evidence was more equivocal as to whether petitioner\u2019s disorder was \u201csevere\u201d and \u201csuch as to constitute a danger to the health or safety of the community.\u201d We have not previously defined the term \u201csevere,\u201d but we understand it to require more than the mere diagnosis of an emotional disorder. <em>See Meadows v. Schiedler, </em>143 Or App 213, 220, 924 P2d 314 (1996) (concluding that an amendment removing the term \u201csevere\u201d from ORS 144.125(3) constituted an <em>ex post facto </em>law, because it enabled the board \u201cto postpone release on a less restrictive showing than the previous version authorized\u201d). Petitioner emphasizes evidence that, in his view, precluded the board\u2019s finding because it was in conflict with other evidence that supported the finding. For example, there was evidence that petitioner had participated in prison programming and therapy and that he had benefitted from those efforts. Petitioner notes that both psychologists recognized that he \u201chad made great strides in his rehabilitation,\u201d and that Colistro specifically concluded that he was \u201camenable to management and supervision in the community.\u201d Colistro also described petitioner\u2019s disorder as partially in remission and opined that petitioner indicated \u201can awareness * * * of his own risk profile\u201d and that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>notwithstanding his disciplinary violation the year before, petitioner had become less confrontational and more \u201cprogram compliant.\u201d And, although petitioner maintained his innocence\u2014a matter that the board found demonstrated a lack of effort to address criminal risk factors and a lack of remorse for his crime\u2014he acknowledged to the psychologists and to the board that his unacceptable drinking behavior had at least indirectly led to the murder of a young child. Finally, the record showed that, in addition to petitioner\u2019s successful participation in therapy and treatment programs, he had also earned two bachelor\u2019s degrees while in prison and was active in the Native American prisoner community.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">We are not persuaded, however, that that countervailing evidence rendered the record insufficient to support the finding that petitioner\u2019s disorder both is severe and constitutes a danger to the health or safety of the community. Although, like Colistro, McGuffin acknowledged petitioner\u2019s progress, he emphasized petitioner\u2019s significant paranoia and sense of persecution. In McGuffin\u2019s opinion, petitioner\u2019s 2012 disciplinary violation, in which he had shared the rape \u201cjoke\u201d with a female corrections officer, showed a \u201closs of control, poor judgment, a need to feel power, a disregard for the rights of others and possibly a need to instill fear.\u201d <em>Cf. Peek v. Thompson, </em>160 Or App 260, 267, 980 P2d 178, <em>rev dismissed, </em>329 Or 553 (1999) (noting that the board on remand could find a PSED from a psychological report that stated, in part, that the prisoner had difficulties \u201ccontrol [ling] emotional discharges\u201d and \u201ctend[ed] to misinterpret his perceptions and to act inappropriately, in part because of excessive negativism and anger\u201d). McGuffin found that incident particularly concerning because it had occurred \u201cin the highly structured environment of prison and was not precipitated by abusing alcohol or any illicit substances,\u201d as were petitioner\u2019s crimes. As noted, the board also found that petitioner was unable to demonstrate remorse and empathy, a finding that, given petitioner\u2019s claim of innocence not only for the murder but for previous crimes and his disciplinary violations, the record supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Thus, contrary to petitioner\u2019s contention, the board did not unduly rely \u201con what it believed to be petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>false claim of innocence and the facts of his crimes.\u201d And, to the extent that petitioner argues that the board could not have made the finding that it did because the two psychologists\u2019 reports were in conflict, we disagree. As long as a reasonable person could have found that, despite differences between Colistro\u2019s and McGuffin\u2019s reports, petitioner\u2019s emotional disorder was severe and constituted a danger to the community, the board was permitted to resolve that conflict in the same manner. We conclude that a reasonable person could do so here. Accordingly, there was substantial evidence to support the board\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-3\">Finally, we consider petitioner\u2019s contention that the board\u2019s order fails to demonstrate substantial reason. Although we have already concluded that a reasonable person could make the findings that the board relied on, we must also ensure that the board\u2019s order provides \u201c\u2018some kind of an explanation connecting the facts of the case (which would include the facts found, if any) and the result reached.\u2019\u201d <em>Jenkins v. Board of Parole, </em>356 Or 186, 200, 335 P3d 828 (2014) (quoting <em>Martin v. Board of Parole, </em>327 Or 147, 157, 957 P2d 1210 (1998)). If the board\u2019s reasoning is not obvious, its order\u2014which includes both the BAF and the ARR\u2014must at least set forth the bases for its inferences. The board\u2019s explanation \u201c\u2018need not be complex, but it should be sufficient to demonstrate the existence of a rational basis and to allow for judicial review.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 196 (quoting <em>City of Roseburg v. Roseburg City Firefighters, </em>292 Or 266, 272, 639 P2d 90 (1981)). There must be \u201cno indication that, in making its decision, the board relied on evidence that did not qualify as substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 208 (citing <em>Martin, </em>327 Or at 157-58). Unlike most agencies, however, the board is not generally required to make written findings of fact and conclusions of law. <em>See id. </em>at 196 (citing ORS 183.315(1), which exempts the board from the findings-and-conclusions requirement in ORS 183.470(2)).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>Here, petitioner argues that the board\u2019s order relied too heavily on the \u201cunchangeable circumstance\u201d of his historical behaviors, including the murder itself, without accounting for the evidence that weighed against its decision other than to state that it had considered \u201call of the evidence presented at [the] hearing.\u201d He also argues that the board failed to explain its conclusion that his claim of innocence made him likely to reoffend. We disagree, however, that the board\u2019s order was so conclusory. The board explicitly reasoned that petitioner had \u201cnot accepted responsibility for [his] crime, and therefore [had] not gained the self-knowledge that would operate to prevent [him] from killing again.\u201d That reasoning appears in the order after the board\u2019s summary of the psychologists\u2019 reports, which indicate that persons with petitioner\u2019s psychological profile tend to minimize their own faults, lack insight, and exhibit defensiveness. The board\u2019s discussion of petitioner\u2019s claim of innocence also precedes the board\u2019s expression of concern regarding petitioner\u2019s inability to experience or demonstrate remorse or empathy. In that context, the board\u2019s reasoning is readily apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">We also conclude that the order adequately explains the connection between \u201cthe facts of the case * * * and the result reached,\u201d <em>Jenkins, </em>356 Or at 200, even though the board did not overtly address the countervailing evidence. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jenkins </em>informs that conclusion. In <em>Jenkins, </em>the court concluded that a rather con-clusory order demonstrated substantial reason, even though the board had done little more than state, based on a psychological report that the board never described, that the petitioner had a PSED such as to constitute a danger to the community. 356 Or at 190. Notably, the petitioner in that case did not contend that the report could not, with sufficient explanation, adequately support the board\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>at 208. But, under those circumstances, at least, the court concluded that there was \u201clittle doubt as to the facts on which [the board] relied or the existence of a rational connection between those facts and its decision.\u201d <em>Id.', see also Martin, </em>327 Or at 159 (approving the board\u2019s conclusory order that imposed a special condition of parole, where \u201cno one reasonably could doubt\u201d the importance of the condition and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>order \u201cindicate [d] that it weighed the different interests of the parties\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-3\">Here, the record is more mixed than in <em>Jenkins, </em>where the only report before the board was unequivocal and supported the board\u2019s decision. However, the board\u2019s order is considerably more detailed here than in <em>Jenkins. </em>And, although a more complete explanation of how the board resolved conflicts in the evidence might aid our review, the legislature has chosen to exempt the board from any requirement to provide such an explanation. ORS 183.315(1) (exempting board from findings-and-conclusions requirement applicable to other agencies under ORS 183.470(2)). Under the circumstances of this case, which include the board\u2019s express consideration of both of the psychologists\u2019 reports, we conclude that the board\u2019s order adequately reflects the evidence on which it relied and explains the connection between that evidence and the board\u2019s resulting decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b843-7\"> Changes to Oregon\u2019s sentencing system became effective October 4, 1977.
