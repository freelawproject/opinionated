J.</author>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">In this case, defendant was arrested in May 2015. She was charged with first-degree manslaughter, ORS 163.118, second-degree manslaughter, ORS 163.125, failure to perform the duties of a driver toward injured persons, ORS 811.705, driving under the influence of intoxicants, ORS 813.010, vehicular assault of a bicyclist or pedestrian, ORS 811.060,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and reckless driving, ORS 811.140. Later, on the state\u2019s motion, the court entered a judgment dismissing the charges without prejudice. Defendant subsequently filed a motion pursuant to ORS 137.225(l)(b)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for an order setting aside and sealing the record of the arrest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state filed a response opposing defendant\u2019s motion, asserting that \u201c [defendant's circumstances and behavior from the date [of] arrest * * * do not warrant setting aside of the arrest\u201d under ORS 137.225(3),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that setting aside the arrest would not be in the best interest of justice under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>ORS 137.225(12).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, at the hearing on the motion, the state advised the trial court that it was not relying on ORS 137.225(3) in opposition to the motion and, instead, was only \u201cgoing forward on subsection (12)\u201d of ORS 137.225. The state asserted and the court agreed that subsection (12) \u201cdoes not apply only to convictions\u201d but also to arrest records and, therefore, the question was \u201cwhether or not there is clear and convincing evidence that at this time it would not be in the best interest of justice to grant the motion.\u201d The court determined, \u201cby clear and convincing evidence, [that] granting the Defendant\u2019s motion to set aside and seal the record of arrest [was] not in the best interest of justice,\u201d and entered an order denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion. She asserts that, \u201cby its plain text, [ORS 137.225(12)] is not applicable to this case.\u201d Furthermore, she asserts that the trial court was required to grant her motion because \u201cthere was no evidence presented that her \u2018circumstances and behavior\u2019 from the date of her arrest to the hearing on the motion would warrant not setting aside her\u201d May 2015 arrest. The state now agrees that ORS 137.225(12) does not apply in this case and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion on the basis of that provision. We agree with the parties that the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion based on ORS 137.225(12). Under the circumstances of this case, including the fact that the state agreed that the court should not deny the motion based on the circumstances and behavior of the applicant from the date of arrest to the date of the hearing under ORS 137.225(3), the court should have granted defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Reversed and remanded for entry of an order setting aside and sealing arrest record pursuant to ORS 137.225(3).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b222-5\"> ORS 811.060 was amended by Oregon Laws 2017, chapter 388, section 1.
