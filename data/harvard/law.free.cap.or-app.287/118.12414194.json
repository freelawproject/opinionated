On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion to suppress evidence that an officer obtained after stopping defendant for a traffic violation. Defendant contends that the officer unlawfully extended the traffic stop by asking her to step out of her car and then questioning her about drugs without reasonable suspicion to believe that defendant was committing a drug crime. At the hearing on the motion to suppress, the officer testified that, after he stopped defendant for the traffic violation, he observed defendant \u201ctalking nonstop\u201d and \u201cshaking really bad[,]\u201d which is \u201cvery common in people that are under the influence of methamphetamine\u2014or a stimulant!.]\u201d The officer also recognized defendant\u2019s passenger as a known drug user. The officer did not testify that he had reasonable suspicion to believe that defendant was driving under the influence of intoxicants, but he did testify that he had reasonable suspicion to believe \u201cthat there were drugs in the car[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The state concedes that the officer\u2019s testimony \u201cwas insufficient to establish reasonable suspicion that defendant possessed controlled substances at the time of the stop.\u201d We agree with defendant\u2019s argument and accept the state\u2019s concession. <em>See State v. Miller, </em>267 Or App 382, 398, 340 P3d 740 (2014) (holding that evidence that the defendant was under the influence of a controlled substance and accompanied by a person who an officer knew from a prior drug investigation and who had been recently arrested on a drug charge was insufficient to support reasonable suspicion that the defendant was in possession of controlled substances).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
