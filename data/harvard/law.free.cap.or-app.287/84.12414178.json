Claimant contends that SAIF failed to meet its burden to prove that claimant suffers from a qualifying preexisting condition that became the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s combined condition. Claimant alternatively contends that the board applied the wrong legal standard when it required claimant to prove that the diagnostic MRI is a medical service directed to a condition caused in major part by claimant\u2019s injury. We conclude that the board permissibly construed the medical evidence as proving that claimant\u2019s osteoarthritis is a qualifying \u201cpreexisting condition\u201d that became the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s left knee combined condition. However, we also conclude that the board erred in failing to consider whether the MRI is directed to claimant\u2019s left knee strain and meniscal tear, which remain accepted conditions. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for the board to make that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">I. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">We begin with an overview of the relevant law regarding a \u201ccombined condition,\u201d because that law provides context for the pertinent facts and for our analysis of the arguments presented. Ordinarily, a claimant establishes compensability of a work injury by proving \u201cthat the work-related injury is a \u2018material\u2019 cause of the disability or the need for treatment.\u201d <em>Brown v. SAIF, </em>361 Or 241, 250, 391 P3d 773 (2017). However, when \u201can otherwise compensable injury\u201d combines with a qualifying \u201cpreexisting condition to cause or prolong disability or a need for treatment,\u201d the resulting condition is a \u201ccombined condition\u201d and is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">\u201ccompensable only if, so long as and to the extent that the otherwise compensable injury is the major contributing cause of the disability of the combined condition or the major contributing cause of the need for treatment of the combined condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number><em>Id. </em>(quoting ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B)). After accepting a combined condition claim, an insurer may deny the condition \u201cif the otherwise compensable injury ceases to be the major contributing cause.\u201d ORS 656.262(6)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">When the claimant challenges the denial of a \u201ccombined condition,\u201d it is the insurer\u2019s burden to prove that the worker has a qualifying \u201cpreexisting condition and that the compensable injury is not the major contributing cause of the disability or need for treatment.\u201d <em>Hopkins v. SAIF, </em>349 Or 348, 352, 245 P3d 90 (2010) (citing ORS 656.266(2)(a) (footnote omitted)). In this context, the \u201cotherwise compen-sable injury\u201d refers to the \u201caccepted medical condition\u201d that combines with a \u201cpreexisting condition.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>361 Or at 272-73. A qualifying \u201cpreexisting condition\u201d means that the worker \u201c\u2018has been diagnosed with such condition, or has obtained medical services for the symptoms of the condition,\u2019 or suffers from \u2018arthritis or an arthritic <em>condition.\u2019\u201dHopkins, </em>349 Or at 352 (quoting ORS 656.005(24)(a)(A) (footnote omitted)). By \u201carthritis,\u201d the legislature meant \u201cthe inflammation of one or more joints, due to infectious, metabolic, or constitutional causes, and resulting in breakdown, degeneration, or structural change.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364. In addition, \u201cbecause [ORS 656.262(6)(c)] provides that a combined condition that has been accepted may be denied when the otherwise com-pensable injury \u2018ceases\u2019 to be the major contributing cause of the combined condition, the statute necessarily requires that there be a change in the worker\u2019s condition.\u201d <em>Oregon Drywall Systems, Inc. v. Bacon, </em>208 Or App 205, 208-09, 144 P3d 987 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">II. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Claimant injured his left knee in October 2005, while working for an employer insured by SAIF. He sought treatment from Dr. Di Paola, who diagnosed \u201cmedial compartment degenerative arthrosis\u201d as well as a medial meniscal tear, for which he performed surgery. Following surgery, Di Paola described claimant\u2019s condition as a work-related left medial meniscus tear and preexisting \u201cdiffuse chon-dromalacia\u201d of the patellofemoral joint and medial compartment. When SAIF closed the claim it specified that claimant\u2019s accepted conditions for the October 2005 injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>included medial collateral ligament strain of the left knee and left medial meniscus tear.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">After SAIF closed the claim, claimant returned occasionally to Di Paola for recurring symptoms of his left knee condition, which Di Paola described as a combining of the meniscal tear with preexisting degenerative changes. In 2011, claimant again returned to Di Paola with ongoing problems in the left knee that had been worsening over time. Di Paola opined that claimant had experienced a \u201cworsening of his preexisting degenerative arthritis that is not attributable to his interval meniscal tears and their surgical treatment.\u201d When claimant asked SAIF to accept his medial compartment degenerative changes, SAIF denied that request but issued a modified notice of acceptance in which it specified that, \u201c[i]n addition to\u201d the previously accepted conditions, SAIF was accepting\u2014\u201cas of\u2019 the date of the 2005 injury\u2014a combined condition consisting of the previously accepted conditions \u201ccombined with pre-existing left knee osteoarthritis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">A few months after issuing the modified notice of acceptance, SAIF issued a denial of claimant\u2019s combined condition in which it specified that \u201cas of July 22, 2011, [claimant\u2019s] accepted injury is no longer the major contributing cause of [his] combined condition.\u201d SAIF also refused to pay for a diagnostic MRI that two of claimant\u2019s doctors recommended \u201cto make sure [claimant\u2019s] ACL is intact and to make sure [claimant] does not have a new injury.\u201d Claimant challenged both denials and the disputes were consolidated for hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">At the hearing, SAIF relied on a concurrence report<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in which Di Paola did not use the term \u201costeoarthritis\u201d but opined that claimant \u201chas a classic case of arthritis in his left knee involving the inflammation of one or more joints, due to infectious, metabolic, or constitutional causes, and resulting in breakdown, degeneration, or structural change.\u201d Claimant relied on the opinion of one of his other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>doctors, who opined that \u201costeoarthritis is considered a noninflammatory condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">The administrative law judge (ALJ) set aside both denials, but the board reversed. The board found that the medical evidence established \u201cthe presence of a statutory \u2018preexisting condition\u2019 (osteoarthritis),\u201d citing Di Paola\u2019s opinion, and that \u201cthe medical evidence establishes that the preexisting condition is the major contributing cause of the disability or need for treatment of [claimant\u2019s] combined knee condition.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) The board also upheld SAIF\u2019s denial of the diagnostic MRI because that medical service was not \u201cdirected to a medical condition caused in major part by the injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">On review, claimant challenges both rulings of the board. First, claimant argues that the board erred in accepting Di Paola\u2019s opinion as legally sufficient to meet SAIF\u2019s burden to prove that claimant suffers from a qualifying \u201cpreexisting condition\u201d that is the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s combined condition. Second, claimant contends that SAIF failed to prove a change in the causal relationship between claimant\u2019s compensable injury and the osteoarthritis after the date that the combined condition was accepted, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cthat the compensable injury has <em>ceased </em>to be the major contributing cause.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Finally, claimant argues that the board erred in evaluating the claim for medical services under the major contributing cause standard. We review the board\u2019s decision under the standard articulated in ORS 183.482(8)(c), under which we are directed to set aside or remand the order if we conclude that the board erroneously interpreted a provision of law or that the board\u2019s findings are not supported by substantial evidence. ORS 656.298(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">A. <em>Legal Sufficiency ofDi Paola\u2019s Opinion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">Claimant argues that the board erred in accepting Di Paola\u2019s opinion as proof that claimant\u2019s \u201costeoarthritis is a qualifying preexisting condition\u201d or that, \u201cas weighed against the osteoarthritis, the compensable injury is no longer the major contributing cause of the combined condition\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>because, according to claimant, Di Paola cannot \u201creasonably be interpreted\u201d as expressing either opinion. In reviewing the board\u2019s evaluation of expert medical opinions, our role \u201cis to determine whether the evaluation is supported by substantial evidence, that is, evidence that, considering the record as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make the findings.\u201d <em>Hutchings v. Amerigas Propane, </em>275 Or App 579, 595, 365 P3d 636 (2015), <em>rev den, </em>358 Or 833 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also SAIF v. Williams, </em>281 Or App 542, 548, 381 P3d 955 (2016) (emphasizing that, \u201c[o]n review of the board\u2019s evaluation of expert opinions, we do not substitute our judgment for that of the board; rather, we determine whether the board\u2019s evaluation of that evidence was reasonable\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). We conclude that the board\u2019s interpretation of Di Paola\u2019s opinion is reasonable in the context of the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">The premise of claimant\u2019s argument is narrow. He acknowledges that Di Paola\u2019s concurrence report offers his opinions that (1) claimant\u2019s otherwise compensable injury combined with a preexisting condition that meets the <em>Hopkins </em>criteria for qualifying preexisting \u201carthritis\u201d and (2) claimant\u2019s work injury was no longer the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s combined condition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, claimant emphasizes that the report expressing those opinions refers to claimant as suffering from preexisting \u201cdegenerative arthritis\u201d and \u201cchondromalacia\u201d and does not use the term \u201costeoarthritis.\u201d Claimant argues that the board, therefore, erred in interpreting Di Paola\u2019s opinion as addressing the \u201costeoarthritis\u201d condition that is at issue in SAIF\u2019s combined condition denial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-5\">1. <em>Di Paola\u2019s opinion as proof that \u201costeoarthritis\u201d is \u201carthritis\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">SAIF argues that the medical evidence as a whole supports the board\u2019s finding that Di Paola considered claimant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>\u201costeoarthritis\u201d to be synonymous with \u201carthritis\u201d and, thus, that Di Paola\u2019s description of claimant\u2019s degenerative knee condition as \u201ca classic case of arthritis\u201d involving \u201cinflammation of one or more joints\u201d was a description of claimant\u2019s \u201costeoarthritis\u201d condition. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">Over the years, Di Paola used varying terminology to refer to the preexisting state of claimant\u2019s knee, including \u201cdegenerative changes,\u201d \u201carthritic condition,\u201d \u201carthritis,\u201d \u201cchondromalacia,\u201d and \u201cend-stage osteoarthritis.\u201d Indeed, in a 2011 report, he used multiple terms in the same sentence, reporting that he had a \u201clengthy discussion\u201d with claimant about the \u201ccauses of knee arthritis\u201d and had advised claimant that \u201cthere is no evidence that\u201d the surgery he performed for claimant\u2019s meniscal tear \u201cmakes any material change in the relentlessly progressive degeneration of end-stage osteoarthritis.\u201d Thus, when Di Paola opined that claimant has \u201ca classic case of arthritis,\u201d satisfying the criteria for that label identified in <em>Hopkins, </em>the board could reasonably construe that opinion as referring to the preexisting condition that SAIF identified in the combined condition acceptances as \u201costeoarthritis.\u201d The board acknowledged that another doctor opined that \u201costeoarthritis is considered a non-inflammatory condition,\u201d but the board found that opinion to be less persuasive than Di Paola\u2019s \u201cthorough opinion\u201d because the other opinion was not explained.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">2. <em>Di Paola\u2019s opinion as evidence of causation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Claimant also contends that Di Paola\u2019s opinion fails to establish the causation element of SAIF\u2019s combined condition denial. When evaluating the compensability of a combined condition, the \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d analysis may include \u201conly those contributing factors that make up the combined condition itself, <em>i.e., </em>the otherwise compen-sable injury and the statutory preexisting condition.\u201d <em>Vigor Industrial, LLC v. Ayres, </em>257 Or App 795, 803, 310 P3d 674 (2013), <em>rev den, </em>355 Or 142 (2014). We will not give \u201cevi-dentiary weight\u201d to an expert opinion that fails to properly evaluate \u201cthe relative contribution of different causes.\u201d <em>SAIF v. Pruitt, </em>198 Or App 253, 258, 108 P3d 586 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Claimant emphasizes that Di Paola\u2019s report identifies claimant as also suffering from \u201cchondromalacia\u201d of the patellofemoral joint and the medial compartment of the left knee. Claimant argues that \u201cchomdomalacia\u201d is a different condition than arthritis. He also concludes from the discussion of \u201cchondromalacia\u201d existing in multiple areas of the knee that Di Paola improperly considered preexisting conditions in addition to the preexisting arthritis in evaluating the contributions to claimant\u2019s combined condition. However, Di Paola\u2019s reference to \u201cchondromalacia\u201d appears in a different portion of his report than does his discussion of the contributing causes of claimant\u2019s combined condition. In the portion of the report expressing his causation opinion, Di Paola compares only \u201cpreexisting degenerative arthritis\u201d and the \u201cwork injury.\u201d Thus, a reasonable person could evaluate Di Paola\u2019s opinion\u2014as the board did\u2014as properly comparing only the components of the accepted combined condition when he opined that claimant\u2019s \u201coriginal work injury combined with the preexisting degenerative arthritis\u201d and that, \u201cas of December 21, 2007, the work injury ceased to be the major contributing cause of the need for treatment.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">B. <em>Evidence that the Compensable Injury </em>Ceased <em>to be the Major Contributing Cause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Claimant next argues that SAIF failed to prove a \u201cchange\u201d in claimant\u2019s combined condition after the date that it became compensable, citing the requirement that we identified in <em>Oregon Drywall. </em>208 Or App at 208-09. SAIF does not dispute that it was obligated to prove a \u201cchange\u201d in claimant\u2019s combined condition, but it argues that the evidence establishes the requisite change. We agree with SAIF.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">As we explained in <em>Oregon Drywall, </em>the \u201ceffective date\u201d of the acceptance of a combined condition marks \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>baseline for determining whether a claimant\u2019s condition has subsequently changed so that the otherwise compensable injury is no longer the major contributing cause of the disability or need for treatment of the combined condition.\u201d 208 Or App at 210. Moreover, the \u201ceffective date\u201d means the date that \u201ccoincide [s] with compensability of the combined condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, SAIF\u2019s amended notice of acceptance clearly specified that it was accepting the combined condition \u201cas of\u2019 the date of the original 2005 injury, and claimant does not contend that the medical evidence supports any later date for the combining of his degenerative arthritis and the work injury. Di Paola opined in his concurrence report that the work injury \u201cwas initially the major contributing cause\u201d but had \u201cceased to be the major contributing cause,\u201d and the board found that opinion to be persuasive. In crediting Di Paola\u2019s opinion, the board necessarily found that claimant\u2019s combined condition changed after the effective date of the acceptance, and substantial evidence supports that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">Although claimant points to two exhibits that, he argues, undermine a finding that his condition changed after the effective date of acceptance, we do not share claimant\u2019s understanding of that evidence. First, claimant construes a stipulation that the parties entered to resolve his aggravation claim as an agreement that claimant\u2019s combined condition claim was accepted as a \u201cnew\u201d condition, <em>i.e., </em>arising after the original injury. However, the stipulation merely recites, historically, that \u201cSAIF reopened the claim as a combined condition as of October 27, 2005,\u201d because the medical evidence indicated \u201cthat a new condition needed to be accepted.\u201d The stipulation does not have the significance that claimant ascribes to it. Second, claimant contends that the board\u2019s construction of Di Paola\u2019s concurrence report is inconsistent with a closing examination report that Di Paola prepared the same month, which opines that claimant had objective \u201cfindings of impairment\u201d that were \u201c[o]ne hundred percent (100%) *** due to the industrial injury.\u201d In claimant\u2019s view, the report suggests that Di Paola believed that claimant\u2019s work injury continues to be the major contributing cause of his combined condition. But claimant does not explain, and we cannot discern, why attributing 100 percent of claimant\u2019s impairment to the compensable injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>contradicts Di Paola\u2019s opinion that claimant\u2019s work injury ceased to be the major contributing cause of the combined condition. The report clearly specifies that \u201cno combined conditions\u201d were affecting claimant\u2019s impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">C. <em>The Medical Services Denial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Claimant\u2019s final challenge is to the board\u2019s conclusion that the major contributing cause standard governs whether the diagnostic left knee MRI is a compensable medical service. The board recited\u2014without analysis\u2014that, because claimant has a \u201ccombined condition,\u201d the medical services dispute is governed by \u201cthe second sentence of ORS 656.245(l)(a),\u201d <em>i.e., </em>by \u201cwhether claimant\u2019s proposed MRI is a medical service directed to a medical condition caused in major part by the injury.\u201d Claimant argues, however, that the board should have applied the material contributing cause standard, regardless of its conclusion that SAIF proved a combined condition. He points out that the ALJ found \u201cthat claimant\u2019s MRI was for conditions caused in material part by the injury.\u201d As claimant argued to the board, \u201cmaterial cause\u201d is the correct standard because \u201c[c]laimant still has an accepted claim for his knee injury and miniscal tear. The medical evidence indicates that it is necessitated by the work injury.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">We agree with claimant, in part; if the diagnostic medical service was directed to one of the originally accepted conditions, then claimant only needed to prove that the service was directed to a condition caused in material part by the injury. Insurers \u201care responsible for medical services \u2018for\u2019 conditions\u2014that is, ordinary \u2018conditions\u2019\u2014that are \u2018caused in material part\u2019 by compensable workplace injuries.\u201d <em>SAIF v. Sprague, </em>346 Or 661, 664, 217 P3d 644 (2009) (quoting ORS 656.245(l)(a)). That portion of ORS 656.245(l)(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-7\">\u201cFor every compensable injury, the insurer or the self-insured employer shall cause to be provided medical services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>for conditions caused in material part by the injury for such period as the nature of the injury or the process of the recovery requires!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">However, the statute sets a different standard for combined conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-5\">\u201cIn addition, for consequential[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] and combined conditions described in ORS 656.005(7), the insurer or the self-insured employer shall cause to be provided only those medical services directed to medical conditions caused in major part by the injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">ORS 656.245(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">In <em>Sprague, </em>on which claimant relies, the court explained that the compensability of a requested medical service for gastric bypass surgery should be determined by first considering the condition that the medical service was \u201cdirected to.\u201d 346 Or at 673. Because the relevant condition in <em>Sprague </em>was a \u201cconsequential\u201d arthritis condition, the court held that compensability was governed by the \u201ccaused in major part\u201d test for consequential and combined conditions. <em>Id. </em>at 672-73. <em>Sprague </em>ultimately focuses on whether the claimant needed to prove that the compensable injury was the major contributing cause of the need for surgery or only of the condition to which the surgery was \u201cdirected,\u201d and concludes that the latter is the correct focus. <em>Id. </em>at 674. Thus, <em>Sprague </em>does not resolve claimant\u2019s contention that the \u201cmaterial\u201d contributing cause standard may continue to apply to some medical services disputes when the insurer has accepted both ordinary conditions and a combined (or consequential) condition. Nevertheless, <em>Sprague\u2019s </em>construction of ORS 656.245(l)(a) is consistent with claimant\u2019s argument that compensability of a medical service is governed by the causation standard that applies to the condition that a particular service is \u201cdirected to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">Claimant also relies on <em>SAIF v. Carlos-Macias, </em>262 Or App 629, 633, 325 P3d 827 (2014), in which we affirmed a board decision that the employer was responsible for medical services \u201caimed at determining the \u2018extent\u2019 of claimant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>injury\u201d to his shoulder, even though SAIF had denied that the claimant\u2019s current shoulder complaints were caused by his accepted conditions. We explained that \u201cthe board correctly pointed out that the \u2018issue of whether the proposed diagnostic procedures are necessary to determine the extent of the compensable injury is different from the issue of whether the current left shoulder condition is compensa-ble.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 637. Although <em>Carlos-Macios </em>did not involve a combined condition or consider whether the major contributing cause standard applied to the claim for medical services, it supports claimant\u2019s argument that the issue of whether the proposed diagnostic MRI is necessary to determine the extent of his compensable injury is separate from the issue of whether his combined condition is currently compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-3\">More significantly, the text of ORS 656.245(l)(a) indicates that claimant\u2019s construction is correct. The statute specifies that, \u201cfor consequential and combined conditions,\u201d the insurer only needs to pay for medical services \u201cdirected to medical conditions caused in major part by the injury.\u201d It also specifies that that standard is \u201c[i]n addition\u201d to the obligation to \u201cprovide medical services for conditions caused in material part by the injury.\u201d Based on the provisions of ORS 656.245(l)(a) as a whole, and as that statute was construed in <em>Sprague </em>and <em>Carlos-Macias, </em>we conclude that the presence of a combined or consequential condition does not eliminate the insurer\u2019s obligation to pay for medical services directed to other compensable conditions that are caused in material part by the injury. Rather, the governing causation standard depends on whether the medical services are directed to either a combined or consequential condition. If the services are directed to a condition that is not a consequential or combined condition, then the relevant inquiry is whether the condition to which the services are directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>is caused in material part by the compensable injury. The board erred in presuming that, because SAIF proved that claimant has a combined condition, compensability of the diagnostic medical service is governed by the major contributing cause standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Although SAIF argues that the purpose of the MRI was \u201cmerely to determine whether claimant\u2019s overall degenerative joint disease has progressed to the point that knee replacement surgery is medically appropriate,\u201d there is evidence to the contrary. In addition to the combined condition involving claimant\u2019s degenerative arthritis, SAIF accepted a medial meniscus tear and medial collateral ligament sprain related to claimant\u2019s 2005 industrial injury, and those conditions remain compensable. <em>See South Lane County Sch. Dist. #45-J3 v. Arms, </em>186 Or App 361, 367, 62 P3d 882, <em>rev den, </em>74 P3d 112 (2003) (explaining that a denial of the continuing compensability of a combined condition is not a denial of the underlying accepted injury, which remains compen-sable). Indeed, Di Paola\u2019s closing report, written after the combined condition ceased to be compensable, is evidence that the underlying accepted conditions continue to cause symptoms that are distinguishable from the combined or preexisting condition. In that report, Di Paola identifies objective findings of impairment that he opined are due \u201c100%\u201d to \u201cthe industrial injury\u201d with no contribution from either \u201cany preexisting condition\u201d or from \u201ccombined conditions.\u201d In addition, the ALJ found that two doctors \u201chave indicated that the MRI was necessitated in material part by claimant\u2019s October 27, 2005 injury and was a diagnostic medical service that will assist in determining the extent of claimant\u2019s October 27, 2005 work injury.\u201d The board did not address the factual issue of whether the MRI is \u201cdirected to\u201d the combined condition or to another condition caused in material part by the compensable injury. Because resolution of that factual dispute will determine which causation standard governs the medical services dispute, we remand for the board to resolve that dispute in a manner consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Reversed and remanded as to claim for medical services; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-7\"> The opinion is presented as a detailed summary prepared by an attorney for SAIF, which Di Paola confirmed \u201caccurately reflects\u201d his opinion. We refer to it as a \u201cconcurrence report\u201d to distinguish it from Di Paola\u2019s earlier, less comprehensive, reports.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b110-8\"> Citing similar acknowledgments by claimant below, SAIF contends that claimant failed to preserve his argument that SAIF failed to meet its burden of proof. We disagree and reject SAIF\u2019s preservation argument without further written discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b112-7\"> Apart from claimant\u2019s challenge that Di Paola\u2019s opinion is legally insufficient, he does not challenge the board\u2019s acceptance of Di Paola\u2019s opinion over other, conflicting medical opinions. And there would be no basis for such a challenge. <em>See Pruitt, </em>198 Or App at 258 (emphasizing that, when the board chooses between conflicting medical evidence, apart from medical opinions that are not entitled to evidentiary weight, \u201cwe will reverse the board \u2018only when the credible evidence apparently weighs overwhelmingly in favor of one finding and the Board finds the other without giving a persuasive explanation\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Armstrong v. Asten-Hill Co., </em>90 Or App 200, 206, 752 P2d 312 (1988)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b114-9\"> Once a worker\u2019s claim has been closed, an insurer\u2019s obligation to pay for medical services is limited, but specifically includes \u201c[s]ervices that are necessary to diagnose the worker\u2019s condition.\u201d ORS 656.245(l)(c)(H).
