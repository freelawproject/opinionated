Premo, </em>355 Or 543, 326 P3d 1177 (2014); <em>Longo v. Premo, </em>355 Or 525, 326 P3d 1152 (2014) (analyzing OEC 504(4)(c)\u2019s breach of duty exception to attorney-client privilege and concluding that a protective order may be necessary in a post-conviction case to prevent disclosure of privileged information to third parties). Petitioner contends, in part, that the post-conviction court had no jurisdiction to enter an order denying the motion because an appeal from a previous order denying the same request was pending at the time the trial court ruled.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, petitioner asserts, jurisdiction \u201cwas vested in this court, not the trial court.\u201d The superintendent, for his part, agrees with petitioner that the post-conviction court lacked jurisdiction to issue the June 2016 order underlying this appeal: \u201cThe post-conviction court had decided the same issue twice before; because those prior orders were subject to pending appeals, the post-conviction court lacked jurisdiction over the cause, and had no authority to revisit its prior rulings.\u201d We agree with the parties that because, at the time the order was entered, an appeal was pending regarding an earlier order of the post-conviction court denying petitioner\u2019s request for a protective order, the post-conviction court lacked jurisdiction to enter the June 21, 2016, order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>ORS 19.270(1)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; <em>Koller v.
