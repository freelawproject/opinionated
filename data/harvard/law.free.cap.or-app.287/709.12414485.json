J.</author> <p id=\"b731-4\" pgmap=\"731\">Petitioner was convicted of aggravated murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He seeks review of an order of the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision following a hearing held on July 18, 2012. ORS 163.105(2). In that order, the board found that petitioner had not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that he was likely to be rehabilitated within a reasonable period of time, and the board declined to change petitioner\u2019s terms of confinement to allow the possibility of parole or work release. The board also determined that, because it was not reasonable to expect petitioner to be granted a change in terms of confinement within four years, petitioner should not be granted another hearing before then. On review, petitioner contends that the board\u2019s findings are not supported by substantial evidence and its ultimate conclusion is not supported by substantial reason. ORS 183.482(8)(c). Petitioner also contends that the board erred when it deferred his next murder review hearing for four years because the determination was based on findings that were not supported by substantial evidence or substantial reason. OAR 255-032-0035.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm.</p> <p id=\"b732-3\" pgmap=\"732(95) 733(86)\">We begin by reviewing for substantial evidence the board\u2019s findings in relation to the criteria under OAR 255-032-0020 relating to whether petitioner was likely to be rehabilitated in a reasonable time.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cOn substantial evidence review, we must determine whether a reasonable person could make the findings that the board made, ORS 183.482(8)(c), and we do not substitute our own view of the evidence for the board\u2019s view of the evidence.\u201d Dixon v. Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision, 257 Or App 273, 278, 306 P3d 716, rev den, 354 Or 389 (2013); see ORS 183.482(8)(c) (\u201cSubstantial evidence exists to support a finding of fact when the record, viewed as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make that finding\u201d). Under ORS 163.105(2)(a) it is petitioner\u2019s burden to prove that he is capable of rehabilitation in a reasonable time. Therefore, \u201cwe examine the record to determine if there was substantial evidence for a reasonable person to conclude that petitioner did not meet his burden,\u201d i.e., substantial evidence for the board\u2019s contrary decision. Dixon, 257 Or App at 279.</p> <p id=\"b733-4\" pgmap=\"733\">First, petitioner challenges the board\u2019s findings under the fourth factor, regarding the \u201cinmate\u2019s maturity, stability, demonstrated responsibility, and any apparent development in the inmate personality which may promote or hinder conformity to law.\u201d OAR 255-032-0020(4). He disputes the board\u2019s factual findings that he demonstrated a lack of empathy or remorse, exhibited a lack of insight and sensitivity, exhibited \u201ca high level of criminal thinking errors,\u201d and failed to accept responsibility for his crime, \u201cincluding the uncontroverted history of domestic violence with [the victim].\u201d Petitioner contends that there is no evidence to support those findings given the contrary evidence in the record. He suggests that he expressed remorse at the hearing, and that his psychologists acknowledged his remorse and acceptance of responsibility in their evaluations. He also disputes that there is evidence in the record to support the board\u2019s negative characterization of his donation in the victim\u2019s name and a gift he gave to his daughters years ago. Petitioner contends that he acknowledged the pattern of domestic violence against the victim and has addressed it with his psychologists.</p> <p id=\"b733-5\" pgmap=\"733(106) 734(105)\">Petitioner is incorrect to suggest that, because there is evidence of his remorse and acceptance of responsibility, the board\u2019s contrary findings are not supported by substantial evidence. See Weems/Roberts v. Board of Parole, 347 Or 586, 602-03, 227 P3d 671 (2010) (\u201cThe fact that a reasonable person could also draw a contrary inference, or that reasonable persons might differ in their assessment of the strength of the inference * * * does not mean that the board\u2019s implicit finding in that regard is not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d). The board\u2019s findings could reasonably be made from evidence in the record, including petitioner\u2019s testimony and demeanor at the hearing. The board made findings that petitioner \u201cdemonstrated a marked lack of empathy and remorse [.] \u201d It found that he displayed a cold demeanor and had a self-centered \u201corientation\u201d at the hearing. The board found that he showed his selfish and entitled attitude when he persisted in \u201cparading\u201d the victim\u2019s name in connection with donations that he has made, despite prior warnings from the board at his previous hearing that such actions were offensive, and when he gave a proud account of using deceit to give his daughters gifts despite their firm intentions to have no relationship with him.</p> <p id=\"b734-4\" pgmap=\"734\">Petitioner\u2019s argument is based in part on his psychologists\u2019 conclusions that he exhibited remorse and accepted responsibility\u2014conclusions that the board could, and did, reasonably find were unreliable due to significant inconsistencies between the psychologists\u2019 accounts of the murder and information from other sources, including a post-sentence report done by the Department of Corrections in 1990.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although petitioner\u2019s prison counselor, Dr. Newman, stated in his letter that petitioner \u201chas constantly confessed guilt and taken total responsibility for the horrific consequences of his actions resulting in the death of his wife,\u201d the board could reasonably find, based on evidence at the hearing including petitioner\u2019s testimony, that he had not, in fact, done so. The board could reasonably find that there were inaccuracies in the psychologists\u2019 reports based on petitioner\u2019s false statements, misrepresentations, and mini-mizations that the psychologists took at face value.</p> <p id=\"b734-5\" pgmap=\"734(54) 735(96)\">The board could also reasonably find that petitioner had \u201cfailed to accept responsibility for the full range of his criminal behavior, including the uncontroverted history of domestic violence with\u201d the victim, that petitioner lacked insight, and that petitioner had, \u201c[t]o a substantial degree, * * * disassociated himself from the murder\u201d and sees \u201cthe spectrum of intimate partner violence that he perpetrated as separate from who he is.\u201d Those findings are supported by evidence in the record, in particular petitioner\u2019s testimony at the hearing, in which he failed to recognize that the murder was part of a pattern of domestic violence that he perpetrated against the victim. That pattern included previous assaults, death threats, and, after the victim had obtained a restraining order, a kidnapping that involved a firearm. Petitioner intimated that he does not or will not need domestic violence treatment unless he is in a future relationship.</p> <p id=\"b735-4\" pgmap=\"735(176) 736(30)\">Next, petitioner challenges the board\u2019s findings under the eighth factor, involving whether he has \u201ca mental or emotional disturbance, deficiency, condition or disorder predisposing [him] to the commission of a crime to a degree rendering [him] a danger to the health and safety of the community.\u201d OAR 255-032-0020(8). He contends that the board erred when it rejected the opinions of two psychologists and pointed to no affirmative evidence that petitioner has any such deficiency.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the psychologists gave reports generally favorable to petitioner, one of them, Dr. Colistro, testified at the hearing about petitioner\u2019s narcissism and pride and his need for continued treatment. Specifically, Dr. Colistro testified that petitioner is narcissistic and that, if petitioner were to be released, he would recommend counseling specifically focusing on his narcissism. He further testified about the link between petitioner\u2019s pride and his crime, noting that \u201cif he had been a humble man on that night, we wouldn\u2019t be sitting here[.]\u201d The board may rely on some aspects of expert testimony without being required to accept other aspects of the opinions expressed. Thus, Dr. Colistro\u2019s testimony together with other evidence in the record provides substantial evidence for the board\u2019s findings under this factor.</p> <p id=\"b736-3\" pgmap=\"736\">Next, petitioner contends that the board erred in applying the ninth factor, which concerns \u201c[t]he adequacy of the inmate\u2019s parole plan including community support from family, friends, treatment providers, and others in the community; type of residence, neighborhood or community in which the inmate plans to live.\u201d OAR 255-032-0020(9). With respect to that factor, the board\u2019s order states, \u201cOffender\u2019s parole plans are inadequate and do not demonstrate forethought or the intent to be self-reliant. After 23 years of incarceration, offender is proposing to reenter the community on subsidy and with just under $1,000 in savings.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b736-4\" pgmap=\"736\">Petitioner first argues that the board erred by focusing \u201csolely on the amount of money petitioner has in his inmate account.\u201d (Emphasis by petitioner.) Although the board referred to the amount in petitioner\u2019s savings account, we do not understand the board to have focused \u201csolely\u201d on the issue of petitioner\u2019s savings. The board\u2019s order expressly refers to the lack of \u201cforethought\u201d and \u201cintent to be self-reliant\u201d\u2014issues that were discussed in depth at the hearing and ranged well beyond the matter of his savings account. Read in the context of the order as a whole, and the proceedings more generally, we understand the reference to petitioner\u2019s account to have been illustrative of the inadequacy of his parole plan and not, as petitioner contends, the sole deficiency.</p> <p id=\"b736-5\" pgmap=\"736(104) 737(17)\">Petitioner further argues that \u201c[t]he board\u2019s conclusion that petitioner\u2019s parole plans fail to demonstrate self-reliance, in light of his extensive employment history and family support upon release, is not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d We disagree. Notwithstanding the evidence favorable to petitioner, such as skills learned in prison, there was sufficient evidence in the record\u2014including but not limited to petitioner\u2019s lack of savings, and his proposal to reenter the community based on food stamps and other subsidies\u2014 from which the board could have found as it did with regard to his intent to be self-reliant. See Dixon, 257 Or App at 278 (\u201c[W]e do not substitute our own view of the evidence for the board\u2019s view of the evidence.\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b737-4\" pgmap=\"737\">Next, petitioner challenges the board\u2019s finding under the tenth factor, \u201cthat there is no reasonable probability that the offender would remain in the community without violating the law and that there is no substantial likelihood that offender would conform to the conditions of parole.\u201d The board based its finding on \u201cthe reasons discussed above\u201d under the other factors. Petitioner argues that the board could not reasonably make this finding when he had no negative disciplinary history during his 23 years of incarceration, had the support of family upon release, had reports from psychologists concluding that he would not violate the law and would conform to the conditions of parole, and \u201chad no significant criminal convictions before the murder.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b737-5\" pgmap=\"737\">We conclude, however, that there is substantial evidence for the board\u2019s finding based on evidence including petitioner\u2019s lack of insight, empathy, or remorse, his minimization of the crime, his failure to accept responsibility for the full extent of his criminal behavior, and his failure to address or have a plan to address his domestic violence issues. As noted, the board reasonably determined that petitioner\u2019s psychologists\u2019 conclusions were unreliable, and it did not accept them. Petitioner claims that his lack of other significant criminal convictions undercuts the board\u2019s finding. However, petitioner fails to mention his history of domestic violence that includes one assault in which the victim was knocked unconscious, a kidnapping involving a firearm and a death threat, and at least one documented violation of a restraining order. The board was particularly concerned about that history at the hearing, and its relationship to petitioner\u2019s crime.</p> <p id=\"b737-6\" pgmap=\"737(35) 738(96)\">Taken together, the four factors, supported by substantial evidence, support the board\u2019s ultimate conclusion, that petitioner failed to prove that he is likely to be rehabilitated within a reasonable time. Petitioner recognizes that the board relied on the four factors discussed above, but disagrees with the board\u2019s conclusion that the evidence shows that those factors \u201cweigh so heavily against offender.\u201d As noted, however, the board\u2019s findings properly concern and determine petitioner\u2019s likelihood of rehabilitation. The board \u201cis not required to rely on all of the criteria set out in OAR 255-032-0020 to support its ultimate conclusion, so long as that conclusion is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Dixon, 257 Or App at 281 n 4. For our part, reweighing the evidence would be impermissible given our standard of review.</p> <p id=\"b738-3\" pgmap=\"738\">There is substantial reason for the board\u2019s order because it \u201carticulates the reasoning that leads from the facts found to the conclusions drawn.\u201d Dixon, 257 Or App at 286 (internal quotation marks omitted). We do not consider this to be a case in which \u201cthe evidence weighs overwhelmingly in petitioner\u2019s favor.\u201d Id. at 288. There was certainly evidence in petitioner\u2019s favor, such as his participation in programs during incarceration, steady employment, support from family, and lack of disciplinary history. But, there was also much evidence weighing against petitioner. The board adequately explained the connection between the facts that it found and its conclusion that petitioner had not met his burden.</p> <p id=\"b738-4\" pgmap=\"738(138) 739(28)\">In his second assignment of error, petitioner contends that the board erred when it deferred his next murder review hearing for four years under OAR 255-32-0035 on the grounds that the determination was based on findings that were not supported by substantial evidence or substantial reason. We do not reach the merits of petitioner\u2019s argument for procedural reasons. As it happens, petitioner has now received the murder review hearing that he contends he should have received earlier.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because our resolution of petitioner\u2019s second assignment of error would have no practical effect, we decline to address it. See Atkinson v. Board of Parole, 280 Or App 410, 426, 382 P3d 567 (2016), rev den, 360 Or 851 (2017) (concluding that, even if the board erred in setting the petitioner\u2019s parole-release date too far in the future, his challenge was moot because \u201cpetitioner already ha[d] received the only relief to which he would be entitled if his view were to prevail on judicial review\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b739-4\" pgmap=\"739\">In sum, the board\u2019s order was supported by substantial evidence and substantial reason. That order properly determined that petitioner did not meet his burden to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he was likely to be rehabilitated within a reasonable period of time.</p> <p id=\"b739-5\" pgmap=\"739\">Affirmed.</p> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b731-5\" pgmap=\"731\"> All citations to ORS 163.105 are to the version in effect when defendant committed his crime in 1989.

We reject that argument without written discussion. See Morrison v. Board of Parole, 277 Or App 861, 866, 374 P3d 948, rev den, 360 Or 465 (2016) (rejecting the petitioner\u2019s ex post facto challenge when the board made him ineligible for his next parole consideration hearing for six years even though the statute in effect at the time he committed his crime only permitted two years of ineligibility).</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"3\"> <p id=\"b732-6\" pgmap=\"732\"> This rule lists ten factors that the board may assess in determining whether an inmate is likely to be rehabilitated in a reasonable time.

Because the board began by expressly making a finding that paraphrased and cited OAR 255-032-0020(8), and cited the same factor immediately after the later finding, we understand the board to have made a finding under OAR 255-032-0020(8)\u2014the factor that it cited and had been discussing.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"6\"> <p id=\"b737-7\" pgmap=\"737\"> Petitioner challenges the factual support for the board\u2019s finding that he lacked an intent to be self-reliant, but he does not dispute the relevancy of that fact to the inquiry under OAR 255-032-0020(9).
