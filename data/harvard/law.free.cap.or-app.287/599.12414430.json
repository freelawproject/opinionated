Williams, </em>357 Or 1, 346 P3d 455 (2015), which was decided after defendant filed his opening brief, but before the state filed its answering brief. The state relied on <em>Williams </em>in its brief, but defendant did not file a reply brief or a supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Because defendant\u2019s petition for reconsideration is based on a contention that was not, but could have been, raised in defendant\u2019s appellate briefing, we deny defendant\u2019s petition. <em>See Kinross Copper Corp. v. State of Oregon, </em>163 Or App 357, 360, 988 P2d 400 (1999), <em>rev den, </em>330 Or 71 (2000) (generally, \u201c[i]f a contention was not raised in the brief, * * * it is not appropriate to assert it on reconsideration\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Petition for reconsideration denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
