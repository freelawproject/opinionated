J.</author>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Defendant appeals from a judgment of conviction for two counts of unlawfully obtaining public assistance, ORS 411.630(1), one count of unlawfully obtaining supplemental nutrition assistance (food stamps), ORS 411.840(1), one count of first-degree theft, ORS 164.055 (l)(a), and one count of unsworn falsification, ORS 162.085(1). Defendant raises two assignments of error, the first of which we reject without discussion. We write only to address defendant\u2019s second assignment of error, in which he argues that the trial court erred when it disallowed his demurrer to the indictment. We conclude that the court\u2019s disallowance of the demurrer was harmless. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The facts of this case are not in dispute. Defendant worked as a police officer for the City of Beaverton. In January 2011, defendant was fired from the Beaverton Police Department and then he was rehired in October 2011. While defendant was unemployed, he received public assistance and food stamps from the State of Oregon.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An investigation by the Department of Human Services (DHS) led DHS to believe that defendant had received $3,351.11 in public benefits to which he was not entitled. The investigation revealed that defendant had lied on forms to obtain those public benefits and that defendant had also failed to report income. Defendant was indicted for various crimes related to his receipt of public benefits. The indictment alleged as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">\u201cCount 1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">\u201cThe defendant, on or between January 27, 2011 and December 31, 2011, in Washington County, Oregon, did unlawfully and knowingly obtain public assistance for the benefit of himself and others to which the said defendant was not entitled under Oregon Law by means of false representation, to wit: his residence address.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>\u201cCount 2</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-4\">\u201cThe defendant, on or between October 1, 2011 and December 31, 2011, in Washington County, Oregon, did unlawfully and knowingly obtain public assistance for the benefit of himself and others to which the said defendant was not entitled under Oregon Law by means of failing to immediately notify the Department of Human Services or the Oregon Health Authority of the receipt of income, which directly affected his eligibility for the assistance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">\u201cCount 3</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">\u201cThe defendant, on or between January 27, 2011 and December 31, 2011, in Washington County, Oregon, did unlawfully and knowingly obtain supplemental nutritional assistance to which he was not entitled to receive under Oregon law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">\u201cCount 4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">\u201cThe defendant, on or between January 27, 2011 and December 31, 2011, in Washington County, Oregon, did unlawfully and knowingly commit theft of money, of the value of one thousand dollars or more, the property of the State of Oregon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">\u00ab\u215c \u2021\u215c\u2021\u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-10\">\u201cCount 7</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-11\">\u201cThe defendant, on or about October 24, 2011, in Washington County, Oregon, did unlawfully and knowingly make a false written statement, to wit: City of Beaverton Affidavit of Marriage or Domestic Partnership, to a public servant in connection with an application for a benefit.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">Defendant filed a \u201cdemurrer to the indictment for violation of ORS 132.560,\u201d arguing that \u201cORS 135.630 requires dismissal of an accusatory instrument \u2018when it appears on the face thereof that the instrument fails to comply with ORS 132.560.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant stated that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>indictment merely lists each offense using the words of the statute without stating that the various charges are sufficiently similar or connected\u201d and, thus, \u201cthe indictment on its face fails to meet the joinder requirements of ORS 132.560(l)(b)The state responded, contending that \u201call seven counts are involved with using some false or fraudulent methodology to obtain benefits\u201d so the counts \u201care enough of a same or similar character to allow for joinder\u201d under ORS 132.560(l)(b)(A). The trial court agreed with the state and disallowed defendant\u2019s demurrer. Following a jury trial, as noted, defendant was convicted of two counts of unlawfully obtaining public assistance, one count of unlawfully obtaining food stamps, one count of first-degree theft, and one count of unsworn falsification.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">On appeal, defendant argues that, \u201c[a]pplying ORS 132.560 and <em>[State </em>v.] <em>Poston[, </em>277 Or App 137, 370 P3d 904 (2016), <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>285 Or App 750 (2017)], the charges in this case could not be properly combined into a single accusatory instrument\u201d because, \u201cas explained in <em>Poston, </em>the connection between the offenses must be expressly alleged.\u201d Defendant contends that, \u201c [i]n particular, count four, theft, alleging the theft of more than $1000 and no other details about the state\u2019s theory, cannot be joined for trial with allegations of unlawfully obtaining public assistance or unsworn falsification\u201d because \u201c[t]he offenses are not of the same or similar character.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The state argues that the charges of unlawfully obtaining public benefits (Counts 1,2, and 3), and the charge of unsworn falsification to a public servant in connection with an application for a benefit, (Count 7) \u201cobviously are of the \u2018same or similar character.\u2019\u201d Additionally, the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>contends that, when viewed in context with those charges, the theft charge (Count 4) is of the same or similar character because \u201cthat count further specially alleged that the crime involved \u2018theft of money, of the value of one thousand dollars or more, the property of the State of Oregon.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">In <em>Poston, </em>we held that the state is \u201crequired to allege in the charging instrument the basis for joinder of the crimes that are charged in it, whether by alleging the basis for joinder in the language of the joinder statute or by alleging facts sufficient to establish compliance with the joinder statute.\u201d 277 Or App at 144-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">In this case, the indictment does not include language from the joinder statute. We agree with the state that the facts alleged in the indictment for the charges of unlawfully obtaining public benefits, and the charge of unsworn falsification to a public servant in connection with an application for any benefit, establish that they are of \u201cthe same or similar character.\u201d ORS 132.560(l)(b)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Assuming without deciding that alleging the theft \u201cof money\u201d from the State of Oregon is insufficient to establish that the charge of first-degree theft is of \u201cthe same or similar character\u201d as the charges related to unlawfully obtaining public benefits and unsworn falsification as specified in Counts 1, 2, 3, and 7, we nonetheless conclude that any such error in joining the charges on that basis is harmless. \u201cUnder Article VII (Amended), section 3, of the Oregon Constitution/<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we must affirm a conviction if there is little likelihood that an error affected the verdict.\u201d <em>Poston, </em>277 Or App at 145 (citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted); <em>see also State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003) (\u201cOregon\u2019s constitutional test for affirmance despite error consists of a single inquiry: Is there little likelihood that the particular error affected the verdict?\u201d). \u201c[WJhet-her improper joinder of charges affected the verdict depends on whether joinder led to the admission of evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>would not have been admissible but for the joinder * * * and, if so, whether that evidence affected the verdict on those charges.\u201d <em>Poston, </em>277 Or App at 145. That analysis requires us to examine the erroneously joined charges as if they had been tried separately and determine whether \u201c[a] 11 of the evidence that was presented at defendant\u2019s trial would have been admissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-4\"><em>\u201cPoston </em>demonstrates that evidence presented at trial on erroneously joined charges would be \u2018admissible,\u2019 as we used that term in <em>Poston, </em>in a hypothetical trial on each charge or properly joined group of charges, only when (1) each item of evidence that was actually presented could have been admitted in the hypothetical trial under a legally correct evidentiary analysis and (2) it is implausible that, had the defendant objected under OEC 403 or raised some other objection invoking the trial court\u2019s discretion, the trial court would have excluded that evidence in the hypothetical trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-5\"><em>State v. Clardy, </em>286 Or App 745, 772-73, 401 P3d 1188 (2017).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Here, the state argues that any such error is harmless because \u201call of the charges were based on the same set of operative <em>facts\u2014i.e., </em>that [defendant] unlawfully obtained various financial benefits from the state by means of false representations.\u201d We agree. We have determined that all of the evidence that was presented at defendant\u2019s trial would have been \u201cadmissible\u201d under a legally correct evidentiary analysis at a trial in which defendant was charged only with first-degree theft. Furthermore, it is implausible that the trial court would have excluded that evidence on a discretionary ground. Likewise, all of the evidence presented at defendant\u2019s trial would have been \u201cadmissible\u201d in a trial in which defendant was charged only with unlawfully obtaining public assistance, unlawfully obtaining supplemental nutrition assistance, and unsworn falsification. Thus, the court\u2019s disallowance of the demurrer was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-8\"> ORS 411.630 prohibits a person from obtaining public assistance to which the person is not entitled to receive and ORS 411.840 prohibits a person from obtaining food stamps which the person is not entitled to receive.
