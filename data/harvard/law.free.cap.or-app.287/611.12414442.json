J.</author>\n<p id=\"b633-3\">Defendant appeals his judgment of conviction for murder constituting domestic violence, ORS 163.115. At issue in this appeal is whether defendant equivocally invoked his right to counsel under Article I, section 12, of the Oregon Constitution during a custodial interview and, if he did, whether the interviewing officers clarified whether defendant meant to invoke his right to counsel. The trial court ruled that statements that defendant made in the interview were admissible upon determining that defendant did not invoke his right to counsel when, immediately after officers read defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights and asked him if he understood them, he responded by asking \u201cWhere\u2019s the lawyer?\u201d Defendant assigns error to that ruling. For the reasons explained below, we conclude that defendant, contrary to the state\u2019s position, preserved his appellate argument and, at the very least, that defendant equivocally invoked his right to counsel. We also conclude that the interviewing officers failed to clarify the intent of defendant\u2019s statement, thereby rendering his subsequent statements to police inadmissible. Further, admission of the statements was not harmless. Consequently, we reverse and remand, and need not reach defendant\u2019s remaining assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">We review for legal error whether defendant\u2019s statement was an equivocal invocation of his right to counsel. <em>State v. Nichols, </em>361 Or 101, 106, 390 P3d 1001 (2017). We limit our discussion of the circumstances of defendant\u2019s statement and the interview to the record developed at the pretrial hearing, <em>State v. Pitt, </em>352 Or 566, 575, 293 P3d 1002 (2012),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of what transpired during the custodial interrogation that are supported by evidence in the record, <em>State v. Avila-Nava, </em>356 Or 600, 609, 341 P3d 714 (2014). Consistent with that standard, we set out the facts below.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Before trial, the state moved to schedule a pretrial hearing on whether statements defendant made during a May 12, 2012, custodial interview in which defendant asked \u201cWhere\u2019s the lawyer?\u201d\u2014as well as other statements made to officers by defendant on the night of the victim\u2019s death and at other times before the May 12 custodial interview\u2014were in violation of defendant\u2019s right to assistance of counsel during a custodial interview. The pretrial hearing concerning the admissibility of the May 12 statements occurred during a lengthy \u201comnibus\u201d hearing, which was intended to resolve several legal and procedural issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\">Detectives Anderson and Rau were the officers who interviewed defendant on May 12 and were the last officers to testify during the <em>Miranda </em>portion of the omnibus hearing. As to the May 12 interview, which occurred on a Saturday, Rau testified that defendant had been arrested the day before and was in police custody and, knowing that defendant would be arraigned on Monday, the detectives wanted to ask defendant a \u201chandful\u201d of questions. It was Rau\u2019s experience that, \u201cafter people are arraigned,\u201d there is not \u201canymore room for interviews.\u201d The detectives recorded the interview. Rau first read defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Rau then asked defendant if he understood each of the rights that had been explained to him. Defendant responded, \u201cWhere\u2019s the lawyer?\u201d Rau asked defendant, \u201cHave you got a lawyer? Have you hired a lawyer?\u201d Defendant answered \u201cNo\u201d and said that he could not afford one. Rau told defendant, \u201cYou\u2019ll be appointed an attorney if you can\u2019t afford one,\u201d and indicated that the appointment would occur at his arraignment on Monday. Anderson followed up by asking defendant, \u201cDo you understand your rights?\u201d and inquiring whether defendant was willing to speak with the detectives. Defendant answered, \u201cYes, absolutely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">In particular relevance to our discussion of preservation below, the following exchange occurred during defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Rau:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: When [defendant] said, All right, where\u2019s the lawyer,\u2019 you had a decision to make how to respond to that, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">\u201c[RAU]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And you asked him, \u2018Did you call one already?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-3\">\u201c[RAU]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-4\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Did you let him know he was going to be afforded an attorney, that is appointed an attorney on Monday when he was arraigned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">\u201c[RAU]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">\u201c [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: You specifically said that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">\u201c [RAU]: Yes. Words to that effect. I think that\u2019s what I specifically said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Did you ask him if he wished to delay the interview until he was appointed an attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-9\">\u201c[RAU]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-10\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Did you tell him he could delay the interview until he was appointed an attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-11\">\u201c[RAU]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-12\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: When he said, yes, he understood his rights, did you clarify with him what he understood?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-13\">\u201c[RAU]: No. I think *** Anderson at that point thanked him for being willing to speak with us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-14\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So, you interpreted or Detective Anderson\u2014well, you interpreted his understanding of the rights as a willingness to speak?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-15\">\u201c[RAU]: He said he understood his rights and we started to converse after that. Had he said he didn\u2019t want to or I don\u2019t want to do it now, then we would have stopped, but that\u2019s not what happened.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-16\">Defense counsel concluded his cross-examination, and the state declined the opportunity to conduct a redirect examination of Rau. Thus, evidence came to a close for the <em>Miranda </em>portion of the hearing, and the court called for a 10-minute break.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-17\">Upon returning, the court engaged in the following colloquy with the parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: *** The State has presented its evidence on the motion to admit the statements of defendant. Defendant does not want to present any evidence. And so with that introduction, [prosecutor]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-4\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Well, judge, in the interest of saving time and with the court\u2019s permission, I would waive any opening argument and confine my comments to simply responding to defense counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, at this time we\u2019re not offering any arguments based on the testimony that we\u2019ve heard, Your Honor, so\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: \u2014(inaudible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: I would invite comment. I would take it that from the State\u2019s perspective that conversation, if you will, about the attorney was not an invocation either equivocal or direct, obviously. That would be the State\u2019s position with respect to that testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-10\">\u201c [PROSECUTOR]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. Thanks very much. This matter comes before the court for hearing at the request of the State for the court to rule pretrial on whether or not the statements made by defendant to the police officers investigating this case may be admissible at his trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-12\">\u201cAt such a pretrial hearing the State is obligated to convince the court using witnesses and evidence that by a preponderance of the evidence the State has complied with the so-called <em>Miranda </em>rule and that the statements given to the police officers were otherwise knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-13\">\u00ab* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-14\">\u201cWith respect to the statements that were made to Detective Anderson on the following day, Saturday, May 12th. Defendant, of course, was in custody and prior to the interview with the detectives, defendant was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>warnings formally. In this particular circumstance, defendant * * * was advised of the so-called <em>Miranda </em>warnings by Detective Rau and after the full panoply of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number><em>Miranda </em>warnings was advised of them orally, defendant responded with the question, \u2018Where\u2019s the lawyer?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-4\">\u201cDetective Rau replied that you can\u2014or, \u2018Did you call a lawyer and retain one?\u2019 Defendant responded with the statement, \u2018No.\u2019 And Detective Rau replied, \u2018You\u2019ll be appointed an attorney at your arraignment on Monday.\u2019 Detective Anderson asked the question, \u2018Do you understand your rights?\u2019 Defendant replied, \u2018Absolutely.\u2019 And, of course, we know that thereafter another interview was conducted that was audio recorded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-5\">\u201cDefendant was in custody and was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. And the court finds that that question, \u2018where\u2019s the lawyer\u2019 and the conversation that subsequently followed was not an invocation of either right to remain silent or the right to have counsel present before further questioning is conducted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-6\">\u201cThat defendant engaged in a lengthy interview without otherwise invoking his right to remain silent or his request for an attorney, together with his verbal acknowledgment that he understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights absolutely, convinces the court that that is not an invocation of the right to counsel or the right to remain silent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Consequently, the detectives testified at defendant\u2019s trial about what defendant said during the interview, and the state also played the audio recording of the interview. Defendant was convicted of murder constituting domestic abuse. He appeals that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">We set out the relevant legal principles concerning defendant\u2019s challenge in greater detail below but, for purposes of our preservation discussion, we note that, under Article I, section 12, a suspect in custody has a right against self-incrimination and a derivative right to counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Avila-Nava, </em>356 Or at 609, 611 n 6. That right is protected by the requirement that, if the suspect unequivocally invokes the right to counsel, officers must stop interrogating the suspect and, if the suspect equivocally invokes the right to counsel, officers must follow up with questions to clarify if the suspect meant to invoke his Article I, section 12, right to counsel before proceeding with interrogation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>In the state\u2019s view, defendant\u2019s claim of error is unpreserved because defendant failed to argue to the trial court that he equivocally invoked his right to counsel and that the officers failed to clarify whether he invoked his right to counsel. Regarding preservation, in general, if an issue has not been presented to the trial court, we will not consider it on appeal. <em>Peeples v. Lampert, </em>345 Or 209, 219, 191 P3d 637 (2008); ORAP 5.45(1). There are important reasons for the rule of preservation. The rule \u201cgives a trial court the chance to consider and rule on a contention, thereby possibly avoiding an error altogether or correcting one already made, which in turn may obviate the need for an appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Another purpose of preservation is to \u201censure [] fairness to opposing parties, by requiring that the positions of the parties are presented clearly to the initial tribunal so that parties are not taken by surprise, misled, or denied opportunities to meet an argument.\u201d <em>State v. Walker, </em>350 Or 540, 548, 258 P3d 1228 (2011) (internal quotations omitted). Finally, preservation \u201cfosters full development of the record, which aids the trial court in making a decision and the appellate court in reviewing it.\u201d <em>Peeples, </em>345 Or at 219-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">It bears emphasizing that, \u201c [ultimately, the preservation rule is a practical one, and close calls * * * inevitably will turn on whether, given the particular record of a case, the court concludes that the policies underlying the rule have been sufficiently served.\u201d <em>State v. Parkins, </em>346 Or 333, 341, 211 P3d 262 (2009). Moreover, the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-5\">\u201cfact that the level of detail or thoroughness with which a party articulates a position may leave something to be desired does not mean that it was insufficient to serve the rule of preservation\u2019s pragmatic purposes. The point, as we have explained, is whether a party provides sufficient information to enable opposing parties to meet an objection and the trial court to avoid error.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-6\">\u201cParticularly in criminal cases, in which there is a premium on considerations of cost and speed, the realities of trial practice may be such that fairly abbreviated shorthand references suffice to put all on notice about the nature of a party\u2019s arguments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-7\"><em>Walker, </em>350 Or at 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>In this case, the state contends that defendant failed to preserve his appellate argument because \u201cdefendant did not present <em>any </em>argument whatsoever regarding the motion\u201d (emphasis in the state\u2019s brief) and, after the prosecutor declined to make an argument after the close of evidence, defense counsel stated that he was \u201cnot offering any arguments based on the testimony we\u2019ve heard.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, the state contends that, had defense counsel raised the issue at the time the parties declined to make closing arguments, the \u201cprosecution very likely would have introduced a copy of the recording into evidence at the pretrial hearing\u201d because the recording includes additional portions of the interview that were not testified to by detectives Rau and Anderson.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That evidence establishes, according to the state, that defendant waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Thus, the state posits that the record was not fully developed. For his part, defendant asserts that, if the pretrial hearing is viewed in its entirety, the issue was preserved and the purposes of preservation were satisfied. We agree with defendant and conclude that his argument is preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-3\">First, it is apparent from the procedure used by the parties and the court that all understood that whether defendant\u2019s statements in the May 12 interview were obtained in violation of his <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel was at issue, and that all understood that it was the state\u2019s burden to prove that they were not. The state moved to schedule a hearing to resolve whether defendant\u2019s statements were obtained in compliance with his <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel. Accordingly, the state adduced testimony from the detectives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>who interrogated defendant and limited its questions solely to the circumstances of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and the subsequent conversation about those warnings and whether defendant was willing to talk to the detectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Second, it is equally apparent that defendant did not concede the point. Instead, through cross-examination defendant established that the officers failed to ask the clarifying questions that are required following an equivocal invocation of the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel. In other words, defendant developed the evidence to show that, if defendant\u2019s statement was an invocation, police did not proceed in the manner required. Defense counsel asked Rau whether he \u201chad a decision to make how to respond\u201d when defendant asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s the lawyer?\u201d after defendant was asked whether he understood the rights that had just been read to him. That question tracks the familiar principle that requires that clarifying questions must be asked if there is an equivocal invocation and officers must decide how to proceed when faced with an equivocal invocation of the right to counsel. Defense counsel followed that question with two more: (1) \u201cDid you ask him if he wished to delay the interview until he was appointed an attorney?\u201d and (2) \u201cDid you tell him he could delay the interview until he was appointed an attorney?\u201d Both questions pointedly inquired whether the detective sought to clarify what defendant meant when he asked \u201cWhere\u2019s the lawyer?\u201d If those questions were not sufficiently clear to reflect that defendant was not conceding that there had not been an invocation of counsel and, in particular, that an equivocal invocation required clarification\u2014 defense counsel asked, \u201cWhen he said, yes, he understood his rights, did you clarify with him what he understood?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Third, the record reflects that the parties were short on time and were deliberately cutting short their arguments in the interest of time, with the apparent understanding that all knew what the legal issue was. When the hearing resumed after a 10-minute recess, \u201cin the interest of saving time,\u201d the state waived making an argument to the court that defendant\u2019s question to the detectives was not an invocation. Defense counsel declined to make an argument as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Fourth, the court expressly resolved the issue now presented by determining that defendant\u2019s statement was not an invocation of any sort, indicating that it understood the issue presented and the law that governed its resolution. The trial court confirmed the prosecutor\u2019s position when it asked if the state\u2019s position was that defendant\u2019s question \u201cwas not an invocation either equivocal or direct, obviously.\u201d Moreover, in the trial court\u2019s oral ruling, the court made findings about what was said in the interview, identified defendant\u2019s question\u2014\u201cWhere\u2019s the lawyer?\u201d\u2014and determined that that question was not an invocation. One of the purposes of the preservation rule is to provide the trial court \u201cthe chance to consider and rule on a contention, thereby possibly avoiding an error altogether or correcting one already made, which in turn may obviate the need for an appeal.\u201d <em>Peeples, </em>345 Or at 219. Given the purpose of the <em>Miranda </em>hearing and the manner in which it was conducted, the court understood the obvious point of contention: Whether defendant invoked his right to counsel when he asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s the lawyer?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">As for the state\u2019s contention that, because defense counsel did not make an express closing argument (or otherwise assert an argument) to the court after the prosecutor declined to make one for the state, it was deprived of an opportunity to fully develop the record\u2014that is, it would have introduced into the record the interview audio recording\u2014we make three points.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">First, the state sought the hearing on the admissibility of defendant\u2019s custodial interview and recognized that it was its burden to show that defendant\u2019s statements during the interview were voluntary. The state elected to meet that burden by questioning both detectives regarding the <em>Miranda </em>conversation they had had with defendant rather than by playing the recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Second, after defense counsel cross-examined Rau and asked the detective whether he had asked questions clarifying defendant\u2019s intent, the state had the opportunity to either conduct a redirect examination of Rau or play the recording. It did neither. Given that circumstance, it appears unlikely that additional argument by defense counsel would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>have prompted the prosecutor (after stating that he wished to save time) to reopen the record for additional evidence when both detectives had already testified to the circumstances of the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Third, even if we were to accept the state\u2019s contention that the prosecutor would have sought to reopen the evidentiary portion of the hearing to play the audio recording, we are not inclined to think that the recording would have aided the trial court or our review. That is, the state asserts that there were parts of the conversation not testified to by the detectives that indicated that defendant had waived his right to counsel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, if a suspect has equivocally invoked a right to counsel, then officers must follow up with questions to clarify the suspect\u2019s intent. If officers have not followed up with clarifying questions, as a general rule, there cannot be a valid waiver. <em>See State v. Meade, </em>327 Or 335, 339, 963 P2d 656 (1998) (stating that, in the case of an equivocal invocation of the right to counsel where the police have followed up with clarifying questions, \u201cthe suspect may <em>thereafter </em>waive the right to have counsel present during that * * * interrogation\u201d (emphasis added)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We conclude below that defendant, at the very least, made an equivocal invocation of counsel, and the officers failed to clarify his intent. The state\u2019s assertion that defendant validly waived his right to counsel relies on a misunderstanding of the case law, as we explain below, 287 Or App at 628-29,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>and the portions of the interview that the state contends it did not get a chance to introduce as evidence do not inform the relevant determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">Accordingly, the state was not procedurally disadvantaged by defense counsel\u2019s choice to forgo a closing argument when, shortly before the trial court\u2019s ruling, defense counsel had raised the issue during cross-examination and the issue was clearly understood by the trial court and the prosecutor. <em>See Peeples, </em>345 Or at 220 (stating that procedural fairness to the parties and the trial court is the touchstone of the preservation rule). Given that pragmatic principle and the practical realities of this criminal pretrial hearing where the court had to resolve a host of legal and procedural issues (and, we note, where the prosecutor indicated the need to save time), the trial court is unlikely to be surprised by our conclusion that the appellate argument was preserved and subject to our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">We turn next to the merits of defendant\u2019s appeal and set out the familiar principles governing the right to counsel during custodial interviews. The right to have an attorney present during interrogation is derived from the Article I, section 12, right against self-incrimination. <em>State v. Scott, </em>343 Or 195, 200, 166 P3d 525 (2007). \u201c[A] level of coercion is inherent in any custodial setting and * * * a lawyer\u2019s presence at a custodial interrogation is one way to ensure the right to be free from compelled self-incrimination.\u201d <em>Meade, </em>327 Or at 339. For a person in custody, or in otherwise compelling circumstances, police provide <em>Miranda </em>warnings to protect that right. <em>State v. McAnulty, </em>356 Or 432, 454, 338 P3d 653 (2014), <em>cert </em>den,_US_, 136 S Ct 34 (2015). Such warnings serve to help ensure that any statement made by a person in custody is the product of the person\u2019s free choice and not the result of the inherently coercive nature of police custody. <em>See State v. Roble-Baker, </em>340 Or 631, 641, 136 P3d 22 (2006) (citing <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 US 436, 455-57, 86 S Ct 1602, 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966)). Moreover, police must stop its interrogation when a person in custody unequivocally invokes the right against self-incrimination. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number><em>McAnulty, </em>356 Or at 454. \u201cThe reason for that requirement is that, \u2018[w]hen the police honor [a defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, section 12], if [the] defendant chooses to assert them, the coercive atmosphere of police interrogation is to some degree dispelled.\u2019\u201d <em>Avila-Nava, </em>356 Or at 609 (quoting <em>State v.

The waiver must be, under the totality of the circumstances, knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. <em>McAnulty, </em>356 Or at 455.

Defendant asserts that, at a minimum,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> a reasonable officer would have understood his question as an equivocal request for counsel because of the context in which it was made\u2014in direct response to Rau\u2019s question, \u201cDo you understand each of the rights I\u2019ve explained to you?\u201d The state argues to the contrary because defendant \u201cdid not ask to speak to an attorney but merely asked where the lawyer was.\u201d Defendant could be understood, in the state\u2019s view, to be asking about a lawyer whom he had already contacted or asking when he would receive appointed counsel. As we will explain, we agree with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Viewed in the context of the totality of the circumstances preceding defendant\u2019s query, we readily conclude that, at a minimum, a reasonable officer would have understood that his question\u2014\u201cWhere\u2019s the lawyer?\u201d\u2014was an equivocal invocation of the right to counsel. That is because defendant\u2019s question followed the Article I, section 12, right that had just been read to him: \u201cYou have the right to talk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>to a lawyer and have them present while you\u2019re being questioned.\u201d It is true that, if defendant\u2019s question were divorced from the context in which it was made, defendant\u2019s statement could be understood as the state suggests. That approach, however, does not comport with Oregon case law. <em>See Brooke, </em>276 Or App at 896 (after considering in context the defendant\u2019s statement, \u201cCan I call my mom? She\u2019s a lawyer,\u201d concluding that a reasonable officer would understand that the defendant telling officers that his mom was a lawyer meant that he wanted to call her in her capacity as a lawyer, and was therefore an unequivocal invocation of counsel); <em>Alarcon, </em>259 Or App at 468 (concluding that, under the totality of the circumstances, an officer would have reasonably understood that the defendant\u2019s query about \u201cwhen she could call a lawyer\u201d was an invocation of her right to counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\">Recently in <em>Nichols, </em>the Supreme Court emphasized the importance of applying a contextual approach to determining whether a statement is an invocation of the right to counsel. 361 Or at 111. In that case, the defendant, after initially waiving his right against compelled self-incrimination, said\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s not something I want to talk about\u201d\u2014in response to a detective\u2019s request to discuss the circumstances surrounding the death of the defendant\u2019s girlfriend five years earlier. <em>Id. </em>at 102. The court acknowledged that, \u201cwhen isolated from its context, defendant\u2019s statement plausibly could be construed\u201d as a reluctance to talk about the circumstance of the victim\u2019s death. <em>Id. </em>at 110. However, the court found significant that the defendant\u2019s statement \u201cwent to the core of the investigation and the crime for which he had been arrested\u201d and the defendant made his statement near the beginning of the interview and following a preliminary back and forth. <em>Id. </em>at 111-12. Thus, when the court considered the defendant\u2019s words \u201c\u2018in the context of the totality of circumstances existing at the time of and preceding their utterance, to determine whether a reasonable officer would have understood that the defendant was invoking that right,\u201d\u2019 the court concluded that a \u201creasonable law enforcement officer should have understood that defendant was invoking his right against self-incrimination as to the entire interview.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108 (quoting <em>Avila-Nava, </em>356 Or at 613), 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Consequently, applying that same contextual approach here, we conclude that, given that defendant\u2019s question (\u201cWhere\u2019s the lawyer\u201d) arose immediately after the officers asked defendant whether he understood his rights, at the very least, a reasonable officer would have understood that defendant may have been invoking his right to counsel. Therefore, the detectives were required to clarify whether defendant meant to assert that he had a right to a lawyer\u2019s assistance during the interview. <em>See Meade, </em>327 Or at 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-3\">That conclusion requires us to determine if the exchange between defendant and the detectives following defendant\u2019s query \u201cWhere\u2019s the lawyer?\u201d clarified whether defendant was invoking the right to counsel. The state asserts that, because it was unclear from defendant\u2019s question whether defendant was asking about a lawyer that defendant may have already retained or whether he was asking when he would receive court-appointed counsel, Rau satisfied his obligation to clarify defendant\u2019s intent by ascertaining that defendant had not retained a lawyer, informing defendant that he would receive court-appointed counsel in two days at defendant\u2019s arraignment hearing, and then asking if he would be willing to talk with the detectives. Further, the state argues that it was sufficient to ask defendant again whether he understood his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">We reject those arguments. The clarification that officers must obtain is whether a suspect intended to invoke the right to counsel derived from the right against self-incrimination under Article I, section 12. <em>See Charboneau, </em>323 Or at 55-56 (the permissible inquiry was limited to the officer asking whether defendant was saying \u201cthat he wanted an attorney and did not want to talk with [officers] anymore\u201d and, after the defendant said no, the officer again advised the defendant of his right to a lawyer); <em>Montez, </em>309 Or at 568, 572-73 (asking the defendant if he was expressing that he wanted an attorney and no longer wanted to talk to the officers were neutral questions that did not go beyond the limited and permissible inquiry to clarify the defendant\u2019s equivocal invocation of counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Here, by contrast, the detectives\u2019 questions did not clarify whether defendant intended to invoke his Article I, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>section 12, right to counsel. The detectives\u2019 response, at most, clarified defendant\u2019s right to court-appointed counsel under the Sixth Amendment or Article I, section ll.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, once defendant equivocally invoked his right to counsel, just repeating the question whether defendant understood his rights is not sufficient. <em>See Alarcon, </em>259 Or App at 469 (\u201c[M]erely informing [the defendant] of the same rights that she had been aware of before her query regarding an attorney was not sufficient to clarify her intent.\u201d). Nor was it sufficient to ask defendant whether he was willing to talk to the officers, without clarifying that defendant had a right to have a lawyer assist him during the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Indeed, not only was the detectives\u2019 follow-up an instance of failing to clarify what defendant meant\u2014and, an instance of misdirection\u2014the follow-up may have misled defendant into believing that he did not have a <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel during the interview. <em>See Miranda, </em>384 US at 471 (holding that \u201can individual held for interrogation must be clearly informed that he has the right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation under the system for protecting the privilege we delineate today\u201d). That is, defendant had a right under the Fifth Amendment and Article I, section 12, to have a lawyer present during the interrogation, <em>Miranda, </em>384 US at 471, and <em>Scott, </em>343 Or at 200, and the detectives\u2019 follow-up informing defendant that he would have counsel in two days and not at that present moment was affirmatively misleading to the extent it implied that defendant was entitled only to a lawyer\u2019s assistance at his arraignment in two days\u2019 time. <em>See United States v. Botello-Rosales, </em>728 F3d 865 (9th Cir 2013) (holding that officer\u2019s warning in Spanish to the defendant that he was entitled to a \u201cfree\u201d lawyer was properly translated as informing the defendant that his right to appointed counsel was \u201ccontingent on the approval of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>request or on the lawyer\u2019s availability, rather than the government\u2019s absolute obligation\u201d to provide counsel and, therefore, such an \u201caffirmatively misleading advisory does not satisfy <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>strictures\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-3\">The state also asserts that, if an invocation is equivocal, \u201cthe officer is permitted to, <em>but not required to, </em>ask clarifying questions.\u201d (Emphasis in the state\u2019s brief.) That is, citing <em>Meade, </em>the state argues that there are circumstances in which the state may prove a valid waiver when officers have not clarified whether a suspect intended to invoke the right to counsel. In the state\u2019s view, this case is one of those instances because defendant evinced a willingness to talk to the officers when he responded \u201cAbsolutely, yes\u201d after the officers asked whether defendant was willing to talk to them. According to the state, defendant thereby voluntarily waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. We disagree; this case is not a circumstance in which an officer\u2019s obligation to clarify the intent of a suspect\u2019s equivocal invocation was obviated.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">In <em>Meade, </em>the defendant, having received <em>Miranda </em>warnings in a custodial interview, said that, if he needed a lawyer, he wanted one. 327 Or at 337. Before the detectives had the opportunity to say anything further, the defendant \u201cleaned forward in his chair, put up his hands as if to stop the detectives from speaking, and said, \u2018You\u2019ve talked a lot. I want to say a few things.\u2019\u201d The defendant then initiated a discussion with the detectives. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court held that, because the defendant\u2019s \u201cphysical gestures cut off further questions by the officers,\u201d the defendant \u201casserted control over the conversation,\u201d and the defendant \u201cinitiated further conversation that evinced a willingness and a desire for a generalized discussion about the investigation,\u201d the interviewing officers \u201chad no obligation to inquire further.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341. That is, an \u201cofficer\u2019s duty to clarify a suspect\u2019s equivocal invocation may be obviated if the suspect initiates further substantive conversation concerning the investigation before the officer has clarified the suspect\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>State v. Holcomb, </em>213 Or App 168, 174, 159 P3d 1271, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 224 (2007) (citing <em>Meade, </em>327 Or at 340). In this case, however, defendant neither \u201ccut off\u2019 the detectives from asking clarifying questions (as evidenced by their questions that did not clarify whether defendant intended to invoke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>his Article, I, section 12, right to counsel) nor did defendant <em>initiate </em>conversation with the detectives. Rather, defendant <em>responded </em>affirmatively when asked if he was willing to talk to the officers. \u201c[P]olice are <em>required </em>to ask follow-up questions to clarify what the person meant before proceeding with interrogation\u201d if the person equivocally invokes his right to counsel under Article I, section 12. <em>Avila-Nava, </em>356 Or at 609 (emphasis added). The state\u2019s argument asserting otherwise is not well founded, and this is not a circumstance in which a suspect\u2019s conduct obviates the requirement of officers to clarify a defendant\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-3\">Our conclusion also requires us to determine whether the admission of defendant\u2019s statements was harmless. <em>See State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003) (under Article VII (Amended), section 3, of the Oregon Constitution, a reviewing court affirms trial court error if there is \u201clittle likelihood that the particular error affected the verdict\u201d). \u201cOur analysis turns on the possible influence that those statements had on the verdict and not whether proof of defendant\u2019s guilt was compelling even without the statements.\u201d <em>State v. Cazarez-Hernandez, </em>280 Or App 312, 318, 381 P3d 969 (2016) (citing <em>State v. Maiden, </em>222 Or App 9, 13, 191 P3d 803 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 618 (2009)). Defendant, asserting that defendant\u2019s statements were among the \u201cmost incriminating pieces of evidence linking\u201d him to the victim\u2019s death, argues that the trial court\u2019s erroneous admission of defendant\u2019s statements made during interrogation was not harmless. The state does not assert otherwise. We conclude that, on this record, the trial court\u2019s erroneous admission was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b633-5\"> The custodial interview of defendant was recorded, and the recording was played for the jury. However, the recording was not played at the pretrial hearing; instead, the officers described the interview.

We reject those arguments without further discussion except to explain two things: (1) that the decisions on which the state relies are inapposite when the trial court, as it did it this case, identifies the relevant issue and rules on it and (2) that defense counsel was not \u201cactively instrumental in bringing about\u201d an alleged error, <em>State v. Brown, </em>272 Or App 321, 324, 355 P3d 129 (2015), by declining to put forth a closing argument after the state also declined to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b642-5\"> Two of the statements that the state asserts were not testified to are defendant\u2019s question asking when he would get his attorney and Rau\u2019s question, \u201cAre you willing to talk to us today?\u201d Those areas of the conversation, however, were captured by the detectives\u2019 testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b642-6\"> In <em>Meade, </em>the court held that, after an equivocal invocation of counsel, the defendant prevented the officers from following up with clarifying questions by launching into a monologue about substantive issues related to the alleged crime. 327 Or at 340-41.
