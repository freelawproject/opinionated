The four officers then shot at defendant, firing a total of more than 50 shots and wounding defendant\u2019s right arm. Defendant admitted carrying the air rifle, but contended that he had held it at his side and pointed down at all times. He asserted that the officers had overreacted when they saw the air rifle, shot at him, and, later, in order to justify the shooting, falsely stated that defendant had pointed the air rifle at them. To impeach the officers, defendant sought to admit evidence of their agencies\u2019 use-of-force policies, on the theory that the officers had a motive to state that they acted in conformance with those policies. The trial court excluded the evidence, and a jury convicted defendant of the four charged counts. Defendant appeals, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the motive evidence. For the reasons explained below, we conclude that defendant preserved his challenge to the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the evidence, the exclusion of the evidence was error, and the error was not harmless. Therefore, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">I. HISTORICAL AND PROCEDURAL FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"aiq-dedup-0\">A. <em>Shooting Incident</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Around 6:00 p.m. on December 25, 2012, defendant called 9-1-1, seeking medical assistance. Defendant said that he needed an ambulance because his \u201chealth was deteriorating.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">A police officer responded to defendant\u2019s residence, which was one of several trailers in a clearing in a wooded area at the end of a narrow dirt road. The officer saw defendant standing near the trailer, holding a shiny, silver object. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>The officer identified himself to defendant, stating his name and his police department. Defendant turned and walked away. The officer left the clearing and called for back-up.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-3\">Meanwhile, defendant called 9-1-1 and asked why an ambulance had not been sent, telling the dispatcher:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\">\u201cAll the sudden the cops showed up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">\u00ab\u2021 $ \u2021 \u215c *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry they\u2019re not supposed to be here. I wanted an ambulance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">\u00ab\u2021 \u2021 \u2021 \u2021 \u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">\u201c* * * If I die tonight, it\u2019s on you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">An ambulance and three other officers met with the first officer at the beginning of the dirt road leading to the clearing. The officers learned that defendant had a bench warrant for failing to appear for court, a misdemeanor. They decided to attempt to contact defendant, to determine whether he needed medical assistance. They did not plan to take any action on the warrant at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">The officers drove down the dirt road in two patrol cars with the headlights off. They stopped their cars at a wide spot in the road and walked the remaining distance to the clearing. Each officer carried a tactical rifle. Once in the clearing, two of the officers knocked on defendant\u2019s trailer door, but no one answered. A man, Smith, came out of another trailer and told the officers that defendant had walked away from the area. One of the officers, Mitchell, spoke with Smith and searched his trailer, but found nothing. The officers decided to leave, and as they were heading out, Mitchell heard a noise in defendant\u2019s trailer. Mitchell alerted the other officers and started walking toward the trailer. The trailer door opened, and the officers saw defendant, who was holding an air rifle.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">The parties dispute what happened next. Defendant contends that he was holding the air rifle at his side, pointed toward the ground. The state contends that defendant raised the air rifle, which the officers believed was an actual rifle, and pointed it at Mitchell.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>The officers then shot at defendant, firing a total of more than 50 shots between the four of them. Defendant did not fire a single shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">After two bursts of shooting by the officers, Mitchell called out to defendant and asked if he had been hit. Defendant, who had been shot in the arm, told Mitchell that he had been hit. Mitchell told defendant to show him his hands, which defendant did. Two officers grabbed defendant, pulled him out of the trailer, and handfcuffed him. The officers arrested defendant and put him in the ambulance to be transported to a hospital. On the way to the hospital, defendant asked the officer who was traveling with him why the officers had shot him in the arm and told him that they \u201cshould have shot him right here,\u201d while pointing to his forehead.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The state charged defendant with four counts of menacing, one for each of the officers involved in the incident. Each count alleged that defendant \u201cdid unlawfully and intentionally attempt to place [the officer] in fear of imminent serious physical injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">B. <em>Pretrial Motions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Defendant filed a pretrial motion for an order allowing evidence of the use-of-force policies of the two law enforcement agencies whose officers were involved in the shooting. In his motion, defendant asserted that evidence of the policies was relevant to the jury\u2019s determination of \u201cwhether [he] in fact menaced the officers, or whether the charges were filed as a means to justify the use of deadly force by the officers.\u201d In other words, defendant asserted that the evidence was relevant to an assessment of whether the officers had fabricated their allegations that he menaced them in order to justify their use of deadly force.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">In addition to his pretrial motion regarding the use-of-force policies, defendant filed \u00e1 separate motion for an order allowing evidence that defendant had \u201cretained counsel for filing a civil lawsuit against the State, its various subdivisions and agencies, as well as the four individual officers, and that the counsel has filed a Tort Claim Notice under ORS 30.275 as a step in the pursuit of the lawsuit.\u201d In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>the motion, defendant asserted that the tort-claim evidence was admissible to show that the officers had \u201can interest or bias in claiming that the defendant menaced them, since, if true, that would defeat the civil lawsuit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">The trial court held a hearing on the motions, and the parties and the court addressed the motions separately, beginning with the motion concerning evidence of the use-of-force policies. Defense counsel explained that his theory of the case was that defendant did not menace the officers at all; instead, when the officers saw defendant with the air rifle pointed down, they overreacted and shot defendant and, thereafter, the officers claimed that defendant had pointed the gun at one of them, in order to justify their use of deadly force:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: [Defendant will] say there was no menacing at whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">\u201cSo, I don\u2019t see how the use of force policies have any bearing on the case at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">\u201cDo you have any other argument?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-9\">\u201c [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I think it kind of ties in with our related argument regarding the civil suit that they did in fact violate the use of force policies in this situation and-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: (Interposing) But, we\u2019re not going to try the civil case here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-11\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-12\">\u201cI am-\u2014-well, I understand that. <em>That\u2014as\u2014there\u2019s going to be a claim that [defendant] menaced them to justify the use of force. </em>That\u2019s essentially the story.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: So, they made up a story, phonied up a call to 9-1-1 so they could go shoot him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-14\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Negative. Or rather, it was more that <em>they made up a claim that [defendant] was threatening them with a firearm when [he] was not, to justify their use of force in this case.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: But that\u2019s still a question this jury will never get to because if they agree with him that he didn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>menace anybody, they find him not guilty and we\u2019re done. So, use of force question has no bearing on it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">(Emphasis added.) Thus, defense counsel repeatedly told the court that he was offering the use-of-force-policy evidence to support his claim that the officers had fabricated their allegations against defendant in order to justify their use of force. That is, defense counsel took the position that the evidence was relevant to show that the officers had a motive to assert that defendant had menaced them, because, if defendant had menaced them, then their use of force would not have violated the policies. The trial court rejected defense counsel\u2019s assertions and denied defendant\u2019s motion regarding the use-of-force-policy evidence on the ground that the evidence was irrelevant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The trial court then turned to defendant\u2019s separate motion regarding the tort-claim evidence. The state argued that that evidence was not admissible to show that the officers were biased or self-interested because the officers \u201cwould be indemnified *** from *** any sort of civil lawsuit.\u201d The trial court rejected that argument and ruled that the evidence was admissible. But the trial court remarked that the evidence \u201ccould be a double edged sword\u201d if defendant testified, because the state could use it to show that defendant had a financial motive to testify to certain facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">C. <em>Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">At trial, the state\u2019s theory was that, on the night of the incident, defendant was suicidal and had tried to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>provoke the officers to shoot him. To support its theory, the state presented as witnesses the four officers who had been involved in the incident. Each of the officers testified that defendant had raised the air rifle and pointed it at Mitchell.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">The state also presented evidence regarding defendant\u2019s statements. That evidence included the statement that defendant made to the 9-1-1 dispatcher when he called to complain that an ambulance had not arrived (\u201cIf I die tonight, it\u2019s on you\u201d) and the statement he made to the officer who rode with him to the hospital (that the officers \u201cshould have shot him\u201d in the forehead). It also included testimony from Smith, the man who had been in one of the trailers on the night of the incident. Smith testified that defendant had been in a lot of pain that night and had been trying to get help, but no one was responding. According to Smith, defendant was \u201churting\u201d and said that he \u201cwanted to go ahead and die.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">In addition, the state presented evidence that defendant had photographs next to his bed. A detective testified that the photographs appeared to be of family or friends and that, in his experience, people often will have \u201cphotos of things that mean a lot to them laid out in the cases where they expect their death, whether it\u2019s natural or a suicide.\u201d The detective referred to the photographs as a \u201cshrine,\u201d and a deputy medical examiner testified that such \u201cshrines\u201d are occasionally found during investigations of suicides and attempted suicides.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Another detective and the medical examiner also testified about a \u201creconstruction\u201d they had done to determine the position of defendant\u2019s arms when he was shot. The medical examiner concluded that defendant\u2019s wounds were caused by a single bullet, which grazed defendant\u2019s forearm, entered and exited defendant\u2019s upper arm, and then re-entered his upper arm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the reconstruction, the detective stood in place of defendant, and the medical examiner marked the detective\u2019s arms to show the locations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>defendant\u2019s wounds. Using a dowel to simulate the trajectory of a bullet, they then attempted to determine what position defendant\u2019s arm would have had to have been in for a single bullet to cause all of the wounds. Based on their reconstruction, the detective believed that defendant had the air rifle raised and nearly leveled when he was shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\">Defendant disputed the state\u2019s theory and evidence, asserting that he had not been suicidal and he had not pointed the air rifle at the officers; instead, the officers had overreacted when they saw the air rifle pointed down. Regarding whether he had been suicidal, defendant testified that, on the night of the incident, he was in pain and had called for an ambulance because he wanted medical assistance. Smith\u2019s girlfriend, who had visited with defendant shortly before the shooting, testified that defendant was in severe pain, with visible symptoms, but that he did not express any thoughts of suicide and was trying to get a ride to the hospital. Regarding the rifle, defendant testified that he held it \u201c [f] acing the floor.\u201d When he attempted to close his trailer door, \u201c[i]t might have been coming up just a little bit,\u201d to \u201c[a]bout a forty-five degree angle[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">Defendant also challenged the accuracy of the reconstruction, which was premised on the theory that a single bullet caused all of defendant\u2019s wounds. Defendant testified that he was shot in the arm twice. Defendant also elicited testimony from the detective who conducted the reconstruction, including that the detective had not received \u201cany formal training as far as wound reconstruction or trajectory training\u201d and the reconstruction was not \u201ca scientific experiment.\u201d The detective acknowledged that the reconstruction was not based on the actual height of defendant or his trailer door. The detective, who stood in for defendant in the reconstruction, is \u201cseveral inches\u201d taller than defendant, and the stool he stood on to simulate the height of the trailer door \u201cjust happen [ed] to be a stool that [they] keep in [their] office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The parties argued their competing theories to the jury. The state specifically challenged defendant\u2019s reliance on the tort-claim evidence to show the officers\u2019 bias, arguing both that the officers had not been aware that defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>had filed the notice and that the notice was evidence of defendant\u2019s own bias. In his closing argument, the prosecutor asserted that, \u201cThe Defendant has bias and reason to change his testimony. The Defendant as you heard has filed a law suit against the officers and the employers involved in this case.\u201d Similarly, in his rebuttal argument, the prosecutor asserted, \u201cThe Defendant is also biased by that suit. The Defendant stands to gain financially should he win that suit. And, I\u2019d ask you to keep that in mind and as you are allowed to do and instructed to do as part of your jury instructions [.] \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">In his closing, defense counsel argued that defendant had not pointed the air rifle at the officers and that the jury should hold the officers responsible for the injuries and property damage they caused. Defense counsel challenged the credibility of the officers, pointing out inconsistencies in their testimony and asserting that, because of the tort-claim notice, they \u201chave their own motive and bias.\u201d Defense counsel also challenged the state\u2019s evidence that defendant had been suicidal and its reconstruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The jury found defendant guilty of the four counts of menacing, and the trial court entered a judgment of a conviction and sentence, which defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">On appeal, defendant raises a single assignment of error, asserting that the trial court erred by denying his pretrial motion regarding the evidence of the use-of-force policies, specifically, the Coos County Sheriffs policy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In response, the state asserts that (1) defendant did not preserve his appellate argument, (2) the court did not err in denying the motion, and (3) even if the court did err, the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>A. <em>Preservation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">At the outset, we conclude that defendant preserved his appellate argument. As described above, defendant filed a written motion regarding the evidence at issue, explained his theory of relevance to the trial court, and obtained a ruling on the motion. 287 Or App at 545-47. That was sufficient to preserve the argument for appeal. <em>State v. Walker, </em>350 Or 540, 548, 258 P3d 1228 (2011) (the purposes of preservation are to give the opposing party an opportunity to respond to, and the trial court to rule on, a contention).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">B. <em>Admissibility</em></p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Regarding the merits of the argument, we conclude that the trial court erred in excluding the evidence. Evidence that supports an inference that a witness has a motive to make certain statements is relevant to show the witness\u2019s bias or self-interest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">\u201cA party is entitled to impeach a witness with evidence regarding the witness\u2019s bias or interest. <em>State v. Hubbard, </em>297 Or 789, 796, 688 P2d 1311 (1984); <em>State v. Nguyen, </em>222 Or App 55, 60, 191 P3d 767 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 690 (2009). As the Supreme Court has observed, it is \u2018always permissible\u2019 to show the bias or interest of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>witness because such evidence goes to the witness\u2019s credibility. <em>Hubbard, </em>297 Or at 796 (internal quotation marks omitted). That observation is in keeping with the principle that \u2018the jury is entitled to hear all the facts relating to the possible bias and self-interest of the witness.\u2019 <em>State v. Sheeler, </em>15 Or App 96, 100, 514 P2d 1370 (1973). Thus, \u2018[ujnless there is reason to exclude [evidence of bias or interest], it must be received.\u2019 <em>State v. Prange, </em>247 Or App 254, 263-64, 268 P3d 749 (2011). A party is entitled to make an \u2018initial showing of [a witness\u2019s] bias or interest.\u2019 <em>Hubbard, </em>297 Or at 798 (internal quotation marks omitted). Only after a party has made such a showing does a trial court have the discretion to exclude additional evidence of bias or interest on the ground, for example, that it is cumulative. <em>Id.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-4\"><em>State v. Valle, </em>255 Or App 805, 809-10, 298 P3d 1237 (2013) (brackets in <em>Valle). </em>Consequently, as the Supreme Court has held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-5\">\u201cThe discretion of the trial judge to exclude evidence relevant to bias or interest only obtains once sufficient facts have been established from which the jury may infer that bias or interest. Typically, this would require wide latitude be given to the cross-examiner to ask and receive answers to questions sufficient to demonstrate to the jury the nature of the bias or interest of the witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-6\"><em>Hubbard, </em>297 Or at 798. \u201cThat is particularly true for a defendant in a criminal case, who has the right, under both the state and federal constitutions, to confront witnesses, a right that includes the right to question a witness about circumstances from which a jury could reasonably infer that the witness has a motive to testify in a certain manner.\u201d <em>Valle, </em>255 Or App at 810; <em>see </em>US Const, Amend VI; Or Const Art I, \u00a7 11; <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 US 308, 318, 94 S Ct 1105, 39 L Ed 2d 347 (1974) (trial court violated youth\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses by prohibiting youth from impeaching witness with evidence that witness was on probation); <em>State v. Najibi, </em>150 Or App 194, 204, 945 P2d 1093 (1997), <em>rev den, </em>326 Or 464 (1998) (defendant had a constitutional right to impeach witness with evidence that witness had a motive to curry favor with the state).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Like any other type of evidence, evidence of a witness\u2019s bias or interest is relevant if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d OEC 401 (defining \u201crelevant evidence\u201d). The threshold for establishing that evidence is relevant is \u201cvery low.\u201d <em>State v. Hampton, </em>317 Or 251, 255 n 8, 855 P2d 621 (1993). \u201cTo be relevant, evidence introduced to impeach a witness for bias or interest need only have a <em>mere tendency </em>to show the bias or interest of the witness.\u201d <em>Hubbard, </em>297 Or App at 796 (emphasis added); <em>see Najibi, </em>150 Or App at 203 (\u201cIt is error for the trial judge to exclude evidence that establishes sufficient facts from which bias or interest of a witness <em>may be </em>inferred.\u201d (Emphasis added.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\">Evidence of bias or interest includes evidence that a witness has a personal motive for stating that he or she took certain action, such as to remain in good standing with an employer. For example, in <em>Hubbard, </em>the Supreme Court held that, in a criminal prosecution arising from a confrontation between the defendant and a police officer, evidence of the officer\u2019s knowledge of his police department\u2019s internal procedures was relevant \u201cto show that the officer has an interest in testifying that he followed such procedures, whether he in fact did so.\u201d 297 Or at 801. The court further held that there was no ground to exclude the evidence and that excluding it was harmful because \u201cthe jury was not fully informed of matters affecting the credibility of the police officer witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 802. <em>See also State v. Knobel, </em>97 Or App 559, 567, 777 P2d 985 (1989), <em>rev den, </em>309 Or 522 (1990) (trial court erred by excluding evidence that witness\u2019s employer was hostile toward defendant and the error was not harmless because it \u201cden[ied] the jury an adequate opportunity to assess [the witness\u2019s] credibility\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">In this case, the evidence ofthe use-of-force policies was relevant to whether the officers involved in the shooting had a personal interest in providing a particular version of events. As in <em>Hubbard, </em>it supported an inference that the officers had an interest in stating that they complied with the policies, whether they in fact did so. Consequently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>defendant was entitled to introduce the evidence to make an initial showing of the officers\u2019 bias, and the trial court erred in excluding it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">C. <em>Harmlessness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Having concluded that the trial court erred by excluding the use-of-force-policy evidence, we turn to the question of whether the error was harmless. <em>See State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003) (an error is harmless only if there is \u201clittle likelihood that the error affected the verdict\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Erroneous exclusion of evidence of a witness\u2019s bias or personal interest is not harmless if, as a result of the exclusion, the jury is \u201cnot fully informed of matters relevant to an assessment of [the witness\u2019s] credibility[.]\u201d <em>Valle, </em>255 Or App at 815; <em>see also Hubbard, </em>297 Or at 800 (erroneous exclusion of impeachment evidence \u201cis reversible if it denies the jury an adequate opportunity to assess the credibility of a witness whose credibility is important to the outcome of the trial\u201d) (citing <em>Alford v. United States, </em>282 US 687, 692, 51 S Ct 218, 75 L Ed 624 (1931) (\u201cIt is the essence of a fair trial that reasonable latitude be given the cross-examiner ***. Prejudice ensues from a denial of the opportunity to place the witness in his proper setting and put the weight of his testimony and his credibility to a test, without which the jury cannot fairly appraise them.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">A witness may have multiple motivations for testifying to particular facts, and \u201c[a]dmission of evidence of one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>type of bias does not render exclusion of evidence of another type of bias harmless.\u201d <em>State v. Hernandez, </em>269 Or App 327, 333-34, 344 P3d 538 (2015) (exclusion of evidence that complainant had an immigration reason for testifying against defendant was not harmless, even though there was evidence that complainant also had a financial reason for testifying against defendant); <em>see also State v. Miller, </em>272 Or App 737, 746-47, 358 P3d 301 (2015) (evidence that complainant had numerous strong reasons to be angry with defendant did not render harmless the erroneous exclusion of evidence that complainant had physically attacked defendant, because the excluded evidence showed that complainant was actually angry with defendant and willing to use physical force against him); <em>State v. Nacoste, </em>272 Or App 460, 470, 356 P3d 135 (2015) (admission of evidence that victim had one motive to accuse <em>defendant\u2014viz., </em>because she was angry with him\u2014did not render harmless the erroneous exclusion of evidence that victim had a second motive to do <em>so\u2014viz., </em>to curry favor with the state).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">Here, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the use-of-force policy evidence was not harmless; it deprived defendant of the opportunity to present evidence relevant to the jury\u2019s assessment of the credibility of the officers whose testimony was central to the state\u2019s case. As defendant asserted to the trial court when arguing his pretrial motion regarding the policies, the policies were relevant to the jury\u2019s determination of whether the officers \u201cmade a claim that [defendant] was threatening them with a firearm, when [he] was not, to justify their use of force in this case.\u201d The policies were evidence of a particular motivation, and because the trial court excluded them, the jurors did not hear \u201call the facts relating to the possible bias and self-interest of the [officers],\u201d <em>Sheeler, </em>15 Or App at 100. Consequently, the jurors were not \u201cfully informed of matters relevant to an assessment of [the officers\u2019] credibility [.] \u201d <em>Valle, 255 </em>Or App at 815. Therefore, the exclusion of the policies was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">In his dissent, Judge Egan argues otherwise, for two reasons. First, he argues that the exclusion of the use-of-force evidence was harmless because the evidence was cumulative. 287 Or App at 570, 572-73 (Egan, J., dissenting). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>Second, the dissent argues that the exclusion of the evidence was harmless because it was corroborated. 287 Or App at 572-73 (Egan, J., dissenting). We address those arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\">Judge Egan bases his arguments on the Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>State v. Titus, </em>328 Or 475, 482, 982 P2d 1133 (1999), identifying two circumstances in which the exclusion of evidence of a witness\u2019s bias or motive can be harmless:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-4\">\u201c[U]nder <em>Hubbard, </em>the trial court\u2019s error *** would be harmless if either: (1) despite the exclusion, the jury nonetheless had an adequate opportunity to assess [the witness\u2019s] credibility; or (2) [the witness\u2019s] credibility was not important to the outcome of the trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">287 Or App at 570, 572-73 (Egan, J., dissenting). In his dissent, Judge Egan argues that both circumstances are present in this case. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">First, Judge Egan\u2019s dissent argues that the jury had an adequate opportunity to assess the officers\u2019 credibility because the trial court admitted evidence that defendant had filed a tort-claim notice. 287 Or App at 570-73 (Egan, J., dissenting). According to the dissent, the use-of-force-policy evidence was cumulative of the tort-claim evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 571. That is incorrect. The use-of-force-policy evidence and the tort-claim evidence were qualitatively different. As explained below, the use-of-force-policy evidence was different, stronger, more specific, and less subject to challenge than the tort-claim evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">First, the use-of-force-policy evidence was <em>different </em>from the tort-claim evidence. Although both were offered to show that the officers were motivated to claim that defendant raised and pointed the air rifle, they concerned different motivations. The use-of-force-policy evidence was relevant to whether the officers had a motive to testify in a certain way in order to protect themselves from adverse employment consequences, whereas the tort-claim evidence was relevant to whether the officers had a motive to testify in a certain way in order to protect themselves from tort liability. As noted, exclusion of evidence of one motive is not rendered harmless by the admission of evidence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>different motive. <em>Hernandez, </em>269 Or App at 333-34; <em>Miller, </em>272 Or App at 746-47; <em>Nacoste, </em>272 Or App at 470. That is, in part, because a jury could infer that the more reasons a person has to engage in particular conduct, the more likely it is that the person will engage in that conduct. Thus, in this case, the use-of-force-policy evidence strengthened defendant\u2019s case in a different and additional way than the tort-claim evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">Second, the use-of-force-policy evidence was <em>stronger </em>than the tort-claim evidence, because the threat of negative repercussions from violation of the policy was more obvious and immediate than the threat from a tort claim that had not been filed, and might not ever be filed. It also was more personal, because, as the prosecutor suggested, the officers could be immune from tort liability.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, the state could argue that the officers\u2019 statements after the incident were unlikely to be affected by the possibility of a future tort claim, from which they might be immune. But, it could not make the same argument with respect to the possibility of an employment investigation, which actually occurred shortly after the incident and which could have jeopardized the officers\u2019 careers.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Third, the use-of-force-policy evidence was more <em>specific. </em>The policy contains a standard for using force, and a jury could infer that the officers had an incentive to describe their conduct as having conformed to that standard.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In contrast, there was no standard identified for tort liability for the officers, so the jury could not determine what specific effect the possibility of tort liability might have on the officers\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, the use-of-force-policy evidence <em>was not subject to the same attack </em>that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>the state made against the tort-claim evidence. As the trial court observed, the tort-claim evidence was a double-edged sword: a jury could use it to conclude, as defendant urged, that the officers had a financial reason to make the statements they did, but the jury could also use it to conclude, as the state urged, that defendant himself had a financial reason for making the statements he did. Indeed, that was how the state effectively neutralized the tort-claim evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The state would not have been able to do the same thing against the use-of-force-policy evidence; again, the use-of-force policy evidence was evidence from which the jury could infer that the officers had a personal motive to make certain statements, regardless of the possibility of any tort claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">In sum, the use-of-force-policy evidence was qualitatively different from the tort-claim evidence; it was important evidence that would have provided separate and better support for defendant\u2019s theory. The exclusion of it prejudiced defendant because it denied him the opportunity \u201cto place the witness [es] in [their] proper setting and put the weight of [their] testimony and [their] credibility to a test, without which the jury cannot fairly appraise them.\u201d <em>Alford, </em>282 US at 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Judge Egan\u2019s contrary conclusion is based on his view that defendant had a single purpose in offering the use-of-force-policy evidence and the tort-claim evidence. According to the dissent, defendant offered the use-of-force-policy evidence to show that the officers had a motive to lie to avoid tort liability. 287 Or App at 571 (Egan, J., dissenting). The record does not support the dissent\u2019s blurring of the two types of evidence, which, as described above, were the subject of separate pretrial motions, separate arguments by the parties, and separate ruling by the trial court. 287 Or App at 545-47. Defendant specifically asserted in his pretrial motion regarding the use-of-force-policy evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>that the evidence was relevant to the jury\u2019s determination of \u201cwhether [he] in fact menaced the officers, or whether the charges were filed as a means to justify the use of deadly force by the officers.\u201d That is, he asserted that the evidence that was the subject of that particular motion was relevant to an assessment of whether the officers had fabricated their allegations that he menaced them in order to justify their use of deadly force.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\">In arguing that the use-of-force-policy evidence was offered only to show that the officers were motivated to avoid tort liability, Judge Egan\u2019s dissent relies on defendant\u2019s pretrial motion regarding the tort-claim evidence, in which defendant asserted that the tort-claim evidence was admissible \u201cto show the jury that the officers have an interest or bias in claiming that the defendant had menaced them, since, if true, that would defeat the civil lawsuit.\u201d 287 Or App at 571 (Egan, J., dissenting). The dissent\u2019s reliance on defendant\u2019s assertion in his motion regarding the tort-claim evidence is misplaced. As explained, defendant filed separate motions regarding the use-of-force-policy evidence and the tort-claim evidence, and the motions were addressed separately by the parties and the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Having concluded that, contrary to Judge Egan\u2019s argument, the jury did not have an adequate opportunity to assess the officers\u2019 credibility, we turn to his assertion that the second circumstance identified in <em>Titus </em>is present in this case. To repeat, in <em>Titus, </em>the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\">\u201c[U]nder <em>Hubbard, </em>the trial court\u2019s error *** would be harmless if either: (1) despite the exclusion, the jury nonetheless had an adequate opportunity to assess [the witness\u2019s] credibility; or (2) [the witness\u2019s] credibility was not important to the outcome of the trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">328 Or at 482. Regarding the second circumstance, the dissent acknowledges, as it must, \u201cthat the credibility of the four officers was important to the outcome of the trial.\u201d 287 Or App at 572 (Egan, J., dissenting). That acknowledgement should end the matter. The officers\u2019 testimony (and, therefore, their credibility) was central to the state\u2019s case. Indeed, in his closing argument, the prosecutor emphasized that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>\u201c[t]here were five eyewitnesses *** to this event, the four officers and [defendant],\u201d and then argued that the officers were more credible than defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Judge Egan\u2019s dissent contends that we do not address the second circumstance identified in <em>Titus </em>and that we should focus on whether the officers\u2019 testimony was corroborated. 287 Or App at 573 (Egan, J., dissenting). That is incorrect. The question under <em>Titus </em>is whether the officers\u2019 credibility was \u201cnot important to the outcome of the trial.\u201d Evidentiary error is harmless only when there is little likelihood that it affected the verdict. <em>Davis, </em>336 Or at 32. When a witness\u2019s credibility is important to the outcome of a trial, the erroneous exclusion of evidence of that witness\u2019s motives or biases is not harmless, regardless of whether the witness\u2019s testimony is corroborated. <em>Hubbard, </em>297 Or at 800 (erroneous exclusion of impeachment evidence \u201cis reversible if it denies the jury an adequate opportunity to assess the credibility of a witness whose credibility is important to the outcome of the trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">It may be that, in some cases, the credibility of a witness will not be important because there is overwhelming evidence regarding the facts to which the witness testified, but this is not such a case. In arguing that the exclusion of the use-of-force-policy evidence was harmless, Judge Egan\u2019s dissent relies on the state\u2019s evidence of the statements defendant made, the photographs near his bed, and the reconstruction. 287 Or App at 573 (Egan, J., dissenting). But that evidence was far from overwhelming. It did not render the officers\u2019 testimony unimportant. It was subject to different interpretations and contested at trial. As described above, defendant challenged the state\u2019s evidence regarding whether he had been suicidal and whether he had pointed the air rifle, and he also presented his own evidence on those issues. 287 Or App at 548-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">In sum, we conclude that defendant preserved his challenge to the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the use-of-force-policy evidence, the trial court erred in excluding the evidence, and the error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b563-8\"> ORS 163.190 provides, \u201cA person commits the crime of menacing if by word or conduct the person intentionally attempts to place another person in fear of imminent serious physical injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b567-9\"> We acknowledge that the denial of a pretrial motion to admit specific evidence does not necessarily preclude the admission of all evidence on the subject matter. However, in this case, the parties and the trial court treated defendant\u2019s motion as concerning the policies as a subject matter. The trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to admit evidence concerning the policies was categorical and the parties understood it as such. At trial, when defense counsel objected to a question the prosecutor asked one of the officers on the ground that it concerned the policies, the prosecutor did not dispute that the trial court had excluded evidence concerning the policies; instead, the prosecutor asserted that the \u201cline of questioning doesn\u2019t get into the policies at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">The trial judge, who was a different judge than the judge who had ruled on the pretrial motions, shared the parties\u2019 understanding of the pretrial judge\u2019s ruling, observing that, based on its review of the pretrial order, it had \u201cassumed we weren\u2019t going to get into the policies.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b568-7\"> The medical examiner testified that, in her opinion, a bullet grazed defendant\u2019s forearm, and then caused a \u201cthrough and through\u201d injury, by going through a fold of skin and coming out the other side, and then entered defendant\u2019s upper arm again.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b570-8\"> The Coos County Sheriff\u2019s Office\u2019s use-of-force policy provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-9\">\u201cDeadly force may be used only when a deputy sheriff reasonably believes that the action is in defense of human life, including the deputy\u2019s own life, or in defense of any person in imminent danger of serious physical injury or death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-10\">\u201cThe objective of the use of deadly force is to render that person incapable of continuing the activity which required the use of that deadly force.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b571-8\"> In his dissent, Judge Armstrong argues that defendant\u2019s appellate argument is unpreserved. 287 Or App at 561 (Armstrong, J., dissenting). He asserts that the trial court did not make the ruling that defendant challenges on appeal because the ruling only excluded the policies themselves. 287 Or App at 560-61 (Armstrong, J., dissenting). That is incorrect because, as noted above, the trial court\u2019s ruling was categorical; that is, it excluded the subject matter of the policies, and the parties understood it as such. 287 Or App at 547 n 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">Judge Armstrong also asserts that defendant did not seek to have the use-of-force-policy evidence admitted as impeachment evidence. We disagree. As recounted above, 287 Or App at 545-47, in his pretrial motion regarding the use-of-force-policy evidence and in his oral argument in support of that motion, defendant asserted that the use-of-force-policy evidence was relevant to whether the charges against him were fabricated. In the motion he wrote that the evidence was relevant to the jury\u2019s determination of \u201cwhether [he] in fact menaced the officers, <em>or whether the charges were filed, as a means to justify the use of deadly force by the </em>officers,\u201d and he orally argued that his theory was that the officers <em>\u201cmade a claim that [defendant] was threatening them with a firearm when [he] was not, to justify their use of force in this case.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The way that the use-of-force policies are relevant to whether the officers <em>fabricated </em>their allegations against defendant is as <em>motive </em>evidence, that is, impeachment evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b574-8\"> The state argues that the trial court did not err because it did not \u201cabuse its discretion\u201d when it excluded the evidence. That argument is unavailing for two reasons: (1) the trial court did not exercise its discretion, it ruled that the evidence was inadmissible as a matter of law because it had \u201cno bearing\u201d on the case, and (2) the trial court had no discretion to exclude the evidence because defendant was entitled to make an initial showing regarding the particular employment-related motive that the officers had for stating that defendant had menaced them. <em>See Hubbard, </em>297 Or at 798 (\u201cThe discretion of the trial judge to exclude evidence relevant to bias or interest only obtains once sufficient facts have been established from which the jury may infer that bias or interest\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b574-9\"> When determining whether evidentiary error is harmless, \u201cwe do not weigh the evidence or act as factfinder!.]\u201d <em>State v.

However, in my view, defendant\u2019s argument on appeal misapprehends the scope of the trial court\u2019s ruling. The trial court\u2019s ruling\u2014which is the only ruling to which defendant assigns error\u2014was narrowly focused on defendant\u2019s bare pretrial request to admit the use-of-force policy orders themselves, presumably as exhibits to be used at trial. Defendant did not attempt to admit evidence of the officers\u2019 knowledge of the use-of-force policies or evidence that the officers had a motive to testify about their conduct in a manner that comported with those policies, and, consequently, the trial court never made a ruling preventing defendant from doing that. As a result, defendant\u2019s arguments on appeal are not directed at any ruling that the trial court actually made, and I would affirm. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The majority and Judge Egan\u2019s dissent adequately relate the facts of this case, so I do not repeat them here. Instead, I focus on the pretrial proceedings that resulted in the ruling that defendant challenges on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Before trial, defendant filed a \u201cmotion to admit use of force policies.\u201d In that motion, defendant requested an order from the court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">\u201callowing evidence of the Coos County Sheriffs Office General Order 4.03 on \u2018Use of Force\u2019 effective 5/01/09, as revised or updated at any later date, and the \u2018Less Lethal Policy,\u2019 General Order 4.04 effective 5/01/09, as revised or updated at any later date, as well as any comparable policy or directive of the Bandon Police Department.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">His stated ground for the motion was that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">\u201c [i] t would be important for the jury to know whether these multiple [firearm] discharges were in compliance with the policies of the applicable department in determining whether the defendant in fact menaced the officers, or whether the charges were filed as a means to justify the use of deadly force by the officers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">Thus, defendant only requested that the trial court enter an order admitting the identified policies themselves for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>use as direct evidence in the menacing case against defendant. Notably, defendant did not seek in his written motion to admit the policies as impeachment evidence. Defendant\u2019s failure to make such a request was in stark contrast to his motion <em>in limine </em>to admit evidence of his tort claim notice against the public entities that employed the officers. In that motion, defendant specifically argued that the evidence of the tort claim notice was admissible \u201cto show the jury that the officers have an interest or bias in claiming that the defendant had menaced them, since if true, that would defeat the civil lawsuit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The state\u2019s response to defendant\u2019s motion to admit the use-of-force policies also was focused on the admissibility of the policies themselves because that is what defendant requested. The state argued that the policies were irrelevant to whether defendant had menaced the officers because that crime requires proof of defendant\u2019s state of mind and not the officers\u2019 state of mind. The state also argued that, to the extent defendant would seek to use the policies as impeachment evidence (although defendant did not make that request), the policies were irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial because the applicable standard for the use of deadly force is statutory and not contained in the policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">At an omnibus hearing, the trial court took up defendant\u2019s motion to admit the use-of-force polices, asking if any party had testimony relevant to that motion, but neither defendant nor the state did. The trial court then engaged in the following colloquy with defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: * * * what does the State\u2019s [sic] use of force policies have to do with the question of whether or not the Defendant was guilty of menacing?

And, our position would be that it was an overreaction or over\u2014non [-] authorized response.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: So, in that context he menaced them less somehow, if he did it at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-9\">\u201c[Defendant]: Our position would be he didn\u2019t menace them at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: So then the use of force policies have nothing to do with it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-4\">\u201c [Defendant]: Right.

The question isn\u2019t how much force the police used or anything of that nature. The question is, did your client menace anybody?

So, I don\u2019t see how the use of force policies have any bearing on the case at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-10\">\u201cDo you have any other argument?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-11\">\u201c [Defendant]: I think it kind of ties in with our related argument regarding the civil suit that they did in fact violate the use of force policies in this situation and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: (Interposing) But, we\u2019re not going to try the civil case here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-13\">\u201c[Defendant]: Correct. I am\u2014well, I understand that. That\u2014as\u2014there\u2019s going to be a claim that [defendant] menaced them to justify the use of force.

The court\u2019s written order confirms that that is what the trial court understood it was doing. That written order succinctly stated: \u201cDefendant\u2019s Motion to Admit Use of Force Policies: DENIED.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred because the use-of-force polices were relevant to impeach the truthfulness of the officers\u2019 testimony. In particular, defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s ruling prevented him from exploring at trial whether the officers had a motive to testify dishonestly to avoid an unreasonable-use-of-force claim. The difficulty with defendant\u2019s argument is that it misapprehends what the trial court ruled below. As set out at length above, the trial court denied only defendant\u2019s attempt to admit the use-of-force policies themselves as direct evidence in the menacing case. Defendant never requested that the trial court allow him to use the policies in an effort to impeach the officers\u2019 testimony (as opposed to admitting the policies <em>themselves)\u2014viz., </em>defendant never attempted to question the officers about their knowledge of the policies or the consequences that they might face if they violated the policies\u2014and never made an attempt to supply an adequate foundation for admission of the policies themselves as impeachment evidence. As a result, the trial court never made a ruling that prohibited defendant from doing those things. Seeking pretrial to admit the use-of-force policies as evidence is a substantively different request from seeking to impeach witness testimony through questioning that is based on the policies. Because the trial court never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>made the ruling that defendant now seeks to challenge on appeal, I would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b585-5\">EGAN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ANq\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction of four counts of menacing, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s exclusion of evidence of the Coos County Sheriffs Office\u2019s and Bandon Police Department\u2019s use-of-force policies. For the reasons explained below, I would conclude that, even if the trial court erred in excluding that evidence, the error was harmless. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Because I believe the majority omits key facts from the historical and procedural background in this case, I recount them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">On December 25, 2013, defendant called 9-1-1 for medical assistance. He requested an ambulance because his \u201chealth was deteriorating.\u201d Officer Garrett of the Bandon Police Department was the first to arrive at defendant\u2019s residence, which was a trailer located in a wooded area. To reach defendant\u2019s trailer, Garrett drove down a narrow dirt road\u2014about one vehicle wide\u2014that opened up to four trailers. When he was close to the first trailer, he stopped his patrol car. At that point, Garrett attempted to notify dispatch that he was at defendant\u2019s trailer; however, he had no reception.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">Garrett then stepped out of his patrol car and noticed that defendant was standing to the left of the first trailer and was holding a \u201cshiny, silver object.\u201d Garrett identified himself as \u201cOfficer Garrett, Bandon Police Department,\u201d and defendant turned around and walked away. Garrett retreated to his patrol car. He backed out of the dirt road \u201cseveral hundred yards\u201d to an area where he was able to get reception, called dispatch, described what he had observed, and requested backup.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">While Garrett waited for backup to arrive, defendant called 9-1-1 again and told the dispatcher:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-11\">\u201cAll the sudden the cops showed up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>\u00ab\u2021\u2021\u2021\u2021\u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-4\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry they\u2019re not supposed to be here. I wanted an ambulance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">\u00ab* * \u215d * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">\u201c* * * If I die tonight, it\u2019s on you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Dispatch then called Garrett to report that defendant had called 9-1-1 again, \u201cwanting to know why the police had responded when he asked for an ambulance.\u201d By that time, the ambulance had arrived, as well as Coos County Sheriffs deputies Mitchell and Wilson, and Bandon Police Department Officer Byrd. Mitchell ran a records search on defendant and discovered that defendant had an outstanding arrest warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">Garrett, Mitchell, Wilson, and Byrd then drove down the dirt road toward defendant\u2019s trailer in two patrol cars. The officers stopped their patrol cars about 300 yards from the clearing where the trailers were located and started to walk toward defendant\u2019s trailer armed with tactical rifles. Mitchell and Wilson knocked on defendant\u2019s trailer door, and no one answered. There were no lights on in defendant\u2019s trailer. Smith, defendant\u2019s neighbor, came out of his trailer and told Mitchell that he believed that defendant had walked away on foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">As the officers were getting ready to leave, Garrett heard noises coming from defendant\u2019s trailer. Garrett alerted Mitchell, and Mitchell turned toward defendant\u2019s trailer. The trailer door swung open and the officers saw that defendant was holding what they believed was a rifle; it is undisputed that defendant was actually holding an air rifle that shoots pellets. Garrett testified that he saw \u201ca person standing there and the barrel of a rifle come up\u201d\u2014\u201cas soon as the door came open I could see the gleam of [the] barrel.\u201d Mitchell testified that when the door opened he saw that defendant was holding a rifle in his right hand. Mitchell commanded defendant several times to drop his weapon. Instead, defendant \u201cstarted to point the rifle up as to aim or as you would hold it with both hands\u201d towards Mitchell. All <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>four officers fired their weapons at defendant. Defendant did not fire a single shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">After the firing stopped, Mitchell asked defendant if he was hit, and defendant responded, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m hit.\u201d Defendant had been shot in the right arm and the hat he had been wearing had a bullet hole through it. The officers arrested defendant and put him in the ambulance. Byrd rode with defendant in the ambulance to the hospital. Defendant asked Byrd \u201cwhy [the officers] shot him in the arm\u201d and told Byrd that he should have shot him \u201cright here\u201d and pointed to his forehead.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Karcher, a deputy medical examiner and forensic nurse, examined defendant at the hospital. Karcher described defendant\u2019s arm injury as a \u201cgraze type gunshot wound\u201d underneath his right forearm and a direct gunshot wound that resulted in a \u201cbig avulsion\u201d in the right bicep of defendant\u2019s arm\u2014\u201c[t]he bullet went through the skin, came out the other side, and then it went in the arm again.\u201d After Karcher examined defendant\u2019s injuries, she participated in an attempt with Detectives Schwenninger and Sparks to reconstruct the trajectory of the bullet that hit defendant. Through that reconstruction, they found that the \u201cslight upward direction, trajectory\u201d of the bullet angle indicated that defendant\u2019s arm had been raised to a \u201clevel\u201d shooting position at the time that he was shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Smith, who was in a neighboring trailer at the time of the shooting, told Schwenninger that he had spoken with defendant earlier that day and defendant had told him that he would rather die than be there right now. Smith also said that defendant is usually \u201chappy-go-lucky,\u201d but, on the night of the incident, he was in a lot of pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">The following day, detectives investigated the crime scene at defendant\u2019s trailer. Detectives discovered that the officers had fired more than 50 rounds of ammunition into defendant\u2019s trailer. Detectives also found a collection of photographs in defendant\u2019s trailer, which Karcher believed could have been a \u201cshrine\u201d made in preparation for committing suicide. The state charged defendant with four counts of menacing, ORS 163.190.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Before trial, defendant moved to admit evidence of the \u201cCoos County Sheriffs Office General Order 4.03 on \u2018Use of force\u2019 effective 5/01/09,\u201d \u201cGeneral Order 4.04 effective 5/01/09,\u201d and \u201cany comparable policy or directive of the Bandon Police Department.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-4\">\u201cIt would be important for the jury to know whether these multiple discharges were in compliance with the policies of the applicable department in determining whether the defendant in fact menaced the officers, or whether the charges were filed as a means to justify the use of deadly force by the officers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The state responded that the use-of-force policies were irrelevant under OEC 401<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and were not admissible \u201cas impeachment evidence against the testifying officers to show that they have motive for being untruthful.\u201d At a pretrial hearing, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to admit the use-of-force policies and explained that the use-of-force question had \u201cno bearing\u201d on whether defendant menaced the officers. The trial court and defense counsel had the following exchange at the hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">\u201c[THE COURT]: So, I don\u2019t see how the use-of-force policies have any bearing on the case at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">\u00ab\u215c \u215c\u2021\u2021\u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-8\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I think it kind of ties in with our related argument regarding the civil suit that [the officers] did in fact violate the use of force policies in this situation * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-9\">\u201c[THE COURT]: *** But, we\u2019re not going to try the civil case here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Correct. *** I understand that * * * there\u2019s going to be a claim that [defendant] menaced them to justify the use of force. That\u2019s essentially the story.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-3\">\u201c[THE COURT]: So, they made up a story, phonied up a call to 9-1-1 so they could go shoot him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-4\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Negative.

So, use of force question has no bearing on it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Thus, the trial court found that the use-of-force policies were not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Before trial, defendant also filed a motion to allow evidence that \u201cdefendant ha[d] retained counsel for filing a civil lawsuit against the State, its various subdivisions and agencies, as well as the four individual officers, and that the counsel ha[d] filed a Tort Claim Notice under ORS 30.275 as a step in pursuit of the lawsuit.\u201d Defendant explained that \u201c[t]his evidence is admissible as a basis to show the jury that the officers have an interest or bias in claiming that the defendant had menaced them, since, if true, that would defeat the civil lawsuit.\u201d The state argued that that evidence did not go to bias \u201cbecause the departments have already determined, at least for their purposes and thus for purposes of indemnification, that the officers acted in a justified manner.\u201d The trial court disagreed with the state and granted the motion to admit that evidence as evidence of bias with the limitation that it be used only \u201c[t]o the extent that * * * [defendant] sent them a tort claim and consulted with a lawyer. And that\u2019s been made known to [the officers\u2019] respective employing jurisdictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">At trial, the state presented a theory that defendant had attempted to commit \u201csuicide by cop.\u201d To support that theory, the state relied on defendant\u2019s 9-1-1 call warning the operator \u201c[i]f I die tonight, it\u2019s on you,\u201d defendant\u2019s statement in the ambulance that the police should have shot him in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>the head, and the potential suicide \u201cshrine\u201d found in defendant\u2019s trailer. All four officers also testified that defendant had pointed the air rifle at Mitchell before they fired their weapons. The state presented evidence that defendant\u2019s testimony had been inconsistent and that he had had a reason to change his testimony after consulting with a lawyer about his tort claim and sending the tort claim notice to the officers\u2019 employers. Defendant testified that, at the time he was shot, the pellet gun he was holding was \u201c[flacing the floor\u201d and that \u201c[i]t might have been coming up just a little bit.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel refuted the state\u2019s \u201csuicide by cop\u201d theory by, among other things, pointing out the inconsistency of that theory with defendant calling 9-1-1 for medical help.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Defendant was convicted by a jury of all four counts of menacing. On appeal, he challenges the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the use-of-force policies as evidence of the involved officers\u2019 bias or interest. Defendant contends that \u201c[t]he use-of-force policy was admissible to impeach the truthfulness of the officers\u2019 testimony with their motive to avoid a civil lawsuit.\u201d On the merits of that argument, I would conclude that any error committed by the trial court in excluding that evidence was harmless and affirm. <em>See State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003); <em>see also </em>OEC 103 (eviden-tiary error is not reversible \u201cunless a substantial right of the party is affected\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The Supreme Court has stated that a trial court\u2019s \u201cdecision to exclude evidence relevant to bias or interest which is error, is reversible if it denies the jury an adequate opportunity to assess the credibility of a witness whose credibility is important to the outcome of the trial.\u201d <em>State v. Hubbard, </em>297 Or 789, 800, 688 P2d 1311 (1984). \u201cThus, under <em>Hubbard, </em>the trial court\u2019s error * * * would be harmless if either: (1) despite the exclusion, the jury nonetheless had an adequate opportunity to assess [the witness\u2019s] credibility; or (2) [the witness\u2019s] credibility was not important to the outcome of the trial.\u201d <em>State v. Titus, </em>328 Or 475, 482, 982 P2d 1133 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">With regard to whether the jury had an adequate opportunity to assess the officers\u2019 credibility, here, the jury heard evidence of possible officer bias against defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>in that defendant had retained an attorney to file a civil action against the state agencies and officers, and that that information was made known to the officers\u2019 respective employers. That evidence, as defendant argued in his pretrial motion, was admissible \u201cto show the jury that the officers have an interest or bias in claiming that the defendant had menaced them, since, if true, <em>that would defeat the civil lawsuit\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Similarly, at the pretrial hearing on defendant\u2019s motion, defendant argued that the use-of-force policies were admissible because they \u201ckind of tie [d] in with [defendant\u2019s] related argument regarding the <em>civil suit that [the officers] did in fact violate the use of force policies in this </em>situation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Defendant also argued in his pretrial motion that the use-of-force policies were admissible because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-4\">\u201c [i]t would be important for the jury to know whether these multiple discharges were in compliance with the policies of the applicable department in determining whether the defendant in fact menaced the officers, or whether the charges were filed as a means to justify the use of deadly force by the officers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Thus, defendant sought to admit the use-of-force evidence to establish the officers\u2019 bias based on the same theory of bias as the evidence of the civil lawsuit, <em>viz., </em>that the officers had a motive to lie to avoid liability for excessive use-of-force as a basis for tort liability. As a result, the exclusion of the use-of-force evidence did not deprive the jury of the opportunity to evaluate the officers\u2019 bias that defendant alleged they held. Thus, I would conclude that the excluded use-of-force policies were cumulative of the evidence that was admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">In coming to the opposite conclusion, the majority ignores the purpose for which defendant offered the use-of-force policies. Defendant argued that he sought to demonstrate the officers\u2019 bias based on the same theory for which he sought to admit the evidence of the tort claim notice\u2014 that is, the officers had a motive to lie or exaggerate because, if defendant was convicted of menacing the officers, then that would defeat the civil claim against the officers based on their use of excessive force against defendant. Based on that theory of the case, the use-of-force policies, which defendant sought to have admitted without any offer of proof of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>any expected testimony, are not qualitatively different from defendant\u2019s tort claim notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The majority claims that the use-of-force policies were \u201crelevant to whether the officers had a motive to testify in a certain way in order to protect themselves from adverse employment consequences,\u201d and thus were qualitatively different from the tort claims notice evidence. 287 Or App at 556. However, defendant never argued in the trial court that the use-of-force policies were relevant for that purpose, nor did he seek to put on an offer of proof that supported such an argument. In determining whether exclusion of evidence is harmless, I believe our role is to evaluate whether the erroneous exclusion of the evidence likely affected the jury\u2019s verdict based on the theories presented by the parties\u2014-not based on what we determine would have been a better theory to have presented to the trial court. Thus, I cannot agree with how the majority proceeds to evaluate whether exclusion of the use-of-force polices was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">I recognize that the credibility of the four officers was important to the outcome of the trial. However, as discussed above, the excluded use-of-force evidence was not qualitatively different from the admitted evidence of the civil action, because the excluded evidence was offered to establish officer bias based on the same theory as the evidence of the civil lawsuit. Consequently, the excluded evidence was not qualitatively different from the admitted evidence in the type or strength of the officer bias that defendant sought to demonstrate. <em>Cf. State v. Valle, </em>255 Or App 805, 815, 298 P3d 1237 (2013) (concluding that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of defendant\u2019s proffered impeachment evidence was not harmless because \u201cthe jury did not have information that was relevant to whether [the witness] had motive to fabricate her allegations against defendant\u201d); <em>State v. Muldrew, </em>229 Or App 219, 230, 210 P3d 936 (2009) (concluding that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of defendant\u2019s proffered impeachment evidence\u2014the statement in the officer\u2019s report\u2014was not harmless because it was the \u201ccrucial piece of evidence that the jury needed in order to evaluate [the officer\u2019s] credibility\u201d). Thus, I would conclude that the jury had an adequate opportunity to assess the officers\u2019 credibility absent the consideration of evidence of the use-of-force policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>In determining if exclusion of bias evidence is harmless, we are also required to consider whether the particular evidence regarding the officers\u2019 credibility was important to the outcome of the trial. <em>See Titus, </em>328 Or at 482 (holding that, under <em>Hubbard, </em>a trial court\u2019s error in excluding bias evidence \u201cwould be harmless <em>if either: </em>(1) despite the exclusion, the jury nonetheless had an adequate opportunity to assess [the witness\u2019s] credibility; or (2) [the witness\u2019s] credibility was not important to the outcome of the trial\u201d (emphasis added)). The majority does not address this necessary prong of the harmlessness analysis for bias evidence and thus fails to acknowledge that there was also evidence that corroborated the officers\u2019 testimony, which strengthens my conclusion that the exclusion of the use-of-force policies was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">Here, there was evidence corroborating the four officers\u2019 testimony that defendant had intended to place the officers in fear of imminent serious physical injury. That evidence included undisputed evidence that defendant was holding an air rifle, and testimony by a medical examiner and two detectives that the bullet trajectory of defendant\u2019s right arm wounds indicated that defendant was holding the air rifle in his right arm in a \u201clevel\u201d shooting position when the officers fired at him. The state also introduced evidence that corroborated the state\u2019s theory that defendant was suicidal at the time of the incident\u2014defendant told Byrd in the ambulance that the officers should have shot him in the head, he told Smith that he was in pain and wanted to die, and the investigators found a potential suicide \u201cshrine\u201d in defendant\u2019s trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">In sum, despite the excluded evidence, the jury had an adequate opportunity to assess the credibility of the officers, and the officers\u2019 credibility was not solely determinative of the outcome of the trial. I would thus conclude that there is little likelihood that the exclusion of the use-of-force policies affected the verdict and would affirm. Accordingly, I dissent from the majority\u2019s opinion reversing defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Hadlock, C.
