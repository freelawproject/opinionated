J.</author>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Wife appeals the trial court\u2019s supplemental judgment granting husband\u2019s motion to modify spousal support. The court concluded that there was a substantial change in wife\u2019s economic circumstances and terminated husband\u2019s spousal support and life insurance obligations. Because we conclude that the court\u2019s factual findings regarding wife\u2019s access to her new husband\u2019s income are unsupported by the record, leaving us unable to determine whether wife\u2019s remarriage constituted a substantial change to her economic circumstances, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">We decline to exercise our discretion to review <em>de novo </em>as wife requests because she has not demonstrated that this is an \u201cexceptional case\u201d warranting such review. <em>See </em>ORS 19.415(3); ORAP 5.40(8)(c). Accordingly, we recount the facts \u201cconsistently with the trial court\u2019s express and implied findings, supplemented with uncontroverted information from the record.\u201d <em>Tilson and Tilson, </em>260 Or App 427, 428, 317 P3d 391 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The parties were married for 20 years and have two children together. They divorced in 2011. As part of the dissolution judgment, the court awarded wife $2,000 per month in indefinite maintenance spousal support. The purpose of that initial award was to maintain wife\u2019s upper middle class standard of living, which the court concluded she could not maintain on her own. Wife is permanently disabled and received social security benefits in the amount of $1,131 per month at the time of dissolution. Husband, in contrast, made $10,025 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">In 2014, wife remarried. Before her remarriage, wife and her new husband, Davis, who had two children of his own from a prior marriage, signed a prenuptial agreement with the intent of defining \u201cthe respective responsibilities that each [would] have regarding their payment of separate and joint expenses during the marriage.\u201d After wife\u2019s remarriage, husband then moved, in relevant part, to terminate or reduce the spousal support award. He argued that there had been a change in wife\u2019s circumstances and that she now had sufficient income support from Davis to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>eliminate the need for spousal support. By that time, wife\u2019s disability payments had slightly increased to $1,209, and her and husband\u2019s older daughter was in college and no longer living at home full time.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">The court held a hearing on husband\u2019s motion where it heard testimony from the parties, as well as Davis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court announced its findings on the record, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">\u201c[T]he court may consider the combined income of wife and her spouse in determining whether wife\u2019s need for support continues substantially as it was originally, which is the test for whether modification or termination of spousal support is appropriate after remarriage. Today wife argued that her prenuptial agreement proves that her finances have not been commingled with those of her spouse, therefore her spouse\u2019s income should not be considered as something that helps determine whether her need for support continues substantially as it was originally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">\u201cI have carefully considered whether the prenuptial agreement in this case has a preclusive effect on the presumption that [wife\u2019s] spouse\u2019s income supplements and combines with [wife\u2019s] income, reducing or eliminating her need for support from [husband]. I conclude that the prenuptial agreement is unpersuasive evidence of the couple\u2019s financial obligations. One compelling reason I reached that conclusion is that the prenup purports to segregate the spouse\u2019s incomes and obligations such that Mr. Davis is impliedly indemnified from financial obligation to [wife] or to [her children]. The provisions that purport to achieve that segregation, however, are contrary to Oregon law. Under ORS 108.045,[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] during the duration of the marriage, a stepparent has a legal obligation to the family and to the stepchildren of a designated custodial parent. I do not believe the prenup *** override[s] Mr. Davis\u2019s statutory financial obligations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">\u201cTherefore, I believe that some portion of Mr. Davis\u2019s income is properly deemed to combine with Ms. Davis\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>income for the purpose of determining whether her need for support continues \u2018substantially as it was originally\u2019 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-4\">\u201cI find that half of Mr. Davis\u2019s monthly income, which is $3,718.00, should be combined with [wife\u2019s] income to compare her current financial picture to the financial picture that she had after the divorce judgment was entered in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">\u201cSince [wife\u2019s] combined income with her new spouse raises her financial resources well above the total that the spousal support award achieved for her after the divorce, and since only her youngest child remains home full time at this point, I conclude that her need for support does not continue substantially as it was originally. For that reason I order that the spousal support award be terminated as of December 2014.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">\u201cSince spousal support is no longer appropriate, I am also eliminating the need for [husband] to continue life insurance for the benefit of [wife] as security for spousal support payments that will no longer be made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">On appeal, wife challenges the trial court\u2019s termination of the spousal support award and the life insurance requirement, raising various interrelated arguments in two assignments of error. Wife\u2019s arguments primarily concern the court\u2019s findings regarding her access to Davis\u2019s income and the effect of the prenuptial agreement as to that determination. Ultimately, however, we understand the crux of wife\u2019s argument to be that the trial court erred in its determination that wife had access to Davis\u2019s gross income and abused its discretion in terminating the spousal support award, in part because it failed to make an express finding that termination of the award was just and equitable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Husband, in turn, argues that the trial court properly terminated the spousal support award and that wife failed to preserve two of her arguments. First, husband argues that wife failed to preserve her argument that the court failed to make an express finding that termination of the spousal support award was just and equitable. Further, husband argues that, even if wife\u2019s challenge was preserved, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>the court did not err because its finding that termination of the award was just and equitable was implicit in its ultimate decision. We agree with husband that the court impliedly found that termination of the spousal support award was just and equitable, as that was the ultimate question. <em>See Reaves and Reaves, </em>236 Or App 313, 319, 236 P3d 803 (2010) (\u201cThe ultimate inquiry * * * is whether a modification of support is \u2018just and equitable\u2019 under the totality of the circumstances.\u201d). Thus, we reject wife\u2019s argument that the court failed to make that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Second, husband argues that wife did not preserve her appellate arguments challenging the court\u2019s conclusion that the prenuptial agreement was contrary to public policy under ORS 108.045. We agree with husband on that point. Although the court made findings on that specific issue <em>sua sponte </em>at the end of the proceedings, there is no indication that wife brought the alleged error to the court\u2019s attention at that point or in the weeks between the court making its oral findings and the final judgment being entered. As such, we conclude that wife did not preserve the arguments she now raises regarding the effect of a prenuptial agreement in light of ORS 108.045, and we do not address them further. <em>See Mitchell and Mitchell, </em>271 Or App 800, 808, 353 P3d 28 (2015) (an issue was not preserved where husband failed to bring the purported error to the court\u2019s attention, despite ample opportunity to do so, during the period of time between the court\u2019s initial finding and entry of the final judgment); <em>McDougal v. Griffith, </em>156 Or App 83, 86-88, 964 P2d 1135 (1998), <em>rev den, </em>328 Or 330 (1999) (an issue was not preserved where the plaintiff did not bring the alleged error to the court\u2019s attention to allow the court to address or correct the error prior to entry of the judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">We next turn to the merits of this case, which narrow to whether and to what extent the court was allowed to modify wife\u2019s spousal support award.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Our analysis is governed by a two-part framework. First, as a threshold matter, a court must determine \u201cwhether there has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>a <em>substantial, unanticipated </em>change in [economic] circumstances since the time of the earlier award.\u201d <em>Tilson, </em>260 Or App at 432 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added; brackets in original). In reviewing the court\u2019s determination as to that issue, we \u201creview the trial court\u2019s implicit and explicit findings of historical fact regarding the parties\u2019 economic circumstances to determine whether those findings are supported by any evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 431. We then \u201creview the court\u2019s determination that those facts constitute a substantial change in economic circumstances of a party under ORS 107.135(3)(a) for legal error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 431-32. Second, if the court concludes that there has been a substantial, unanticipated change in economic circumstances, \u201cthen the trial court must determine what amount of support is \u2018just and equitable under the totality of the circumstances.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 432 <em>(quoting Frost and Frost, </em>244 Or App 16, 23, 260 P3d 570 (2011)). If we reach that determination, then we review the court\u2019s ultimate conclusion for abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Here, wife does not dispute that her remarriage was an unanticipated change in her circumstances. However, the question remains whether wife\u2019s remarriage caused a substantial change in her economic circumstances. That, in turn, depends on the extent to which Davis\u2019s income was, in fact, available to wife. <em>Id. </em>at 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">As noted above, the trial court found that $3,718, or half of Davis\u2019s gross monthly income, was available to wife. However, we cannot conclude that that finding is supported by the record. Although Davis\u2019s paystubs support a finding that $3,718 was half of Davis\u2019s gross taxed income, the record does not indicate that that amount was, in fact, available to wife. We have previously indicated that \u201cthe determination of whether a party should have a new spouse\u2019s income attributed to him or her, and in what amount, is a case-specific inquiry.\u201d <em>Jones and Jones, </em>172 Or App 199, 204, 17 P3d 491, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>174 Or App 33, 23 P3d 988 (2001); <em>see also Rubey and Rubey, </em>165 Or App 616, 622, 996 P2d 1006 (2000) (courts cannot always presume that a new spouse\u2019s income is available). Here, it appears that the court made a general assumption that half of Davis\u2019s gross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>income is available to wife. Although in some instances that assumption may be appropriate, it is not so in this case. Even leaving aside the prenuptial agreement between wife and Davis, there is evidence in the record indicating that wife did not have access to the entire amount determined by the court, given Davis\u2019s independent financial obligations. For instance, Davis testified that he has joint custody of his two children from a prior marriage and that they spend about 42 percent of their time with him. He stated that he has an ongoing $500 spousal support obligation, which is automatically deducted from his income, and that he expected to incur about $15,000 in legal fees related to ongoing child support and custody issues. Additionally, Davis, who is a state police trooper, indicated that he pays monthly union dues. The trial court did not account for any of those expenses in reaching the $3,718 figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\">Husband acknowledges that the trial court did not subtract even the child support obligation but contends that that decision was within the court\u2019s discretion. We disagree. The trial court\u2019s task was to determine whether and to what extent Davis\u2019s income was <em>actually </em>available to wife, which is not a matter of discretion. Rather, the overall record must support the court\u2019s factual findings as to what amount of income is, in fact, available to wife. In this case, because the court did not take into consideration the ways in which Davis\u2019s independent obligations might limit the availability of his income to wife, we cannot conclude that $3,718 is actually available to wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Accordingly, as a threshold matter, we cannot determine whether wife\u2019s remarriage constituted a substantial change in her economic circumstances. Although the record suggests that some portion of Davis\u2019s monthly income may be available to wife, the trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to establish the extent to which wife\u2019s overall economic circumstances have changed, if at all.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse and remand for the court to make factual findings, in the first instance, as to the extent to which Davis\u2019s independent obligations limit wife\u2019s access to his income, and to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>whether termination or modification of the spousal support is just and equitable in light of those new findings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-8\"> The same judge presided over the dissolution and modification proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b345-9\"> ORS 108.045(1) provides, in part: \u201cThe expenses of the family and the education of minor children, including step-children, are chargeable upon the property of both husband and wife, or either of them.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b347-6\"> A trial court has authority to modify a previously awarded spousal support award under ORS 107.135(l)(a), consistent with the requirements set out in subsection (3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b349-5\"> On appeal, wife acknowledges that she may have access to, at most, $800 of Davis\u2019s income.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b350-5\"> Given our disposition, we decline to consider the trial court\u2019s termination of husband\u2019s obligation to maintain a life insurance policy, because that issue is contingent on the spousal support award.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
