We write only to address wife\u2019s second assignment of error, in which she contends that the trial court erred in its property division award, because the court awarded husband half of the value of wife\u2019s separately owned property in California. We reject without discussion wife\u2019s first and third assignments of error. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Wife requests that we exercise our discretion under ORS 19.415(3)(b) to review the trial court\u2019s property division award <em>de </em>novo; however, because this is not an exceptional case, we decline to exercise our discretion to apply such review. ORAP 5.40(8)(c). Accordingly, we state \u201cthe facts consistently with the trial court\u2019s express and implied findings, as supplemented by uncontroverted information from the record.\u201d <em>Code and Code, </em>280 Or App 266, 267, 380 P3d 1073 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The parties were married in 2005. In January 2010, wife\u2019s father passed away and his estate was divided between wife and wife\u2019s brother. As part of wife\u2019s father\u2019s estate, wife and wife\u2019s brother were the beneficiaries of wife\u2019s father\u2019s IRA and each received their share of the \u201cRequired Minimum Distribution\u201d (RMD). In May 2010, wife asked her brother if he would consider giving wife his share of the RMD so that she could use that money to purchase property in California (the Dolly Lane property). Wife\u2019s brother agreed to give wife his share of the RMD, and the Dolly Lane property was purchased with those inherited funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">At the dissolution trial, the parties disputed whether the Dolly Lane property was intended to be joint property. Husband testified that the parties had agreed to purchase the home as a vacation home, but that the property was ineligible for financing. Because the Dolly Lane property was ineligible for financing, husband testified that the parties had agreed that wife would use her RMD to purchase the property and that husband would \u201cpick up the taxes that were incurred from doing that.\u201d Husband testified that, as a result of wife receiving the RMD, the parties incurred a tax burden of around $170,000, but that wife paid $68,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>towards those taxes from her inherited funds. After wife purchased the Dolly Lane property, husband made about seven trips to the property. During those trips, husband testified that he worked to improve the property, including building shelters for the parties\u2019 pets, installing air conditioning, mowing, and installing some fencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">On the other hand, wife testified that husband had told her not to purchase the Dolly Lane property, but that she purchased the Dolly Lane property to distance herself from husband. In regard to the tax consequences the parties faced after wife received the RMD, wife testified that she paid the tax liability using her inherited funds; in support of her assertion that she paid the tax liability, wife submitted evidence of her payment to the Internal Revenue Service in the amount of $67,642.64. Wife disputed that husband worked to improve the property, asserting that she hired contractors to do the work and paid for those contractors using her inherited funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The trial court concluded that the Dolly Lane property was a marital asset, subject to division, and awarded the property to wife. The trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">\u201cAfter applying jointly to obtain financing through an institutional lender and being denied, the parties mutually agreed to use a withdrawal from wife\u2019s [RMD] in order to pay cash for the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-7\">\u201cThe parties shared the cost of tax and [penalties] flowing from the early [RMD] withdrawal. [Husband] performed significant work to improve the property. The parties intended the property to be a joint asset of the marital estate. It is not separate property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">The trial court incorporated its oral findings into the general judgment of dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">On appeal, wife contends that the trial court erred in awarding husband half the value of the Dolly Lane property. In other words, wife contends that the trial court erred in concluding that the Dolly Lane property was subject to division under ORS 107.105(l)(f). Wife argues that she paid for the Dolly Lane property, the tax liability from the RMD withdrawals, and improvements to the property using her inherited funds, and, as a result, the property was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>subject to division. Specifically, wife takes issue with the trial court\u2019s finding that both parties paid the tax liability incurred as a result of her RMD withdrawal. In response, husband argues that the trial court did not err in awarding husband half the value of the Dolly Lane property. Husband contends that the trial court\u2019s award was \u201cjust and proper,\u201d considering husband\u2019s direct and indirect contributions to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\">ORS 107.105(1) (f) provides for the division of marital property \u201cas may be just and proper in all the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-4\">\u201cOn appeal, we review a trial court\u2019s just and proper determination for an abuse of discretion, and we are bound by the trial court\u2019s express and implicit factual findings if they are supported by any evidence in the record. We will not disturb a trial court\u2019s just and proper determination unless we conclude that the trial court misapplied the statutory and equitable considerations that ORS 107.105(l)(f) requires.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-5\"><em>Code, </em>280 Or App at 271 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">As noted, ORS 107.105(l)(f) provides that a judgment of dissolution may provide for the division of marital property \u201cas may be just and proper in all the circumstances.\u201d In determining the \u201cjust and proper\u201d division of marital property, we begin by determining \u201cwhether the asset was brought into the marriage or was acquired during the marriage (a \u2018marital asset\u2019).\u201d <em>Morgan and Morgan, </em>269 Or App 156, 162, 344 P3d 81, <em>rev den, </em>357 Or 595 (2015). Marital assets are subject to the statutory presumption of equal contribution. That is, ORS 107.105(l)(f)(C) provides that \u201cthere is a rebuttable presumption that both parties have contributed equally to the acquisition of\u2019 marital assets, \u201cwhether such property is jointly or separately held.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">A party seeking to rebut the presumption of equal contribution \u201chas the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the other spouse\u2019s efforts during the marriage did not contribute equally to the acquisition of the disputed marital asset.\u201d <em>Kunze and Kunze, </em>337 Or 122, 134, 92 P3d 100 (2004). In determining whether a party has satisfied that burden, \u201cORS 107.105(l)(f) requires the court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>consider both economic and noneconomic spousal contributions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When the presumption of equal contribution has not been rebutted, \u201cthe \u2018just and proper\u2019 division of marital assets, absent other considerations, is an equal division between the parties.\u201d <em>Hostetler and Hostetler, </em>269 Or App 312, 319, 344 P3d 126 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">Reviewing the trial court\u2019s findings for any evidence, we conclude that the trial court did not err in awarding husband half of the value of the Dolly Lane property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There is no dispute that the Dolly Lane property is a marital asset\u2014the property was acquired during the parties\u2019 marriage. The issue, then, is whether wife rebutted the presumption of equal contribution. Husband testified that: husband and wife intended the Dolly Lane property to be the parties\u2019 vacation home; the parties agreed that wife would use her RMD funds to purchase the property; both husband and wife paid the tax liability that resulted from wife\u2019s RMD withdrawals; and husband made improvements to the property. Having received that evidence at trial, and having implicitly determined husband\u2019s testimony to be credible, the trial court could conclude that wife had not rebutted the presumption of equal contribution, and, hence, the court could determine that the \u201cjust and proper\u201d division of the Dolly Lane property is an equal division between husband and wife. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by evidence in the record, and, as a result, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the Dolly Lane property was a marital asset, subject to equal division.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b197-6\"> We note that wife\u2019s argument rests on disputing the trial court\u2019s factual findings regarding the taxes; that is, wife does not contend that the trial court misapplied the statutory and equitable considerations set forth in ORS 107.105(l)(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
