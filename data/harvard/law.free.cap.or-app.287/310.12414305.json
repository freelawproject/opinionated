On appeal, mother raises four assignments of error. We write only to address mother\u2019s first assignment, in which she contends that the trial court erred in denying her motion to dismiss jurisdiction and terminate the wardship.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, mother asserts that the evidence was insufficient to support continued jurisdiction in this case. The state, for its part, concedes that the juvenile court erred in denying mother\u2019s motion to dismiss jurisdiction and terminate the wardship. We agree with the parties that the evidence was insufficient to support continued jurisdiction and accept the state\u2019s concession. Accordingly, the juvenile court\u2019s judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-6\"> In her second, third, and fourth assignments, mother challenges the juvenile court\u2019s decision to change the permanency plan from reunification to adoption. In light of our resolution of mother\u2019s first assignment of error, which is dis-positive, we do not consider mother\u2019s remaining contentions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
