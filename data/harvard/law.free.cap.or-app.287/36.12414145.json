A\u2019s father, petitioners\u2019 son, consented to the adoption, but A\u2019s mother did not. As authorized by ORS 109.324 and ORS 109.330, petitioners moved the court for an order allowing the adoption to proceed without mother\u2019s consent on the ground that mother \u201cwillfully * * * neglected without just and sufficient cause to provide proper care and maintenance for [A] for one year next preceding the filing of the petition for adoption.\u201d ORS 109.324(1). After an evi-dentiary hearing, the court, upon determining that mother willfully neglected A during the pertinent one-year period, entered an order ruling that mother\u2019s consent is not required for adoption and that the adoption \u201cshall proceed\u201d notwithstanding any objection by mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">Mother appeals that order, assigning error to the court\u2019s determination that she willfully neglected A and its ensuing conclusion that the adoption shall proceed without mother\u2019s consent and over any of her objections. Mother also asserts that her court-appointed trial counsel<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rendered inadequate assistance of counsel by failing to present evidence favorable to mother. Those arguments, however, are not ones that we can address at present, because the order mother has appealed is not appealable. We therefore must dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">As an appellate court, we lack subject matter jurisdiction over an appeal from a judgment or order that is not appealable. <em>State v. Nix, </em>356 Or 768, 773, 345 P3d 416 (2015). We thus \u201chave an independent duty to determine whether [an] appeal [is] statutorily authorized.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We must comport <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>with that \u201cindependent duty\u201d even when the parties have not raised the issues themselves, as is the case here. We turn to that jurisdictional assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Given that the legislature has not provided a specific statute for appeals in adoption proceedings, the general appeals statute, ORS 19.205, determines whether we have jurisdiction over this appeal. <em>See Gastineau v. Harris, </em>121 Or App 67, 70, 853 P2d 1338, <em>rev den, </em>317 Or 583 (1993) (looking to <em>former </em>ORS 19.010 (1995), <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 19.205 (1997), to determine whether order in adoption case was appealable). It is readily apparent we do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">ORS 19.205 authorizes appeals from three types of judgments and two types of orders entered in actions. Subsection (1) of the statute supplies us with jurisdiction over appeals from \u201ca limited judgment, general judgment or supplemental judgment, as those terms are defined by ORS 18.005.\u201d The order on appeal, though, is not a judgment in either form or substance. <em>See generally Interstate Roofing, Inc. v. Springville Corp., </em>347 Or 144, 152, 218 P3d 113 (2009) (explaining that, as defined by statute, a judgment \u201cbroadly consists of two distinct parts, one substantive and one formal\u201d). As to form, a document \u201cmust be plainly titled as a judgment\u201d to qualify as a judgment. ORS 18.038(1); ORS 18.005(8) (a judgment must be \u201creflected in a judgment document\u201d); ORS 18.005(9) (a \u201cjudgment document\u201d is \u201ca writing in the form provided by ORS 18.038 that incorporates a court\u2019s judgment\u201d). The order in this case is plainly titled as an \u201corder.\u201d As to substance, a document must represent \u201cthe concluding decision of a court on one or more requests for relief in one or more actions.\u201d ORS 18.005(8); <em>Interstate Roofing, </em>347 Or at 152. The order that mother appeals is not \u201ca concluding decision on a request for relief.\u201d Instead, it is an interlocutory decision that A\u2019s adoption can proceed without mother\u2019s consent and over her objection. The trial court still must determine whether to grant the petition for adoption under the standards set forth in ORS 109.350<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>it can render a concluding decision on petitioners\u2019 \u201crequest for relief\u2019 in this proceeding\u2014that is, the adoption of A, the attendant termination of the parental rights of mother and father, and the other ancillary relief incidental to a decision to permit adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">As to orders, subsections (2) and (3) of ORS 19.205 identify the types that are appealable. Subsection (3), by its terms, applies only to post-judgment orders and thus cannot authorize this appeal from an order entered before the entry of any sort of judgment. ORS 19.205(3) (providing for appeals of certain orders \u201cmade in the action after a general judgment is entered\u201d). Subsection (2) of ORS 19.205 authorizes an appeal of a prejudgment order if the order \u201caffects a substantial right, and that effectively determines the action so as to prevent a judgment in the action.\u201d ORS 19.205(2). But in <em>Gastineau, </em>we held that an order under ORS 109.324 authorizing an adoption to proceed without a parent\u2019s consent is not that type of order. 121 Or App at 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">At issue in <em>Gastineau </em>was whether an ORS 109.324 order dispensing with the need for a father\u2019s consent for an adoption was appealable under <em>former </em>ORS 19.010(2)(a) (1995), the statutory predecessor to ORS 19.205(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In that case, the father appealed a final judgment terminating the father\u2019s parental rights and permitting the mother\u2019s new husband to adopt mother and father\u2019s child. <em>Id. </em>The mother argued that the father was required to appeal the court\u2019s order dispensing with his consent separately, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>father\u2019s appeal of the final judgment granting the adoption was untimely as to the court\u2019s order under ORS 109.324. <em>Id. </em>We rejected that argument, concluding that the court\u2019s earlier order under ORS 109.324 was not \u201c[a]n order affecting a substantial right, and which in effect determines the action or suit so as to prevent a judgment or decree therein\u201d within the meaning of <em>former </em>ORS 19.010(2)(a) (1995). <em>Id. </em>That was because the ORS 109.324 order was interlocutory and did not itself effectuate the termination of the father\u2019s parental rights: \u201cThe effect of the order is interlocutory. Father\u2019s parental rights did not terminate until the judgment granting the adoption was entered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the father\u2019s appeal of the final judgment of adoption was the proper way for the father to challenge the adoption, including the court\u2019s decision that it could proceed without his consent. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\">Our reasoning in <em>Gastineau </em>applies with equal force to the order on appeal in this case. As in <em>Gastineau, </em>the order is interlocutory and neither conclusively resolves the adoption proceeding nor precludes the resolution of it. As noted, the conclusive resolution of petitioners\u2019 request for relief in this proceeding will occur when the trial court enters a judgment under ORS 109.350.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Finally, we observe that ORS 19.205(5), which governs appeals from a \u201cspecial statutory proceeding,\u201d adds nothing to the analysis to the extent that provision is applicable to this adoption proceeding. That provision authorizes an appeal of an order or a judgment from a \u201cspecial statutory proceeding\u201d only \u201cunder the same conditions, in the same manner and with like effect <em>as from a judgment or order entered in an action!\u2019 </em>ORS 19.205(5) (emphasis added). In other words, to be appealable, an order or judgment entered in a special statutory proceeding must be the sort that would be appealable under ORS 19.205(1) to (3) if entered in an action. For the reasons we have explained, the order on appeal is not appealable under ORS 19.205(1) to (3). ORS 19.205(5) therefore does not make the order appealable, even if it were considered an order in a special statutory proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>In sum, the order on appeal is not appealable under ORS 19.205. We therefore lack jurisdiction and must dismiss this appeal without considering either mother\u2019s challenge to the merits of the order or her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We observe, however, that we see nothing in the statutes governing adoption proceedings that would preclude mother from raising the issue of counsel\u2019s alleged ineffectiveness in the trial court so as to develop the evidentiary record on that claim. <em>See Dept. of Human Services v. T. L., </em>358 Or 679, 702-04, 369 P3d 1159 (2016) (noting that \u201cit is a \u2018rare\u2019 case in which the question whether counsel was inadequate will not require the development of an evidentiary record\u201d). That would facilitate review of the question in any subsequent appellate proceedings that may result from the trial court\u2019s final decision on the adoption petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b57-6\"> Because this proceeding may result in the termination of mother\u2019s parental rights with respect to A through state action, mother, who is indigent, is entitled to the appointment of counsel at state expense to the same extent that an indigent parent is entitled to court-appointed counsel in a proceeding to terminate parental rights brought under the juvenile code. <em>Zockert v. Fanning, </em>310 Or 514, 519-24, 800 P2d 773 (1990) (holding that right to counsel afforded to indigent parents in termination proceedings under the juvenile code extends to indigent parents in contested adoption proceedings because such proceedings result in termination of parental rights).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b58-6\"> ORS 109.350 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">\u201cIf, upon a petition for adoption or readoption duly presented and consented to, the court is satisfied as to the identity and relations of the persons, that the petitioner is of sufficient ability to bring up the child and furnish suitable nurture and education, having reference to the degree and condition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>the parents, that, if applicable, the requirements of the Indian Child Welfare Act (25 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.) have been met, and that it is fit and proper that such adoption or readoption be effected, a judgment shall be made setting forth the facts, and ordering that from the date of the judgment the child, to all legal intents and purposes, is the child of the petitioner.
