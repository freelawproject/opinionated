It is, in effect, a statute of limitations passed for the security of the personal representative \u2014 for the benefit of the heirs and distributees, and intended to effect a speedy and final settlement of estates. This statute requiring the exhibition by a creditor of his debt or demand within two years from the time of the granting of letters testamentary or of administration, is as obligatory in a Court of Chancery as at law.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b76-15\">There should be actual presentation of the claim within the time prescribed, or something done equivalent to it; but the presentation need not be in any particular form.

But they set up as a defence to the claim of complainants against the estate of Harrison, that letters of administration were granted to defendant, Meacham, on the l6th day of July, 1836, and that he did, in accordance with the requisitions of the statute in such case made and provided, entitled an \u201cAct concerning wills, letters testamentary, letters of administration,, and the duties of executors, adminis-'' trators, &amp;c.,\u201d 'by advertisement, dated July 23d, 1836, published in a newspaper, give notice to all persons having any claims against the estate of William D.

It is believed there is no conflict of authority on this point. It is in conformity with the general rule of equity <em>pleading, </em>that all persons who are or may be interested should be joined.

R., 127.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b78-7\">But the other and most important point we present, is,.the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>of non-claim for two years provided by the 39th section of the act of November 20, 1828.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-5\">The provision is, \u201c that all debts and demands of whatsoever nature against the estate of any testator or intestate which shall not be exhibited within the said two years shall forever afterwards be barred.\u201d The only saving is as to <em>femes covert, </em>infants, persons of unsound mind, or without the United States, in the military or naval service thereof during war. Thomp. Dig., 206.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-6\">The condition on which the bar is made to depend is, that the Executor or Administrator give notice in some Gazette for four weeks, that the bar will be enforced unless the claim or demand be exhibited within the period of two years limited. Idem.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-7\">The notice in this case was published in strict conformity with the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-8\">Administration was granted to the defendant, Meacham, on the 16th July, 1836, and the first publication of the notice to creditors was on the 23d July, 1836.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-9\">The first notice of the present claim is alleged by the complainant in his bill to have been made after the return of <em>nulla bona </em>on the <em>fieri facias </em>issued against Wilder upon the judgment in Franklin County, which appears from the record filed to have been in December, 1841; then he charges, that \u201c he made known to defendant, Meacham, the existence of the claim and demanded payment.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-10\">If this had been done immediately upon the return of the <em>fieri facias, </em>it would have been more than five years after the grant of administration, and therefore, too late ; but we contend that there was no legal notice of the claim until the 3d June, 1844, when the present bill was filed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-11\">The statute requires the \u201c exhibition\u201d of the debt or demand, and it is conceived means something more than saying to an administrator : <em>\u201c </em>I have a claim against the estate you represent, and demand payment.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-12\">To <em>exhibit, </em>in ordinary parlance, means to <em>produce, show, offer to view; </em>and I am not aware of any technical signification different from this. It would, therefore, seem, that something more than the mere assertion of a claim or demand is requisite ; the evidence of the debt or demand, or some specific statement of the character, origin, and extent of the claimant\u2019s demand, should have been presen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>ted to the administrator. This, we say, there is no evidence of, save by the filing of this bill nearly eight years after the grant of administration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-5\">The letter of Meacham produced in evidence by the complainant, in answer to the alleged demand, shews, that the demand so called, contained no notice of the character of the claim made upon him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-6\">It being conceded that the notice to creditors was duly given, and the complainant not alleging a presentment or exhibition of the demand within the time limited, and not bringing himself within the protection of the saving clause, the question is, can this claim or demand be now enforced in this suit ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-7\">Our statute acts upon \u201c <em>all debts and demands,\u201d </em>against the estate of the deceased; more comprehensive terms, it is conceived, could not well be employed to express the intention of the Legislature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-8\">\u201c <em>Debt\u201d </em>is a word of known signification, and is used in law to express a sum of money due upon any contract, express or implied\u2014 \u201c <em>Demand\u201d </em>is a term still more comprehensive, and embraces a right of action beyond those which can be properly called debts. <em>In re </em>Denny vs. Manhattan Co., 2 Hill N. Y., 228.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-9\">As a release of <em>suits </em>is more large than of <em>quarrels </em>or <em>actions ; </em>so, a release of <em>demands </em>is more large and beneficial than either of them. 2 Jacob Law Dict., 238.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-10\">But the class of debts and demands intended to be covered by the statute is still further described by the addition of the phrase <em>\u201c of whatsoever nature\u201d </em>\u2014 words of still more comprehensive import; as if the Legislature intended, as no doubt they did, to exclude the idea that there did, or should exist, any debts or demands which should form exceptions to the general rule laid down.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-11\">This section of the act of 1828, has never been directly before this Court for adjudication, but in the case of Gilchrist, Judge, &amp;c., vs. Fillyau, it was incidentally considered in the determination of the question of the right of a bond creditor to sue the heir at law, and with which it seemed to be entirely connected, and to that case we refer for a portion of our argument. 2 Florida Rep., 98.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-12\">The statute is considered by this Court to be one of <em>repose, </em>and to be as equally available to the heir or distributee, as to the executor or administrator. ' And in this view, the decision is in accordance with the decisions of all the State Courts in which similar statutes have been adopted, and to which reference will hereafter be made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>This view, in our opinion, is fortified by reference to the 38th section of the act of November 20th, 1828, which immediately precedes, and seems to be intimately connected with, the one under discussion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-5\">The 38th section allows the executor or administrator the period of six months within which to arrange the trust fund committed to his charge, and to ascertain the claims upon it, without let or hindrance from legatee or distributee. After that time he may be <em>competed </em>to pay legacies and make distribution of the estate, provided the legatees or distributees shall give bond and security to refund a due proportion of any debt or demand which may afterwards appear against the estate, and all costs which may be awarded on the same : Provided, <em>that such debt or demand appear within two years from the grant of letters.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-6\">Now, suppose the estate distributed immediately after the lapse of six months, and the distributees had given bonds to refund according to the requisition of the statute, and no debt or demand should be exhibited until after the two years had elapsed \u2014 could any recovery be had upon the bond according to the provision of the 38th section, unless the creditor should bring himself within some one of the clauses of the saving <em>1</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-7\">Clearly not, for the undertaking of the distributee was to pay a due proportion only of such debts or demands as might be exhibited within the two years, and none were so exhibited. So, it would seem, if the legatee or distributee is unwilling or unable to give the bond and security provided for, he may leave his legacy or distributive share in the hands of the executor till the period of limitation elapses, and then demand and receive it \u2014 for all claims not then exhibited, are barred by the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-8\">From this, it would appear, that the protection of those entitled to the estate as legatees or distributees is one of the principal objects of the statute <em>; </em>and it also serves to make the creditor vigilant, and by early exhibition and prosecution of his claim insure a faithful and diligent action of the representative. <em>Vigilantibus non dormientibus, leges subveniunt.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-9\">It was argued for the complainant in the Circuit Court, that the statute did not include a debt or demand of the character of that sued upon here, because, as it was alleged, the claim was a mere equitable one, and did not arise, or accrue, until after the surviving part<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>ner had been pursued at law, and until after the expiration of the limitation of two years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-5\">To this we reply : 1. We contend, that the right of suit or action, as well as claim, accrued on the maturity of the note against the estate of William D. Harrison, deceased.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-7\">We hold it to be the law, settled by weight of authority, that a partnership debt is, in equity, joint and several; and that on the death of one partner, his executors or administrators may be sued without resorting to the survivor, and without the allegation of his insolvency.

Rep., 127.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-9\">We admit there are some American cases which seem to support 'the views of the counsel opposed to us, and which influenced the Judge below in his decision; but it will be seen that a majority of these cases were decided upon what was then understood to be the \u25a0doctrine of the English Courts of Equity. And when we advert to the <em>fact that the </em>establishment <em>of the </em>right of a creditor to resort to the estate of a deceased partner is one of, comparatively, modern date, we may expect contrariety of opinion during the progress of formation, and until finally settled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-10\">An examination of the English cases will show some diversity of \u25a0opinion both as to the principle and the reason upon which it was placed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-11\">The first case is that of Lane vs. Williams, decided in Trin. T., 1693, and we presume from the date, by Ld. Keeper <em>Somers. </em>In this case the Court declared the joint debt to be a charge, in equity, -against both partners and their separate estates <em>; </em>nothing is said about the <em>necessity </em>of the surviving partner being insolvent, although it appears that he was so. 2 Vern. R., 292.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-12\">The same case is reported as having been decided by the Ld. Commrs. Rawlinson and Hutchins, in Mich. T., 1692; and from Mr. Raithby\u2019s note it appears that the executor of the deceased partner had taken a bond of indemnity <em>from </em>the survivor against all demands arising from the partnership, and which seems from the decree to <em>'have </em>influenced the decision of the Court 2 Vernon R., 277.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>The next case is that of Heath vs. Percival, decided in 1720 by\" Ld. Ch. Macclesfield, where, although the surviving partner was insolvent, that circumstance did not seem to enter into the reason oF the Court for the judgment that the debt should be paid out of the estate of the deceased partner. 1 Peere., Willm., 682.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-5\">In Bishop vs. Church, decided by Ld. Hardwick in 1751, the survivor had never been sued at all, although the creditor had been desired to sue him and get in his money. The Court held he was not Bound to do so, although in this case the learned Chancellor held' that the right to resort to the- estate of the deceased was an equity which may be rebutted by circumstances, such as laches or collusion. 2 Vesey Sr., 100, 371.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-6\">In Hoare vs. Contencin, which was decided by Ld. Thurlow in-1'779 <em>; </em>he <em>doubted </em>the equitable right to proceed against the property of a deceased partner. 1 Bro. Ch. Ca., 27.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-7\">In Ex parte Kendall, decided in 1811, Lord Eldon expresses his surprize that where parties think proper to enter into a joint, instead of a joint and several contract, that Courts of Equity have not left that to its fate as a joint contract, and says it is an equity, subject,, however, to many considerations. 17 Vesey, Jr., 518.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-8\">But in the case of Devaynes vs. Noble, the Master of the Rolls,. (Sir Wm. Grant,) reviews all the preceding cases, and deduces the doctrine from them, that in equity, all joint contracts are joint and several. And he scouts the idea that the previous pursuit by all possible diligence to obtain payment from the survivors, was the condition upon which a resort to the estate of the deceased partner was allowed \u2014 and this for obvious reasons stated by him. Decided in 1816. 1 Merivale R., 562, 569.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-9\">This case was affirmed on appeal by Lord Broughamfin-1831, who takes a distinction between mercantile and\u2019other joint contracts. 13 Eng. Chan. R., 114, 115.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-10\">The case of Devaynes and Noble was afterwards in 1833 fully recognized and acted upon in Wilkinson vs. Henderson,by Sir John Leach, M. R. In this case the defence was,.that there had been no-effort to recover the sum due from the surviving partner \u2014 the Court held, he was not compelled to pursue him in the first instance, but might at once resort to the estate of the deceased.. 7 Eng. Ch\u2019y R., 176, 177.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>This case was followed by that of Thorp vs. Jackson, decided by the very able bench of the Court of Exchequer, sitting in equity, M. Baron Alderson pronouncing the judgment of the Court, fully sustaining the previous cases of Devaynes vs. Noble, and Wilkinson vs. Henderson. 2 Young &amp; Collyer R., 553.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-5\">The late Justice Story, in the case of Van Reimsdyk vs. Kane, 1 Gallison R., 371, which was decided in 1812, held that such a suit must expressly charge the insolvency of the survivor, but we find his more recent opinion in his Comm, on the Law of Partnership. He says very decidedly, that the doctrine that the joint creditor had no claim in equity, except when the survivor is insolvent, has been overturned ; and it is now held that partnership debts are joint and several in equity, and that creditors may at once proceed against the representatives of the deceased partner, whether the survivors are, or are not, solvent. Story Comm, on Part, 514.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-6\">This doctrine has been fully recognized and acted upon in the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of Nelson et al. vs. Hill. 5 How. S. C. Reps., 127.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-7\">Some of the cases decided in New York determine that a creditor may come into equity upon the insolvency of the survivor, but do not hold that the insolvency is essential. Jenkins vs. Degroot, 1 Caines\u2019 Cases in Error, 122. Hammersly vs. Lambert, 2 John. Ch. R. 508.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-8\">In <em>the late </em>case of Laurence vs. The Leake Orphan House, decided by the Court of Errors of that State, it is held that the insolvency is essential, but it will be seen, upon examination, that it was a case of fraud of peculiar character, <em>and it was necessary so to </em>determine, to avoid the general <em>act </em>of limitations. The Court held it an equitable right, and which would only be barred by the statute of limitations, as to equitable rights of ten years. The decision professes to be based upon the earlier English cases, but if we are not mistaken as to the effect of those decisions, the learned Court in New York certainly was. 2 Denio R., 577.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-9\">It may be as well to remark here, that there is <em>no </em>statute in New York similar to our statute of non-claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-10\">In the discussion of the case at bar before the Court below, this statute (39th section act of November 20, 1828,) so shocked the sense of propriety of the learned judge, that he declared his very great indisposition to give any effect to it, if it could be avoided.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>His Honor compared it, with the statute of Missouri, from which he was of the opinion it had been copied, with some alterations <em>; </em>and which alterations, by shortening the period for exhibition of claims, had disturbed the harmony of the general system of limitations, and had deviated from the correct policy of the law in this particular, and ought not to have been passed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-5\">Entertaining these views, it is not surprising that the learned judge below adopted the decision of the Supreme Court of Connecticut, in the case of Pendleton vs. Phelps, a note of which in the Digest fell under the observation of the judge in the course of his examination, as decisive of the present controversy. This case from the note cited, seems to have been decided upon what was understood to be the English decisions on the subject of the liability of a deceased partner\u2019s estate, as affected by the Connecticut statute of non-claim. 4 Day\u2019s R., 481.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-6\">It is most respectfully urged, that it cannot and ought not to be considered as authoritative precedent in our Courts, and under our statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-7\">2dly. We insist \u2014 That if the right of action did not accrue until after the lapse of the two years limited, yet the liability or cause of action did exist before the intestate\u2019s death. It was <em>debilum in present\u00ed, solvendum in futuro.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-8\">Our statute is broad enough to cover it, regarding it as a debt or demand, due presently, or in future \u2014 absolute, or contingent and conditional. It includes <em>dll debts and demands of whatsoever nature.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-9\">Under the Alabama statute of non-claim, it was held by the Supreme Court of that State, that there was no difference between an absolute and conditional liability, as to the necessity of a presentment to the executor, to prevent the operation of the statute of non-claim. King vs. Moseley, 5 Ala. Reps, 610. And to the same point is the decision of the Supreme Court of Connecticut, under the statute of non-claim of that State. Paine vs. Smith, 2 Root, 142.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-10\">Sdly. We insist \u2014 That if the counsel for the appellee are correct in their position, that the cause of action did not accrue, as against the estate of William D. Harrison, until after pursuit of the survivor at law to insolvency, it then results, as a principle of equity, that the creditor should pursue the survivor with all possible diligence, and if there be any laches in this respect, the creditor should bear the bur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>deif of the loss consequent upon it. The creditor should commence his suit immediately upon the accruing of the right of action, and should, with good faith and diligence, pursue it against the survivor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-5\">We refer here to the record exhibited by complainant with his bill, and show the negligence of complainant in pursuing his remedy at law against the survivor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-6\">But we do not in any wise admit by this position, that we have any want of faith in our other points.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-7\">Similar statutes having been passed by several of the States of the Union, it is proposed to refer to them, and the adjudication of the Courts respectively, not as authoritative precedents, but in the hope that the view taken by the Courts of those States in the exposition and effect given to these laws, may afford some light to this Court in the interpretation and application of our own statute. Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Connecticut, North Carolina, Missouri and Alabama, have all provided statutes of <em>non claim, </em>as they are termed ; and the judiciaries of those States have ever held them to be statutes of <em>r&amp;pose, </em>designed to enforce a speedy settlement of the estates of deceased persons, and to quiet the possession of the residuum by the heirs and distributees. Angell on Lim., (2d Ed.,) 167.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-8\">The statute of <em>Massachusetts </em>provides that no executor or administrator shall be held to answer any suit, unless commenced within four years after undertaking the trust.

It is said that Wilder, the surviving partner of the firm of Harrison &amp; Wilder, was a necessary party.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-14\">2d. That, under the act of 20th November, 1828, the claim of Laverty should have been presented to the administrator of Harrison, within two years after administration granted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-15\">It is answered to the first objection, that all the cases cited on the other side to sustain the position assumed, were English cases, in which proceedings were had in the first instance against the estate of the deceased partner, and it was necessary to make the survivor a party, to bind him by the decree \u2014 to ascertain his liability, and that he might be present at the taking of the account, to defend and protect the interest of the joint effects. He is supposed to have a know<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>ledge of the transactions, and the estate of the deceased partner is entitled to the benefit of his answer. But <em>no </em>case <em>it is believed can </em>be found, where the survivor is deemed a necessary party, after his liability has been fixed by a judgment at law. No decree could be rendered against him, and he would not be allowed to contest the judgment. The case in 2 Denio, 585, is in point. Butts &amp; Havens vs. Geming and others, 5 Paige\u2019s Ch. Rep., 154.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-5\">The most important question to be considered is, whether the heirs and distributees of Harrison\u2019s estate are discharged from the payment of the complainant\u2019s demand, by reason of the provisions of the act of the 20th November, 1828, usually known as the act of non-claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-6\">It will be remembered that the complainant is seeking to recover the amount of his debt from the distributees of Harrison, who are in equity trustees for this purpose, and are not entitled to the enjoyment of the estate of the ancestor, <em>except </em>the surplus of the assets, after the payment of all the debts. 2 Story\u2019s Equity Com., 498, section 1251.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-7\">The note given by the firm of Harrison &amp; <em>Wilder </em>to complainant, is dated the 23d March, 1836, and payable twelve months from date. The death of Harrison took place some time in the month of May, 1836. In the month of November, 1838, the complainant, Laverty, 'instituted suit against Wilder, the surviving partner, and in December, 1841, there was a return of his execution, endorsed \u201c <em>No property found.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-8\">The complainant then filed his bill in Gadsden Superior Court, against the administrator of Harrison, and the distributees of his estate, to recover the amount of his demand.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-9\">The first point to be considered and determined is, was the complainant right, in first resorting to the surviving partner and the joint assets, for the payment of his debt, or should he have proceeded in equity against the estate of Harrison, the deceased partner, <em>before </em>suing Wilder, the survivor, to insolvency ? Until recently this question, both in England and this country, would have met with but one response, and that is, that the surviving partner must be sued to Insolvency, before the estate of the deceased partner could bo called upon to discharge partnership debts. On this point, see the opinion of the Court in Pendleton vs. Phelps, 4 Day, 477. Lawrence vs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Trustees of the Leake and Watts Orphan House, 2 Denio\u2019s Rep., 585. Sale vs. Dishmon\u2019s Executors, 3 Leigh, 553.

Higginson, &amp;c. vs. Air, 1 Desau., 427. 2 Robinson\u2019s Prac., 129, and, indeed, every case decided in this country.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-5\">It seems, however, that, by recent adjudications in England, the Courts have <em>permitted </em>the creditor, at his <em>option, and for his benefit, </em>and the more speedy recovery of his debt, to unite the representative of the estate of the deceased partner in the same chancery suit with the surviving partner, and have proceeded to take an account of the partnership effects, and settle the rights of parties. In these proceedings, the Courts still continued to keep the partnership funds separate and distinct from those of the separate partners. Let it be also observed that, even in the English Courts, this right on behalf of creditors to resort to the estate of the deceased partner in the first instance, is <em>only permissive, </em>and not <em>compulsory, </em>and in every reported case it was for his <em>benefit; </em>and that the creditor may still, in the English Courts, <em>if he so elects, </em>pursue the surviving partner to insolvency, and then proceed against the estate of the deceased partner in the hands of the heir, and that he may adopt this course, without incurring the hazard of the statute of limitations, while pursuing the joint effects of the survivor. Winter vs. Innes, 4 Myl. and Craig, 111.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-6\">It will be seen from a careful examination of the decisions made by the Courts of the several States of the Union, that they have <em>uniformly held, without exception, </em>that in order to justify a creditor\u2019s filing a bill against the estate of a deceased partner, he must first follow the joint effects in the hands of the survivor, and only upon his insolvency do they allow the estate of the deceased partner to be resorted to. The question is now before this Court for the first time, and it is with it to determine whether they will adopt the recent English decisions, or follow the uniform current of decisions made in the United States. It is a matter for its consideration whether the <em>ultimate good </em>will outweigh the <em>hardship </em>in this individual case. Should the rule as established by the English Courts, be held to be more consonant with reason and the principles of equity, still it will' be seen that there it is <em>only.permissive </em>to the creditor for his benefit,, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>and not <em>compulsory to Ms injury, </em>and that being permitted to elect between remedies, it has never been held to defeat his debt under the stringent statute of limitations. It is hoped that the very first application of the English rule in this country will not be to defeat the collection of a just debt by the creditor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-4\">The case cited on the other side, of Nelson et al., vs. Hill, et al., 5 Howard S. C. Rep., 127, was a bill against the survivors of <em>one </em>of the firms, and the estate of the deceased partners, without first having resorted to the legal remedy against the survivor. In that case the Circuit Court sustained a demurrer to the bill, on the ground that the suit in the first instance should have been at law and against the survivor. The Supreme Court of the United States reversed the decision, and decided that the creditor has his <em>option. </em>It will be seen-that in this case, the <em>only </em>one decided in this country, the decision was to advance the rights of the creditor. There were other circumstances and facts in this case that made it one peculiarly proper to resort to a Court of Equity in the first instance. If it be true, as it doubtless is, that a suit against the surviving partner will keep alive the claim against the estate of the deceased partner, so as to defeat the general statute of limitations, will it not also apply to the act of non-claim, which it is conceded is a special statute of limitations ? It is said in the books that the equities between the partners, of which the creditors may have the benefit, will defeat the statute of limitations. Will not the same equities apply to the act of non-claim ? See the case of Winter vs. Innes, 4 Myl. &amp; Craig, 111.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-5\">I shall next endeavor to show that whether the Court shall be of the opinion that the recent English decisions are the most reasonable, and are to be adopted in this State ; or whether they shall adhere to the decisions of the Courts of this country : still the claim of Laverty against the estate of Harrison, was not of that character and description of <em>debt and demand, </em>which, by our statute, should have been exhibited to the personal representative.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-6\">It would seem from the general law on the subject of the administration of estates, that this act of non-claim was-not so much designed as a new act of limitations, as it was intended for one of repose to the personal representative. It was desirable to appoint by law some time beyond which the personal representative, and those who signed his official bond, should not be liable to suit by creditors. The terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>used in the act of the 20th November, 1828, showed most conclusively, that this two year\u2019s act was not designed so much to <em>release the estate </em>of the deceased, as it was to release the representative from suit. It will be seen on examination, that this act differs materially in its provisions from similar acts in the other States, and more nearly resembles that of Missouri. In other States* their acts of non-claim apply only to creditors, while our\u2019s include not only creditors, but legatees and <em>persons entitled to distribution. </em>Now persons entitled to distribution are those entitled to the estate of the deceased, after the payment of his debts. Does the act design to <em>protect </em>the estate from those entitled to it ? Why protect it if they are not to enjoy the benefit of the protection ? Why protect their rights in order to defeat them ? Is it the object of the act to create a fund at the expense of creditors, to the enjoyment of which those entitled to it <em>may </em>never succeed ? Should those entitled to distribution not appear and claim within the two years, will the representative succeed to the estate, or will it escheat to the Commonwealth ? Should it be distributed to some of those entitled to distribution, will others, who are equally the objects of the ancestor\u2019s love and care but who did not claim within the two years, be barred and excluded from its benefits, or rather would not a Court of Equity cause those who had received it to refund a just proportion to their co-distributees? It would seem from these views that the object of the act of 20th November, 1828, was especially intended for the benefit and protection of the personal representative, and not designed to protect the estate by defeating such debts and demands as could not properly be exhibited to the representative, and paid by him. When a claim is of such a nature that it cannot be adjusted and settled by the administrator, then it is not such a debt and demand as the act designed should be exhibited within the two years, or be forever barred of recovery. Vide 6 Connecticut Rep., 258.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-5\">It is contended for the appellants that the act of the 20th November, 1828, is a statute of limitations. It is granted that it is a statute <em>limiting </em>the time in which the personal representative may be sued by the creditors of the deceased, but it is denied that it is a statute of limitations for the <em>estate itself, </em>against the claims of distributees, who in fact are the persons entitled to its enjoyment; and, if not a statute of limitations as to them, with what propriety can it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>be said to extend to <em>creditors, </em>seeing they are by the express terms of the statute placed on the same footing ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-5\">All statutes of limitations are looked upon with jealousy and distrust when invoked to defeat a meritorious claim, and the Courts will never extend their provisions by <em>implication and construction, </em>but require parties relying on them to bring themselves most clearly within the benefit of their provisions ; and, indeed, where the Court can see that a statute of limitations will defeat a just demand,, it will usually require a party to come within its very letter. No <em>latitude of construction </em>will be adopted in aid of such a statute. In the case now under consideration, the judgment and the return of insolvency against Wilder, the surviving partner, is the foundation of the bill. <em>No debt and demand </em>could properly be said to exist against the estate of Harrison, the deceased partner, until the survivor was sued to insolvency. Previous to that time, Laverty was the creditor of Wilder, the surviving partner, who, if he paid the debt, became, to that extent, a creditor of Harrison\u2019s estate for his <em>pro rata </em>proportion, and might maintain his action for contribution. West vs. Skip, 1 Vesey, Sr., 251.</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-6\">This, at least, is the rule of proceedings aslaiddownbytheCourts. of this country without exception, and if a different one exists in England, it was only adopted, after much hesitation, and repeated conflicting decisions, and this Court will hardly, I presume, require a\u2022 party to nicely balance the weight of authority, in order to escape the consequences of the statute of limitations. Courts have uniformly held that it was much better to adhere to decisions once made, even if erroneous, than by reversing individual cases to unsettle the law which had been long acquiesced in. In Devaynes vs. Noble, a case much relied upon at bar, Lord Chancellor Brougham says, <em>\u201c </em>It is not upon slight grounds,, certainly, that any Court, either of law or of equity, ought to loosen and unsettle that which has stood for so long a period as nineteen years. If it be true that even a prevailing error \u2014 what has been called a common or universal error \u2014 may be said to make the law, this at least may be allowed to be a sound foundation of the doctrine I am referring to, namely, that, unless a great and manifest deviation from principle shall have been committed, it may create much further mischief to reverse an individual case by way of correcting a slight error, <em>if that error has been acted </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number><em>upon for a long series of years, </em>than to leave it as it stands; more especially, if the opinion of lawyers and the decisions of Judges have been ruled by it, and if, upon the analogies of that case, the same principle has been recognized and adopted in other cases, connected with and relating to it.\u201d Devaynes vs. Noble, 2 Rus. &amp; Mylne, 495. 13 Cond. Eng. Ch. Rep., 144. It is believed that the language held by the Lord Chancellor in this case, is entirely applicable to the case before the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-6\">The next question for consideration is, the nature and character of Laverty\u2019s demand against the estate of Harrison, the deceased partner. It is contended on behalf of the complainant, that in the case at bar, the debt and demand against the estate of Harrison, was <em>uncertain and contingent, </em>depending on the solvency of Wilder, the surviving partner, for had the surviving partner proved solvent, there never could have arisen any <em>debt or demand </em>against the estate of-Harrison in favor of Laverty. In England, the true and legal test of insolvency is, 1st, By the party becoming a bankrupt, and 2nd, By a judgment and execution, and a return of <em>nulla bona. </em>See 2 Robinson\u2019s Practice, 130. Up to the time of the return of the execution against Wilder, Laverty had no debt or demand against the estate of Harrison. His <em>debt and demand </em>was against the surviving partner and the partnership effects, and not until he proved insolvent, did the right of action accrue to him against Harrison\u2019s estate. At that <em>instant of time, his contingent claim </em>against the estate of Harrison was converted into a debt and demand. His right to <em>exhibit </em>his claim and to <em>demand </em>payment from Harrison\u2019s personal representative, then for the first time <em>sprung into existence. </em>As against Harrisdn\u2019s estate it was <em>suspended and in abeyance </em>until Wilder, the survivor, proved insolvent \u2014 a mere <em>contingency </em>which might never happen. It remained <em>dormant </em>against the estate of Harrison until this period of time, and until the happening of the contingency 5 and then, and not until then, could the statute of non-claim begin to run. Vide Backus vs. Cleverland, Kirby, 36. Adams vs. same, do. 38. 6 Connecticut Rep., 258. Pendleton vs. Phelps, 4 Day, 477. Neil vs. Cunningham, 2 Porter, 171. 10 Alabama Rep., 24. 2 Denio\u2019s Rep., 585.</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-9\">If, in the case under consideration, Wilder, the survivor, had been solvent, the firm being insolvent, and from his separate and private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>fortune had satisfied and discharged the demand of Laverty against the partnership, could he not have maintained his action against Harrison\u2019s representative for contribution ; and would not the defence of the act of non-claim have been well answered, by replying that he had no debt or demand against Harrison\u2019s estate until satisfaction to Laverty, and until after the two years had expired ? In a case of this nature, the surviving partner, with full knowledge of the partnership effects and its liabilities, might well know that ultimately he would have to resort to the estate of the deceased partner for contribution ; and yet it would seem he might, notwithstanding the act of two years, maintain his action for this purpose. The cases stated in the books show most clearly that it is not every <em>debt and, demand, </em>that may <em>ultimately </em>come against an estate, that must be exhibited and made known to the personal representative within the two years, or be \u201cforever barred of recovery.\u201d Take- the common one of a surety on the bond of a guardian, or other fiduciary. A, as surety for B, makes good by suit or otherwise the deficiency of his principal. B. has been dead for many years before this deficiency is ascertained, and his estate has been distributed to those in interest. It cannot be that B.\u2019s estate is discharged from the claim of the surety. True it is that B.\u2019s personal representative is discharged from suit, but the estate in the hands of distributees is still liable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-5\">This will servo to illustrate the position before taken, that the statute of two years was for the benefit and repose of the personal representative, and was not intended to discharge the estate in the hands of heirs and distributees from the payment of such debts of the ancestor as could not be exhibited to the representative. One of the most cherished principles upon which courts of equity act is, \u201c that a man shall <em>he just before he is generous,\u201d </em>and they will exercise all power in their hands to compel payment of debts, before enriching heirs and distributees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-6\">I have presented the various questions involved in this case, as if the personal representative of Harrison had complied with the act of 20th November, 1828, and had given the notice required by its provisions. I shall now proceed to show that those who are seeking to avoid the payment of this claim, and are most <em>clamorous for rigid and stringent technicalities, </em>have not so complied with the statute as to entitle themselves to the benefits of its provisions. It will be seen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>on reference to the act, Thomp. Dig., 206, that it contemplates two notices to be published by the administrator. The one, <em>required </em>by the 2d section, is to be published for the space of eight weeks, calling upon all persons having claims against the estate of the deceased, to present them without delay to the executor or administrator. The other, under the 6th section of the act, leaves it <em>optional </em>with the representative, but provides, <em>if </em>the representative <em>shall malte </em>the publication for the space of four weeks, directed to <em>creditors, legatees and persons entitled to distribution, </em>then their claims and demands will bo barred at the expiration of two years, unless exhibited within the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-4\">The only notice given by the representative of Harrison is a <em>general one, </em>to be found on the twentieth page of the printed record, which, he says in his answer, was published for the space of four weeks, <em>and longer. </em>On examination, it will be found that this notice cannot be held to be a compliance with the 6th section of the act of 20th November, 1828 ; it is manifest from its terms that it was not intended to be. It bears on its face the evidence that it was designed as a <em>general notice </em>to persons having claims against the estate of Harrison to make them known to the representative, preparatory to so arranging the affairs of the estate that it might be speedily settled. It is most apparent that the 6th section of the act was not in the mind of the representative at the time of giving the notice. It is much more like the notice <em>required </em>by the 2d section of the act, than that required by the 6th section. The first notice is <em>obligatory </em>on the representative, and may be general \u2014 while that under the 6th section is <em>optional </em>with the representative, and must be special. It wants the most essential requisite of a notice under the 6th section. It is not <em>directed to the persons </em>that the act declares shall be notified, and <em>legatees, and persons entitled to distribution, </em>are wholly omitted to be notified. It may be observed that this act is but one of many for the administration of estates in this State, and that, in order to give it a just construction, regard should be had to the entire legislation on this subject. The law requires that, in the event of the insolvency of an estate, a <em>pro rata </em>distribution shall be made among the creditors. Now, examine the notice given by Meacham, the administrator of Harrison, and it is most obvious that it was for the purpose of enabling him to ascertain the <em>condition </em>of the estate to meet this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>requirement of law. True it is, that all persons are warned that their claims will be barred of recovery unless presented within two years; yet it is apparent, from the character and terms of the notice, that the representative had not in view the 6th section of the act, but his notice was designed to <em>quicken </em>debtors in paying, and creditors in presenting their debts, that the <em>condition </em>of the estate might be ascertained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-5\">In conclusion, it may be observed that, if all the benefit claimed for the estate from the act of November 20th, 1828, was conceded, still, this being purely an equitable demand, the statute does not apply. The right to pursue the estate of the deceased partner arises from the equities between the parties. The estate is a trust fund in the hands of the heirs and distributees for the payment of debts, and it is contended that nothing but <em>laches </em>will defeat the creditor in pursuing it in their hands, and subjecting it to the payment of the debts of the ancestor. His debt is a lien on the fund, which he can lose by his laches and neglect, and no statute of limitations will impair his rights. See Story\u2019s Eq., 498, \u00a71251. Hamersley vs. Lamb, 2 John. Ch. Rep., 508. Sale vs. Dishmon\u2019s Executors, 3 Leigh, 560.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-6\">In this last case, the Court say, the defendant having made no charge of <em>laches in the answer, or any </em>part of the pleadings, the question could not be examined by the appellate court.

They say that Wilder, the survivor, should have been made a party.</p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-10\">2d. They say the claim in this case should have been presented to the administrator within two years after administration granted on Harrison\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-11\">In answer to the first objection, it is sufficient to say, that the cases-cited on the other side are English cases, where there had been no judgment recovered against the survivors. The only object in making the survivor a party is, that he may be present at the taking of the account of the amount due to complainant. Such account in this case was taken by the recovery at law against Wilder. The case in 5 Howard was the case of a creditor\u2019s bill, where only a part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>claims liad been reduced to judgment against the survivor of <em>one </em>of the firms. To have joined Wilder could have answered no useful purpose. The debt as to him, had been already ascertained, and no decree could be rendered against him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-5\">Again : No such objection was taken by demurrer, or is insisted upon in the answer of the appellants. The objection comes too late.</p>\n<p data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-6\">As <em>to the second objection. </em>\u2014 The question is, how far the statutes-of this State have cut off the right of a creditor to follow in equity the estate of a deceased debtor, as a trust in the hands of the administrator, or legatees, and distributees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-7\">The statute of five years, it is admitted, does not apply in this case, and indeed is never applied in equity, unless there be a concurrent remedy at law. See cases cited by Hoffman, Vice Chancellor, in 2 Denio, 577.</p>\n<p data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-8\"><em>But it is </em>said the statute of two years, or of non-claim, amounts to-a flat bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-9\">I say the statute of two years does not bar equities (where there is no concurrent remedy at law,) any more than the statute of five years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-10\">_The statute requires <em>\u201c </em>all <em>debts and demands </em>of whatsoever nature,\u201d to be presented, &amp;c., and also by implication from the proviso, the claims of distributees and legatees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-11\">The terms <em>debt and demand, </em>mean, as I contend, money demands, on which an action at law may be sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-12\">The terms <em>debt </em>and <em>demand </em>are used in our attachment laws, and also in the statute of set-off. It is true in one of the attachment statutes, debts and demands <em>not due </em>are spoken of, but this does not prove a different construction, independent of the qualifying words-<em>whether due or not. </em>But could the claim in question against Harrison\u2019s estate be the <em>basis of </em>an attachment under either of the statutes,, or could it be the subject of a set-off? Certainly not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-13\">The claim against Harrison was not a debt or demand within the meaning of either of these statutes of attachment or set-off. Why then should these identical words in the statute of non-claim, be construed to extend to Laverty\u2019s <em>contingent equitable </em>claim against Harrison\u2019s estate?</p>\n<p data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-14\">The object of the statute undoubtedly is, to effect a speedy payment of debts to creditors, and a speedy distribution to the next of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>kin, to terminate the office of the administrator within two years, so that-he may be protected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-5\">The administrator cannot be protected <em>except, </em>by providing against two classes of <em>persons </em>\u2014 creditors and <em>distributees. </em>He is effectually protected after distribution against any suit by creditors who do not exhibit their demands within two years from the date of his administration \u2014 for, when he distributes before the two years expire, he takes a bond of indemnity to protect him against all creditors who present their demands within the <em>two years ; </em>and this indemnity is as broad as his responsibility under such circumstances. And when he distributes after the two years, he is protected against all claims demanded after the <em>distribution, </em>for the distribution he may give in evidence against <em>subsequent </em>claims, under the plea of <em>plene administravit. </em>He is also protected against distributees, because although he may distribute to the wrong persons, the right persons cannot mantain a suit against him, unless they have brought their claims to the knowledge of the administrator before the two years expire, so as to enable the administrator to put the <em>surplus </em>in proper hands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-6\">But because creditors, whose demands accrue after the two years, cannot compel the administrator to pay them, when he has previously parted with the <em>fund; </em>or because the right persons entitled to distribution cannot have redress against the administrator, when they did not notify him of their claims \u2014 is it to be inferred that they have no remedy in equity against <em>the fund or assets ?</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-7\">The persons properly entitled to distribution, I take it, notwithstanding the want of notice to the administrator, and certainly the future <em>creditor, </em>could follow the fund in any hands, except those of a purchaser. 2 Story\u2019s Eq., 498, \u00a71251.</p>\n<p data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-8\">Now, if our statutes required or authorized the administrator to take a bond from the distributees to refund for <em>any </em>future claims which might accrue, it might be inferred that all future suits were to be enforced against the administrator, (if any one could be found to take the office under such provisions,) \u2014 for the refunding bond in his hands might be construed to be assets, and thus create a continuing and indefinite liability. But the administrator is not required or authorized to take such refunding bond, and, consequently, is not held to such continuing liability. I maintain that while the administrator, who has parted with the fund by a distribution, is protected from suits on claims accruing subsequently, the <em>fund </em>is not protected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Hence I say, that Laverty\u2019s claim is not within the operation of the statute of non-claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-5\">But it is said that a bill in equity might have been sustained against Harrison\u2019s administrator and Wilder immediately after the note became due, and therefore that there was such a demand as should have been presented within two years after administration granted. The note was not due until some nine months of the two years had expired, and there is no statute to meet such a case. 4 Day, 476. To argue that Laverty\u2019s claim against Harrison\u2019s estate must, under these circumstances, be presented within the two years, is to argue that he must also present any other claim accruing within that time, even within five days of the expiration of the time, and though the note be payable in New York, and it be necessary to present it <em>there, </em>in order to bind endorsers. The appellant\u2019s position in this respect cannot be correct \u2014 for a creditor is not bound to act upon the presumption that his claim will not be paid at maturity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-6\">The more reasonable construction of our statute is, that debts and demands on which suits at law may be brought, must be presented within the two years \u2014 a period of time allowed to such creditors to come in. But that in reference to creditors whose claims accrue in such manner, of at such time, as not to allow them the full two years for presentation, there is no limitation, except such as may exist independent of the statute of non-claim. Our statute does not, like those of some of the other States, appoint a time for the presentation of <em>future </em>claims, contingent or otherwise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6J\">But did <em>any right </em>to sue or claim, legal or equitable, accrue to Laverty, prior to the return of <em>nulla tona </em>on the execution against Wilder \u2014 or in other words, was not Laverty\u2019s claim against Harrison\u2019s estate dependent upon the result of the suit at law against Wilder ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-8\">Recent English authorities, and one American, have been cited upon the other side, to show that Laverty had a remedy in the first instance in equity against Harrison\u2019s estate, by joining Wilder, the survivor ; but these cases do not show that it is <em>necessary </em>to resort, to such remedy, to preserve the ulterior liability of the deceased partner\u2019s estate. Indeed, in every decision authorizing this resort to equity in the first instance, the <em>creditor </em>has been the party invoking that remedy. No decision can be found, even in England, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>the election of a different remedy is held to prejudice the rights of the creditor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-5\">I understand the English decisions to amount to this, that, out of great consideration for the <em>creditor, </em>the Courts will <em>permit </em>a resort to equity in the first instance against the estate of the deceased partner,. leaving his representatives to pursae the survivor ; <em>or </em>will permit the creditor to pursue the survivor to recover the amount of the claim, leaving him to settle his accounts afterwards with the representatives of the deceased partner. In other words, there are two remedies \u2014 the one at law, the other in equity \u2014 and the creditor may elect either at his option, but cannot pursue both. Such certainly is the view taken by the Supreme Court in 5 Howard, cited on the other side. The Court say \u2014 the creditor <em>\u201c </em>may, at his <em>option, </em>proceed at law against the surviving partner, or go in the first instance into equity against the representatives of the deceased.\u201d To harrass the survivor by a suit at law and a suit in equity at the same time, on the same cause of action, would certainly seem to be contrary to principle. Besides, the suit at law against the survivor is virtually a proceeding against the estate of both parties, for the judgment and execution bind the joint property \u2014 at least, so it is considered in England \u2014 so far as to <em>preserve </em>the ulterior equity against the estate of the deceased partner. Winter vs. Innes, 4 Myl. and Craig, 111, cited in Collyer on Part., (N. E.,) p. 542.</p>\n<p data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-6\">But in equity, as well as in cases in bankruptcy, the English Courts recognize the prior lien of joint creditors on joint assets, and separate creditors on separate assets \u2014 principles which would seem to be <em>inconsistent </em>with the equitable remedy against the deceased partner in the first instance. Gray vs. Chiswell, 9 Ves., Jr., 118.</p>\n<p data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-7\">That the English doctrine is an invasion upon correct principles, is apparent from the language of Lord Brougham, in Devaynes vs. Noble. (13 Cond. Eng. Chy. Rep., 144.) Lord Thurlow and Lord Eldon would not have recognized the rule as an original question-The latter, indeed, expressed <em>surprise </em>at its introduction, and his-<em>ignorance </em>of its origin! It is apparent also that Lord Brougham had misgivings as to the correctness <em>upon principle </em>of his decision in Devaynes vs. Noble, and yet it is remarkable that in that case the <em>insolvency o\u00ed </em>the survivors-appeared upon the record. Lord Brougham seems to have made' his decision- upon the authority of <em>precedent, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>rather than upon the authority of principle, and certainly there was sufficient precedent to authorize the decision upon the <em>facts of that case. </em>But whatever may be the English rule, and its applicability to a case like this, in England, there can be no doubt that the doctrine of the American Courts fully sustains the complainant in the course he has pursued. 2 Denio, 577. 4 Day, 476. 2 Porter, 171. 6 Conn., 258.</p>\n<p data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-6\">The American rule is, that the deceased partner\u2019s estate cannot be resorted to until the. remedy at law against the survivor is exhausted, or until the survivor <em>become insolvent. </em>This rule is consistent with the English and American doctrine governing the marshalling of joint and separate estates of partners, and is supported by irresistible reasoning. Besides, it has prevailed in the State where the contract was made, and also in our State where the contract is sought to be enforced. Lord Brougham says, in Devaynes vs. Noble, \u201c unless a great and manifest deviation from principle shall have been committed, it may create much further mischief to reverse an individual case by way of correcting a slight error, if that error has been acted upon for a long series of years, than to leave it as it stands.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-7\">It is peculiarly the policy of the slave States to adopt the American rule, for generally the separate estate of the deceased partner in this country consists principally of slave property, the value of which to the family of the deceased cannot be replaced out of the partnership moneys.</p>\n<p data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-8\">It cannot be doubted that Laverly\u2019s claim in any of the States of the Union would not be considered within the statutes of non-claim, but as a contingent claim arising upon the insolvency of Wilder, which appears by the return of <em>nulla bona. </em>Even 'in Alabama, where the statutes of non-claim are most rigid, the case in 4 Day is approved, and such a claim as our\u2019s held not to be within the statute, of non-claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-9\">As to the laches of Laverty complained of, see cases cited on the other side \u2014 and particularly 2 John.

Whether on a bill filed by a creditor of a partnership against the representatives of a deceased partner, it is necessary that the surviving partner should be made a party to the bill after judgment against him at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">2d. Can a creditor of a partnership, upon its dissolution by the death of one of its members, proceed, at once, in equity, against the estate of the deceased partner, without first showing the insolvency of the surviving partner ?</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">Besides these, there are other questions as to the forms of notices, to be given by executors or administrators to persons having debts or demands against the estate of their testator or intestate \u2014 the effect of the statute of non-claim in cases like the present; the mode of exhibition of debts or demands against estates of decedents ; and the effect of the statute of non-claim where equitable rights are involved, or trusts actual or implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">As to the first point, there can be no doubt but that the surviving partner should be made a party to the bill filed against the estate of the deceased partner, for the reason that he is interested in taking an account. Story on Part., 515. Story\u2019s Eq. Pl., 157. Wilkinson vs. Henderson, 1 Mylne &amp; Keen, 582, 589. Burwell vs. Mandeville, Ex. 2 Howard S. C. R., 560, 575. In the latter case, Judge Story remarks, \u201c In general, the surviving partner is liable at law only, and no decree can be made against him, although he may be made a proper party to the suit in equity, as being interested to contest the plaintiff\u2019s demands, unless some other equity intervenes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">It is true, there had been a judgment at law in this case against the surviving partner and a return of <em>nulla bona </em>upon the execution,, still he may have had effects of the firm in his possession not amena<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>ble to the execution, such as liabilities and evidences of debts due the concern. It was moreover a new proceeding, and he might have had an interest in taking the accounts correctly, inasmuch as there might be a remedy over against him by the representatives of the estate by their being substituted in the place of the creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The question whether the creditor of a partnership must in the first place pursue the surviving partner at law, before he can proceed in equity against the estate of the deceased partner, is one of difficulty, and from the <em>fact </em>that this is the first time that it has been presented for adjudication in this Court, we have duly considered <em>it; </em>and we give, with due caution, our views on this embarrassing topic.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The old English doctrine on this subject, though not entirely clear and settled, was, that the joint creditor must, in the first instance, seek his redress against the surviving partner, and that he had no claim in equity against the deceased partner, unless the surviving partner was insolvent or bankrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">This doctrine was based upon the general principle that, the joint estate was the first fund for the payment of the joint debts ; and inasmuch as the joint estate vests in the surviving partner, the joint creditors, upon equitable considerations, ought to resort to the surviving partner before they should endeavor to obtain redress or satisfaction out of the <em>assets </em>of the deceased partner. Bishop vs. Church, 2 Vesey, 100. Ex parte Kendall, 17 Ves., 519. Story on Partnership, 514, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">This doctrine has been since contravened, and it is now held (says Judge Story,) that all partnership debts are to be deemed joint and <em>several; </em>and consequently the joint creditors have in all cases the right to proceed at law against the survivors, and an election also to proceed in equity against the estate of the deceased partner whether the survivors be insolvent, bankrupt or not. Story on Part., 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">This doctrine was first definitely settled in the case of Devaynes vs. Noble, 1 Mer., 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">The case was pending many years, and was first decided by Sir Wm. Grant, and finally by Lord Brougham, 2 Russell &amp; Mylne, 495. It was followed by other decisions to the same effect, and is now the settled and firmly established doctrine of the English law. Wilkinson vs. Henderson, 1 Mylne &amp; Keen, 582, and other authorities cited on page 514, of Story on Partnership, and in, the brief of counsel for appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>The English decisions upon this point have been adopted, as we have seen, by Judge Story, and regarded by him as settling definitely the law on the subject. So, also, Chancellor Kent, in the 3d book of his Commentaries, page 64, uses this language : <em>\u201c </em>But relief may be now had in equity against the representatives of the deceased partner having assets, if the surviving partner be insolvent. And it is now held, that a partnership contract, upon the death of a partner, is in equity to be considered as joint and several and to be treated as the several debt of each partner;\u201d citing <em>in </em>a <em>note 3d </em>Merrivale, 393. 3 Paige, 367<em>; </em>and in that note he says : \u201c A joint creditor</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">may file a bill against the representatives of a deceased partner, though the survivor be not insolvent. He is not compelled to sue the survivor in the first instance.\u201d And then cites the cases of Devaynes vs. Noble, Wilkinson vs. Henderson, 1 Mylne &amp; Keen, 582, and other authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">We have been referred to some American cases by the counsel for appellee, going the other way, such as 2 Peters, 171. 2 Denio, 585. 6 Con., 258. Pendleton vs. Phelps, 4 Day, 477, and others. But to these stands opposed a very recent decision, Nelson, et al., vs. Hill, 5 Howard, 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">The Court in this case uses this very cogent and explicit language: \u201c It is now a rule of law too well settled to be shaken, that the creditor of a partnership may, at his option, proceed at law against the surviving partner, or go in the first instance into equity against the representatives of the deceased partner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">So, too, the Supreme Court of Alabama, in a case reported in 8 Alabama Reports, 577, remarks: <em>\u201c </em>It is true, by the common law, upon the death of a partner, the remedy was gone at law, against his personal representatives, but in equity the liability was held to continue, and it is said could be enforced by bill whether the survivors were solvent or otherwise. Story on Part., 514, and cases there cited. Indeed in this respect, it is now recognized as the well settled doctrine, that there is no distinction between the debts due from partners and those due from other joint debtors. In equity all are considered as joint and several, and the creditors may pursue the personal representatives of the deceased joint debtor or partner, whether the survivors are insolvent or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">The Court then refers to a decision in the case of Marr vs. South<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>wick, et al., 2d Porter, 351, as having been made in opposition to the foregoing principles, and clearly by the above language expresses its dissent to that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Upon a review of the whole subject, we feel constrained to side with the English rule, as adopted by the highest legal tribunals in our own country, and such text writers as Judge Story and Chancellor Kent.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">We deem it consonant with reason and justice, that creditors should possess every facility of enforcing their demands against the estates of those who contracted the obligations, without being obliged to await the law\u2019s delay, by being forced in the first place to pursue the surviving partner, before they can come upon the estate of the deceased partner ; nor can we see any good reason why the death of one of the partners should place the creditor, as to the efficiency of his remedy, in a worse position than if the death had not occurred. Credit is far from being given in any instance to partners on account of their partnership effects, but creditors look, and they have a legal right to do so, not only to those effects, but to the separate property of the individual partners. The <em>lex mercatoria </em>regarded the contract of partners as joint and several, and Courts of Equity have, we think, very wisely adopted that principle. At common law, the rule was different, being then regarded as a joint contract. In Abbot vs. Smith, 2d Black., 949, Chief Justice DeGrey remarks, \u201c that a contract when made with partners is originally a joint contract, but may be separate as to its effects, and that each is answerable for the whole, and not merely for his proportionable part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Creditors certainly cannot complain because a two-fold remedy is afforded them; nor should the heirs or representatives of the deceased partner be querulous \u2014 for we cannot see that any prejudice can accrue to them, by the ability of the joint creditors to render them primarily liable; for if the estate of the surviving partner be solvent, they have a remedy over by virtue of the subsisting equities <em>; </em>and if it be insolvent, it is very certain that the estate of the deceased partner is liable to the payment of the debt. Sir John Leach, in the case of Wilkinson vs. Henderson, 1 Mylne &amp; Keene, 582, bases his decision upon the ground \u2014 \u201cthat the estate of the deceased partner is, at all events, liable to the full satisfaction of the creditors, and must, first or last, be answerable for the failure of the surviving part<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>ner; that no additional charge is thrown upon the assets of the deceased partner by a resort to them in the first instance, and that great inconvenience and expense might otherwise be occasioned to the joint creditors:\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Besides the foregoing reasons, we coincide with the modern rule, as being more compatible and more in consonance with the policy of our statutes, in relation to the settlement of estates of deceased persons. It is the province of every Court, where the policy of law is clearly discernible, to carry out that policy, unless militating against the letter and spirit of the Constitution. Cases of individual hardship may, no doubt, occasionally arise, from the enforcement of this principle, but this is preferable to the infraction of the laws, regulations, or policy of a State.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">All our statutes in relation to the estates of decedents bear upon their face the determination, that estates shall be settled as speedily as possible. The Legislature saw the evil results which would almost inevitably ensue, if estates remained a long time unsettled, arising from the expenses of administration, the detention of property from the legitimate and appropriate owners, the presentation of stale demands, and the litigation springing out of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">To obviate these mischiefs, various statutes were passed, all having the same objects, all converging to one point, the speedy settlement. of estates. Among them is the one invoked by the appellants, which is in the following words : <em>\u201c </em>All debts and demands of whatsoever nature, against the estate of any testator or intestate, which shall not be exhibited within the said two years, shall be forever barred : <em>Provided, </em>That the executor or administrator shall, by advertisement, to be published once a week for the space of four weeks, in some newspaper printed in the State, give notice to all creditors, legatees and persons entitled to distribution, that their claims and demands will be barred at the expiration of the period aforesaid, unless exhibited within the same\u201d \u2014 with a saving to married women, infants, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">Much stress is laid upon the fact, that this statute is of a stringent nature, but for that reason it is not to be disregarded ,\u2022 and if the law-making power prescribes a rigid rule, a corresponding rigid 'observance must follow, and is as much a duty, as though the rule was more mild, qualified, or equitable. Legal morality can draw no dis. tinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>This statute is virtually a statute of limitations, passed not only for the security of the legal representatives, but for the benefit of the heirs and distributees, to effect the speedy and final settlement of estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">By it, and the statute preceding it, (section 2,) the executor or administrator is enabled to ascerfain what debts or demands are due by the estate, so that h\u00e9 can discover whether the estate is solvent or not; while it enables the distributees or legatees to demand distribution of the estate, unless it be necessary for the administrator or executor to retain it longer in his hands, for the purpose of paying debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">If a creditor of a partnership, in case of its dissolution by the death of one of its members, was obliged to exhaust his legal remedies against the surviving partner, before he could proceed against the estate of the deceased partner, the result would be, that the estate would necessarily be kept open and unsettled in many instances for a long period, owing to tedious litigation; and this would be, we have seen, against the policy, and I may add also, the explicit declarations of our statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The statute, too, seems to have contemplated the idea that legatees and distributees should take their portions, discharged from all claims not exhibited within two years ; because the bond they give, upon receiving their portion, refers to debts or demands appearing within two years, after granting the letters testamentary, or letters of administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">If, therefore, the contract of partners be joint and several in equity\u2014 if the joint creditors can proceed primarily against the estate of the deceased partner, and such we deem the law to be \u2014 we are clearly of the opinion that such creditor should exhibit his demand within the time prescribed by our statute. Having an option, he should exercise it; possessing a right, he should pursue it, within the terms of the law. If he does neither, he waives his remedy, and is es-topped by a statute, as obligatory in a Court of Chancery as at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">As to the form of the notice published by Meacham, the administrator of Wilder, we deem it sufficiently correct. It is in these words : \u201c All persons having any claims against the estate of William D. Harrison, deceased, are hereby warned to present them to the subscriber within the time prescribed by law, or they will be forever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>barred of recovery; all those indebted to the estate are requested to make immediate payment.\u201d It embodies, we think, substantially the requirements of the statute ; and although it does not contain the words, \u201c creditors, legatees and persons entitled to distribution,\u201d still we think the words, <em>\u201c </em>all persons having any claims against the estate,\u201d are of so comprehensive a character, that they include and embrace within their meaning, \u201c creditors, legatees and persons entitled to distribution,\u201d upon the principle that the <em>major </em>includes the <em>minor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The statute prescribes two notices, one to be published four the other eight weeks. Whether the one to be published for the latter-period was so published or not does not appear, but the one before the Court, from its substantial conformity to the requisitions of the section containing the statute of non-claim, must be taken by the-Court as a sufficient compliance with the proviso of that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">By the first statute (sec. 2,) the advertisement is merely directory,, while by the second (sec. 6,) it is the condition upon which, on its being complied with, the statute applies as to barring debts or demands. As to the question, what shall constitute an exhibition of a-debt or demand against an estate, we think there should be actual presentation of the claim within the time prescribed, or something-done by the party equivalent to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">The presentation need not be in any particular form, but sufficient to give such notice to the executor or administrator of the existence of the debt or demand, its character and amount, as would enable-him with reasonable certainty to provide for its payment. Mere knowledge on the part of the executor or administrator of the existence of the claim is not enough. The' party holding the claim or demand must pursue some measures to present his demand, and not remain passive, or sleep upon his right. The bringing a suit or action at law or in equity, we would regard as equivalent to an actual presentation, and we think that a debt, though not due, is embraced' within the intention of the statute. In this last point, we are sustained by the decisions in Alabama. Jones\u2019 Ex\u2019rs vs. Lightfoot, 10 Ala. R., 26. King &amp; Barnes vs. Moseley, 5 Ala. R., 610. Pinkston vs. Huie, 9 Ala., 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">The Court, in the case of Pendleton vs. Phelps, indicates an opinion in accordance with the one by us expressed, for it remarks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>\u201c This is different from the case of a demand payable at a future period. We think that the words \u201c debts or demands,\u201d clearly cover debts not due. If A promises to pay B fifty dollars in a year from the date of the promise, it certainly creates a debt on the part of A. It is the obligation or contract that,creates the debt. In the words of counsel it is <em>debitum in praesenti solvendum in futuro.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">It is said that the statute of two years does not bar equities (where there is no concurrent remedy at law) any more than the statute of five years, and that the heirs and distributees of Harrison\u2019s estate are trustees for the debt due by their intestate as a member of the firm of Harrison &amp; Wilder.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">By way of response to these propositions we will cite the case of the Executors of Fisher vs. the Executors of Tucker, 1 McCord Ch. R., 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">It was in the first place decided by Chancellor Wattes, and after-wards affirmed on appeal in the Court of Appeals in South Carolina. The circumstances of that case are very similar to the one at bar. Heriot and Tucker were copartners in trade, and they became indebted to James Fisher in the sum of \u00a31100. Tucker, one of the firm, died, leaving Heriot the surviving partner. A bill was filed against the estate of Tucker by the Executor of Fisher, the creditor, on not being able to procure payment from Heriot, alleging his insolvency. The defendants rested their defence upon the statute of limitations. The Chancellor uses this language : \u201c The books furnish no case in which a Court of Equity has ever felt at liberty to dispense with the operation of the statute against a legal demand, unless there has been some extrinsic equity to authorize it. The cases are numerous to the contrary, but I will only refer to the following: In Read vs. Read, 5 Ves., 744, the Court would not, on a bill for mesne profits, decree an account for more than six years, <em>because more could not be recovered at law. </em>And it is then said that the circumstance of being obliged to sue in equity, does not alter the nature of the action for mesne profits. And in Hovenden vs. Amnesly, 2 Sch. &amp; Lef., 680, Lord Reddesdale says : \u201c Courts of Equity are bound to yield obedience to the statute of limitations upon all legal titles and legal demands.\u201d \u201c It is manifest that the present demand was originally a legal one, and the circumstance of bringing it into this Court will not, as was said by the Court in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>case of Reade vs. Reade, alter its original nature. It is stated to have been for goods sold to the firm of Heriot and Tucker, the remedy for which was exclusively a legal one while the partners were alive, or while the survivor of them was solvent.\u201d The Chancellor decreed that the bill be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Sir Thomas Plummer, Master of the Rolls, says, that after a bar has been fixed by statute to the legal remedy, the remedy in a Court of Equity in analagous cases has been confined to the same period-He then stated it to be clear that had the claim in question before him been a claim of a legal estate in a Court of law, the remedy would have been barred by the statute of limitations, and it was therefore, clear, that being an equitable claim, the remedy was equally barred in a Court of Equity. 3 Brown Ch. R., 630. Angell on Lim., 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">\u201c Courts of Equity,\u201d says Lord Reddesdale, \u201c are not within the words of the statute, because the words apply only to particular legal remedies, but they are within the spirit and meaning of the statute, and have been always so considered.\u201d Angell on Lim., 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">\u201c Whenever,\u201d says Sir Thomas Plummer, \u201c any statute has fixed the period of limitations, by which the claim, if it had been made, in a Court of law, would have been barred, the claim has by analogy, been confined to the same period in a Court of Equity.\u201d And the Supreme Court of the United States say, that Courts of Equity are no more exempt from statutes of limitations than Courts of law. Ib. 26. Melicot vs. O\u2019Donnel, 1 Ball &amp; Beatty, 156. Thomas vs. Heirs of Harvie, 10 Wheat., 149. Ib. 168, 170. 3 Bro. Ch., C., 639, note. 4 Harrington, 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">The contract of partnership is dissolved by the death of one of the partners. At law, the estate of the deceased partner cannot be proceeded against by the joint creditors, because the contract being joint, all the original parties should be joined. Of course, the surviving partner cannot be, because different judgments would have to be given. The resort of the joint creditor against the estate of the deceased partner must be in equity. Now does this, as a result, change the original legal contract into such an equity as to prevent the bar of the statute ? A change of remedy from one at law to one in equity, should not have such a result, and more especially in the face of the words of the statute \u201c all claims or demands of whatsoever nature.,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>To say that the statute should not be a bar in a ca'se like the present, would be an evasion of it. The pleadings create an issue of fact, whether the claim or demand was presented or not within the two years. It is not pretended that it was presented until the 6th December, 1841, being after the expiration of the term prescribed by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">We consider the other point, that the legatees and heirs of Harrison are trustees for this demand, as untenable. There is certainly no express trust, and if one is merely constructive, the statute docs apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">In the case of Townshend vs. Townshend, 1 Brown C. C., 554, the Court say \u2014 \u201cThen, as to trusts being an exception to the statute of limitations, the rule holds only between trustees and <em>cestui que trusts. </em>It is true that the trustee cannot set it up against his <em>cestui que trust; </em>but this is merely the case of a trustee by implication, and as such, affected by an equity \u2014 but that equity must be pursued within some reasonable time. Both courts of law and equity preserve an analogy to the statute of limitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">In Lockey vs. Lockey, Prec. in Ch., 518, the Lord Chancellor was of opinion, that when one receives the profits of an infant\u2019s estate, and six years after he becomes of age he brings a bill for an account, the statute of limitations is as much a bar to the suit, as it would be to an account at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">In Webster vs. Webster, 10 Ves., 93, a bill for an account and payment of a debt was filed against defendant, who pleaded the statute, and though regarded in equity as a trustee, the plea was held a good one. See also 194-5-6 of Angell on Limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">These authorities are cited in the case in 1st McCord, already re. ferred to, and the Court in that case also confirmed the views we have taken as to this last question.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">With these views, we think, therefore, there was error in granting the decree in the Court below, and it is ordered, adjudged and decreed that the bill of complainant be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
