In No. 02-6093, Spotts seeks a writ of mandamus, requesting an expedited ruling on his pending \u00a7 2255 motion and raising substantive arguments, and also moves to proceed in forma pauperis.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-16\">Writs of mandamus and prohibition are extraordinary remedies, which should issue only when the petitioner\u2019s right to the remedy is clear and indisputable and when the petitioner has no other adequate means of relief. <em>See Kerr v. United States, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976); <em>In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826 (4th Cir.1987); <em>In re Vargas, </em>723 F.2d 1461, 1468 (10th Cir.1983). Because we find extraordinary circumstances lacking, we deny the petitions. We grant Spotts\u2019 motion to proceed in forma pauper-is in No. 02-6093. We deny Spotts\u2019 motion for release pending appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-18\">\n<em>PETITIONS DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
