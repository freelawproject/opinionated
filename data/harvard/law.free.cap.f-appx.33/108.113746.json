Mandamus relief is available only when the petitioner has a \u201cclear right to the relief sought.\u201d <em>In re First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>860 F.2d 135, 138 (4th Cir.1988). Further, mandamus is a drastic remedy and should only be used in extraordinary situations. <em>Kerr v. United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976). Mandamus relief is only available when there are no other means by which the relief sought could be granted, <em>In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826 (4th Cir.1987), and may not be used as a substitute for appeal. <em>In re Catawba Indian Tribe, </em>973 F.2d 1133, 1135 (4th Cir.1992). The party seeking mandamus relief carries the heavy burden of showing that he has \u201cno other adequate means to attain the relief he desires\u201d and that his entitlement to such relief is \u201cclear and indisputable.\u201d <em>Allied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 35, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-18\">Rice has failed to show that he has a clear right to the relief sought. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(b) (1994) (granting the Bureau of Prisons plenary power to designate place of confinement); <em>Olim v. Wakinekona, </em>461 U.S. 238, 245-49, 103 S.Ct. 1741, 75 L.Ed.2d 813 (1983) (discussing requests for transfers between state institutions). Moreover, Rice may raise his claims by way of an action pursuant to <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). Accordingly, although we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny Rice\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>terials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
