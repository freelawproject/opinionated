Johnson appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of Appellees on her employment discrimination claims raised under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17 (West 1994 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2001). Johnson also seeks review of the district court\u2019s orders denying numerous discovery requests. We have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs, the joint appendix, the supplemental joint appendix, and the district court\u2019s orders and find no error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-27\">We review the district court\u2019s orders concerning discovery management for abuse of discretion. <em>Wells v. Liddy, </em>186 F.3d 505, 518 n. 12 (4th Cir.1999). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Johnson\u2019s numerous discovery requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">On the merits, the district court properly found that Johnson failed to establish a hostile work environment claim. <em>See Causey v. Balog, </em>162 F.3d 795, 801 (4th Cir.1998), Furthermore, Johnson\u2019s discriminatory discharge and retaliation claims fail because she has failed to show the legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons Appellees offered for terminating her were a pretext for discrimination. <em>See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 137-39, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment on the reasoning of the district court. <em>Johnson v. Quin Rivers Agency for Community Action, Inc., </em>No. CA-00-330-3 (E.D.Va. May 9, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
