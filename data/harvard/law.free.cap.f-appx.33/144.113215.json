Timmons seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Defendants in Timmons\u2019 action alleging employment discrimination. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Timmons\u2019 notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on October 4, 2001. Timmons\u2019 notice of appeal was filed on November 21, 2001. Because Timmons failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">In No. 02-1113, Timmons appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to extend the time to note his appeal from the order entered on October 4. The district court construed the notice of appeal filed on November 21 as a motion to extend the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5). The district court was without authority to construe Timmons\u2019 bare notice of appeal, which contained no request for additional time, as a Rule 4(a)(5) motion. <em>See Wilder v. Chairman, Cent. Classification Bd., </em>926 F.2d 367, 371 (4th Cir.1991); <em>Washington v. Bumgarner, </em>882 F.2d 899, 901 (4th Cir.1989). We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Timmons\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-13\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-14\">No. <em>01-2403\u2014DISMISSED.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-15\">No. <em>02-1113\u2014AFFIRMED.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
