We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s order and the transcript of the proceedings and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-24\">Schwenger appeals the district court\u2019s decision not to disturb the magistrate judge\u2019s ruling denying his motion to suppress evidence. Rule 12(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that motions to suppress evidence must be made before trial. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>115 F.3d 1185, 1190 (4th Cir.1997). Failure to make a motion to suppress before trial constitutes waiver. We find that Schwenger waived the issue of whether evidence should be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-25\">Because the only issue Schwenger raised before the district court was regarding the suppression of evidence, we do not review the other issues raised in his informal brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal conten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>tions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
