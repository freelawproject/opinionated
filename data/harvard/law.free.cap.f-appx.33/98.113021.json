Vega seeks to appeal judgment of his conviction. We dismiss the appeal as to this criminal conviction for lack of jurisdiction because Vega\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Criminal defendants have ten days from the entry of the judgment or order at issue to file a notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b). The appeal periods established by Rule 4 are mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>Browder v. Director, Dept. of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978). The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on January 21, 2001. Vega\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on October 30, 2001. Because Vega failed to file a timely notice of appeal, we dismiss the appeal as to his criminal conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">To the extent that Vega appeals the district court\u2019s orders denying his request for copies of a forensic report and a superseding indictment and his request for transcripts of the grand jury, the plea hearing, and the sentencing hearing at government expense, we have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s orders and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See United States v. Vega, </em>Nos. CR-99-453; CA-01-1898-WMN (D. Md. Oct. 24, 2001; Jan. 15, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
