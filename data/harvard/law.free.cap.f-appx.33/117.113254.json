Wayne Pittman pursuant to 17 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 505 (West 1996), the Copyright Act\u2019s fee-shifting provision. The district court awarded Pittman a total of $277,980 in attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Drive-In contends that the district court erred in various respects in determining the amount of the fee award. Having had the benefit of oral argument and having carefully considered the parties\u2019 briefs, the record, and the relevant legal authority, we conclude that the district court correctly resolved the issues before it. <em>See Drive-In Music Co. v. Killette, </em>No. 3:91-0008 (D.S.C. Mar. 19, 2001) (order granting attorneys\u2019 fees for work performed by Pittman\u2019s lead counsel); <em>Drive-In Music Co. v. Killette, </em>No. 3:91-0008 (D.S.C. Mar. 19, 2001) (order granting attorneys\u2019 fees for work performed by Pittman\u2019s local counsel). Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b161-17\"> The facts of the underlying litigation are reproduced in this court\u2019s prior opinions in this case. <em>See Drive-In Music Co. v. Killette, </em>Nos. 98-2666, 98-2724, 2000 WL 432365 (4th Cir. April 20, 2000) (unpublished) (affirming the district court's disposition of the merits and holding that the district court possessed discretion to grant Pittman an award of attorneys\u2019 fees); <em>Killette v. Pittman, </em>No. 96-1827, 1997 WL 657005 (4th Cir. October 22, 1997) (unpublished) (holding that settlement agreement between two of the parties was binding and reversing a judgment against Pittman on a slander-of-title claim).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
