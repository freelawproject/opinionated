Landoll failed to state a claim in her complaint against her former employer, Pittsylvania County Schools (PCS) and PCS Superintendent Jerry Webb for age, sex, and disability discrimination and whether the district court abused its discretion by refusing to appoint Landoll counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have examined Landoll\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>complaint and find the decision of the district court is without reversible error, with one exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">In her pro se complaint, Landoll alleges that she is a female, her performance was satisfactory in that she earned continuing contract status with PCS, she suffered an adverse employment action when PCS refused to transfer her from Serious Emotional Disturbance to Specific Learning Disabled classes, and a similarly situated male teacher received more favorable treatment when PCS transferred him from an SED to an SLD class. <em>See St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 506, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993) (holding a prima facie case of sex discrimination should show (1) plaintiff is a member of a protected class; (2) plaintiff was performing satisfactorily; (3) plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) a similarly situated employee received favorable treatment). While the district court properly found Landoll failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted for sexual harassment or hostile work environment and dismissed Landoll\u2019s claim pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), the court did not consider Landoll\u2019s sex discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">We conclude the district court erred by dismissing Landoll\u2019s sex discrimination claim against PCS and Superintendent Jerry Webb, in his official capacity, without considering it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Consequently, although we affirm on the district court\u2019s reasoning the dismissal of Landoll\u2019s age and disability claims and the district court\u2019s refusal to appoint counsel, we vacate the dismissal of Landoll\u2019s sex discrimination claim and remand for further consideration. We reject Landoll\u2019s claim on appeal that the district court\u2019s opinion and order contradicts its findings from the bench because, although it expressed sympathy for Landoll\u2019s plight, the district court did not make any findings from the bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">We deny the Appellees\u2019 motion to strike Landoll\u2019s supplemental brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the material before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b120-16\">. Because Landoll did not assign error to the district court\u2019s dismissal of defendant Pittsylvania County Board of Supervisors (Board of Supervisors) and asked this court to remove the Board of Supervisors as a defendant, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>do not consider any claims with respect to the Board of Supervisors on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b121-8\">. Because our conclusion is that the district court erred by dismissing Landoll\u2019s assertion of sex discrimination without considering it, we indicate no view as to the merits or legal sufficiency of this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
