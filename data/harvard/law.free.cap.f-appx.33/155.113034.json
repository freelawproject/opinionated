Although little action occurred in the months following the transfer of the \u00a7 2254 petition, the district court issued an order on March 13, 2002, treating the respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment and ordering Johnson to respond in thirty days. Because of this recent activity, we find no unreasonable delay at present. Thus, mandamus relief is not warranted. Accordingly, although we grant Johnson\u2019s motion to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis, we deny his petition for a writ of mandamus. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
