We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion accepting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Dixon v. Francis, </em>No. CA-00-939-5 (S.D.W.Va. Feb. 14, 2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
