He was sentenced to 600 months imprisonment followed by five years supervised release, and a $500 fine. Anderson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">Counsel for Anderson has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that he has found no meritorious claims for appeal. Anderson, informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, has not done so. In his brief counsel reviews the constitutional requirements for the guilty plea and sentencing. He states that his review of the record discloses \u201cno substantial or meaningful\u201d violations of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 or Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-12\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and find no meritorious issues. Therefore, we affirm Anderson\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-13\">Counsel moves this court to allow him to withdraw as counsel for Anderson on the ground that he has found no meritorious issues for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of the chent\u2019s right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that such a petition be filed but counsel believes that it would be frivolous to do so, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-15\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
