We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Quesenberry\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-29\">Parties are accorded thirty days after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on May 16, 2001. Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on September 27, 2001. Because Appellant failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We also deny Quesenberry\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel, his motion for a hearing, and his motion objecting to the filing fee. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
