In No. 01-7091, Dula appeals the district court\u2019s order granting in part and denying in part his 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp. 2001) motion. With respect to No. 01-4608, we affirm Dula\u2019s conviction and sentence. With respect to No. 01-7091, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-26\">Following a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 hearing, the district court accepted Dula\u2019s plea of guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base. The Government declined to move for a departure from the Guidelines under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1 (2000). The district court denied Dula\u2019s motion for departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 and sentenced him to the minimum term of imprisonment, as calculated under the Sentencing Guidelines, of 188 months, supervised release for five years, and a special assessment of $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-27\">Dula filed a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255, asserting claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The Government filed a motion for summary judgment. The district court granted in part and denied in part Dula\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion and the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment, dismissing all of Dula\u2019s claims except for his ineffective assistance of counsel claim based upon his counsel\u2019s failure to file an appeal. The district court then vacated the criminal judgment and entered a new judgment with the same sentence and conditions from which Dula could file a direct appeal. Dula noted timely appeals both from his conviction and sentence and from the district court\u2019s judgment as to his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">In the appellate brief prepared by counsel in No. 01-4608, Dula contends that the Government breached its agreement to file a motion for downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 after preventing him from providing additional information which could have amounted to substantial assistance. Dula\u2019s plea agreement, however, contained no unconditional promise to file a motion for downward departure but instead left the decision to the Government\u2019s discretion. Dula makes no claim that the Government\u2019s refusal to grant a downward departure was based upon an unconstitutional motive. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992); <em>United States v. Wallace, </em>22 F.3d 84, 87 (4th Cir.1994). Furthermore, the Government presented objective support for its decision to withhold the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, and Dula has failed to demonstrate that the Government acted in bad faith. <em>See United States v. Snow, </em>234 F.3d 187, 190-91 (4th Cir.2000). Accordingly, we hold that the district court did not err in concluding that the Government did not breach the plea agreement. Therefore, we affirm Dula\u2019s conviction and sentence in No. 01-4:608.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">In No. 01-7091, Dula argues that the district court erred by partially dismissing his \u00a7 2255 motion, contending that his sentence violates <em>Apprendi </em>and that his counsel was ineffective in regard to his guilty plea. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss Dula\u2019s appeal of the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion in No. 01-7091 on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See United States v. Dula, </em>Nos. CR-98-282; CA-00-188-5-1 (W.D.N.C. May 31, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">No. <em>01-4608\u2014AFFIRMED.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">No. <em>01-7091\u2014DISMISSED.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
