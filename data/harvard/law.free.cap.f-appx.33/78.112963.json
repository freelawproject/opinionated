We affirm with modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">Because Brotherton failed to object during the supervised release violation hearing, we review for plain error. Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (to obtain reversal on issues not preserved for review, defendant must show error that was plain, affected substantial rights, and seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">Section 3583(d) of Title 18 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-13\">If an alien defendant is subject to deportation, the court may provide, as a condition of supervised release, that he be deported and remain outside the United States, and may order that he be delivered to a duly authorized immigration official for such deportation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-17\">18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(d) (West Supp.2001).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>United States v. Xiang, </em>77 F.3d 771, 772 (4th Cir.1996), we held that Congress intended to permit courts to add as a condition of supervised release deportation by the INS of defendants who are deportable, but authorized district courts only to order that the defendant be delivered to the INS. We further emphasized that the statute does not authorize the court itself to order deportation directly, but that the INS must accomplish the deportation under its established procedures and the court only orders delivery of the defendant to the INS for that purpose. <em>Id. </em>at 772-73. In <em>Xiang, </em>we modified the district court\u2019s order to make clear that the district court was not directly ordering deportation. To eliminate any ambiguity in this case, we modify the district court\u2019s judgment as follows to conform with the language approved in <em>Xiang:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-18\">As a condition of supervised release, upon completion of his term of imprisonment, the defendant is to be surrendered to a duly-authorized immigration official for deportation in accordance with established procedures provided by the Immigration and Naturalization Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 <em>et seq. </em>As a further condition of supervised release, if ordered deported, the defendant shall remain outside the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFg\">Brotherton\u2019s reliance on 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1228(c) is misplaced. In enacting 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1228(c), Congress provided in limited circumstances for direct judicial deportation of aliens convicted of aggravated felonies.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is only under this circumstance that the district court must observe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>specific procedural safeguards. <em>Xiang, </em>77 F.3d at 773. This statute is clearly inapplicable to Brotherton\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">To be clear, Brotherton is assured to receive the proper procedural safeguards by the INS under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1229 (West 1999) because the district court is not directly ordering Brotherton\u2019s deportation, but rather surrendering him to the INS who will seek deportation under the clearly established procedures. <em>See Xiang, </em>77 F.3d at 773 (the exception created in 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1228(c) would be meaningless if 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(d) could be read to authorize judicial deportation for lesser crimes without any procedural safeguards).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court as modified. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-14\">. Brotherton is a deportable alien under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) (West 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b123-19\">. The relevant provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a) were reclassified as 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1228(c) in 1996.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
