We dismiss the appeals for lack of jurisdiction because the orders are not appealable. This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1994), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (1994); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The orders here appealed are neither final orders nor appealable interlocutory or collateral orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">We dismiss the appeals as interlocutory. Ve dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
