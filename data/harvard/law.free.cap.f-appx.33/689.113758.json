He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress cocaine seized from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>rental vehicle he was driving a short time before police officers encountered him outside the vehicle. Finding no error in the district court\u2019s decision, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">We review the factual findings underlying a motion to suppress for clear error, while the legal determinations are reviewed de novo. <em>See Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992). When a suppression motion has been denied, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>See United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Davidson\u2019s assertion that the district court erred in ruling that he lacked standing to challenge the search of the vehicle is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Wellons, </em>32 F.3d 117, 119 (4th Cir.1994). Moreover, Davidson\u2019s challenge to the correctness of the <em>Wellons </em>decision need not be addressed as there is no dispute that the lessee of the vehicle consented to its search. <em>See United States v. Zapata, </em>180 F.3d 1237, 1241 (11th Cir.1999). The district court did not err in denying Davidson\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Davidson\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
