On appeal, counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that there are no meritorious claims on appeal but raising the issue of whether Pharr\u2019s criminal history was properly calculated under the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s arguments on appeal and do not find that the district court erred in determining Pharr\u2019s criminal history. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir.1989) (stating review standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
