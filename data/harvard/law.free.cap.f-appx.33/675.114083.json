Weatherford is the named insured in an executive umbrella policy issued by Auto-Owners Insurance Company. After a collision involving his son, the insurer brought a declaratory judgment action, contending that the definition of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>insured \u201crelative\u201d in the umbrella policy unambiguously excluded a relative who did not reside in the named insured\u2019s household. The district court disagreed and dismissed the action with prejudice. Because the policy\u2019s definition of \u201crelative\u201d is ambiguous, and because the father had a reasonable expectation of coverage for his son, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Defendant Debbie Rae Sarata is the personal representative of the estate of Raymond Beauparlant, who was killed in a collision on September 15, 1999 in Lexington County, South Carolina. Defendant James T. Weatherford was driving the other vehicle involved in the accident. He was twenty-four years old at the time. The issue before us is whether he is a \u201crelative\u201d as that term is defined in the umbrella policy issued by Auto-Owners to his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">The umbrella policy contains the following definitions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-8\">\u201cInsured\u201d means you and also:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-9\">(a) A relative____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-10\">\u201cRelative\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-11\">(a) your relative; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-12\">(b) anyone else, under the age of 21, in your care; who resides in your household.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-13\">Auto-Owners contends that the definition of \u201crelative\u201d in the policy unambiguously excludes a relative who does not live in the named insured\u2019s household, and that the son did not reside in the father\u2019s household when the accident took place. Sarata replies that the policy\u2019s definition of \u201crelative\u201d does not unambiguously exclude a relative of the named insured who is identified in and covered by the underlying automobile liability policy, even if he does not live with the named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-16\">The umbrella policy required the father to maintain an underlying policy for automobile bodily injury liability of $500,000. The umbrella policy provided that \u201c[i]f any underlying insurance is exhausted by any occurrence, we will assume charge of the settlement or defense of any claim against the insured resulting from the same occurrence.\u201d The underlying policy listed the father as the named insured and identified his son as the primary driver of the vehicle involved in the accident. The father paid the premiums on the underlying policy, and the underlying insurer, State Farm Insurance Company, paid its limits of $500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-17\">On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court applied Georgia law and found that the umbrella policy\u2019s definition of \u201crelative\u201d was ambiguous.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It then applied Georgia\u2019s rules for construing insurance policies, which require that ambiguities be strictly construed against the insurer, and that the policy be read in accordance with the reasonable expectations of the insured where possible. <em>Richards v. Hanover Ins. Co., </em>250 Ga. 613, 299 S.E.2d 561, 563 (1983). The district court concluded that the father had an objectively reasonable expectation of coverage for his son, and thus that the son was an insured under the umbrella policy for purposes of claims arising out of the collision. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>Accordingly, the court granted Sarata\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Auto-Owners appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Reviewing the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, see Higgins v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>863 F.2d 1162, 1167 (4th Cir.1988), we agree that the policy language at issue is ambiguous. In view of the non-standard and confusing use of semicolons and, more importantly, the misplacement of the final clause, \u201cwho resides in your household,\u201d the definition of the term \u201crelative\u201d does not unambiguously limit coverage to only those relatives who reside in the insured\u2019s household.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, the reader could reasonably conclude that the clause \u201cwho resides in your household\u201d modifies only line (b) and not the phrase \u201cyour relative\u201d in line (a). The words \u201cyour relative\u201d appear to stand alone. Because there is no way to clearly determine through parsing what the clause \u201cwho resides in your household\u201d modifies, it is far from unreasonable for the insured to expect that any relative specifically insured by an underlying policy is also an insured in the umbrella policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">As the district court observed, qualifying clauses typically modify only the immediately preceding words and phrases. This basic rule of both grammar and interpretation is commonly known as the last antecedent rule. <em>See, e.g., Bakery &amp; Confectionery Union &amp; Indus. Int\u2019l Pension Fund v. Ralph\u2019s Grocery Co., </em>118 F.3d 1018, 1026 (4th Cir.1997); <em>Virginia v. Browner, </em>80 F.3d 869, 877 (4th Cir.1996). The phrase \u201cyour relative\u201d is too far removed from the final clause,, \u201cwho resides in your household,\u201d for the lay reader to unambiguously understand that a relative covered in an underlying policy is excluded in the umbrella policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">Contrary to Auto-Owners\u2019 assertion, the district court correctly concluded that the use of semi-colons in the definition of \u201crelative\u201d does not create an exception to the last antecedent rule because they are employed incorrectly and superfluously. Laypersons cannot be expected to glean that the insurer\u2019s non-standard use of semi-colons indicates a continuation of the items to be modified by the final clause. Instead, they may reasonably disregard improper punctuation in attempting to discern the meaning of contractual language. And when reading the definition without the incorrect punctuation, they may rely on the standard rule of grammar that a clause qualifies only the language which immediately precedes it. Here, only line (b) comes just before the clause \u201cwho resides in your household.\u201d The \u201c(b)\u201d and \u201cor\u201d separate \u201cyour relative\u201d from the remainder of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-12\">In any event, the district court also astutely determined that the ambiguity here is created not by the non-standard use of punctuation, but rather by the word order. And Auto-Owners\u2019 contentions notwithstanding, the semi-colons do nothing to resolve the confusion. On the contrary, the insurer\u2019s use of them in a nonstandard and confusing fashion only makes matters worse.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-13\">As the drafter of this insurance contract, Auto-Owners could have been so clear so easily, thereby avoiding the problem of interpretation that has generated this litigation. For example, the definition of \u201crelative\u201d would have unambiguously limited relatives to residents of the named in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>sured\u2019s household, even with the same punctuation, if it had stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\">\u201cRelative\u201d means someone who resides in your household and is: (a) your relative; or (b) anyone else, under the age of 21, in your care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Auto-Owners has not met its \u201cburden of drafting clear and precise language\u201d indicating that the phrase \u201cyour relative\u201d excludes non-resident relatives covered by the underlying policy. <em>See Richards, </em>299 S.E.2d at 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Auto-Owners further argues that its format and punctuation pattern in other policy definitions require the clause \u201cwho resides in your household\u201d to be read as qualifying the phrase \u201cyour relative.\u201d Again, we agree with the district court that neither the indentations and line spacing nor the punctuation pattern eliminate the ambiguity. The differences in vertical line spacing are not readily apparent, nor can lay readers be expected to understand or even notice a pattern of superfluous punctuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">Finally, Auto-Owners submits that it not only is unreasonable but also \u201cdefies logic\u201d for the father to expect coverage for any remote relative no matter where located. As seductive as this argument may at first appear, such an implication simply does not follow from an interpretation that does not qualify the phrase \u201cyour relative\u201d with the final clause, \u201cwho resides in your household.\u201d As the district court observed, \u201cit is unlikely that a named insured would purchase the required $500,000 of underlying coverage for such a remote relative or designate a remote relative as the primary driver.\u201d And in view of the way this contract was drafted, as well as the fact that by design umbrella and underlying policies often have the same scope, it is certainly reasonable for the father to expect that a relative identified in and insured by the underlying policy is also an insured in the umbrella policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">In short, it is very difficult for the average person to read this policy and understand what is going on. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b717-14\">. Georgia law is controlling because the umbrella policy was issued in Georgia to a Georgia resident. A federal court sitting in diversity must apply the choice of law rules of the forum state. <em>Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., </em>313 U.S. 487, 496, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 85 L.Ed. 1477 (1941). And in insurance coverage disputes, South Carolina courts apply \"the law of the state in which application for insurance was made, the policy delivered, and the contract formed.\u201d <em>Unisun Ins. Co. v. Hertz Rental Corp., </em>312 S.C. 549, 436 S.E.2d 182, 184 (Ct.App.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b718-7\">. Semi-colons act either as weak periods or as strong commas. Sidney Greenbaum, <em>The Oxford English Grammar % </em>11.17 (1996). In standard usage, they are not employed to indicate a continuation of the items to be modified by a final clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
