We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the order is not appealable. This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1994), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (1994); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The order here appealed is neither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order. <em>Miller v. Simmons, </em>814 F.2d 962, 964-65 (4th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-19\">We deny as moot Appellants\u2019 motion to expedite the appeal and dismiss the appeal as interlocutory.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-20\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b128-14\"> In addition, we lack jurisdiction to entertain a pleading recently filed by Hazel that relates to the district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(b) motion in an apparently unrelated habeas proceeding. Hazel asks this Court to restore his appellate rights, send him a copy of the magistrate judge\u2019s report, and reassign his case. Because the decision challenged by Hazel was denied on May 2, 2001, we have no authority to consider Hazel\u2019s individual request for relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
