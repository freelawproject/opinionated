We have reviewed the record and the district court order and find no error. Accordingly, we affirm. Neal failed to show such action was necessary to achieve justice or that sound reasons exist for not raising this claim earlier. We deny Neal\u2019s motion to authorize preparation of a transcript at government expense. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-19\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
