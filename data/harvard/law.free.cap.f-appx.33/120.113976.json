She was sentenced to a total of 181 months imprisonment. Williams noted a timely appeal and her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Williams was informed of her right to file a pro se supplemental brief, and she has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Williams, through counsel, questions the district court\u2019s decision not to award an adjustment based upon acceptance of responsibility. Prior to her arrest, Williams had advised law enforcement officers that she knew her co-defendant was a drug dealer and that she served as his \u201cco-pilot\u201d for the transactions. During her interview for the pre-sentence report, Williams retracted those statements, but maintained her guilty plea to the crimes. The probation officer recommended denying a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility due to Williams\u2019 retractions. The district court accepted the probation officer\u2019s recommendation and sentenced Williams to the statutory minimum for each crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">We find Williams\u2019 sentence is appropriate under relevant statutory and guideline provisions. Because Williams did not object to the pre-sentence report, we review her claim for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Furthermore, an adjustment based upon acceptance of responsibility lies squarely within the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3E1.1 (2000). The district court questioned Williams regarding her two stories and she responded that she did not know why she changed her mind. Throughout the proceedings, though, Williams consistently admitted her guilt to the crimes charged. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record and find no meritorious issues. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
