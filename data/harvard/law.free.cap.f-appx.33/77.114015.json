Hopkins appeals from the district court\u2019s order dismissing his cM rights action as frivolous under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00a9 (West Supp.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">The district court dismissed the claims as frivolous under \u00a7 1915(e) based on Hopkins\u2019 fa\u00fcure to allege certain facts and to support his claims with evidence. Because Hopkins may be able to particularize his complaint to state non-frivolous claims arising from the events described in the complaint, <em>see Coleman v. Peyton, </em>340 F.2d 603, 604 (4th Cir.1965), we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand the case to permit Hopkins the opportunity to particularize his complaint.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In so doing, we express no opinion whether Hopkins\u2019 complaint, as particularized, can pass muster under \u00a7 1915(e) or whether an amended complaint can survive a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment. Likewise, this disposition indicates no view of the merits of Hopkins\u2019 claims. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-13\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b122-11\"> We note dismissing Hopkins\u2019 complaint without prejudice would be ineffective in this case because Title VII restricts Hopkins\u2019 filing time to 90 days after receipt of the right to sue notice and that time has now expired. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e\u20145(f)(1) (West 1994 &amp; Supp. 2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
