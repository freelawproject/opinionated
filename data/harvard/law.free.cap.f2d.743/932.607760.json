(\u201cEureka\u201d), a Netherlands Antilles Corporation, to insure certain real property in the District of Columbia known as Carrollsburg Square. This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">On April 30, 1979, Eureka announced its intention to convert into condominiums one of the large buildings in Carrollsburg Square. Eureka\u2019s efforts met with opposition from tenants relying on the protections granted by Section 602 of the Rental Housing Act of 1977 (District of Columbia Law 2-54). Eureka\u2019s policy with CTI contained a special Note II which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2Ek\">The policy insures against loss or damage arising out of an enforcement or attempted enforcement of the rights, if any, of Tenants in the property pursuant to the provisions of Section 602 of the Rental Housing Act of 1977 (District of Columbia Law 2-54) or the Emergency Multi-Family Rental Housing Purchase Act of 1979, as the same may be amended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">On May 9, 1979 the tenants asked the District of Columbia Rent Administrator to conduct an investigation to determine whether their \u00a7 602 rights had been violated. The Rent Administrator dismissed the tenants\u2019 petition, but on August 14, 1979, the D.C. Rental Accommodations Commission reversed the Administrator\u2019s decision in part and enjoined Eureka from proceeding with the conversion. Because of that injunction, Eureka\u2019s exclusive sales agent, Shannon and Luchs, refused to commence sales as planned. Sales did not begin until early November, after Eureka agreed to indemnify Shannon and Luchs for any liability arising from its sales activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-9\">The Rental Accommodations Commission injunction remained in effect until January 4,1980. In addition, during the fall of 1979 the tenants brought suit in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia to enjoin the conversion; and on December 27, 1979 the D.C. Department of Housing and Community Development sent a letter to Eureka threatening to issue a cease and desist order.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-11\">Eureka opposed the tenants\u2019 actions and kept CTI informed about all developments as they occurred. CTI promptly agreed that the tenant actions were within the risks covered by Note II and agreed to pay all of Eureka\u2019s legal expenses in opposing the tenants. Eureka began settlement negotiations with the tenants in the fall of 1979. During January and early February 1980, representatives of Eureka had several meetings with CTI officials, but reached no agreement on settlement terms the insurer could approve.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-14\">Eureka entered a settlement agreement without CTI\u2019s consent on February 6, 1980. This agreement eliminated the major obstacles arising from the tenants\u2019 actions under \u00a7 602. Eureka was not able, however, to begin closing on condominium sales until March 21, 1980 because it lacked necessary permissions from District of Columbia and federal officials and from certain private entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-15\">At trial, Eureka claimed the cost of its settlement with the tenants, delay damages, and attorney\u2019s fees. The court found that CTI was liable under the policy despite Eureka\u2019s unilateral settlement with the tenants. It awarded Eureka the full cost of the settlement and $100,000 in delay damages, but rejected Eureka\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees. In this appeal, CTI contends that the trial court erred (1) in finding that Eureka\u2019s unilateral settlement with the tenants was justified by CTI\u2019s wrongful refusal to admit liability for delay damages; (2) in denying discovery of certain documents which CTI contends would show that Eureka breached the duty of cooperation it owed CTI under the policy; and (3) in awarding delay damages that were unjustified by the evidence. Eureka on cross-ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>peal urges us to award attorney\u2019s fees that were denied by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">We affirm the trial court\u2019s finding of liability and its award of settlement costs for the reasons given in its opinion. For the reasons given below, we sustain the district court\u2019s ruling on the discovery issue; we reverse in part the award of delay damages and remand for a new determination of their amount; and finally, we sustain the refusal to award Eureka attorney\u2019s fees incurred in its action against CTI but remand to assess the attorney\u2019s fees Eureka incurred in reaching a settlement with the tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">II. The Discovery Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">CTI has argued throughout this litigation that it is excused from any breach of its insurance policy with Eureka because Eureka breached the duty of cooperation it owed CTI under the policy. CTI contends that Eureka breached this duty by planning legal action against CTI with Daniel Singer and his firm, Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver, &amp; Kampelman (\u201cFried, Frank\u201d), who at the time were counsel to both CTI and Eureka in their common interest in defeating tenant claims. To gather support for this claim, CTI sought discovery from Eureka of documents relating to Eureka\u2019s consultation with Fried, Frank about legal action against CTI. Upon Eureka\u2019s resistance on grounds of attorney-client privilege, the district court ordered the disclosure only of those documents that related to the tenant dispute or were prepared with a view toward litigation with the tenants, in effect upholding Eureka\u2019s claim of privilege. The district court found after trial that CTI had failed to establish Eureka\u2019s alleged noncooperation. CTI now contends that the denial of discovery was in error (and prejudicial) insofar as it prevented disclosure to CTI of seven documents regarding (to the extent withheld) Eureka\u2019s possible claims against CTI: four memoranda to Mr. Singer from other Fried, Frank attorneys; two telexes from Mr. Singer to a Eureka official; and notes by Mr. Singer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-11\">CTI concedes that, in preparing the documents, \u201cEureka and Fried Frank were acting against CTI\u2019s interest.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This concession confirms Eureka\u2019s statement that, although Fried, Frank \u201crepresented CTI and Eureka <em>jointly </em>with respect to the defense of the tenant ... actions,\u201d it \u201crepresented Eureka <em>individually </em>with respect to the conversion generally and Eureka\u2019s rights <em>vis-a-vis </em>CTI.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Against the background of Fried, Frank\u2019s longstanding representation of Eureka in all aspects of the condominium conversion, including the negotiation of the insurance policy, there can be no doubt that Eureka and Mr. Singer thought they had an attorney-client relationship in which communications were privileged from CTI to the extent those communications concerned possible legal action against CTI. For the following reasons, this conclusion justifies Eureka\u2019s invocation of the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-12\">CTI and Eureka agree that Wigmore\u2019s treatise states the relevant law of attorney-client privilege.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This case falls at the intersection of two principles stated by Wigmore. First, \u201ca communication by A to X as the common attorney of A and B, who afterwards become party opponents, is not privileged as between A and B since there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>was no secrecy between them at the time of communication.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Second,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-5\">[a] communication by A to X as A\u2019s attorney, X being then also the attorney of B, now become the party opponent, is ordinarily privileged because of the relation of X toward A. Nor does the fact of A\u2019s knowledge that X is already B\u2019s attorney, nor the fact of B\u2019s being already adversely interested destroy the privilege. This is so because, although X ought not to undertake to act for both in any matter where there is a possibility of adverse interests, nonetheless A is protected by reason of the relation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVMp\">Evidently in contemplation of the situation presented here (the matter on which X represents B being a matter of common interest to A and B as joint clients of X), Wig-more points out that, \u201c[i]n practice, difficulty often will arise here in distinguishing this situation from that of\u201d the first principle.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">CTI contends that this case falls under Wigmore\u2019s first principle, which can be found as well in C. McCormick, Handbook of the Law of Evidence 219-20 (3d ed. 1984) and in many cases, <em>e.g., Truck Insurance Exchange v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Co., </em>66 F.R.D. 129, 132 (E.D.Pa.1975); <em>LaRocca v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>47 F.R.D. 278, 280 (W.D.Pa.1969); <em>Henke v. Iowa Home Mutual Casualty Co., </em>249 Iowa 614, 87 N.W.2d 920 (1958). Eureka contends to the contrary that this case falls under Wigmore\u2019s second principle.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For several reasons, we agree with Eureka.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">First, Wigmore\u2019s first principle presupposes the absence of secrecy between the parties at the time of communication. Here, although there was no secrecy with respect to the defense of tenant claims, Eureka assuredly was concealing from CTI its consideration of legal action against the latter. Second, and closely related, Wig-more\u2019s first principle presupposes that the communication at issue was made in the course of the attorney\u2019s joint representation of a \u201ccommon interest\u201d of the two parties.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Here, although Fried, Frank was representing Eureka and CTI in a matter of common interest at the time the communications at issue were made, those communications were not made in the course of its representation on that matter; indeed, they were made in the course of representation distinctly not in the interest of CTI. The policy behind Wigmore\u2019s first principle \u2014 to encourage openness and cooperation between joint clients \u2014 does not apply to matters known at the time of communication not to be in the common interest of the attorney\u2019s two clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-13\">The communications sought here were made not only after the interests of CTI and Eureka diverged but after their common attorney knew they diverged and undertook separate representation of Eureka on this understanding. Eureka and Mr. Singer thus expressly understood there to be an attorney-client relationship between them distinct from the one to which CTI was a party. In this crucial respect, this case differs from the leading cases under Wigmore\u2019s first principle, where the party claiming a privilege (and his attorney) had no reasonable expectations of confidentiality for the privilege to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-14\">Given Eureka\u2019s expectations of confidentiality and the absence of any policy favoring disclosure to CTI, Eureka should not be deprived of the privilege even if, as CTI suggests, the asserted attorney-client relationship should not have been created. We need not express any view on CTI\u2019s contention that Fried, Frank should not have simultaneously undertaken to repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>sent Eureka in an interest adverse to CTI and continued to represent CTI in a closely-related matter. As Wigmore\u2019s second principle expressly states, counsel\u2019s failure to avoid a conflict of interest should not deprive the client of the privilege. The privilege, being the client\u2019s, should not be defeated solely because the attorney\u2019s conduct was ethically questionable. We conclude, therefore, that Eureka was privileged not to disclose the requested documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">III. Delay Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">Eureka requested $1.3 million in so-called delay damages. These consisted of financial carrying charges, losses from operating rental properties, and increases in advertising and sales costs, transfer taxes, and commitment fees which were incurred by reason of the failure to sell all the condominiums as soon as would have occurred but for the tenant actions vindicating \u00a7 602 rights. Its calculation of the amount of these items rested on two assumptions: (1) that in the absence of such tenant actions, closings on the units in phase I would have begun on November 1, 1979; and (2) that all units in phase I would have been sold by the end of March 1980. The district court rejected both assumptions. It found that even absent tenant actions Eureka would not have been able to begin closings until March 1980 because it lacked necessary approvals from federal and local authorities and from certain private institutions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It further found that Eureka\u2019s projections of a five-month sellout were \u201cseriously flawed\u201d and \u201clittle more than guesswork.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because neither of the assumptions on which Eureka\u2019s calculations rested were supported by the evidence, the court rejected the calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">The court found, nonetheless, that Eureka had suffered delay damages as a result of the tenants\u2019 actions and had carried its burden of establishing the amount of this injury with the \u201creasonable certainty\u201d that District of Columbia law requires.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The injury the court found was of three sorts: (a) Delays in commencing sales caused Eureka to lose some potential sales and forced it to continue its sales effort longer than expected and in a less favorable market. (b) Even after sales were commenced, a similar effect was produced by the inability to tell prospective purchasers when they could close and therefore what financing would be available, (c) Tenant actions also damaged Eureka by diverting effort from other tasks; it was a \u201cmatter of common sense ... that if this effort had been expended in other ways the conversion would have been more successful.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We consider each of these in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-14\">(a) The record supports the finding that the tenant actions delayed the beginning of Eureka\u2019s sales effort from September to November, 1979. CTI argues, however, that this delay in beginning sales did no harm, since Eureka would have received no money until a closing took place, and closings could not have begun until March 1980 in any case. This argument ignores the fact that the number of units Eureka could close on in March was determined by the sales which took place prior to the initial closing date. Had Eureka been able to commence sales as scheduled in September, it is probable that it would have been able to close on a larger number of units in March.. That would have reduced Eureka\u2019s carrying charges and other expenses in subsequent months. The damages Eureka is entitled to under the rubric of lost sales are not, as the appellant seems to suppose, expenses incurred before March 1980, but rather additional expenses incurred after that date because units that would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>been sold by then (if there had been no delay in commencing sales due to tenant actions) remained unsold for some time thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\">It is true that Eureka did not\u2014 and obviously could not \u2014 demonstrate particular lost sales. But in light of the evidence that sales conditions were particularly favorable in Fall 1979, it is reasonable to assume that if Eureka had started one month earlier it would have made by the end of each successive month at least the number of sales it in fact made at the end of the following month. Where the plaintiff has shown with this degree of certainty the fact of losses, courts will not deny recovery merely because it is difficult to determine the exact amount.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-5\">\u201cIn such case, while the damages may not be determined by mere speculation or guess, it will be enough if the evidence show the extent of the damages as a matter of just and reasonable inference, although the result be only approximate.\u201d [<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">This general principle of the law of damages applies not only when the defendant is a tortfeasor who caused the injury complained of but also when the defendant is an insurance company.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s award of damages for expenses attributable to delay in beginning sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">As for (b) sales lost, and delay damages thereby caused, through uncertainty over closing dates: In light of the district court\u2019s finding that the closing was in any event dependent upon governmental and private permissions which were not obtained until March 1980, this uncertainty would have existed even if the tenants had not pursued their \u00a7 602 remedies, and any consequent damages are therefore not attributable to the actions against which CTI insured Eureka.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As for (c) delay damages Eureka suffered because tenant actions distracted it from other activities: The record provides no basis on which to determine what distractions Eureka may have endured because of the tenants\u2019 actions or what effects those distractions may have had on the overall conversion effort. Damages may not be awarded on the basis of mere speculation or guesswork.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although it may be a matter of \u201ccommon sense\u201d that things would have gone better for Eureka if it had not been forced to deal with tenant claims under \u00a7 602, such conjectures are too speculative to support an award of damages, especially to a new business with no proven record and no experience in the Washington condominium market.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-12\">Although we have found ample basis to support the award of delay damages on the basis of lost sales ((a) above), we have difficulty in sustaining the amount of the award. The district court did not describe how its $100,000 delay damages award was computed, or even specify the portions attributable to each of the three factors discussed above. Its only explanation was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-13\">As trier of fact viewing the record as a whole the Court awards damages in the amount of $100,000, as representing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>reasonable award for the injuries outlined above.[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">This does not suffice. While damage awards are findings of fact which will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> it is essential that the trial court give sufficient indication of how it computed the amount so that the reviewing court can determine whether it is supported by the record.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-5\">[T]he measure of damages and method of computation [must] be exposed so as to inform the litigants and afford a possibility of intelligent review.[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">We remand to the District Court for re-determination of this item of damages and further articulation of the basis for its calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">IV. The Attorney\u2019s Fees Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">Eureka presents two claims for attorney\u2019s fees: 1) attorney\u2019s fees incurred in defending and settling tenants\u2019 claims; 2) attorney\u2019s fees incurred in connection with this litigation against CTI. The district court rejected both claims. Eureka appeals the denial of both.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-9\">A. <em>Attorney\u2019s Fees Related to the Tenant Actions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-10\">Eureka seeks $67,656.38 in legal fees it paid to Fried, Frank for services rendered in connection with the tenant actions. Section 3 of the title insurance policy requires CTI, \u201cat its own cost and without undue delay, ... [to] provide for the defense of an insured in all litigation consisting of actions or proceedings commenced against such insured ...\u201d involving matters covered by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-18\">When Eureka informed CTI on May 23, 1979 of the tenants\u2019 section 602(b) actions filed on May 9th of that year, CTI undertook to fulfill its defense obligations under the policy by agreeing to pay Fried, Frank, then Eureka\u2019s attorney, for work performed in defense of the tenants\u2019 claims. CTI was billed directly by Fried, Frank for all such work until February 4, 1980.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> At that point, disagreements concerning the advisability of settling with the tenants and CTI\u2019s liability for delay damages had caused such deterioration in relations between Eureka and CTI that litigation between the parties appeared imminent. As a result, Fried, Frank informed CTI that it could no longer represent both parties and that CTI should no longer pay Fried, Frank's fees.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-19\">Because of its holding that CTI\u2019s failure to confess liability for delay damages caused by the tenant actions breached the contract of insurance and justified Eureka\u2019s decision to proceed on its own toward a resolution of the tenant actions,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the district court ruled correctly that CTI was \u201cliable for the costs, if proven, of services performed by independent counsel in connection with Eureka\u2019s efforts to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>solve the tenants\u2019 challenge to title.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> However, the district court found that Eureka\u2019s evidence was insufficient to support an award of $67,656.38 in unreimbursed attorney\u2019s fees and rejected the entire claim. We find that this ruling was clearly erroneous and remand to the district court for further proceedings to assess the amount of attorney\u2019s fees to which Eureka is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">The district court relied on two factors in concluding that Eureka\u2019s evidence was insufficient. First, Eureka submitted only Fried, Frank\u2019s unitemized bills stating that the work related to tenant 602 claims. Daniel Singer, Eureka\u2019s principal legal adviser at Fried, Frank, testified at length at trial on other matters without providing any detailed information in support of the invoices.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Second, the tenant settlement was signed on February 5, 1980, and \u201c[t]he bulk of the services performed by Fried, Frank ... [thereafter] related to various government approvals that would have been required even in the absence of the tenant actions.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> According to the court, one of the invoices was for work performed between May 1 and August 5, 1980, long after the tenant dispute had been resolved. Since it was \u201cimplausible that Fried, Frank performed any services during this period relating to tenants\u2019 efforts to enforce section 602,\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and no evidence had been introduced to show what portion of the $67,-656.38 was related to the tenant actions, the court could not apportion the fees claimed between services that were covered by the policy and those that were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">However, in a private action for damages an itemized bill is not necessary to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case on the amount of attorney\u2019s fees. It is most important to note the distinction between claims for attorney\u2019s fees brought in the context of private damages actions and those made under a statute authorizing recovery of attorney\u2019s fees by prevailing parties in suits against the government or in civil rights cases. In the latter category of cases, the court must establish a \u201creasonable fee\u201d for the legal services involved in the action.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-18\">The most useful starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate. This calculation provides an objective basis on which to make an initial estimate of the value of a lawyer\u2019s services. The party seeking an award of fees should submit evidence supporting the hours worked and rates claimed. Where the documentation of hours is inadequate, the district court may reduce the award accordingly.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHXg\">Time recordkeeping must be relatively detailed in such cases for several reasons not applicable to private damages actions. For instance, when fees are awarded to a prevailing party under a statute, hours may have to be allocated between time expended on claims on which the party in fact prevailed and hours spent on unsuccessful issues.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Moreover, the desire to maintain a continuing relationship with a client, the usual incentive for a law firm to charge only reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, is absent when fees are charged to the government or to another nonprevailing party. Attorneys in such cases \u201cneed fear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>no future loss of business to the firm if the fees they seek ... are unreasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Consequently, \u201c[s]pecial caution is required because of the incentive which the [federal agency\u2019s] 'deep pocket\u2019 offers to attorneys to inflate their billing charges and to claim far more as reimbursement then would be sought or could reasonably be recovered from most private parties.\"<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">In contrast, in a private damages action, the court is not asked to set the attorney\u2019s fees. Rather, once a finding of liability for attorney\u2019s fees has been made, the role of the trier of fact is the same as in any other case involving a claim for expenses as consequential damages \u2014 to determine whether the expense has in fact been paid or incurred, whether the expense is related to the wrong upon which liability has been based, and whether the expense was reasonable.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> District of Columbia law has firmly established that submission of a paid bill, supported by testimony of the claimant or claimant\u2019s agent that the expense was occasioned by defendant\u2019s wrong, is sufficient <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the amount of damages.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Once a <em>prima facie </em>case of damages has been established by the claimant, the burden of production shifts to the opponent to go forward with evidence tending to mitigate or abate the damages or to undermine the credibility of the claimant\u2019s case.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-11\">The facts adduced at trial were clearly sufficient to meet Eureka\u2019s burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>showing of the amount of attorney\u2019s fees. The district court had before it Schedule V of Eureka Exhibit No. 125, prepared by Price Water-house, Eureka\u2019s expert accounting witness.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Exhibit 125 represented Price Waterhouse\u2019s expert opinion, based upon examination of Fried, Frank\u2019s invoices and Eureka\u2019s checks paying those invoices, that Eureka had paid Fried, Frank $67,656.38 \u201cfor services rendered in connection with tenant actions not reimbursed by Chicago <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>Title Insurance Company.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> John Leyes, a Price Waterhouse partner and certified Public Accountant, also testified at trial that the accounting firm had \u201cexcluded from the invoices actions which were not associated with the legal services, for things other than tenants\u2019 actions____\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Eureka\u2019s managing director also testified that the bills were paid for legal services performed in resolving the tenant actions.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">Moreover, there was, contrary to the district court\u2019s holding, ample evidence in the record to support the conclusion that a substantial number of hours were expended by Fried, Frank in litigation and settlement of the tenant actions during the time period covered by the invoices. To begin with, the district court erroneously concluded that the invoices covered only services performed after February 4, 1980, when Daniel Singer wrote to CTI to indicate that they would no longer be billed directly for defense of the tenants\u2019 claims. Since the tenant settlement agreement was signed on February 5, 1980, the judge reasoned that Fried, Frank could not have performed much work in connection with the tenant claims thereafter.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> However, the parties stipulated that \u201cFried, Frank did not send CTI statements for legal services performed from January 1, through midnight February 4, 1980.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Moreover, the May 1, 1980 invoice itself states that it covers services rendered on the tenant claims from \u201cJanuary 1, 1980 through March 31, 1980.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The record shows that substantial amounts of legal work were performed by Fried, Frank on the tenant settlement and related tenant matters between the beginning of January and February 4, 1980.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-16\">Second, the district court erroneously concluded that \u201cthe record does not suggest that Fried, Frank performed work in connection with the settlement [after February 5, 1980].\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> To the contrary, the record shows that Fried, Frank continued to perform substantial legal services for Eureka in connection with the tenant actions throughout the first half of 1980. These services included arranging for the formal dismissal of the tenant actions,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> finalizing the escrow arrangements required by the tenant settlement agreements,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> and opposing attempts by \u201choldout\u201d tenants to assert section 602(b) claims before the Department of Housing and Community Development.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-17\">Third, the court concluded that one of the invoices was for work apparently performed between May 1 and August 5, 1980, a time so long after the resolution of the tenant dispute that it is \u201cimplausible that Fried, Frank performed any services during this period relating to tenants\u2019 efforts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>to enforce section 602.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> However, as Eureka\u2019s accounting expert indicated at trial, the date on the invoice did not necessarily mean that the services covered by that invoice were performed between that date and the date of the preceding invoice.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Rather, as the invoice itself indicated, the August 5 bill covered services performed between April 1, 1980 and June 30, 1980,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> a period during which Fried, Frank was still involved in defending claims brought by \u201chold out\u201d tenants.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"aeh-dedup-0\">Finally, the court held that [t]he bulk of the services performed by Fried, Frank after February 4, 1980, related to obtaining various governmental approvals that would have been required even in the absence of the tenant actions. Eureka presented no evidence that these services were paid for separately, or, if not, what portion of the $67,656.38 represented fees for these services.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1008-13\">To the contrary, as has been noted above, both the Price Waterhouse exhibit and the testimony of John Leyes, Eureka\u2019s accounting expert, suggested that fees for services other than those involving the tenant actions had been excluded in calculating the fees claimed.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Leyes also specifically testified that the amount claimed in this action comprised only that portion identified as relating to the tenant actions out of total fees in excess of $110,000 paid by Eureka to Fried, Frank during the period in question.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-14\">This evidence by itself would have been sufficient to meet Eureka\u2019s burden of proving a <em>prima facie </em>case on the amount of attorney\u2019s fees. However, the court also had before it CTI Exhibit No. 179, providing additional proof that Fried, Frank had billed services relating to the tenant actions separately from time spent in pursuit of Eureka\u2019s other interests.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> The exhibit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>demonstrates that Fried, Frank established separate accounts for the various matters handled by the firm for Eureka. Work concerning the condominium conversion as such, including the pursuit of required government approvals, purchase of the fee, and financing matters, were billed to one account. Services concerning the tenant actions, as well as early negotiations with CTI concerning the form and substance of, and CTPs possible contributions to, the tenant settlement, were billed to a separate account, and a third account was established to cover services rendered in connection with the litigation between Eureka and CTI.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Separate invoices were provided for each of these accounts.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Time sheets indicate that attorneys adhered to these billing distinctions in submitting their time charges.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1009-20\">In sum, it cannot be said that Eureka failed to meet its burden of producing evidence sufficient to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case on the amount of attorney\u2019s fees paid by Eureka in connection with the tenant actions. We therefore remand this issue to the district court for entry of an appropriate award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-21\">B. <em>Attorney\u2019s Fees Related to the Present Litigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1009-22\">Eureka\u2019s claim for the award of attorney\u2019s fees incurred in this action presents a wholly different picture, however. It is well established that the American rule ordinarily bars the award of attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> It is equally well established that a successful litigant may recover attorney\u2019s fees \u201cwhen his opponent has acted \u2018in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>oppressive reasons.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>60</footnotemark> The \u201cbad faith\u201d exception to the general rule against award of attorney\u2019s fees is a narrow one, however, to be applied only in exceptional circumstances.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> The district court correctly found that the facts of this case do not fit within its narrow exception.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"aml-dedup-1\">CTI\u2019s failure to confess its liability for Eureka\u2019s delay damages may have been wrongful and a breach of its obligations under the policy, but it cannot be said that this error rose to the level of bad faith. As the court below observed, CTI simply failed \u201cto recognize promptly that its representative Cooney had provided Eureka with coverage for a novel and substantial risk.\u201d <footnotemark>63</footnotemark> An insurer\u2019s failure to respond immediately to a claim does not necessarily amount to bad faith justifying an award of attorney\u2019s fees incurred in subsequent litigation between the insurer and the insured,<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> particularly where, as here, \u201cno past experience or body of interpretation provided guidanee\u201d to the parties.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> CTI\u2019s overall \u201cgood faith\u201d toward its insured is amply demonstrated by its prompt assumption of responsibility for defense of the tenant actions before Eureka had even been named as a respondent in those actions. Thus, the trial court\u2019s denial of Eureka\u2019s demand for attorney\u2019s fees incurred in this litigation must be upheld,</p>\n<p id=\"ALB\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"acw-dedup-0\">_ We affirm the trial court\u2019s finding of liability and its award of settlement costs ^or the reasons given in its opinion; we sustain the district court s ruling on the discovery issue; we reverse in part the award of delay damages and remand for a new determination of their amount; and finally, we sustain the refusal to award Eureka attorney\u2019s fees incurred in its action against CTI but remand to assess the attorney s fees Eureka incurred in reaching a settlement with the tenants,</p>\n<p id=\"aj7-dedup-0\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">.

Nothing in the record suggests any intention on the part of Eureka to relinquish its claim to attorney\u2019s fees for the tenant actions. It seems more plausible to interpret Fried, Frank\u2019s instructions to CTI as a simple acknowledgment of the reality that CTI could not be expected to pay legal fees for consummation of a settlement to which it did not consent and that, consequently, CTI\u2019s liability for <em>all </em>damages, including delay damages and settlement expenses as well as attorney\u2019s fees, would have to be negotiated or litigated at a future date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1004-21\">. <em>See Eureka Inv.

However, since such an inference can be supported by other evidence, itemization cannot be held to be a <em>sine qua non </em>in proving damages. In the present case, the facts that CTI had originally retained Fried, Frank to litigate the tenant actions and by its own admission had paid over $60,000 in legal fees to Fried, Frank, apparently on the basis of invoices no different than those admitted at trial, support an inference of reasonableness of the fees. Fried, Frank's billing system, which established separate matter numbers to which charges for services unrelated to the tenant actions were billed, supports an inference of necessity, as does the statement on the face of the invoices that charges for unrelated services had been excluded. <em>See </em>CTI Ex.

This represents less than ten percent of the attorney\u2019s fees claimed in this action and less than five percent of the total attorney\u2019s fees paid out by CTI and Eureka in connection with the tenant actions. It seems clear that the amount of fees charged by Fried, Frank in fact diminish, as one would have expected, as the tenant actions approached resolution. In any event, if the district court questioned the credibility of the August 5 invoice the appropriate response would have been to deny the fees claimed under that invoice rather than to deny recovery of fees entirely.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"52\">\n<p id=\"b1008-9\">. 530 F.Supp. at 1124.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"53\">\n<p id=\"b1008-10\">. <em>See supra </em>pp. 942-43.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"54\">\n<p id=\"b1008-11\">. Leyes testimony, Supp.Trans. at S-261.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"55\">\n<p id=\"b1008-12\">. The status of CTI Exhibit No. 179 is disputed by the parties. CTI claims that the exhibit was marked solely for identification, was not received in evidence, and is not a part of the record in this case. <em>See </em>Letter from Roger E. Warin (attorney for CTI) to George A. Fisher (Clerk, United States Court of Appeals) (July 25, 1983). Eureka, on the other hand, contends that while the exhibit was never formally moved into evidence by CTI, it has been treated as being in evidence by both CTI and the district court judge. Eureka suggests that the failure to formally move the exhibit into evidence resulted from CTI\u2019s procedure of moving selected exhibits into evidence in a single letter to the district court after the close of trial rather than moving its exhibits into evidence as they were referred to during the course of the trial. <em>See </em>Letter from Stephen Sacks (attorney for Eureka) to George A. Fisher (Clerk, United States Court of Appeals) (July 27, 1983). CTI responds that its failure to move the exhibit formally into evidence was intentional, but that its own use of the exhibit in its briefs was inadvertent. <em>See </em>Letter from Roger Warin to George A. Fisher (August 1, 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-16\">Although the docket reveals that this exhibit was never formally placed in evidence, we find that the exhibit was treated as evidence in the district court, and, therefore, will be treated as part of the record in this case. CTI\u2019s attorney showed a copy of the exhibit to James Adler, CTI\u2019s expert accounting witness, during the direct examination of that witness. Adler read extensively from the exhibit during his testimony. <em>See </em>Adler testimony, Supp.Trans. at S-426-28. Furthermore, the court had a copy of the exhibit before it during this testimony and relied upon its contents during its own colloquy with counsel and the witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>Q. I would like to show you [the witness] CTI Exhibit No. 179, which containes [szc] those invoices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">THE COURT: Dated May 1 and August 5. Adler testimony, Supp.Trans. at S-426. And, in response to the witness\u2019s assertion that he had not seen the time sheets contained in the exhibit, to back up the invoices that were also contained in the exhibit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-6\">THE COURT: You haven\u2019t seen the back-up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiOv\">THE WITNESS: All I have seen is just this invoice, itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-7\">THE COURT: Then you didn\u2019t show him the exhibit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-8\">MR. WARIN: He has got the entire exhibit in front of him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-9\">THE WITNESS: But the invoice, itself, comes with just the invoice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-10\">THE COURT: Now wait a minute. CTI Exhibit 179 contains the back-up, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-11\">MR. WARIN: I think his point is, all Price Waterhouse looked at was the invoice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-12\">THE COURT: But he went beyond that and said he hasn\u2019t seen the underlying supporting material.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-13\">The underlying supporting material seems to be in the exhibit. It is a great big, thick exhibit with all the time charges that have been made by the firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-14\">You didn\u2019t analyze those?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-15\">THE WITNESS: No, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1009-16\"><em>Id. </em>at S-427-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-17\">Moreover, CTI cited Exhibit No. 179 before both the district court and this court. <em>See </em>CTI Post-trial Brief at 111 (October 20, 1981); CTI Reply Brief at 34 n. 23 (August 18, 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-18\">Rule 10(e) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-23\">[i]f anything material to either party is omitted from the record by error or accident or is misstated therein, ... the court of appeals, on proper suggestion or of its own initiative, may direct that the omission or misstatement be corrected____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1009-24\">A similar rule has been invoked to permit the court of appeals to consider against defendant an exhibit which had been marked for identification but which, apparently through oversight, had not been introduced in evidence, where the defendant had referred to the exhibit in its brief and reproduced it in its appendix. <em>See Williams v. Pennsylvania R.R. Co., </em>313 F.2d 203, 209 (2d Cir.1963). We hold that in view of the treatment of CTI Exhibit No. 179 as evidence at trial and on appeal, its omission from the record was, if not accident, error. Therefore, we directed the parties to submit a copy of the exhibit and have treated it as part of the record on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"56\">\n<p id=\"b1009-25\">. <em>See </em>CTI Ex.

Contrary to Eureka\u2019s contention, the standard of bad faith is no lower in the case of an insurer than it is for other parties. <em>See, e.g., Jefferson-Pilot Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Boothe, Prichard &amp; Dudley, </em>638 F.2d 670, 676 (4th Cir. 1980); <em>Continental Ins. Co. v. Lynham, </em>293 A.2d 481, 483 (D.C.1972); <em>McIntosh v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>268 A.2d 518 (D.C.1970). Rather, the unique vulnerability of an insured, in need of the immediate defense support or medical services for which it has contracted, may often give rise to facts supporting a finding of bad faith when an insurer reneges on the promises of its policy or takes advantage of the circumstances to \"bully\u201d its insured into a settlement. <em>See, e.g., Siegel v. William E. Bookhultz &amp; Sons, </em>419 F.2d 720 (D.C.Cir.1969) (insurer abandoned its defense of insured, leaving insured helpless).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"62\">\n<p id=\"at3-dedup-0\">.

Indeed, early in the trial, the district judge had difficulty identifying the language of Note II as a recognizable genre of title coverage. <em>See </em>Singer testimony Tr.Trans. at 85.

Nor can bad faith be found from CTI\u2019s abandonment at trial of its position that the insurer was liable for delay damages only if the tenants proved successful, Although we do not accept this position (it is no longer in the case), it has the support of legal authority elsewhere and therefore cannot be termed frivolous. <em>See American Legion Ed Brauner Post No. 307, Inc. v. Southwest Title and Ins. Co., </em>253 La. 608, 218 So.2d 612 (La.1969). CTI\u2019s ultimate abandonment of this defense worked to Eureka's advantage by admitting the insurer\u2019s liability for delay damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
