RUBIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">This diversity case was filed in a Mississippi district court in an effort to obtain the protection of the longer Mississippi statute of limitations over a personal injury action that would have been untimely if filed in Louisiana, where the injury occurred. We affirm its dismissal by the district court for want of personal jurisdiction over the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">While working in Ruston, Louisiana, and using a power saw, Sam Smith, a Louisiana resident, suffered a complete amputation of his left hand, wrist, and lower forearm by the saw. The saw had been designed and manufactured by DeWalt Products Corporation (\u201cDeWalt\u201d), which is domiciled in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and is a division of Black &amp; Decker (U.S.), Inc., a Maryland corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-17\">More than one year after his injury, Smith filed this products liability action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. Jurisdiction was predicated on the complete diversity of citizenship between Smith and DeWalt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Assuming that the court had jurisdiction, Smith sought to apply Mississippi\u2019s six year statute of limitations for negligence and strict liability in products liability actions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The applicable Louisiana statute of limitations for similar actions is one year.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following a motion by DeWalt, the district court dismissed Smith\u2019s claim for lack of personal jurisdiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Smith appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-18\">In a federal diversity action such as this, the reach of federal jurisdiction over non-resident defendants is measured by a two-step inquiry. First, the law of the forum state must provide for the assertion of such jurisdiction; and second, the exercise of jurisdiction under state law must comport with the dictates of the fourteenth amendment due process clause.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In this case, because Mississippi law does not provide for the assertion of personal jurisdiction over DeWalt, we do not consider the due process issue. For the same reason, we also do not address the choice-of-law question concerning the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-19\">Smith asserts three possible grounds for obtaining personal jurisdiction over DeWalt. The first argument is that DeWalt falls within the scope of the \u201cdoing-business\u201d provisions of the Mississippi long-arm statute,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and is thereby amenable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>to suit in Mississippi. This argument fails for several reasons. First, although the statute on its face does not preclude its use by non-resident plaintiffs, federal courts interpreting Mississippi law have consistently held that a non-resident plaintiff cannot use its provisions to obtain in personam jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cThe thesis of these and similar decisions is that the statute is designed to protect and be used only by Mississippi residents.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This line of authority makes Smith\u2019s status as a non-resident plaintiff a barrier to his use of the long arm statute to obtain in personam jurisdiction over DeWalt.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">This interpretation of the statute is buttressed by recent amendments to it. In 1980, the Mississippi legislature amended the statute to allow a non-resident plaintiff to obtain service of process upon a non-resident defendant who has committed a tort in whole or in part in Mississippi against the non-resident plaintiff.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The legislature did not amend the \u201cdoing-business\u201d provision of the statute in a similar fashion. Given the long-standing judicial construction of the long-arm statute to preclude its use by non-resident plaintiffs, the legislature\u2019s decision not to amend the \u201cdoing-business\u201d provision of the statute at the same time it specifically extended the \u201ctort\u201d provision to non-resident plaintiffs indicates a legislative intent that the \u201cdoing-business\u201d provision is not available to non-resident plaintiffs. Subsequent construction of the long-arm statute after the 1980 amendments confirms this result.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">Finally, even if this court were to allow a non-resident plaintiff such as Smith to make use of the Mississippi long-arm statute, DeWalt still would not be subject to the in-personam jurisdiction of the district court. By its own terms, the statute\u2019s scope is limited to those cases in which the cause of action accrues from or is incident to the activities of the non-resident defendant.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As interpreted by the Mississippi Supreme Court, before personal jurisdiction may be exercised under the \u201cdoing-business\u201d provision of the long-arm statute, there must be a sufficient nexus between the activities of the defendant within the state and the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Here, there does not appear to be a nexus of any kind between the activity of DeWalt in Mississippi and the claims asserted by Mr. Smith. There is nothing to indicate that the saw in question was manufactured in Mississippi, that it was ever owned by a Mississippian, that it was ever sold in Mississippi or by a Mississippian, that it was ever serviced in Mississippi or by a Mississippian, or that it was ever within the territorial boundaries of the state of Mississippi. The mere fact that DeWalt markets its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>products nationally and that some of these goods find their way into Mississippi is not a sufficient nexus to subject DeWalt to in-personam jurisdiction under the \u201cdoing-business\u201d provision of the Mississippi long-arm statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Smith\u2019s second argument for obtaining in-personam jurisdiction over DeWalt is that, because DeWalt would be entitled to sue in Mississippi as a plaintiff, \u201cequality of treatment\u201d demands that it also be subject to suit in Mississippi as a defendant. Smith focuses on the interstate commerce exception<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> to Mississippi\u2019s \u201cdoor-closing\u201d statute<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> which describes a foreign corporation that merely transacts business in interstate commerce in Mississippi as not transacting business in Mississippi. This description, in turn, exempts such a corporation from the limitations, of Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 79-3-247 (1972)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> which precludes a foreign corporation that transacts business in Mississippi without authorization from bringing suit in state court. Because DeWalt merely transacts business in interstate commerce, it is not \u201ctransacting business\u201d in Mississippi; and because it is not transacting business in Mississippi without proper authorization, it is not precluded from bringing suit in Mississippi. Smith argues that we should extend this reasoning one step further and conclude that \u201cequality of treatment\u201d requires that De-Walt also be subject to suit in Mississippi as a defendant. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">Smith\u2019s argument ignores the provisions of the Mississippi long-arm statute; a statute already shown to bar the exercise of in-personam jurisdiction over DeWalt. Under the clear dictates of that statute, Mississippi does not claim jurisdiction over DeWalt. Smith cannot avoid this conclusion by attempting to avoid the statute. Moreover, this court has previously noted that there is no authority for the proposition that, \u201cMississippi would construe its statute as permitting service on a non-resident corporation whose only activities in the state are a part of an interstate transaction.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> For these reasons, Smith\u2019s \u201cequality of treatment\u201d argument must also fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">Smith\u2019s final argument for obtaining personal jurisdiction over DeWalt fares no better than his first two. Smith points to Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 79-1-27 (1972)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and its seemingly clear command that <em>any </em>corporation doing business in Mississippi is subject to suit there. As explained by the Mississippi Supreme Court, the purpose of this statute is to \u201c \u2018open the door\u2019 of ... Mississippi courts to foreign corporations ... doing business in [Mississippi] to sue and be sued here on all bona fide causes of action.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Smith argues, therefore, that despite the restrictive interpretation given to the other two statutory provisions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>he relies upon, this section allows a nonresident corporation doing business in Mississippi to be sued in that state no matter what the cause of action or where it arises.</p>\n<p id=\"APj\">_ This argument cannot prevail for two reasons. First, the Mississippi Supreme Court has held that, in a situation such as this, Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 79-1-27 (1972) and the long-arm statute must be construed together and harmonized.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This court of course follows that construction of Mississippi law,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> but in the instant ease, the only manner in which these two provisions can be harmonized is to refuse to extend personal jurisdiction over DeWalt. As already noted, when the Mississippi legislature amended the long-arm statute m 1980, it did not extend the \u201cdoing-business\u201d provision of that statute to non-resident plaintiffs.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> To extend jurisdiction over DeWalt on the authority of \u00a7 79-1-27, therefore, would be completely contrary to the intent of the Mississippi legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"AG0\">Second, \u00a7 79-1-27 applies only to corpotions found to be \u201cdoing business\u201d in Mississippi. As we have already noted, DeWalt has insufficient contacts with Mississippi to be considered to be doing business there for purposes of asserting personal jurisdiction over it.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In this context, it should also be noted that DeWalt maintains no offices, employees or representatives in Mississippi. It also does not neg\u00f3tiate contracts in Mississippi. DeWalt\u2019s products are sold on a regular basis in Mississippi, but only as a result of marketing such products nationally to independent distributors who in turn sell to wholesalers and retailers, or who sell in their own outlet stores in the various states.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak0\">Because we can find no basis for the exercise of personal jurisdiction under Mississippi law in this case, there is no reason for this court to consider either the due process issue or the statute of limitations issue raised by Smith in this appeal. For the reasons stated above, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b354-11\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(1) (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b354-12\">.
