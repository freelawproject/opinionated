We AFFIRM in part and REVERSE in part. Peoples Bank of Polk County, the plaintiff, is a bank organized under the laws of Tennessee. Prior to a name change, Peoples Bank of Polk County was known as Southern United Bank of Polk County. Mary-ville Savings and Loan Corporation, the debtor, is a corporation organized under the laws of Tennessee. Defendant McDonald is the trustee in bankruptcy of the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-15\">Debtor, through its duly authorized officers, executed a \u201cPromissory Note, Security Agreement and Disclosure Statement\u201d on June 10, 1981. The document provided for the payment, upon demand, by debtor to plaintiff of the principal sum of $75,000, together with interest from the date of execution until the date of payment at the rate of 18% per annum. As collateral for the loan, debtor assigned to plaintiff all rights in certain promissory notes and deeds of trust encumbering real property located in Blount County, Tennessee. This assignment was accomplished by debtor\u2019s execution of a \u201cGeneral Assignment of Promissory Note and Trust Deeds.\u201d This assignment was duly recorded with the Register of Deeds of Blount County, Tennessee, on June 15, 1981, the usual manner for recordation in Tennessee of interests in real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-16\">After the initial borrowing, debtor made certain payments on the principal amount and interest due under the note, bringing the balance due down to approximately $55,000. During January of 1982, debtor secured the advance of an additional $20,-000 from plaintiff without the execution of another promissory note, and executed another \u201cGeneral Assignment of Promissory Notes and Trust Deeds,\u201d assigning all of its rights in additional notes and deeds of trust on real property to plaintiff. This document was also recorded with the Register of Deeds of Blount County, Tennessee, on January 28, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-17\">Typically, the deeds of trust provided that, among other things, \u201cthis conveyance shall secure the above described debt (the loan evidenced by a promissory note), and the interest thereon, or renewals ... thereof.\u201d The \u201cdeed of trust notes\u201d recited that payment was due at the Maryville Savings and Loan Corporation. Each \u201cPromissory Note, Security Agreement and Disclosure Statement\u201d granted plaintiff a \u201csecurity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>interest\u201d in the underlying property or collateral, including \u201creal or personal property,\u201d and the agreements were to be \u201cinterpreted according to the laws of the State of Tennessee, except where pre-empted by Federal law.\u201d The general assignments were \u201cto establish a line of credit for Mary-ville Savings &amp; Loan Corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">On March 18, 1982, debtor filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition owing $75,000 plus interest on the note from plaintiff. Plaintiff initiated an adversary proceeding seeking a ruling that its security interest in the promissory notes and deeds of trust was perfected and that it therefore should recover the notes and the deeds of trust despite debtor\u2019s filing in bankruptcy. Defendant asserted that plaintiff\u2019s failure to take actual possession of the notes and deeds of trust prevented perfection of plaintiff\u2019s security interest under Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 9-304(1), Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 47-9-304(1). Plaintiff argued that the transaction here was not covered by article nine of the U.C.C. because it involved a real estate transaction; as support, plaintiff cited U.C.C. \u00a7 9-104, Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 47-9-104, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"amo-dedup-0\"><em>Transactions excluded from chapter. </em>\u2014This chapter does not apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">(j) except to the extent that provision is made for fixtures in \u00a7 47-9-313, to the creation or transfer of an interest in or a lien on real estate____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Defendant, on the other hand, relies upon U.C.C. \u00a7 9-102, Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 47-9-102, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">(1) Except as otherwise provided in \u00a7 47-9-103 on multiple state transactions and in \u00a7 47-9-104 on excluded transactions, this chapter applies so far as concerns any personal property and fixtures within the jurisdiction of this state:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-10\">(a) to any transaction (regardless of its form) which is intended to create a security interest in personal property or fixtures including goods, documents, instruments, general intangibles, chattel paper, accounts or contract rights; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-3\">(b) to any sale of accounts, contract rights or chattel paper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-11\">(3) The application of this chapter to a security interest in a secured obligation is not affected by the fact that the obligation is itself secured by a transaction or interest to which this chapter does not apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">The bankruptcy court, 27 B.R. 701, held that plaintiff failed to perfect its security interest in the notes and deeds of trust, but the district court reversed, holding that the recordation accomplished, although not in compliance with the U.C.C. as applicable in Tennessee, was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-13\">In keeping with the parties\u2019 approach to this ease, both the bankruptcy court and the district court assumed that article nine perfection requirements applied either to the entirety of this transaction or not at all \u2014 that is, it applied either to both the notes and the deeds or to neither. We conclude that this approach fails to give meaningful scope, depending on the result reached, either to \u00a7 9-102 or to \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(j). Comment four to Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 47-9-102 illustrates the necessity in eases such as this to analyze the security interest created in the promissory note separately from the interest created in the deed of trust. That illustration reads,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-14\">The owner of Blackacre borrows $10,-000 from his neighbor, and secures his note by a mortgage of Blackacre. This Article [Chapter] is not applicable to the creation of the real estate mortgage. However, when the mortgagee in turn pledges this note and mortgage to secure his own obligation to X, this Article [Chapter] is applicable to the security interest thus created in the note and the mortgage. <em>Whether the transfer of the collateral for the note, i.e., the mortgagee\u2019s interest in Blackacre requires further action (such as recording an assignment of the mortgagee\u2019s interest) is left to real estate law. See Section 9-1040).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-15\">Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 47-9-102 comment 4 (emphasis added). We are persuaded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 9-102(3) and 9-104(j) may be reconciled by holding in this case that article nine be applied in regard to the promissory notes but <em>not </em>in regard to the deeds of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">This conclusion is bolstered by the Third Circuit\u2019s careful opinion in <em>In re Bristol Assoc., Inc., </em>505 F.2d 1056 (3d Cir.1974). In <em>Bristol, </em>a case involving Pennsylvania law, the court noted that amendments to the comments to U.C.C. \u00a7 9-102<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> made clear the drafters\u2019 intention that \u201conly that portion of the package unrelated to the real property\u201d be governed by article nine when \u201ca promissory note and mortgage together become the subject of a security interest.\u201d 505 F.2d at 1061. <em>See also First Nat\u2019l Bank of Boston v. Larson (In re Kennedy Mortgage Co.), </em>17 B.R. 957, 963-65 (Bankr.D.N.J.1982).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Tennessee case law cited by plaintiff does not direct a contrary result. Neither <em>Commerce Union Bank v. May, </em>503 S.W.2d 112 (Tenn.1973), nor <em>Union Livestock Yards, Inc. v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>552 S.W.2d 392 (Tenn.Ct.App.1976), cert. <em>denied, </em>(Tenn. May 31, 1977), discusses the reach of \u00a7 9-102(3). Indeed, neither ease clearly involves a situation in which discussion of \u00a7 9-102(3) would be expected \u2014 that is, the creation of a security interest in an obligation itself secured by a transaction or interest to which article nine does not apply-</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The Tennessee Supreme Court in <em>May, </em>however, did hold that \u201cthe U.C.C. does not supercede the law in this state with respect to <em>liens upon real estate.\u201d </em>503 S.W.2d at 117 (emphasis added). Some authority<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> has discussed whether a note pledged by a real estate mortgage given as security for a loan thereby becomes \u201crealty paper\u201d within the purview of article nine of the U.C.C. Our attention has been called to no Tennessee case, however, that even discusses, much less adopts, this concept. We are not prepared to hold that in Tennessee the character of a note as personalty is transformed into a real estate interest merely because it is secured by a mortgage or deed of trust, or assigned as security together with a mortgage or deed of trust. Although the assignments in question did involve \u201ctransfers of interests in real property\u201d because they involved deeds of trust, we cannot agree with the district court that the notes themselves constituted \u201cliens upon real estate\u201d nor adopted the character of real property. Both Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 47-9-102 and Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 47-9-104 purport to apply only to personal property and fixtures or to security interests in personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">In this case, then, we conclude that article nine applies to the plaintiff\u2019s security interest but only in the promissory notes themselves. Since plaintiff did not take possession of the notes, plaintiff\u2019s security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>interest in the notes was not perfected. <em>See </em>Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 47-9-304(1). On the other hand, we conclude that article nine does not apply to plaintiffs security interest in the deeds of trust. While defendant argues in his reply brief that plaintiffs security interest in the deeds of trust was not perfected even if article nine were held not to apply, he admits that he did not raise that issue below; plaintiff\u2019s security interest in the deeds of trust is therefore deemed to be a perfected interest. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED in part and REVERSED in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The case is REMANDED to the court below for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-5\">. Comment 4 to \u00a7 9-102 set forth <em>supra, </em>was amended by the Commissioners on Uniform State Laws to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">The owner of Blackacre borrows $ 10,000 from his neighbor, and secured his note by a mortgage on Blackacre. This Article is not applicable to the creation of the real estate mortgage. Nor is it applicable to a sale of the note by the mortgagee, even though the mortgagee continues to secure the note. However, when the mortgagee pledges the note to secure his own obligation to X, this Article applies to the security interest thus created, which is a security interest in an instrument even though the instrument is secured by a real estate mortgage. This Article leaves to other law the question of the effect on rights under the mortgage of delivery or non-delivery of the mortgage or of recording or non-recording of an assignment of the mortgagee's interest. See'Section 9-104(j).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-9\"><em>Bristol, </em>505 F.2d at 1058-59; <em>see id. </em>at 1060-61.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b480-10\">. In arguing that article nine governs the security interest in both the notes and the deeds of trust, defendant relies on three cases construing California law, <em>Greiner v. Wilke (In re Staff Mortgage &amp; Investment Corp.), </em>625 F.2d 281 (9th Cir.1980), <em>Starr v. Bruce Farley Corp., </em>612 F.2d 1197 (9th Cir.1980), and <em>Huffman v. Wikle (In re Staff Mortgage and Investment Corp.), </em>550 F.2d 1228 (9th Cir.1977). Those cases, however, do not address the effect of \u00a7 9-104, an issue clearly raised by plaintiff here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b480-11\">.
