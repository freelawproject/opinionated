The jury found in favor of Hintz. The defendants appeal the district court\u2019s denial of their motions for a directed ver-diet, for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and for a new trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b600-16\">On the morning of July 27, 1979, Tina Hintz and her husband, Robert Hintz, were traveling west on a Dix Township road in Ford County, Illinois.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This road terminated in a T-intersection at a north-south township road. The township had placed a double-arrow sign west of the intersection to warn west-bound traffic, but had installed no stop signs or advance warning signs. Robert Hintz, who was the driver, testified that there also was loose gravel in the intersection. Because the morning was foggy, the plaintiff and her husband did not see the warning sign until they were about twenty-five feet away from the intersection. Robert Hintz braked and tried to turn sharply south, but his car skidded into a ditch.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-17\">Although Robert Hintz sustained no injuries in the accident, Tina Hintz was not so fortunate. She sustained a back injury for which she has had surgery twice and a neurological injury that has caused bowel and bladder dysfunctions. She testified that several of her toes have curled under her feet, and that she still suffers from continual back pain, numbness in her legs, and bladder accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-18\">At the time of the accident, Defendant Jamison, as Dix Township Road Commissioner, was in charge of posting and maintaining the township\u2019s road signs. In Illinois, a township is liable for the tortious acts of its road commissioner acting in his official capacity. <em>See Hennigs v. Centreville Township, </em>56 Ill.2d 151, 306 N.E.2d 287 (1974). The plaintiff alleged that the defendants breached their duty to maintain roadways in a reasonably safe condition and to post adequate warning signs as required by the Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act, Ill.Stat.Ann. ch. 85, \u00a7\u00a7 3-102 &amp; -104 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>(Smith-Hurd 1965) (the Tort Immunity Act).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendants filed a third party complaint against Robert Hintz, alleging that his negligent driving caused the accident. The jury awarded Tina Hintz $250,-000, with a twenty-five percent contribution to come from Robert Hintz. The district court denied the defendants\u2019 post-trial motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The defendants\u2019 principal argument on appeal is that they are immune from liability under the Tort Immunity Act. Ill.Stat. Ann. ch. 85, \u00a7 1-101 (Smith-Hurd 1965). The Act confers immunity for public officials\u2019 discretionary acts, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2-201, and provides that local governmental bodies are not liable for injury caused by an employee where the employee is not liable, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2-109. Another section provides that nothing in the Act shall \u201cdeprive any public entity of any defense heretofore existing and not described herein.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2-111. Finally, Section 9-103(c), which states that any insurance policy must waive the insurance company\u2019s right to refuse payment because of the \u201cnon-liability of the insured public entity ... and its immunity from suit by reason of the defenses and immunities provided in this Act,\u201d has been interpreted by Illinois courts to provide that procuring insurance waives a public body\u2019s immunity. <em>See, e.g., Sullivan v. Midlothian Park District, </em>51 Ill.2d 274, 281 N.E.2d 659 (1972). Dix Township has an insurance policy that conforms to Section 9-103\u2019s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The plaintiff apparently concedes that Jamison\u2019s alleged failure to post warning signs was a discretionary act protected by the public official immunity of Section 2-201. She argues, however, that Dix Township\u2019s insurance policy waived both Jami-son\u2019s and the township\u2019s immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-11\">Before 1959, local governmental bodies and their employees generally were protected against suit in Illinois by a doctrine of quasi-judicial immunity. In <em>Molitor v. Kaneland Community Unit District No. 302, </em>18 Ill.2d 11, 163 N.E.2d 89 (1959), the Illinois Supreme Court abolished tort immunity for school districts. Later cases held that <em>Molitor </em>marked the end of governmental immunity in Illinois. Subsequent legislative attempts to immunize specific municipal bodies fell to constitutional challenge, <em>see Harvey v. Clyde Park District, </em>32 Ill.2d 60, 203 N.E.2d 573 (1964), prompting passage of the comprehensive Tort Immunity Act. <em>See generally </em>Comment, <em>Illinois Tort Claims Act: A New Approach to Municipal Tort Immunity in Illinois, </em>61 Nw.U.L.Rev. 265, 265-71 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">The defendants argue that public official immunity existed before the Act was passed, and thus is a \u201cheretofore existing\u201d defense preserved by Section 2-111 that is not waived when a public entity procures insurance. Although Section 2-111 also states that the defense not be \u201cdescribed\u201d in the Act, the defendants contend that the Illinois Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lansing v. County of McLean, </em>69 Ill.2d 562, 14 Ill.Dec. 543, 372 N.E.2d 822 (1978), supports their argument that an immunity existing before the Act was passed is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>waived even when the immunity is described in the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">The defendants misapply the court\u2019s holding in <em>Lansing. </em>That case did not involve governmental immunity, but rather a defense that had been unaffected by <em>Molitor. </em>69 Ill.2d at 571, 14 Ill.Dec. at 547, 372 N.E.2d at 826 (the city\u2019s defense \u201cdid not indeed rest on a doctrine of governmental immunity, but rather upon the absence of liability in circumstances where the [county] had taken no action contributing to the injury.\u201d). In <em>Lansing, </em>the court rejected the plaintiff\u2019s attempt to use the Section 9-103 insurance waiver to hold a city liable for injuries resulting from its failure to remove naturally-accumulating ice and snow from city streets. Since 1931, Illinois courts have held that cities have no such duty, <em>see Graham v. City of Chicago, </em>346 Ill. 638, 178 N.E. 911 (1931), and the Act itself affirms this defense in Section 3-105. <em>Lansing </em>thus stands for the proposition that the insurance waiver provision may not impose new liability on governmental bodies for acts that previously had been held not tortious. <em>See also Porter v. City of Urbana, </em>88 Ill.App.3d 443, 445, 43 Ill.Dec. 610, 612, 410 N.E.2d 610, 612 (1980) (\u201cThe Tort Immunity Act is not a catalog of duties or a source of rights; it does not grant new liabilities where none already exist.\u201d); <em>Hannon v. Counihan, </em>54 Ill.App.3d 509, 512, 12 Ill.Dec. 210, 213, 369 N.E.2d 917, 919 (1977) (\u201cThe Tort Immunity Act does not create any new liabilities for negligent acts or omissions which did not previously exist.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Although the Tort Immunity Act did not impose new liability where none had existed previously, it did confer immunity for local governmental units and their employees, and provide that such immunity would be waived when the governmental body procures insurance. We are not convinced by the defendants\u2019 contention that public official immunity was not affected by <em>Molitor </em>and thus is a \u201cheretofore existing\u201d defense that may not be waived by insurance. Rather, whether public officials still enjoyed immunity after the <em>Molitor </em>decision was disputed by Illinois courts. <em>Compare, e.g., Blazer v. Highway Commissioner of Marengo Township, </em>93 Ill.App.2d 89, 235 N.E.2d 13 (1968) (public officials not immune after <em>Molitor) and Kitto v. Wattleworth, </em>24 Ill.App.2d 484, 164 N.E.2d 817 (1960) (same) <em>with Ten Eicken v. Johnson, </em>1 Ill.App.3d 165, 273 N.E.2d 633 (1971) <em>(Molitor </em>did not destroy public official immunity) <em>and Lusietto v. Kingan, </em>107 Ill.App.2d 239, 246 N.E.2d 24 (1969) (same). As discussed, the Act\u2019s purpose was to resolve such confusion regarding immunity in the wake of <em>Molitor. </em>Thus, the defendants\u2019 immunity here is both conferred by the Act and waived by the township\u2019s insurance policy. <em>See Bollinger v. Schneider, </em>64 Ill.App.3d 758, 21 Ill.Dec. 522, 381 N.E.2d 849 (1978) (insurance policy waives prison officials\u2019 \u00a7 2-201 immunity). <em>See also Sullivan v. Midlothian Park District, </em>51 Ill.2d 274, 281 N.E.2d 659 (1972) (insurance waives \u00a7 3-106 immunity for injuries occurring in public parks or playgrounds); <em>Holda v. Kane County, </em>88 Ill.App.3d 522, 43 Ill.Dec. 552, 410 N.E.2d 552 (1980) (insurance waives city\u2019s \u00a7 2-102 immunity from punitive damages); <em>Marshall-Putnam Farm Bureau v. Shaver, </em>12 Ill.App.3d 402, 299 N.E.2d 10 (1973) (insurance waives any otherwise available immunities for mayor and city from liability for failure to repair or demolish abandoned building).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">The defendants raise several other objections, all of which involve decisions that are left either to the discretion of the judge or the wisdom of the jury. We conclude that the jury\u2019s verdict was supported by the evidence, and thus the district court properly denied the defendants\u2019 motions for a directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Furthermore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s expert witness, a civil engineer. The expert\u2019s technical understanding of Illinois\u2019 signing requirements could help the jury understand the evidence, as permitted un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>der Federal Rule of Evidence 702. Also, the district court gave proper jury instructions regarding comparative negligence in Illinois. Finally, the jury\u2019s money award is not \u201cso large as to shock the conscience of the court.\u201d <em>Huff v. White Motor Corp., </em>609 F.2d 286, 296 (7th Cir.1979) (quoting <em>Grunenthal v. Long Island RR, </em>393 U.S. 156, 159 n. 4, 89 S.Ct. 331, 333 n. 4, 21 L.Ed.2d 309 (1968)). Rather, considering the injuries that the plaintiff received and the fact that twenty-five percent of the award will be set-off by the contribution from her husband, it is the defendants\u2019 suggestion that the award is excessive that we find rather shocking.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b600-19\">. At the time of the accident, Tina Hintz was a resident of Illinois. She moved to Oklahoma before instituting this suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b601-8\">.
