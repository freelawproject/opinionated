Because of errors occurring in the course of trial, we must reverse the judgment favorable to him rendered by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"A9u\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A-cx\">Mr. Campos is the former police chief of Missouri City, a suburb of Houston. In July 1980, a local newspaper article suggested that Campos had improperly caused a surveillance to be conducted by the police department for his own private purposes, one of his former wife in connection with a domestic dispute. In consequence, the municipal authorities carried out an internal investigation of the police department throu&amp;h the city attorney, who reported the Possibility of serious problems there. Further investigation by the city manager and his assistant, including interviews with police officers, appeared to establish the presence of problems, unrest and dissatisfaetion with Mr. Campos\u2019 administration of the department, despite his personal popu-Parity there and with the local citizenry. A memorandum from the assistant manager outlined these findings and recommended that Campos be given an opportunity to respond to them. On September 23 and 24, the manager and his assistant discussed the charges privately with Campos on automobile rides; and in a private and confidential memorandum written on September 24, before the second meetinS with CamP0S&gt; the manager recommended to the city council that CamP0S be asked to resiSn'</p>\n<p id=\"ae2-dedup-0\">The following day, Campos was given a list of the reasons for that recommendation, reasons that we set out in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Campos requested further specifics, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>declining to attend a meeting scheduled for September 26 with the city manager or a closed session of the city council set for September 29 until these were furnished. The next day he was furnished copies of the earlier memoranda in the investigation and notified of a proposed executive session of the council scheduled for October 2 at which he was to be heard regarding the charges. At that meeting there was further discussion of the charges, with Campos requesting further names, dates, and specifics.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-4\">In response, Campos was offered access to the police department files and provided with a memorandum giving further details as to some of the charges. Further discussion of the charges, and an interview with police officers, took place at a closed council meeting on October 9, with Campos present. At another such session the following day, Campos was asked to resign. He refused and demanded a public hearing. At this, the meeting was thrown open to the public, many of whom spoke in support of Mr. Campos. Nevertheless, on motion and second, the council voted to discharge him. This action followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-5\">\n<em>The Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-6\">This is well stated by Judge Gar-wood in our recent decision of <em>Wells v. Hico Independent School District, </em>736 F.2d 243, 256-7 (5th Cir.1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1189-7\">To establish a liberty interest, an employee must demonstrate that his governmental employer has brought false charges against him that \u201cmight seriously damage his standing and associations in his community,\u201d or that impose a \u201cstigma or other disability\u201d that forecloses \u201cfreedom to take advantage of other employment opportunities.\u201d <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 573, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2707, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). <em>See Wells v. Doland, </em>711 F.2d 670, 676 (5th Cir.1983). Mere proof that nonrenewal might make an individual less attractive to other employers does not, by itself, implicate a liberty interest. <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. at 574 n. 13, 92 S.Ct. at 2707 n. 13. <em>Dennis v. S. &amp; S. Consolidated Rural High School District, </em>577 F.2d 338, 340 (5th Cir.1978). (\u201c[M]ere nonrenewal of a teacher\u2019s contract is not such a blight upon his good name, reputation, honor, or integrity as to constitute a deprivation of liberty.\u201d)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Nor is reputation alone a constitutionally protected interest, even though state law may create an action for defamation. <em>Paul v. Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976). Rather, the stigma must be imposed by the state in connection with its denial of a right or status previously recognized by state law, such as the non-renewal at issue here, though loss of a property interest (such as tenured employment) is not required. <em>Dennis, </em>577 F.2d at 341-42; <em>Wells, </em>711 F.2d at 676 (the stigmatization must be \u201cin or as a result of the discharge process\u201d).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The employee must also show that \u201cthe governmental agency has made or is likely to make the ... stigmatizing charges public \u2018in any official or intentional manner, other than in connection with the defense of [related legal] action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ortwein v. Mackey, </em>511 F.2d 696, 699 (5th Cir.1975); <em>Wells, </em>711 F.2d at 676 n. 8. Moreover, the employee must not have received a meaningful hearing to clear his name.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The charges must be false. <em>Codd v. Velger, </em>429 U.S. 624, 628, 97 S.Ct. 882, 884, 51 L.Ed.2d 92 (1977).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1190-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>To the above statement we need add nothing; it outlines law that is dispositive of the appeal. We turn now to the points advanced for reversal by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-7\">\n<em>Publication of Charges</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-8\">As our above statement recognizes, a discharged public employee is entitled to a \u201cname-clearing\u201d hearing before the governing body that discharged him whenever stigmatizing charges have been made in connection with his discharge, when no meaningful public hearing was conducted pre-discharge, and when he requests such a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-9\">Appellants complain that the charge of the court to the jury omitted an essential element of the legal formulation stated above.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree. Nowhere in the court\u2019s instructions to the jury is it advised that unless the stigmatizing matter is made public by the employer in connection with the discharge no \u201cname-clearing\u201d proceeding is required. The jury was therefore left to believe that even private charges, carefully kept confidential by the charging body in deference to Mr. Campos, could give rise to a right in him to a name-clearing session. That is not the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-12\">On the record before us, it appears that no public disclosure of the charges against Chief Campos was made before he demanded that further proceedings in connection with his discharge be conducted in public. If so, he accrued no right to a name-clearing proceeding. If, as it appears, it was Mr. Campos who demanded that the charges be made public, it was his own hand that was on the dagger. Whatever matter of arguable relevance became public as a result of this demand became so at Mr. Campos\u2019 demand. This is not the set of circumstances that the law envisions, one in which the discharged employee is publicly defamed in connection with his discharge by matter deliberately released by his former employer without an opportunity on his part to respond in public. On the present record, nothing of that sort occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-13\">Here by contrast, the employer having apparently made strenuous efforts to prevent the charges against the employee from becoming public, the employee demanded that further proceedings be conducted at a public meeting. It thus appears that Mr. Campos himself, rather than the city, was the cause of whatever public airing the charges against him and his discharge received. In such circumstances, the entire omission of the \u201cpublication\u201d element from the court\u2019s charge may well have caused the jury to return a verdict against the defendants based on charges that they had sought to keep confidential and never published \u2014 until the plaintiff demanded it. This was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-14\">Because the trial appears to have been conducted under this serious misapprehension of the law, both by counsel for Mr. Campos and by the court, we conclude that the interests of justice would be better served by a remand to permit evidence of publication \u2014 if there be any \u2014 to be brought forward than by a rendition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>\n<em>Other Points</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-5\">Most of the other claims for reversal and points likely to recur on remand are covered by the passage from <em>Wells </em>quoted above, to which we refer the court and the parties. In particular, since the object of such a hearing is to insure that the employee\u2019s defense of his actions receives the same public consideration as did the employer\u2019s charges against him, it is the employer \u2014 in this case the city council \u2014 before whom such a hearing, if any, should be had. At that stage of matters, no impartiality is required of the employer, which will already have acted to discharge the employee in the usual case: only that the hearing be conducted in such a manner that the employee has a fair opportunity to make his defense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1191-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"amx-dedup-0\">. \"There is information available strongly showing that Chief Campos directed the use of City personnel and city equipment for purposes other than official police business.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag4d\">\"1.
