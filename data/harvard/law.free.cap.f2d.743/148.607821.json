The Tax Court\u2019s decision affirming the termination of the publisher\u2019s 52-year-old tax-ex\u00e9mption under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c)(3) (1982),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was based on its conclusion that the publisher had become a profitable venture with only an attenuated relationship to the church with which it claims an affiliation. For the reasons set forth below, the decision of the Tax Court will be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-18\">In 1931, the Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Company (P &amp; R) was incorporated to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-19\">state, defend and disseminate (through every proper means connected with or incidental to the printing and publishing business) the system of belief and practice taught in the Bible, as that system is now set forth in the Confession of Faith and Catechisms of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-20\">App. at R-131. P &amp; R\u2019s charter requires that any income otherwise available as a dividend be used to improve its publications, extend their influence, or assist institutions \u201cengaged in the teaching or inculcating\u201d of the \u201csystem of belief and practice\u201d of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church (OPC). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-21\">The IRS granted P &amp; R tax-exempt status in 1939, stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-22\">Your actual activities consist of publishing a religious paper known as \u201cChristianity Today,\u201d a Presbyterian journal devoted to stating, defending, and furthering the gospel. Your income is derived from subscriptions, contributions and gifts and is used to defray maintenance and general operating expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aon-dedup-0\">App. at R-132.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-23\">From the beginning, P &amp; R has been closely linked \u2014 although not formally affiliated \u2014 with the OPC, a Presbyterian group dedicated to its view of reformed Presbyte<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>rian theology and, in particular, to the doctrine of Biblical Christianity set forth in the Westminster Confession of Faith, P &amp; R\u2019s central editorial criterion is whether a book chosen for publication would make a \u201cworthy contribution ... to the reformed [Presbyterian] community.\u201d App. at R-140. One independent publisher characterized P &amp; R\u2019s books as lacking in \u201ccommon ground\u201d with the \u201cnonreformed mind\u201d and \u201coffensive\u201d to all but the \u201ctruly reformed.\u201d App. at Ex. 52-A2.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">One of P &amp; R\u2019s three incorporators and original directors founded the OPC in 1932, one year after P &amp; R\u2019s incorporation. Seven of P &amp; R\u2019s nine directors are either officials at Westminster Theological Seminary of Philadelphia or pastors of OPC or OPC-affiliated denominations. On January 1, 1976, P &amp; R changed its charter to specify OPC\u2019s seminary, the Westminster Theological Seminary of Philadelphia, as the recipient of all P &amp; R assets in case of dissolution, citing Westminster\u2019s common dedication to Biblical Christianity and the Westminster Confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The organizational structure of P &amp; R further underscores its close ties to the OPC. Since 1931, the publishing house has been run by three successive generations of the Craig family. Samuel, Charles, and Bryce Craig each worked without compensation at what amounted to a family concern whose business was conducted at the Craigs\u2019 kitchen table; all three Craigs were ministers. The record is devoid of evidence indicating any lessening of ties between P &amp; R and the OPC.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">From .its inception until 1969, the company could claim no income over and above expenses. Indeed, the Craigs themselves often contributed personal funds in order to keep the corporation afloat (Samuel donated $500 in 1939 and $3,000 in 1954; Charles donated a total of $19,600 from 1955 to 1963). Until 1973, P &amp; R relied exclusively on volunteers to help the Craigs with editing, packing, shipping, and clerical work.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Beginning in 1969, however, P &amp; R experienced a considerable increase in economic activity as a result of the sudden and unexpected popularity of books written by Jay Adams, a Westminster Theological faculty member. P &amp; R reported gross profits of over $20,000 for 1969, almost twice as much in 1970, and subsequent escalations culminating in over $300,000 in gross profits in 1979. App. at R-138. By 1979, P &amp; R had seven paid employees assisting Bryce Craig, one with a salary of $12,500, and five with salaries under $6,250 (all five full-time employees were OPC officials or members). Bryce Craig himself began receiving a salary of $12,000 in 1976, which increased, to $15,350 by 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">As early as March 2,1974, P &amp; R notified the Internal Revenue Service that it was accumulating surplus cash as a \u201cbuilding fund.\u201d In 1976, P &amp; R used this fund to purchase 5-V2 acres of land in Harmony, New Jersey, close to both an OPC community and Harmony Press, the printer for both P &amp; R and OPC. In 1978, construction of a combined warehouse and office-building in Harmony was completed at a cost of $263,000; an additional $27,000 was spent in 1979 for equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">After an audit, the IRS issued a revocation of P &amp; R\u2019s tax-exempt status in 1980 on the grounds that P &amp; R was not \u201coperating exclusively for purposes set forth in 501(c)(3)\u201d and was \u201cengaged in a business activity which is carried on similar to a commercial enterprise.\u201d The IRS made this revocation retroactive, to apply from January 1, 1969 onward.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">The Tax Court affirmed the revocation in a December 23, 1982 opinion, 79 Tax Court 1070, but held that the IRS abused its discretion in making the revocation retroactive to 1969. Instead, it set the effective revocation date at 1975, based upon its declaration that as of that year P &amp; R \u201chad acquired a truly commercial hue\u201d and the company \u201cwas aware ... that IRS agents had been raising serious questions [about its exemption].\u201d App. at R-160. To support its determination that P &amp; R came to be \u201canimated\u201d by a substantial commercial [and thus nonexempt] purpose\u201d in 1975, App. at R-147, the Tax Court relied primar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>ily on three lines of evidence: first, P &amp; R\u2019s \u201csoarpng] net and gross profits\u201d between 1969 and 1979; second, the fact that P &amp; R set prices which generated \u201cconsistent and comfortable net profit margins,\u201d rather than lowering prices to encourage a broader readership; and, third, P &amp; R\u2019s purchase and sale of books to and from Baker Book Stores (a commercial publishing house), which \u201cmust have ... overlapped] in subject matter\u201d with commercial publishers. App. at R-149-52. The Tax Court deemed this sufficient to support the proposition that P &amp; R was in \u201ccompetition with commercial publishers.\u201d App. at R-151.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">On P &amp; R\u2019s motion for reconsideration, the Tax Court issued a second opinion on April 8, 1983, leaving its prior judgment intact and rejecting P &amp; R\u2019s argument that its \u201cprofit\u201d figures should have been adjusted to reflect accumulations for the building fund. The Tax Court suggested that the new building furthered commercial purposes as much as religious purposes, and noted that \u201cgross profit margins\u201d did not fall after the building was completed. App. at R-222-23. Finally, the Tax Court emphasized that P &amp; R\u2019s accumulations exceeded its expenditures for the new building. P &amp; R\u2019s motion to reconsider also sought to distinguish its OPC-affiliated activity from that of generic Christian publishers. The Tax Court rejected this point, stating that \u201cthe denominational or nondenominational character of an organization has never been a controlling criterion.\u201d App. at R-224.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">The principal issue we must address is at what point the successful operation of a tax-exempt organization should be deemed to have transformed that organization into a commercial enterprise and thereby to have forfeited its tax exemption. The Tax Court answered this question by looking at the composite effects of the broad-scale increase in commercial activity, the accumulation of capital, the company\u2019s \u201cprofitability,\u201d and the development of a professional staff. Although these indicia of non-exempt business activity are all relevant, we are troubled by the inflexibility of the Tax Court\u2019s approach. It is doubtful that any small-scale exempt operation could ever increase its economic activity without forfeiting tax-exempt status under such a definition of non-exempt commercial character. Thus, we believe that the statutory inclusion or exclusion of P <em>&amp; </em>R should be considered under a two-prong test: first, what is the purpose of an organization claiming tax-exempt status; and, second, to whose benefit does its activity inure?</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">This two-prong inquiry is drawn directly from the wording of \u00a7 501(c)(3) and the legislative history of its enactment. The statute explicitly cites as qualifying for tax exemption those entities \u201corganized exclusively for religious, charitable ... or educational purposes.\u201d Indeed, the statute\u2019s original sponsor cited the religious publishing house as the archetypal example of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>contemplated tax-exempt organization. In the words of the sponsor, Senator Bacon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APV\">[T]he corporation which I had particularly in mind as an illustration at the time I drew this amendment is the Methodist Book Concern, which has its headquarters in Nashville, which is a very large printing establishment, and in which there must necessarily be profit made, and there is a profit made exclusively for religious, benevolent, charitable, and educational purposes, in which no man receives a scintilla of individual profit. Of course if that were the only one, it might not be a matter that you would say we would be justified in changing these provisions of law to meet a particular case, but there are in greater or less degree such institutions scattered all over this country. If Senators will mark the words, the amendment is very carefully guarded, so as not to include any institution where there is any individual profit, and further than that, where any of the funds are devoted to any purpose other than those which are religious, benevolent, charitable, and educational.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">44 Cong.Rec., pt. 4, at 4151 (1909).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">This passage directly supports the two-part test set forth today. The legislative history refers to a \u201cvery large printing establishment ... in which there must necessarily be profit made\u201d as within the scope of the exemption. Significantly, Senator Bacon\u2019s remarks point to the purpose of the publishing house and the absence of personal profit, rather than the volume of business, as the hallmarks of non-taxable activity. Assuming that large religious or educational publishers may qualify for an exemption, and assuming that not all such publishers are created as large entities, the question becomes one of defining the standards by which the growth in volume of a publisher will not in itself jeopardize the tax exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">In the case at hand, the \u201cpurpose\u201d prong of the two-part test is the more difficult to administer. Therefore, we will turn first to the question of inurement, and then return to the question of purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">In order to qualify for a \u00a7 501(c)(3) exemption, \u201cno part of an organization\u2019s net earnings may inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.\u201d Treasury regulations apply this rule to define an organization as \u201cnot operated exclusively for one or more exempt purposes if its net earnings inure in whole or in part to the benefit of private shareholders or individuals.\u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.501(c)(3)-l(c)(2) (1984). \u201cPrivate shareholder or individual\u201d is broadly defined as any person \u201chaving a personal and private interest in the activities of the organization.\u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.501(a)-l(c) (1984). The policy underpinnings of the non-inurement rule derive from the common law belief that charities should promote the public good rather than private benefit. In addition, to the extent that the personnel of a religious organization, particularly a select few, materially profit from the organization\u2019s activity, the sincerity of the claimed religious beliefs may be called into question.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">The non-inurement test is clearly articulated in <em>Founding Church of Scientology v. United States, </em>412 F.2d 1197, 188 Ct.Cl. 490, <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 1009, 90 S.Ct. 1237, 25 L.Ed.2d 422 (1969), a challenge to the denial of tax-exempt status to the Church of Scientology. Although the government attacked the church\u2019s claim for \u00a7 501(c)(3) coverage based upon both a commercial purpose and private benefit, the court reached only the latter question. Since the church allowed the leader of Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard, to receive ten per cent of the church\u2019s gross income instead of a salary, 412 F.2d at 1199, the earnings of the church directly inured to the private benefit of Mr. Hubbard. Thus, it was unnecessary to \u201cdetermine whether plaintiff\u2019s operations were exclusively for religious or educational purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court reasoned that \u201can organization\u2019s net earnings may inure to the benefit of private individuals in ways other than by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>the actual distribution of dividends or payment of excessive salaries.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1200.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Among the numerous cases denying tax-exempt status based upon private inurement are <em>Basic Unit Ministry of Alma Karl Schurig v. Comm\u2019r, </em>670 F.2d 1210 (D.C.Cir.1982) (organization spent approximately 70 per cent of its income on the living expenses of 15 members); <em>Bubbling Well Church of Universal Love, Inc. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>670 F.2d 104 (9th Cir.1981) (church paid sizeable salaries to three family members who were its sole employees and voting directors); <em>Church of the Chosen People (North American Panarchate) v. United States, </em>548 F.Supp. 1247 (D.Minn.1982) (organization which taught doctrine of \u201cGay Imperative\u201d found to be operated primarily for private purposes); <em>New Life Tabernacle v. Comm\u2019r, </em>44 T.C.M. (CCH) 309 (1982) (organization paid members\u2019 living expenses and allowances in return for their income and performance of duties); <em>Church of the Transfiguring Spirit, Inc. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>76 T.C. 1 (1981) (organization disbursed most of its income as allowance to two controlling ministers); <em>Basic Bible Church v. Comm\u2019r, </em>74 T.C. 846 (1980) (church\u2019s founder and his family received 75 per cent of church income for \u201csubsistance\u201d); <em>People of God Community v. Comm\u2019r, </em>75 T.C. 127 (1980) (under a percentage-of-gross tithes method, petitioner\u2019s three ministers received salaries totaling well over half of its budget); <em>The Southern Church of Universal Brotherhood Assembled Inc., v. Comm\u2019r, </em>74 T.C. 1223 (1980) (church paid living expenses of minister in return for virtually all of his income) aff\u2019d, 647 F.2d 163 (2d Cir.1981); <em>Unitary Mission Church of Long Island v. Comm\u2019r, </em>74 T.C. 507 (1980) (church\u2019s ministers received travel expenses, loans and fluctuating allowances); <em>Beth-El Ministries, Inc. v. U.S., </em>79-2 U.S.Tax Cas. (CCH) \u00b6 9412 (D.D.C.1979) (organization provided members with food, clothing, shelter and support in return for their salaries and possessions); <em>Incorporated Trustees of the Gospel Worker Society, </em>510 F.Supp. 374 (D.D.C.1981); <em>Christian Manner Int\u2019l v. Comm\u2019r, </em>71 T.C. 661 (1979) (publishing house published only its founder\u2019s two books and was determined to be primarily engaged in underwriting founder\u2019s writings).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">There is no basis in the record for concluding that P &amp; IPs increased commercial activity inured to the personal benefit of any individual. Although the Tax Court commented on the fact that the total wages and salaries paid by the publishing company rose from under $550 in 1972 to about $57,600 in 1979, App. at R-135, a breakdown of these figures negates any suggestion of personal enrichment. In 1979 Bryce Craig was receiving $15,350, none of the seven other paid employees received annual salaries over $12,500, and five were paid under $6,250. App. at R-134. Under extant circumstances, such salaries were relatively modest.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Therefore, if P &amp; R is to be denied tax-exempt status, it must be as a result of the first prong of the test set forward today: the purpose of P &amp; R would have to be incompatible with \u00a7 501(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">In order to come within the terms of \u00a7 501(c)(3), an organization seeking tax-exempt status must establish that it is organized \u201cexclusively\u201d for an exempt purpose. In the leading case elucidating the purposes considered exempt under \u00a7 501(c)(3), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>the Supreme Court in <em>Better Business Bureau v. U.S., </em>326 U.S. 279, 283, 66 S.Ct. 112, 114, 90 L.Ed. 67 (1945), stated, \u201c[t]he presence of a single [non-exempt] purpose, ... substantial in nature, will destroy the exemption.\u201d The Court found that the Better Business Bureau of the District of Columbia was not exempt because a substantial purpose was \u201cthe mutual welfare, protection and improvement of business methods among merchants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281, 66 S.Ct. at 113. Nevertheless, <em>Better Business Bureau </em>is a relatively straightforward case because of the presence of an explicit non-exempt commercial purpose by the organization claiming the exemption. P &amp; R, to the contrary, claims that it is animated by no commercial motive and therefore falls squarely within the statutory exemption. Thus, the Tax Court\u2019s decision in the present case rests on the evaluation of what it deemed to be the true but unspoken motive of P &amp; R.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Any exploration of unarticulated or illicit purpose necessarily involves courts in difficult and murky problems. When the legality of an action depends not upon its surface manifestation but upon the undisclosed motivation of the actor, similar acts can lead to diametrically opposite legal consequences. In the field of equal protection law, for instance, similar state actions having disproportionate impacts upon minorities may be upheld or struck down depending upon the weighing of various indicia of \u201cdiscriminatory intent.\u201d <em>Compare Rogers v. Lodge, </em>458 U.S. 613, 102 S.Ct. 3272, 73 L.Ed.2d 1012 (1982) (striking down at-large election systems in Burke County, Georgia as invidiously motivated) with <em>City of Mobile v. Bolden, </em>446 U.S. 55, 100 S.Ct. 1490, 64 L.Ed.2d 47 (1980) (upholding identical election scheme in Mobile, Alabama).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">The difficulties inherent in any legal standard predicated upon the subjective intent of an actor are further compounded when that actor is a corporate entity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In such circumstances, courts forced to pass upon a potentially illicit purpose have looked for objective indicia from which the intent of the actor may be discerned. <em>See, e.g., Griffin v. County School Board, </em>377 U.S. 218, 230-32, 84 S.Ct. 1226, 1232-33, 12 L.Ed.2d 256 (1964) (intent in closing school to avoid desegregation order inferred from past segregative practices). In reviewing the decision of the Tax Court in the present case, therefore, the question is whether the proper indicia were relied upon in concluding that P &amp; R was animated by a purpose alien to the statutory exemption of \u00a7 501(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">The Tax Court properly framed the inquiry as to whether P &amp; R\u2019s purpose was within \u00a7 501(c)(3) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-13\">Where a nonexempt purpose is not an expressed goal, courts have focused on the manner in which activities themselves are carried on, implicitly reasoning that an end can be inferred from the chosen means. If, for example, an organization\u2019s management decisions replicate those of commercial enterprises, it is a fair inference that at least one purpose is commercial, and hence nonexempt. And if this nonexempt goal is substantial, tax exempt status must be denied. Clearly, petitioner\u2019s conduct of a growing and very profitable publishing business must enbue it with some commercial hue. How deep a tint these activities impart can best be evaluated by looking at certain factors deemed significant in cases involving religious publishing companies, as well as in other pertinent cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-14\">App. at R-147-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-15\">There are two aspects of the Tax Court\u2019s opinion regarding P &amp; R\u2019s purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>that require careful examination. First is the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cpetitioner was not affiliated or controlled by any particular church and [that] this nondenominational character \u2018contributes to the resemblance between its publishing activities and those of commercial, non-exempt publishers of Christian literature with whom ... [it] competes.\u2019 \u201d App. at R-153, quoting <em>Inc. Trustees of Gospel Wkr. Soc. v. United States, </em>510 F.Supp. 374, 379 n. 16 (D.D.C.1981). Given the close connection between P &amp; R and the OPC, the absence of formal control of P &amp; R by any particular church is not dispositive of the question of the fundamental ties between its goals as a publishing house and the dogma espoused by the OPC. In <em>Inc. Trustees, </em>the court\u2019s decision that a gospel-oriented press failed to qualify for \u00a7 501(c)(3) status did not turn on the extent of the press\u2019 formal affiliation with a church. Rather, the court focused on the virtually complete cessation of religious activity by the church, the church\u2019s unexplained accumulation of millions of dollars, and the fact that some officers of the affiliated publishing concern were drawing salaries ranging from $42,-000 to over $100,000. The Tax Court itself seems to have recognized the non-dispositive nature of formal affiliation in its decision on the motion for reconsideration, where it stated, \u201cthe denominational or nondenominational character of an organization has never been a controlling criterion.\u201d App. at R-224 (citing <em>Fides Publishers Ass\u2019n v. United States, </em>263 F.Supp. 924 (N.D.Ind.1967)).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The second point, P &amp; R\u2019s accumulation of \u201cprofits,\u201d causes greater difficulty. Although the profits of P &amp; R constituted only one of the factors enumerated and discussed by the Tax Court in its opinion, the memorandum filed upon P &amp; R\u2019s motion for reconsideration makes clear that the Tax Court\u2019s principal concern was the \u201cpresence of substantial profits.\u201d App. at R-220. The Tax Court computed P &amp; R\u2019s profits by subtracting the cost of goods sold from the gross sales of books to arrive at the gross profits. The sum of other expenses was in turn subtracted from the gross profits to derive the net profit schedule used by the Tax Court in determining P &amp; R\u2019s profitability. App. at R-138. These net profits peaked at $106,180 in 1975, the year the Tax Court decided that P &amp; R had acquired a truly commercial character. On reconsideration, the Tax Court added that the gross profits margin of P &amp; R did not fall even after the new building was constructed. App. at R-222.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">We do not read \u00a7 501(c)(3) or its legislative history to define the purpose of an organization claiming tax-exempt status as a direct derivative of the volume of business of that organization. Rather, the inquiry must remain that of determining the purpose to which the increased business activity is directed. As the Tax Court itself observed, \u201cthe presence of profitmaking activities is not per se a bar to qualification of an organization as exempt if the activities further or accomplish an exempt purpose.\u201d <em>Aid to Artisans, Inc. v. Commissioner, </em>71 T.C. 202, 211 (1978).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Despite the long history of \u00a7 501(c)(3) and the numerous organizations that have claimed its coverage, no regulation or body of case law has defined the concept of \u201cpurpose\u201d under this provision of the Tax Code with sufficient clarity to protect against arbitrary, ad hoc decision-making.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>The Tax Court\u2019s analysis of P &amp; R\u2019s accumulation of profits in the present context could, absent a clearer articulation of the legal standard for tax-exempt status, lead to such arbitrary or ad hoc treatment. We are particularly concerned that although the Tax Court acknowledged that P &amp; R informed the IRS as early as March 2, 1974 of its accumulation of funds to purchase or build an office and warehouse, App. at R-137, the opinion tabulates the company\u2019s cash-on-hand, App. at R-139, and cites this as an important factor in concluding that P &amp; R was motivated by a non-exempt purpose. App. at R-149.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">There is no doubt that unexplained accumulations of cash may properly be considered as evidence of commercial purpose. Although no regulations govern cash accumulations in the 501(c)(3) context, we are guided by the accumulated earnings tax, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 531 <em>et seq. </em>(1982). The accumulated earnings provision of the Tax Code was designed to weed out illegitimate non-payment of dividends by corporations seeking to avoid the higher tax exposure of shareholders. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 532. A violation of this section is established by a corporation\u2019s accumulation of earnings beyond the reasonable needs of the business, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 533, which may include reasonably anticipated future needs of the enterprise. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 537. The legislative history of this provision reveals congressional concern that an inflexible application of the tax laws not stifle legitimate business expansion. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1337, 83rd Cong., 2d Sess. 52 (1954); S.Rep. No. 1622, 83rd Cong., 2d Sess. 68 (1954), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1954, p. 4017. The legislative concern was directly incorporated by the IRS in its regulations,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> particularly 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.537-2(b)(l) (1984) which cites as a reasonable basis for the accumulation of earnings and profits the need to \u201cprovide for bona fide expansion of business or replacement of plant ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">Given the absence of regulations governing the accumulation of cash by \u00a7 501(c)(3) organizations, it is reasonable to take notice of the regulations developed by the IRS in 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.537 in reviewing the case at bar. In light of the clear notice to the IRS of P &amp; R\u2019s need to expand its physical capacity, the claim that the accumulated profits would be used for this purpose,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the recognition by the IRS of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>such expansion as a legitimate reason for cash accumulation, we are unable to affirm the Tax Court\u2019s determination that P &amp; R\u2019s cash-on-hand situation was a strong indicator of a non-exempt purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Although we recognize that the Tax Court is entitled to deference in determining the existence of a substantial, nonexempt purpose, that court must focus on facts which indicate a purpose falling outside the ambit of section 501(c)(3).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In this case, the Tax Court focused primarily on two factors \u2014 the lack of affiliation with a particular church and the accumulation of profits. As we have shown, neither factor indicates the presence of a non-exempt purpose here. Therefore, we must consider the balance of the record to determine whether all the evidence taken together supports a finding of non-exemption. Such an examination reveals no additional evidence of improper motives.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-14\">Two competing policy considerations are present in situations where tax-exempt organizations begin to expand the scope of their profit-generating activities. On the one hand, the simple act of accumulating revenues may properly call into question the ultimate purpose of an organization ostensibly dedicated to one of the enumerated pursuits under \u00a7 501(c)(3). On the other hand, success in terms of audience reached and influence exerted, in and of itself, should not jeopardize the tax-exempt status of organizations which remain true to their stated goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-15\">Our concern is that organizations seeking \u00a7 501(c)(3) status may be forced to choose between expanding their audience <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>and influence on the one hand, and maintaining their tax-exempt status on the other. If this were a stagnant society in which various ideas and creeds preserve a hold on a fixed proportion of the population, this concern would evaporate. A large religious institution with a broad base of support, such as one of the more established churches, could be the springboard for large-scale publishing houses dedicated to advancing its doctrines and be assured of qualifying for \u00a7 501(c)(3) coverage. A small denomination, such as the OPC, could then have within its penumbra only a small-scale operation run off a kitchen table. In such circumstances, any attempt by a publisher adhering to the views of the small denomination to expand its scope of activities would properly raise questions relating to its continued eligibility for tax-exempt status.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">This view does not reflect either the dynamic quality of our society or the goals that generated the grant of tax-exempt status to religious publishers. The sudden popularity of an erstwhile obscure writer, such as Jay Adams, cannot, by itself, be the basis for stating that P &amp; R has departed from its professed purpose any more than an increase in congregations would call into question the OPC\u2019s continued designation as a church. Such a standard would lead to an inequitable disparity in treatment for publishers affiliated with mainstream churches as opposed to small offshoots.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Accordingly, the decision of the Tax Court will be reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b226-15\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c)(3) provides a list of organizations eligible for tax-exempt status:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aft\">Corporations, and any community chest, fund, or foundation, organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, testing for public safety, literary, or educational purposes, or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals, no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual, no substantial part of the activities of which is carrying on propaganda, or otherwise attempting, to influence legislation, and which does not participate in, or intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of any candidate for public office.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b228-5\">.

It consciously attempted to transform itself into a more mainline commercial enterprise: It searched out more readers; it employed paid workers; it dropped money-losing plans; it paid substantial royalties; it made formal contracts with some authors; and, of course, it expanded into a new facility from which it could continue to reap profits. Further, petitioner was not affiliated or controlled by any particular church organization and this nondenominational character \"contributes to the resemblance between its publishing activities and those of commercial, non-exempt publishers of Christian literature with whom ... [it] competes.\" <em>Inc. Trustees of Gospel Wkr. Soc. v. United States, </em>[510 F.Supp. 374,] 379, n. 16 [D.D.C. (1981) ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfS\">Petitioner argues that it accumulated profits to expand so that it could publish more books and thus reach more readers. We recognize that petitioner used a large amount of its accumulated profits for the new Harmony facility; this new facility probably aided petitioner in increasing its productivity and distribution. Such increase, however, may also be indicative of a commercial enterprise. We are not convinced that one of the significant reasons for expansion was not the commercial one of wishing to expand production for profit. <em>Cf. Inc. Trustees of Gospel Wkr. Soc. v.

To alleviate the problem, in 1969 Charles and his wife personally purchased a house with a cinderblock truck garage in East Orange, New Jersey, for approximately $30,000. Petitioner\u2019s operations were moved to the garage while the house was rented to people unconnected with petitioner. Charles paid fire and liability insurance on the house and garage from 1969 through 1978 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>(the period in which he owned the property); and in 1970 he purchased and had installed a heating system for the garage at a cost of $1,460.
