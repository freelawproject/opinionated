TT r T1T. \u00a7 1254(a)(1). He contends that the BIA , , abused its discretion by finding that: (1) , , , ,, \u00b0 \u00cd deportation to the Philippines would not A A 1 cause him extreme hardship; and (2) his brief trips to the Philippines \u201cmeaningfully interrupted\u201d his seven years continuous presence in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"AM9\">_ . , . . asiSan&gt; a l ty;mne year'\u00b0 na lve aa citizen of the Philippines, first entered the United States as a non-immigrant temporary worker m September 1973. Between 1973 and 1982, Dasigan left the United \u201e ., , , , ; States temporarily and returned to the f . \u201c T Philippines twice, from May 1976 until Jan- \u201e /. uary 1977 and from October 1979 until <em>* </em>January 1980. Both times Dasigan left the United States because his temporary worker visa expired and returned after obtaining a new temporary worker visa.</p>\n<p id=\"all-dedup-0\">. . Unfortunately for petitioner, the Supreme Court of the United States changed the law from what he (and this court) had previously thought and stated it to be. Petitioner had filed his opening brief on this appeal on September 30, 1983. The INS filed its answering brief on November 4, 1983. On January 10, 1984, the Supreme Court handed down the decision in <em>INS v. Phinpathya, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 584, 589, 78 L.Ed.2d 401 (1984) and reversed this court\u2019s opinion appearing at 673 F.2d 1013 (9th Cir.1981) which had followed this circuit\u2019s earlier opinion in <em>Kamheangpatiyooth v. INS, </em>597 F.2d 1253, 1257 (9th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"AyL\">The issue considered in <em>Phinpathya </em>was the intent of Congress in using the words b8 U'S'C- \u00a7 1254(a)(1) \u201ccontinuous physical Presence- Said the Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbE\">\u201cThe [Ninth Circuit] Court of Appeals\u2019 interpretation of this requirement [continuous physical presence] departs from the act\u2019s plain meaning. \u00a7 244(a)(l)\u2019s language requiring certain threshold cri- <em>^ \\ . </em>* 5 ., ... ^ tena to be met before the Attorney Gen- , , eral m his discretion may suspend deportation, plainly narrows the class of aliens wh0 may obtain suspension.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAbd\">T , \u2022 <em>,, </em>rA70 ,, ,.

He argues that his two triPs to fche Philippines to obtain a new nonimmigrant temporary worker visa did not \u201cmeaningfully interrupt\u201d his seven years continuous presence m the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"a7b-dedup-0\">In <em>INS v. Phinpathya, </em>the Supreme Court held that the seven years continuous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>presence requirement of \u00a7 1254(a)(1) is a strict threshold criteria an alien must meet before the Attorney General may exercise discretion to suspend deportation. <em>Id. </em>at 592. After reviewing the language of the statute and legislative history, the Court refused to permit any exception to \u201ccontinuous physical presence\u201d to satisfy the statutory requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 589-93.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A7S\">The petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AyE6\">. In disapproving any exception to the \u201ccontinuous physical presence\u201d requirement of \u00a7 1254(a)(1), the Court carefully distinguished this case from <em>Rosenberg v. Fleuti, </em>374 U.S. 449, 83 S.Ct. 1804, 10 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1963), in which it took a much more flexible approach to statutory construction under the Immigration and Nationality Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"acv-dedup-0\"><em>Fleuti </em>dealt with a statutory exception enacted precisely to ameliorate the harsh effects of prior judicial construction of the \u201centry\u201d doctrine... By contrast, this case deals with a threshold requirement added to that statute specifically to limit the discretionary availability of the suspension remedy... Thus, whereas a flexible approach to statutory construction was consistent with the congression-ai purpose underlying \u00a7 101(a)(13), such an approach would not be consistent with the congressional purpose underlying the \"continuous physical presence\u201d requirement.
