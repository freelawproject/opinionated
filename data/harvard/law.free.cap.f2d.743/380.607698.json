Long, seeking a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction prohibiting the defendant, EEOC, from requiring Long to appear at a deposition and to produce certain documents pursuant to an administrative subpoena. The EEOC had issued the subpoena in connection with its attempts to investigate charges of age discrimination filed by an employee discharged by Muller Optical. Muller Optical had resisted all efforts by the EEOC to investigate the charge, making the subpoena necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-22\">The plaintiffs argued that the EEOC lacked authority to investigate the age discrimination charges because the Reorganization Act of 1977, which authorized the transfer of authority to enforce the ADEA, was invalid because it contained a one-House legislative veto found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in <em>Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Cha-dha, </em>462 U.S. 919, 103 S.Ct. 2764, 77 L.Ed.2d 317 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-23\">The District court denied the request for a preliminary injunction, holding that the offending provision was severable from the rest of the act and, in the alternative, that subsequent acts of Congress had ratified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>the transfer of enforcement authority under the ADEA from the Department of Labor to the EEOC. The case is now on appeal from that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">As a preliminary matter, the EEOC argues that Muller Optical lacks standing to bring this suit because it can demonstrate no injury. The claim is that Muller Optical suffers no more injury if it is investigated by the EEOC than it would if investigated by the Department of Labor. The district court rejected this argument as have other courts presented with this issue. <em>Muller Optical Company v. EEOC, </em>574 F.Supp. 946 (W.D.Tenn.1983); <em>EEOC v. Allstate Insurance Company, </em>570 F.Supp. 1224 (S.D.Miss.1983). <em>See also, EEOC v. Chrysler Corp., </em>No. 81-72347, slip op. at 8-10 (E.D.Mich. Jan. 23, 1984). In this case the plaintiffs have been subpoenaed by the EEOC and ordered to produce documents. The plaintiffs claim that the EEOC lacks authority to investigate the age discrimination claims and, therefore, lacks authority to issue the subpoena. The plaintiffs have alleged sufficient injury to meet the requirements for standing and the district court was correct in rejecting this frivolous argument. <em>See Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., </em>454 U.S. 464, 472, 102, 752, 758, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982); <em>Gladstone Realtors v.

Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Org., </em>426 U.S. 26, 38, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 1924, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The Court has entertained and granted motions on behalf of Chrysler Corporation and ANR Pipeline Company and Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America to file briefs amici curiae. The material provided by counsel has been of assistance to the Court in resolving this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"a4k-dedup-0\">LEGISLATIVE HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"AhqE\">Age Discrimination in Employment Act</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Congress passed the Age Discrimination in Employment Act in 1967 and placed enforcement authority under the Department of Labor. The Secretary of Labor was given the authority to appoint agents and retain employees necessary to enforce the act, to issue necessary rules and regulations, to make investigations and to enforce the provisions of the act in accordance with the powers, remedies and procedures contained in designated sections of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 625, 626, and 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">The Reorganization Act of 1977</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">In 1977 Congress passed the Reorganization Act, authorizing the President to reorganize the executive branch and its agencies to increase efficiency and to promote the better execution of the laws. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 901. Section 901 describes the broad policies of the Reorganization Act; sections 903 and 904 describe the methods by which the reorganization might be accomplished; and section 905 outlines the limitations on the reorganization power. The President was required to transmit each reorganization plan to both Houses of Congress, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 903, and the plan would become effective after the passage of 60 days. However, the statute permitted either House of Congress to prevent the plan from taking effect.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-10\">[A] reorganization plan is effective at the end of the first period of sixty calendar days of continuous session of Congress after the date on which the plan is transmitted to it unless, between the date of transmittal and the end of the sixty day period, either House passes a resolution stating in substance that the House does not favor the reorganization plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 906. The Reorganization Act also provided that a resolution disapproving each reorganization plan would be automatically introduced in the House of Representatives and in the Senate on the first day of session following transmittal of the plan. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 909-10. The plan would be reviewed by the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and by the Committee on Government Operations of the House and reported out of committee within 45 days. If the plan was not reported within 45 days, it would be placed on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>calendar of the appropriate House for consideration. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978 transferred the authority to enforce the ADEA to the EEOC. 43 F.R. 19807, 92 Stat. 3781, <em>reprinted at </em>5 U.S.C.App. at 111 (Supp. 1984).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The transfer of authority under the ADEA was complete and did not alter the substance of the enforcement authority in any way. The power of government over individuals and corporations was not enlarged nor was it diminished by the reorganization. The effect was merely to transfer the authority provided under the ADEA from the Labor Department to the EEOC.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Neither House of Congress exercised the legislative veto provision contained in \u00a7 906 with respect to the Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978. The House rejected the resolution of disapproval by a vote of 356 to 39. <em>See 124 </em>Cong.Rec. 1136-37. The Senate Committee on Government Operations unfavorably reported a similar resolution of disapproval by a unanimous vote and, by unanimous consent, the Senate indefinitely postponed consideration of the resolution. <em>See </em>124 Cong.Rec. 10,912, 12,-888. The actions occurred after lengthy hearings by both committees assigned to review the Reorganization Plan of 1978.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The transfer of authority to enforce the ADEA was implemented on July 1, 1979, pursuant to the Reorganization Act and the Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978, and the EEOC has enforced the Act since that date. <em>See </em>Executive Order No. 12,144, 44 Fed. Reg. 37, 193 (June 26, 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-15\">Post Transfer Congressional Action</p>\n<p id=\"b447-16\">Since the transfer was effectuated, Congress has appropriated funds requested by the EEOC for the functions transferred. The appropriation bills for fiscal years 1981 and 1983 contain citations to both the Equal Pay Act and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act in connection with the appropriation made to the EEOC.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hearings held in connection with budget submissions on behalf of the EEOC contain testimony referencing the enforcement of the Equal Pay Act and ADEA as an EEOC function.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-17\">The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 contains a specific reference to Reorganization Plans 1 and 2 of 1978, stating that any provision of either plan which was inconsistent with the Act was superceded. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 note at 93 (Supp.1984). Nothing in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 was inconsistent with the transfer of ADEA enforcement authority contained in Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>THE CHADHA DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"APa\">In <em>Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha, supra, </em>the Supreme Court held that the exercise of a one-House veto, authorized by statute, was unconstitutional because it enabled Congress to act in a legislative capacity without complying with the procedural requirements of Article I. <em>Chadha </em>addressed the one-House veto provision contained in \u00a7 244(c)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(c)(2), which had been exercised to reverse a decision by the Attorney General granting permanent residence to six aliens, including Chadha. Section 244(c)(1) of the Act gave the Attorney General discretionary power to suspend the deportation of an alien under certain conditions. Upon exercising this power, the Attorney General was required to prepare a detailed report for submission to Congress, which would enable it to review the decision. Under \u00a7 244(c)(2) either House could pass a resolution reversing the decision of the Attorney General and the House of Representatives passed such a resolution. The Supreme Court found that Congress had delegated the authority to the Attorney General and could not alter the decision to suspend deportation, if at all, except through the established legislative process of Article I of the Constitution. The exercise of the one-House veto in <em>Chadha </em>was a <em>legislative </em>act which altered rights, duties and relations and, as such, was an exercise of power unauthorized by the Constitution.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-4\">Examination of the action taken here by one House pursuant to \u00a7 244(c)(2) reveals that it was essentially legislative in purpose and effect. In purporting to exercise power defined in Art. 1, \u00a7 8, cl. 4 to \u201cestablish an uniform Rule of Naturalization,\u201d the House took action that had the purpose and effect of altering the legal rights, duties and relations of persons, including the Attorney General, executive branch officials and Chadha, all outside the legislative branch. Section 244(c)(2) purports to authorize one House of Congress to require the Attorney General to deport an individual alien whose deportation otherwise would be cancelled under \u00a7 244. The one-House veto operated in this case to overrule the Attorney General and mandate Chadha\u2019s deportation; absent the House action, Chadha would remain in the United States. Congress has <em>acted </em>and its action has altered Chadha\u2019s status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">The legislative character of the one-House veto in this case is confirmed by the character of the Congressional action it supplants. Neither the House of Representatives nor the Senate contends that, absent the veto provision in \u00a7 244(c)(2), either of them, or both of them acting together, could effectively require the Attorney General to deport an alien once the Attorney General, in the exercise of legislatively delegated authority, had determined the alien should remain in the United States. Without the challenged provision in \u00a7 244(c)(2), this could have been achieved, if at all, only by legislation requiring deportation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"avq-dedup-0\"><em>Chadha, supra, </em>103 S.Ct. at 2784-85. It is clear from the decision in <em>Chadha </em>that the exercise of a one-House veto is unconstitutional. It is not altogether clear, however, how this decision affects statutes containing one-House veto provisions that Congress has chosen not to exercise. That is precisely the problem presented in this case and the problem that looms over a significant number of statutes passed by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">If <em>Chadha </em>applies to potentially invalidate all statutes containing legislative veto provisions, whether exercised or not, a substantial amount of legislation will be drawn into question as well as agency action thereunder. <em>See Chadha, supra, </em>103 S.Ct. at 2811-16 (Appendix to dissenting opinion of J. White). Justice White, in his dissenting opinion in <em>Chadha, </em>states that legislative veto provisions have been included in nearly 200 statutes covering a variety of areas. The Reorganization Act of 1977 alone, which is the subject of this case, was the basis for ten different reorganization plans which became effective between 1977 and 1980. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C.App. I at 98-152 (Supp.1984). The various plans created of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>fices and agencies, transferred functions among agencies, and consolidated functions to eliminate duplication \u2014 all as directed by Congress in the Reorganization Act. The present case is merely one of the many possible ways a dispute might arise challenging a specific act of reorganization.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">As easily predicted, there have been a number of cases since <em>Chadha </em>challenging statutes containing legislative veto provisions and courts have used a variety of approaches in dealing with the problem.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> All of the arguments and approaches to the problem used in these cases have been thoroughly explored by the interested parties in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The EEOC argues that the court should not apply <em>Chadha </em>for two reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">1. The unconstitutional one-House veto provision can be severed to preserve the substantive portions of the Reorganization Act and thereby to validate the Reorganization Plans implemented pursuant to the Act. In <em>Chadha, supra, </em>the Supreme Court found that the one-House veto provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act was severable from the remaining provisions based upon the presence of a sever-ability clause and the legislative history of the Act. The Reorganization Act contains no severability clause but the EEOC argues that severability can be drawn from the legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">2. Congressional action subsequent to the Reorganization Act has impliedly ratified the transfer of ADEA enforcement authority to the EEOC. The Commission contends that the subsequent appropriations to the EEOC, which cite enforcement of the Equal Pay Act and the ADEA as part of the basis for the appropriation, and the reference to the Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978 in the Civil Service Reform Act support a finding of ratification.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">An amicus asserts that the transfer of enforcement authority to the EEOC was not consistent with Congressional intent demonstrated in the legislative history surrounding the provision of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act which vested enforcement authority in the Department of Labor. That amicus argues that Congress carefully considered the placement of enforcement authority and specifically chose the Department of Labor instead of the newer and more inexperienced EEOC and that the transfer directly contravenes the original action of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">All of these arguments assume that the presence of the one-House veto in the Reorganization Act is alone sufficient to invalidate the Act, without regard to the fact that the veto was not exercised in this case. The Court is not persuaded that <em>Chadha </em>dictates this conclusion or necessitates framing the issues in this way.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-14\">The basis for the decision in <em>Chadha </em>is the doctrine of separation of powers which is integral to the constitutional scheme. Under Art. I, \u00a7 1, \u201c[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.\u201d Article II, Section 1 provides \u201cThe executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America\u201d. And Article III, Section 1 vests in the \u201cSupreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as Congress may from time to time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>ordain and establish\u201d the \u201cjudicial power of the United States\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">The President may not circumvent the constitution by attempting to legislate by Executive Order. <em>Youngstown Co. v. Sawyer, </em>343 U.S. 579, 72 S.Ct. 863, 96 L.Ed. 1153 (1952). Congress may not usurp the appointment power vested in the President pursuant to Art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2 <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 120-43, 96 S.Ct. 612, 682-94, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976). Congress may not exercise judicial power by legislating deprivations for specific individuals or groups of individuals in violation of the Bill of Attainder Clause. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>381 U.S. 437, 85 S.Ct. 1707, 14 L.Ed.2d 484 (1965); <em>United States v. Lovett, </em>328 U.S. 303, 66 S.Ct. 1073, 90 L.Ed. 1252 (1946). The constitution dictates each of these results through the specific delegations of power in Articles I, II, and III.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The Supreme Court in <em>Chadha </em>found that the exercise of one-House veto violated the constitution because in substance it was an attempt to legislate by one-House of Congress. In using the veto, the House of Representatives purported to exercise more power than it had been given by the constitution. For a particular bill to become law, it must be passed by both Houses of Congress and presented to the President and neither requirement was met. The exercise of the veto in <em>Chadha </em>also invaded the authority of the Executive Branch in that it sought to require the Attorney General to deport an alien after he had decided, in the exercise of properly delegated authority, that the alien should be permitted to stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The judiciary, like the other two branches of government, is confined to the power granted by the constitution and can act only within the context of a case or controversy brought in conformity with the jurisdictional grant of Article III, \u00a7 2. The policy of judicial restraint is consistent with the separation of powers inherent in the constitutional scheme and the idea that courts should be reluctant to act absent a specific case brought within the constitutional grant of jurisdiction was articulated long ago in <em>Hayburn\u2019s Case, </em>2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 408, 1 L.Ed. 436 (1792) and in <em>Marbury v. Madison, </em>5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803). The duty to avoid decisions of constitutional questions and the various doctrines related to advisory opinions, political questions, ripeness, etc., are all based upon the general policy of judicial restraint. Consequently, this court must seek to avoid the constitutional determination and must attempt to preserve the legislation in question, if possible. <em>See, e.g., Johnson v. Robison, </em>415 U.S. 361, 366-67, 94 S.Ct. 1160, 1165-66, 39 L.Ed.2d 389 (1974); <em>United States v. Thirty-Seven (37) Photographs, </em>402 U.S. 363, 369, 91 S.Ct. 1400, 1404, 28 L.Ed.2d 822 <em>rehearing denied, </em>403 U.S. 924, 91 S.Ct. 2221, 29 L.Ed.2d 702 (1971); <em>Crowell v. Benson, </em>285 U.S. 22, 62, 52 S.Ct. 285, 296, 76 L.Ed. 598 (1932); <em>Trade-Mark Cases, </em>100 U.S. 82, 96, (10 Otto) 82, 96, 25 L.Ed. 550 (1879).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">It is with these principles in mind that the court approaches the question of the constitutionality of the Reorganization Act and the Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978. It is clear that <em>Chadha </em>dictates and expressly holds that the exercise of the one-House veto is unconstitutional. In exercising the veto Congress purported to act in a legislative capacity. This action was a violation of Article I. In the present case, Congress did not exercise the veto and did not act to legislate contrary to its constitutional grant of power.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">The Reorganization Act expressly delegated the power to the President to reorganize and restructure the executive branch consistent with the policies and the limitations of the Act. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-912. The President prepared the Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978 in conformity with the power delegated. The plan did not alter the substance of any right conferred under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act but merely transferred the authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>enforce substantive rights to the EEOC.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is clear from the legislative history that Congress was satisfied that the President had complied with the standards set forth in the Act. As discussed earlier, the House voted against the resolution of disapproval and the Senate unanimously consented to table the resolution after receiving the recommendation from its Committee on Government Operations that the resolution of disapproval be rejected. Both the House and Senate committees charged with reviewing the reorganization plan conducted hearings on the advisability of the transfer of enforcement authority prior to presenting recommendations on the resolutions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">In enacting the Reorganization Act, Congress tried, through the legislative veto, to put a string on the power delegated to the President in much the same way as it tried to put a string on the power delegated to the Attorney General in <em>Chadha. </em>As in <em>Chadha, </em>the veto provision could not be validly exercised. However, in the present case, the one-House veto was never exercised and the legislative history surrounding the Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978 demonstrates that the President acted in accordance with the wishes of Congress. The Reorganization Act itself was enacted in conformance with Article I and Congress did not veto the plan and then did not act in an unconstitutional manner in violation of Article I as occurred in <em>Chadha. </em>The legislative and executive branches of government never came into conflict as they did in <em>Chadha </em>to create a constitutional confrontation that would require judicial intervention. When there is no confrontation, the court should not create one and should not decide questions in the hypothetical.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">Therefore, the court concludes that it is not necessary to examine the legislative history to determine whether the veto provision is severable. Nor is it necessary to determine if subsequent actions of Congress constitute a ratification of the President\u2019s reorganization plan. These issues are simply not relevant in this case. When the President Acts in accordance with the wishes of Congress and Congress does not act in an unconstitutional manner by attempting to legislate by means of the one-House veto, there is no need to go further and examine the severability question as was necessary in <em>Chadha. </em>If Congress had attempted to legislate in this unconstitutional manner, then the issue would be relevant. But when Congress does not act unconstitutionally, the severability of a provision permitting unconstitutional action should not be part of the proper analysis of the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">The central question for the consideration of severability is whether Congress would have passed the statute absent the offending provision. The difficulty arises when an invalid provision is an integral part of the scheme contemplated by the statute. It is hard to see the logic of this inquiry under the circumstances of the present case. Congress has long since reviewed the President\u2019s reorganization plan and has long since chosen not to exercise the one-House veto. Congress and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>President were apparently in accord with respect to the transfer of authority to the EEOC. To inquire at this point in time whether Congress would have passed the Reorganizational Act without the one-House veto provision and, thereby, whether the substantive provisions of the Act are effective absent the provision, makes no sense when Congress has already declined to use the veto provision and thus has already approved the plan. Such an inquiry would involve the court in needless speculation and would require it to manufacture a conflict between Congress and the President when no conflict in fact exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Not only is a consideration of the severability of the veto provision not relevant for all the reasons stated, but also severance in the absence of a clearly expressed legislative intent is a murky endeavor and the resting of a constitutional decision involving the transfer of executive power on such an exercise filled with the subjective feelings so necessary to this type of analysis should be avoided. Instead, a court faced with the claim made in this case should endeavor to provide analysis and guidance that does not involve the subjective opinions of individuals and that will help solve the constitutional claims in the hundreds of other cases arising as a result of more than half a century of inclusion of a legislative veto provision in statutes. The correct analysis is that Congress did not act unconstitutionally when it passed the Reorganization Act of 1977. Congress did not act unconstitutionally by attempting to exercise a one-House veto. No conflict existed between Congress and the executive. The existence of an unused portion of the statute which, if used, would not be valid does not make invalid the exercise of power directed by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The conclusion, that the existence of a one-House veto provision in a statute does not render the statute invalid but only renders the act of Congress, if it attempts to exercise its one-House veto invalid, does not end the court\u2019s inquiry in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Congress may not delegate legislative authority without establishing a set of standards to guide, direct and circumscribe the exercise of that authority. <em>Lichter v. United States, </em>334 U.S. 742, 68 S.Ct. 1294, 92 L.Ed. 1694 (1948); <em>Schechter Corp. v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 495, 55 S.Ct. 837, 79 L.Ed. 1570 (1935); <em>Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, </em>293 U.S. 388, 55 S.Ct. 241, 79 L.Ed. 446 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">It is thought by some that the legislative veto has been used by Congress to avoid the difficult problem of designing standards sufficiently detailed to provide guidance, <em>See Chadha, supra, </em>103 S.Ct. at 2792-96 (J. White dissenting). As Professor Tribe said prior to <em>Chadha, </em>the inclusion of a legislative veto should not cure an overbroad delegation of authority. L. Tribe, <em>American Constitutional Law, </em>162 (1978). On the other hand, he likewise observed that a properly limited delegation is not rendered overbroad by the inclusion of a legislative veto. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">The real issue facing this court in this case, and in all cases involving statutes in which the legislative veto has not been exercised, is whether the delegation of authority is accompanied by sufficient standards to permit the executive to constitutionally exercise the power given.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">The legislative history of the Reorganization Act demonstrates than Congress was mindful of the possible constitutional problems with the one-house veto and included standards in the statute to increase Congressional control over the reorganization process and to increase the likelihood that the statute would be found constitutional.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>The standards provided are of varying kinds and, taken as a whole, guide, direct and circumscribe the President in reorganizing the executive branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">First, Congress directed that the reorganization plans should be designed to further one or more of the following purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">Promote better execution of the laws;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ava-dedup-0\">Promote more effective management of the executive branch and its agencies;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">Promote the effective administration of the public business;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">Reduce expenditures;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-10\">Promote economy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-11\">Increase efficiency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-12\">Coordinate and consolidate agencies and functions according to major purposes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-13\">Reduce the number of agencies by consolidating those with similar functions and abolish such agencies or functions thereof as may not be necessary to efficient government;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-14\">Eliminate overlapping and duplicating effort.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-15\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 901. These are explicit guides and directives to the President which provide a careful framework for the authority granted. Furthermore, these are not the only standards provided in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-16\">The Act is specific in excluding certain activity of the executive department from its operation. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 902 (excluding the General Accounting Office and the Comptroller General). The President is also prohibited from \u201ccreating a new executive department, abolishing or transferring an executive department of independent regulatory agency, or all the functions thereof, or consolidating two or more executive departments or two or more independent regulatory agencies, or all of the functions thereof.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(a)(1). He is proscribed from extending the life of an agency and from authorizing an agency to exercise a function which is not expressly authorized by law at the time of the plan. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(a)(2)-(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-24\">The statute provides both general and specific directives for the exercise of the reorganization power as well as a number of circumscribing limitations upon the exercise of that power. The transfer of ADEA enforcement functions from the Department of Labor to EEOC is not unconstitutional under these circumstances. We agree with the analysis of the court in <em>E.E.O.C. v. Hernando Bank, Inc., </em>724 F.2d 1188 (5th Cir.1984) in this regard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-25\">The substantive limitations imposed retain for Congress control over the substantive operations of the federal government. The Act does nothing more than delegate to the President the authority to reorganize the complex bureaucratic machinery of the executive branch so as to implement most effectively Congress\u2019 substantive policies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-26\">724 F.2d at 1192.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-27\">It is clear that \u201cCongress is not permitted to abdicate or to transfer to others the essential legislative functions with which it is thus vested.\u201d <em>Schechter Corp. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number><em>v. United States, supra, </em>295 U.S. at 529, 55 S.Ct. at 843 (quoted with approval in <em>National Cable Television Ass\u2019n. v.

S.E.C., </em>329 U.S. 90, 104 [67 S.Ct. 133, 142, 91 L.Ed. 103],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-5\"><em>Lichter v. United States, supra, </em>334 U.S. at 785, 68 S.Ct. at 1316.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">In <em>Lichter </em>the Supreme Court upheld a delegation of authority to renegotiate all contracts and subcontracts made by the War Department, the Navy Department or the Maritime Department. The Secretary of each department was instructed to require the contractor or subcontractor to renegotiate a contract whenever the Secretary determined that \u201cexcessive profits\u201d had been realized or were likely to be realized. The Renegotiation Act did not define the term \u201cexcessive profits\u201d. The Court, however, found that the term itself was sufficiently clear in light of the factual background of the Act. Furthermore, the power authorized under the Act was for a limited period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">The standards provided in the Reorganization Act of 1977 are considerably more detailed than those in the Renegotiation Act found valid in <em>Lichter. </em>The authority to reorganize the executive branch was also conferred for a limited period of time.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">Finally, the extent and the type of authority delegated in the Reorganization Act is an important consideration. The cases discussing the sufficiency of the standards needed to sustain a delegation of power use the phrase \u201cin light of the conditions to which they are to be applied.\u201d <em>Lichter, supra, </em>334 U.S. at 785, 68 S.Ct. at 1316. In 1978 Congress recognized that the government had grown over a number of decades by adding one agency on top of another, often with conflicting or duplicative authority. H.R.Rep. No. 95-105, <em>supra </em>at 4, 1977 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 43-44. Congress also recognized that reorganization could be accomplished more speedily by the President \u201cthan by the enactment of specific legislation.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 901(b). The President was given authority to streamline the executive branch as a manager would streamline a department of a company. He was not given authority to eliminate functions, to alter substantive rights, or to change the way in which statutes could be enforced. The standards provided in the Act are clearly sufficient, in light of the conditions to which they were to be applied and in light of the nature of the authority delegated.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We do not construe the action by the Congress in this case to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>be an evasion of the Constitution by enactment of executive proposals by mere silence, <em>See Chadha, </em>462 U.S. at_n. 22, 103 S.Ct. at 2787 n. 22, nor did the Congressional action in reorganization alter the substantive rights of parties subject to ADEA as was the case in <em>Chadha </em>where the substantive rights of the alien and I.N.S. were affected by one-House action, <em>id. </em>at-, 103 S.Ct. at 2784.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">While the court has discussed the facts relative to the ratification argument set forth by the EEOC, we do not mean to imply that ratification is a proper ground for upholding the Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978. The facts do not support ratification, and we do not adopt EEOC\u2019s argument in this respect. However, the facts are relevant to the broader issue of whether the plan was, in fact, consistent with the standards articulated in the Reorganization Act, and to the lack of constitutional confrontation between the executive and legislative branches, and to the complete legislative history of this particular transfer of authority and have therefore been included.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">For the reasons given above, the order of the district court denying the motion for a preliminary injunction is Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">APPENDIX I</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">REORGANIZATION PLAN NO. 1 OF 1978</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">43 F.R. 19807, 92 Stat. 3781</p>\n<p id=\"AG8\">Prepared by the President and transmitted to the Senate and the House of Representatives in Congress assembled, February 23, 1978, pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 9 of Title 5 of the United States Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-15\">EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY</p>\n<p id=\"b455-16\">Section 1.

This Plan makes the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission the principal Federal agency in fair employment enforcement. Together with actions I shall take by Executive Order, it consolidates Federal equal employment opportunity activities and lays, for the first time, the foundation of a unified, coherent Federal structure to combat job discrimination in all its forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-16\">In 1940 President Roosevelt issued the first Executive Order forbidding discrimination in employment by the Federal government. Since that time the Congress, the courts and the Executive Branch\u2014 spurred by the courage and sacrifice of many people and organizations \u2014 have taken historic steps to extend equal employment opportunity protection throughout the private as well as public sector. But each new prohibition against discrimination unfortunately has brought with it a further dispersal of Federal equal employment opportunity responsibility. This fragmentation of authority among a number of Federal agencies has meant confusion and ineffective enforcement for employees, regulatory duplication and needless expense for employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-17\">Fair employment is too vital for haphazard enforcement. My Administration will aggressively enforce our civil rights laws. Although discrimination in any area has severe consequences, limiting economic opportunity affects access to education, housing and health care. I, therefore, ask you to join with me to reorganize administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>tion of the civil rights laws and to begin that effort by reorganizing the enforcement of those laws which ensure an equal opportunity to a job.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Eighteen government units now exercise important responsibilities under statutes, Executive Orders and regulations relating to equal employment opportunity:</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [section 2000e <em>et seq. </em>of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare], which bans employment discrimination based on race, national origin, sex or religion. The EEOC acts on individual complaints and also initiates private sector cases involving a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The Department of Labor and 11 other agencies enforce Executive Order 11246 [set out as a note under section 2000e of Title 42]. This prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of race, national origin, sex, or religion and requires affirmative action by government contractors. While the Department now coordinates enforcement of this \u201ccontract compliance\u201d program, it is actually administered by eleven other departments and agencies. The Department also administers those statutes requiring contractors to take affirmative action to employ handicapped people, disabled veterans and Vietnam veterans.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">In addition, the Labor Department enforces the Equal Pay Act of 1963 [section 206(d) of Title 29, Labor], which prohibits employers from paying unequal wages based on sex, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 [section 621 <em>et seq. </em>of Title 29], which forbids age discrimination against persons between the ages of 40 and 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">The Department of Justice litigates Title VII cases involving public sector employers \u2014 State and local governments. The Department also represents the Federal government in lawsuits against Federal contractors and grant recipients who are in violation of Federal nondiscrimination prohibitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">The Civil Service Commission (CSC) enforces Title VII and all other nondiscrimination and affirmative action requirements for Federal employment. The CSC rules on complaints filed by individuals and monitors affirmative action plans submitted annually by other Federal agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">The Equal Employment Opportunity Coordinating Council includes representatives from EEOC, Labor, Justice, CSC and the Civil Rights Commission. It is charged with coordinating the Federal equal employment opportunity enforcement effort and with eliminating overlap and inconsistent standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">In addition to these major government units, other agencies enforce various equal employment opportunity requirements which apply to specific grant programs. The Department of Treasury, for example, administers the anti-discrimination prohibitions applicable to recipients of revenue sharing funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-12\">These programs have had only limited success. Some of the past deficiencies include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-13\">\u2014inconsistent standards of compliance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-14\">\u2014duplicative, inconsistent paperwork requirements and investigative efforts;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-15\">\u2014conflicts within agencies between their program responsibilities and their responsibility to enforce the civil rights laws;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-16\">\u2014confusion on the part of workers about how and where to seek redress;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-17\">\u2014lack of accountability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-18\">I am proposing today a series of steps to bring coherence to the equal employment enforcement effort. These steps, to be accomplished by the Reorganization Plan and Executive Orders, constitute an important step toward consolidation of equal employment opportunity enforcement. They will be implemented over the next two years, so that the agencies involved may continue their internal reform.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-19\">Its experience and broad scope make the EEOC suitable for the role of principal Federal agency in fair employment enforce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>ment. Located in the Executive Branch and responsible to the President, the EEOC has developed considerable expertise in the field of employment discrimination since Congress created it by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [section 2000e-4 of Title 42], The Commission has played a pioneer role in defining both employment discrimination and its appropriate remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">While it has had management problems in past administrations, the EEOC\u2019s new leadership is making substantial progress in correcting them. In the last seven months the Commission has redesigned its internal structures and adopted proven management techniques. Early experience with these procedures indicates a high degree of success in reducing and expediting new cases. At my direction, the Office of Management and Budget is actively assisting the EEOC to ensure that these reforms continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The Reorganization Plan I am submitting will accomplish the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">On July 1, 1978, abolish the Equal Employment Opportunity Coordinating Council (42 U.S.C. 2000e-14) and transfer its duties to the EEOC (no positions or funds shifted).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">On October 1, 1978, shift enforcement of equal employment opportunity for Federal employees from the CSC to the EEOC (100 positions and $6.5 million shifted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">On July 1, 1979, shift responsibility for enforcing both the Equal Pay Act and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act from the Labor Department to the EEOC (198 positions and $5.3 million shifted for Equal Pay; 119 positions and $3.5 million for Age Discrimination).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">Clarify the Attorney General\u2019s authority to initiate \u201cpattern or practice\u201d suits under Title VII in the public sector.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">In addition, I will issue an Executive Order on October 1, 1978, to consolidate the contract compliance program \u2014 now the responsibility of Labor and eleven \u201ccompliance agencies\u201d \u2014 into the Labor' Department (1,517 positions and $33.1 million shifted).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-13\">These proposed transfers and consolidations reduce from fifteen to three the number of Federal agencies having important equal employment opportunity responsibilities under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Federal contract compliance provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-14\">Each element of my Plan is important to the success of the entire proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-15\">By abolishing the Equal Employment Opportunity Coordinating Council and transferring its responsibilities to the EEOC, this plan places the Commission at the center of equal employment opportunity enforcement. With these new responsibilities, the EEOC can give coherence and direction to the government\u2019s efforts by developing strong uniform enforcement standards to apply throughout the government: standardized data collection procedures, joint training programs, programs to ensure the sharing of enforcement related data among agencies, and methods and priorities for complaint and compliance reviews. Such direction has been absent in the Equal Employment Opportunity Coordinating Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-16\">Transfer of the Civil Service Commission\u2019s equal employment opportunity responsibilities to EEOC is needed to ensure that: (1) Federal employees have the same rights and remedies as those in the private sector and in State and local government; (2) Federal agencies meet the same standards as are required of other employers\u2019 and (3) potential conflicts between an agency\u2019s equal employment opportunity and personnel management functions are minimized. The Federal government must not fall below the standard of performance it expects of private employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-17\">It should be stressed, however, that affected agencies will be consulted before EEOC takes any action. When the Plan has been approved, I intend to issue an Executive Order which will provide for consultation, as well as a procedure for reviewing major disputed issues within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Executive Office of the President. The Attorney General's responsibility to advise the Executive Branch on legal issues will also be preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">The Civil Service Commission has in the past been lethargic in enforcing fair employment requirements within the Federal government. While the Chairman and other Commissioners I have appointed have already demonstrated their personal commitment to expanding equal employment opportunity, responsibility for ensuring fair employment for Federal employees should rest ultimately with the EEOC.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">We must ensure that the transfer in no way undermines the important objectives of the comprehensive civil service reorganization which will be submitted to Congress in the near future. When the two plans take effect, I will direct the EEOC and the CSC to coordinate their procedures to prevent any duplication and overlap.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The Equal Pay Act now administered by the Labor Department, prohibits employers from paying unequal wages based on sex. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which is enforced by EEOC, contains a broader ban on sex discrimination. The transfer of Equal Pay responsibility from the Labor Department to the EEOC will minimize overlap and centralize enforcement of statutory prohibitions against sex discrimination in employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">The transfer will strengthen efforts to combat sex discrimination. Such efforts would be enhanced still further by passage of the legislation pending before you, which I support, that would prohibit employers from excluding women disabled by pregnancy from participating in disability programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">There is now virtually complete overlap in the employers, labor organizations, and employment agencies covered by Title VII and by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. This overlap is burdensome to employers and confusing to victims of discrimination. The proposed transfer of the age discrimination program from the Labor Department to the EEOC will eliminate the duplication.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">The Plan I am proposing will not affect the Attorney General\u2019s responsibility to enforce Title VII against State or local governments or to represent the Federal government in suits against Federal contractors and grant recipients. In 1972, the Congress determined that the Attorney General should be involved in suits against State and local governments. This proposal reinforces that judgment and clarifies the Attorney. General\u2019s authority to initiate litigation against State or local governments engaged in a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of discrimination. This in no way diminishes the EEOC\u2019s existing authority to investigate complaints filed against State or local governments and, where appropriate, to refer them to the Attorney General. The Justice Department and the EEOC will cooperate so that the Department sues on valid referrals, as well as on its own \u201cpattern or practice\u201d cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">A critical element of my proposals will be accomplished by Executive Order rather than by the Reorganization Plan. This involves consolidation in the Labor Department of the responsibility to ensure that Federal contractors comply with Executive Order 11246. Consolidation will achieve the following: promote consistent standards, procedures, and reporting requirements; remove contractors from the jurisdiction of multiple agencies; prevent an agency\u2019s equal employment objectives from being outweighed by its procurement and construction objectives; and produce more effective law enforcement through unification of planning training and sanctions. By 1981, after I have had an opportunity to review the manner in which both the EEOC and the Labor Department are exercising their new responsibilities, I will determine whether further action is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">Finally, the responsibility for enforcing grant-related equal employment provisions will remain with the agencies administering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>the grant programs. With the EEOC acting as coordinator of Federal equal employment programs, we will be able to bring overlap and duplication to a minimum. We will be able, for example, to see that a university\u2019s employment practices are not subject to duplicative investigations under both Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 [section 1681 <em>et seq. </em>of Title 20, Education] and the contract compliance program. Because of the similarities between the Executive Order program and those statutes requiring Federal contractors to take affirmative action to employ handicapped individuals and disabled and Vietnam veterans, I have determined that enforcement of these statutes should remain in the Labor Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Each of the changes set forth in the Reorganization Plan accompanying this message is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in Section 901(a) of Title 5 of the United States Code. I have taken care to determine that all functions abolished by the plan are done only under the statutory authority provided by Section 903(b) of Title 5 of the United States Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">I do not anticipate that the reorganization contained in this Plan will result in any significant change in expenditures. They will result in a more efficient and manageable enforcement program.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">The Plan I am submitting is moderate and measured. It gives the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission \u2014 an agency dedicated solely to this purpose \u2014 the primary Federal responsibility in the areas of job discrimination, but it is designed to give this agency sufficient time to absorb its new responsibilities. This reorganization will produce consistent agency standards as well as increased accountability. Combined with the intense commitment of those charged with these responsibilities, it will become possible for us to accelerate this Nation\u2019s progress in ensuring equal job opportunities for all our people.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">JIMMY CARTER</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">THE WHITE HOUSE,</p>\n<p id=\"akv-dedup-0\">February 23, 1978.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b447-9\">.

The Reorganization Act of 1977 was a compromise between bills sponsored by the Administration (S. 626, H.R. 3047 and H.R. 3442) and a bill drafted by Representative Jack Brooks (H.R. 3131). The former bills were drawn along the lines of past reorganization bills and contained a one-House veto and broad delegations of power. The bill proposed by Representative Brooks made enactment of a Reorganization Plan contingent upon approval by vote of both houses and signature of the President. H.R. 3131 was rejected because Congress wanted to expedite the reorganization. The bills sponsored by the Administration were rejected as an overbroad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>delegation. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep.

Under the authority, the President would submit reorganization plans to the Congress which would become effective after 60 days unless either House of Congress has adopted a resolution disapproving such plan. Procedures assuring a vote on each plan if any Member of Congress asks for it, are incorporated in the bill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-22\">In the course of the hearings on this legislation, the constitutionality of the key provision of this bill was questioned. It was contended that the bill makes too broad a delegation of legislative authority to the President by permitting plans submitted by the President to become law without the approval of Congress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-29\">The question remains unresolved, but it is the position of the committee that the risk of an unfavorable ruling by the courts, while still remaining, may have been lessened by the adoption of the new voting procedure and <em>the added limitations on the use of the reorganization authority.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-30\">It is the intention of the committee to examine carefully each reorganization plan submitted under this authority and to assure the participation of Congress in the reorganization process to the fullest extent possible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7-\">H.R.Rep.

Davis opines that the <em>Panama </em>decision would not be followed today and is explainable only by two extraneous factors: 1) broad delegation in other parts of the Act and 2) criminal penalties for violation code provisions the content of which were not readily ascertainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">The <em>Schechter </em>case involved a broad delegation of authority to approve \"codes of fair competition\u201d to govern all business subject to federal authority. \"In view of the scope of that broad declaration, and of the nature of the few restrictions that are imposed, the discretion of the President in approving or prescribing codes, and thus enacting laws for the government of trade and industry throughout the country, is virtually unfettered.\" 295 U.S. at 541-42, 55 S.Ct. at 848-49.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b454-13\">.

An amicus argues that the Reorganization Act is an invalid delegation of authority because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>it contains insufficient limitations of \u00a7 905, citing the remarks of Professor Tribe reprinted in the House Report No. 95-105. Professor Tribe expressed some concern that the President could alter substantive rights by inappropriate transfers of functions. Professor Tribe\u2019s full remarks are found at H.R.Rep.

Section 901(a)(1) says that the purpose of the Act is \"to promote the better execution of the laws, the more effective management of the executive branch and of its agencies and functions, and the expeditious administration of the public business.\u201d Subsections (a)(4), (5) and (6) discuss grouping and consolidating similar functions \"according to major purposes\u201d to eliminate duplication. The policies outlined in this section are clear. An inappropriate transfer affecting substantive rights would violate the purpose of promoting the better execution of the laws in \u00a7 901(a)(1) and possibly the purpose of consolidating similar functions \"according to major purposes\u201d of subsections (a)(4) and- (5). Inappropriate transfers might also violate the prohibition of \u00a7 903(a)(2) that no enforcement function or statutory program can be eliminated by the plan. If substantive rights were affected by the transfer, the specific transfer of authority might be subject to the charge that it effectively eliminated all or part of an enforcement function.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
