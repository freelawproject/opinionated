(NBS) appeals from those portions of the judgment of the district court (1) holding claim 7 of AM International Inc.\u2019s (A.M.) patent No. 3,272,120 valid and infringed; (2) denying NBS costs and attorneys\u2019 fees; and (3) granting an injunction against further infringement of claim 7 by NBS.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm and remand for a determination of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-13\">I. <em>Factual Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1293-14\">This appeal concerns a single patent, No. 3,272,120, (C20) entitled \u201cAddress Printing Machines with Roller Platens,\u201d issued to AM (as assignee of the inventor, D.W. Johnson) on September 13, 1966 from an application filed October 22, 1964.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The patent was described by the district court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1293-19\">The \u2019120 patent discloses and claims a data recorder using a two platen roller, two stroke (forward-return) method for imprinting forms from embossed printing plates or cards, such as are used in credit transactions in department stores and gas stations and in finance institutions with bank cards. The data recorder disclosed in the \u2019120 patent has a dual platen roller arranged on a double eccentric shaft constituting a platen assembly which allows for selective imprinting of characters from the embossed plates or cards. A first platen roller is lowered and imprints on the form the first portion of characters as it rolls along the embossed plate or card, which is on the bed of the data recorder, in a left-to-right stroke of the platen carriage, which houses the platen assembly and is operated by hand. The first platen roller is then raised and a second platen roller is lowered to imprint the remaining portion of the characters as it rolls along the embossed plate or card in a right-to-left return stroke.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1293-20\">The AM machine was designed to meet a particular demand for an imprinter that could produce imprints on carbon form sets sufficiently clear to be read accurately by machine. The demand in part grew out of the American Bankers\u2019 Association\u2019s decision to adopt \u201cmagnetic ink character rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>ognition symbols\u201d (MICR symbols) for imprinting deposit slips, receipts, and other forms. As stated in the patent application \u201c[although the use of MICR characters has greatly increased the speed and efficiency with which the imprinted forms can be sorted, a considerable amount of difficulty has been encountered in the imprinting of the MICR characters on the forms.\u201d After listing recent improvements in the design of imprinters and form sets, the patent described the principal object of the AM machine: \u201cit is the object of the present invention to further advance current practices of imaging form sets with characters having a high degree of clarity and outline accuracy through the use of small data recorders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\">The \u2019120 patent listed seven claims, the last of which was held to have been infringed. Claim 7 is described in the patent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"alk-dedup-0\">7. A method of making an impression on a form set from an embossed printing device which utilizes a carriage movable in opposite directions between a first and second position and having a pair of roller platens rotatably supported thereon, rolling one of the platens in printing relation to one portion of the printing device with the other platen in non-printing relation to another portion of the printing device when the carriage is moved in one direction, and rolling the other platen in printing relation to the other portion of the printing device with said one platen in non-printing relation to said one portion when the carriage is moved in the opposite direction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1294-5\">Accompanying and illustrating the claims in the patent were drawings showing \u201ca preferred embodiment of the present invention\u201d as a \u201csmall data recorder\u201d with its carriage and platform holding a merchant plate and customer card.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-6\">II. <em>Proceedings Below</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ahic\">On April 27, 1978 AM initiated the proceedings leading to this litigation when it applied for reissue of the \u2019120 patent pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 251. The purpose of the reissue proceeding is to correct inadvertent errors in the original patent which may make it \u201cwholly or partly inoperative or invalid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>AM sought to amend its patent by adding additional references to \u201cprior art.\u201d Prior art references are important because the statutory presumption of the patent\u2019s validity, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7. 282, \u201cis \u2018largely, if not wholly, dissipated\u2019 when pertinent prior art is not considered by the Patent Office.\u201d <em>Medical Laboratory Automation v. Labcon, Inc., </em>670 F.2d 671, 674 (7th Cir.1981) (quoting <em>Chicago Rawhide Mfg. Co. v. Crane Packing Co., </em>523 F.2d 452, 458 (7th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 1091, 96 S.Ct. 887, 47 L.Ed.2d 103 (1976)). Failure of the examiner to consider pertinent prior art, then, leaves the patent open to attack on numerous grounds such as \u201cobviousness\u201d (35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103), anticipation (35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a)), and fraud on the Patent Office (37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.56).</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-8\">On November 17, 1980, NBS filed a petition and protest in the reissue proceeding, asking the Patent Office to withdraw AM\u2019s application and to strike it from the Patent Office files for violation of the duty of disclosure required under 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.56. The patent examiner\u2019s initial opinion on February 12, 1981 noted that a prior art patent No. 3,340,800 (\u2019800), also assigned to AM, \u201cwould clearly have been material and would have been a most pertinent reference.\u201d The examiner then considered the merits of the reissue application and rejected all claims of the \u2019120 patent. The examiner specifically rejected Claim 7 on two grounds: (1) \u201cunder 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a) as fully anticipated by Cox [patent No. 539,-356]\u201d; and (2) \u201cas being \u2018on sale\u2019 [under \u00a7 102(b) ] more than a year before the [October 22, 1964] filing date\u201d of the original \u2019120 patent application. AM appealed to the Patent Office Board of Appeals. At AM\u2019s request the appeal was suspended pending the outcome of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-9\">While the reissue proceedings were still pending, appellant NBS filed two complaints in federal district court. In pertinent part NBS sought a declaratory judgment \u201cfor the purpose of resolving an actu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>al controversy between the parties with respect to the validity, enforceability and infringement by plaintiffs of each of AM\u2019s United States Patents 3,138,091; 3,272,120; 3,340,800; 3,763,777.\u201d NBS also sought treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 284 and 285 respectively. AM counterclaimed against NBS, alleging the validity and infringement of each of its four patents and similarly requesting treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. The trial lasted eleven days, from April 13 to April 9R qqo \u2019 '</p>\n<p id=\"aaf-dedup-0\">On August 26, 1982, the district court issued a 49-page memorandum opinion, with a careful analysis of the expert testimony, exhibits and applicable law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The \u201con \u2019 <em>^ </em>nZi\u201c\u2019.,1that1ClT 7 \u00b0! AM s 120 patent was valid and infringed by plaintiffs devices. The court enjoined NBS from further manufacture and sale of the infringing imprinters and ordered an accounting \u201cas to the amount of damages suffered by AM by reason of NBS' infringement of Claim 7.\u201d Based on this accounting, the court ordered that \u201cAM shall recover from Plaintiffs the amount of these damages, not less than a reasonable royalty \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AzoM\">, \u201e Observing that this is a close case, , <em>0 </em>,, . . . . that at any time the validity and infringe- , . ,, , . , ment of the three patents was open to 1 . , , ^x ,, 1 . , , , , honest doubt, that defendants have not . x... ... . ..... proven that plaintiffs acted m a bad faith , ,. , , ,, , , . ... \u201e , belief that the patents -were invalid, and . f . , . \u2019 . . that defendants have not carried their ... . .... .... , \u201e burden of proof as to willful infringement, ,. , 7 . , , , , .. the court denied both parties requests for treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"AH9H\">.. . ,. . , Finally, m the same order, the court cer-i... . <em>.f </em>. . , . . \u2019 . , , tified its judgment for immediate appeal . <em>1 </em>\u00ae pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b).

J</p>\n<p id=\"acb-dedup-2\">III. <em>Contentions on Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"aqx-dedup-2\">Appellant NBS raises numerous issues on appeal which are summarized in the following five contentions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANn3\">1. The Patent Offices expertise in resolving issues and the attendant presumption of its correct exercise are controlling, and alternatively AM is \u201ccollaterally estopped to assert that claim 7 is valid, having unsuccessfully contested that issue in a fair proceeding before the [Patent Office];\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Acvz\">2.

Crane Packing Co., </em>523 F.2d 452, 457-58 (7th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 1091, 96 S.Ct. 887, 47 L.Ed.2d 103 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>In <em>Johnson &amp; Johnson v. Wallace A. Erickson &amp; Co., </em>627 F.2d 57 (7th Cir.1980), we considered whether a district court could compel a reissue proceeding as a condition precedent to adjudication in the court. In holding that the district court lacked the power to compel a prior resort to the Patent Office, we first noted that \u201cthe only authority competent to set a patent aside, or to annul it, or to correct it for any reason whatever, is vested in the Courts of the United States, and not in the department which issued the patent,\u201d quoting from <em>McCormick Harvesting Co. v. Aultman, </em>169 U.S. 606, 609, 18 S.Ct. 443, 444, 42 L.Ed. 875 (1898) <em>Id. </em>at 59. We concluded that a prior reissue proceeding would have <em>no </em>effect on subsequent litigation over the validity of a patent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-4\">The doctrine of primary jurisdiction does not apply. The validity of patents is \u201cwithin the conventional experience of judges____\u201d The question of the validity of any particular patent is a private issue between the patentee and alleged infring-ers, and not a public issue of industry-wide or regulatory concern. Finally, the factual adjudications of the Patent Office, unlike most administrative factual adjudications, ... are not conclusive if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. The ultimate question of patent validity is one of law and not subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review____ <em>Thus, the compelled reissue proceedings would have no effect whatever on the judicial process.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1296-8\">627 F.2d at 61-62 (citations omitted, emphasis added); see also <em>Application of Hitch-ings, </em>342 F.2d 80, 82, 52 CCPA 1141 (1965) (even within the Patent Office \u201cprinciple of res judicata should not apply where the initial decision is no more than an unap-pealed final rejection of an examiner.\u201d); cf. <em>Mooney v. Brunswick Corp., </em>663 F.2d 724, 731 (7th Cir.1981) (irregularities in reissue proceeding diminished presumption of validity).</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-9\">In the subsequent case of <em>Singer Co. v. P.R. Mallory &amp; Co., Inc., </em>671 F.2d 232 (7th Cir.1982), reversing an order of the district court enjoining a patentee from proceeding with its patent reissue application, we recognized that the statutory procedure under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 251 would \u201cpermit a review of prior art by an agency with particular expertise in the area, and ... provide a guide to the patentee as to the advisability of continuing expensive infringement litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236. On the other hand, we also noted that a reissue of the patent would not affect the substantive rights in the litigation of the party attacking the validity of the patent. \u201cThe district court will still rule on ... [the] prior art claims, thus providing a remedy at law for any \u2018incorrect\u2019 findings by the Patent Office.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-11\">The courts generally defer to the technical expertise possessed by the Patent Office in originally issuing a patent. This expertise and corresponding judicial deference are the practical underpinnings of the statutory presumption of validity surrounding patents. See <em>Chicago Rawhide Mfg. Co., </em>523 F.2d at 458; <em>Parker v. Motorola, Inc., </em>524 F.2d 518, 521 (5th Cir.1975). But less deference is appropriate for a patent office finding of invalidity in a reissue proceeding because, as we pointed out in <em>Johnson &amp; Johnson, </em>patent validity is a question of law reserved exclusively to the federal courts in de novo proceedings. Here, special deference to the Patent Office decision is particularly, inappropriate because the patent had been in existence for over 11 years and because the district court, having the benefit of extensive proof by expert testimony and demonstrative evidence, issued a detailed, well-reasoned opinion. The decision of the Patent Office in the reissue proceeding is neither cloaked in a \u201cpresumption of correctness\u201d independent of the patent nor entitled to special deference in a separate federal court adjudication of patent validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-12\">V. <em>Validity of Claim 7</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1296-13\">It is well established that \u201cthe ultimate question of patent validity is one of law____\u201d <em>Graham v. John Deere Co., </em>383 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>U.S. 1, 17, 86 S.Ct. 684, 694, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966); <em>Medical Laboratory Automation v. Labcon, Inc., </em>670 F.2d at 672. The Supreme Court has made it equally clear, however, that the three conditions of patent validity \u2014 novelty, utility (defined in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101 and 102), and \u201cnonobviousness\u201d (35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103) \u2014 are legal issues which lend themselves to critical factual inquiries. See <em>Graham, </em>383 U.S. at 17, 86 S.Ct. at 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">In <em>Republic Industries Inc. v. Schlage Lock Co., </em>592 F.2d 963, 972-73 (7th Cir.1979), and <em>Dual Mfg. &amp; Engineering, Inc. v. Burris Industries Inc., </em>619 F.2d 660, 665 (7th Cir. en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 870, 101 S.Ct. 208, 66 L.Ed.2d 90 (1980), we summarized the extent of the presumption of validity of a patent, noting that the presumption is not conclusive, but merely places the burden of proof on the party attacking the validity of the patent. We noted further that the presumption does not exist against evidence of prior art not before the Patent Office, and that even one prior art reference not considered by the Patent Office can suffice to overthrow the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-6\">Even though the presumption of validity is weakened by the failure of the Patent Office to consider all pertinent art before issuing the patent, the \u201cdegree by which it is weakened depends on a balancing of the pertinence of the newly cited art with the pertinence of the art considered by the Patent Office.\u201d <em>Tee-Pak, Inc. v. St. Regis Paper Company, </em>491 F.2d 1193, 1196 (6th Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-7\">We now consider the various alleged claims of invalidity in light of these principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-8\">A. <em>Obviousness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1297-9\">NBS contends that claim 7 of the \u2019120 patent was \u201cobvious\u201d in light of prior art patents \u2019800 and \u2019725. The obviousness bar appears in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-10\">A patent may not be obtained ... if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1297-13\">The Supreme Court has set out standards for applying section 103 in <em>Graham v. John Deere Co., </em>383 U.S. at 17, 86 S.Ct. at 694:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-14\">Under \u00a7 103, the scope and content of the prior art are to be determined; differences between the prior art and the claims at issue are to be ascertained; and the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art resolved. Against this background, the obviousness or nonobviousness of the subject matter is determined.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1297-15\">This court has consistently followed these guidelines. See, <em>e.g., Dickey-John Corp. v. International Tapetronics Corp., </em>710 F.2d 329 (7th Cir.1983); <em>Novo Industri A/S v. Travenol Laboratories, Inc., </em>677 F.2d 1202, 1206 (7th Cir.1982); <em>Dual Mfg. &amp; Engineering v. Burris Industries, </em>619 F.2d 660, 666 (7th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-16\">The district court similarly followed the <em>Graham </em>guidelines. First, the court determined the scope and content of the prior art patents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-17\">The patents referred to by [NBS\u2019s expert] Van DerLinden include Nos. 1,280,-192; 1,941,667; 2,775,936; 3,018,725; 3,113,615; 3,340,800. All but one of these patents discloses either a single platen roller operating in a single stroke method, tandum [sic] platen rollers operating in a single stroke method, or two platen rollers operating in a single stroke, idling return method. The \u2019800 patent discloses a two platen roller, multiple stroke imprinter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1297-19\">Second, the court noted the differences between the prior art and the claims at issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-20\">While certain elements of Claim 7 of the \u2019120 patent were disclosed in the pri- or art, the prior art combines none of these elements to produce the result which makes the \u2019120 patent distinctive: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>selective imprinting by two platen rollers on opposite strokes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">546 F.Supp. at 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-5\">Finally, although the district court made no specific finding of the contemporaneous level of skill in the pertinent art, it is clear from the several references to that guideline in the court\u2019s opinion that it resolved the level of ordinary skill in the art based on the expert testimony and the prior art itself. Moreover, at least one expert testified that \u201c[m]y designers would have had a very bad time\u201d simply combining the prior art to produce the disputed invention. We are satisfied, therefore, that the district court followed the approved procedure in its analysis of the obviousness issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-6\">The obviousness issue presents a very close question in this case. Despite its conclusion that \u201cClaim 7 of the \u2019120 patent would not have been obvious to one reasonably skilled in the art at the time the invention was made,\u201d the district court observed that the \u2019800 patent is the \u201cclosest\u201d prior art. It discloses a two roller machine for selectively imprinting in four strokes: the first roller on the first stroke; .an idling return stroke; then the second roller on the third stroke; and an idling return fourth stroke. It is distinguished from the \u2019120 patent principally because it does not imprint in both directions, requiring only two strokes. In light of the \u2019800 patent, it would seem a logical improvement, if not an obvious one, to have designed a machine to imprint on opposite strokes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1298-11\">We are persuaded, however, that the district court reached the right conclusion for two reasons. First, we are aware that a finding of obviousness might be the product of impermissible hindsight, reached without a precise appreciation of the contemporaneous level of skill in the art. See <em>Walt Disney Productions v. Fred A. Niles Communications Center, Inc., </em>369 F.2d 230, 234 (7th Cir.1966). Second, as Justice Stevens concluded in a similar case while a member of this court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-12\">[A]s we read the transcript of the testimony in this case, we are impressed with the importance of having live witnesses, subject to cross-examination, explain the operation of physical exhibits in a way which enables a district judge to understand what is before him and to interrupt with proper questions when he does not understand____ The trial judge really is in a better position to evaluate the obviousness issue than we are____ In this court it is appellant\u2019s burden to persuade us that an intelligent district judge, who has demonstrated a thorough understanding of the relevant art, committed an error requiring reversal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1298-16\"><em>Chicago Rawhide Mfg. Co. v. Crane Packing Co., </em>523 F.2d at 460. In this case the district court\u2019s opportunity to base its conclusions on live testimony is critically important. In its discussion of the obviousness issue, the district court made several important credibility assessments, specifically crediting the testimony of AM\u2019s expert and rejecting that of NBS\u2019s expert.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>Because we are unable to make these credibility assessments, we agree that \u201c[t]he trial judge really is in a better position to evaluate the obviousness issue than we are,\u201d notwithstanding that the issue is a legal question freely reviewable by this court. Here, the district court credited \u201cdefendants\u2019 expert testimony\u201d and rejected \u201cplaintiffs\u2019 expert testimony. Based on the prior art and the expert testimony,\u201d the court found \u201cClaim 7 of the \u2019120 patent would not have been obvious to one reasonably skilled in the art at the time the invention was made.\u201d 546 F.Supp. at 352-53. There is substantial evidence to support the court\u2019s findings of fact, and NBS has not convinced us that the trial judge made an error of law in holding claim 7 \u201cnonobvious\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-5\">B. <em>Anticipation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1299-6\">As the district court observed, \u201c[ajnticipation is a strictly technical defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 350 (citing <em>Illinois Tool Works, Inc. v. Sweetheart Plastics, Inc., </em>436 F.2d 1180, 1182-83 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>403 U.S. 942, 91 S.Ct. 2270, 29 L.Ed.2d 722 (1971)). The defense of anticipation derives from the requirements for novelty found in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a):</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-7\">A person shall be entitled to a patent unless\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1299-8\">(a) the invention was known or used by others in this country, or patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country, before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1299-10\">In <em>Saunders v. Air-Flo Co., </em>646 F.2d 1201, 1203 (7th Cir.1981), this court described the strict standards for anticipation under section 102(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1299-11\">\u201cA previous patent ... anticipates a purported invention only where, except for insubstantial differences, it contains all of the same elements operating in the same fashion to perform an identical function.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1299-16\">(quoting <em>Popeil Bros., Inc. v. Schick Electric, Inc., </em>494 F.2d 162, 164 (7th Cir.1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-17\">NBS contends, and the Patent Office concluded, that the Cox Patent No. 539,356 \u201cfully anticipated\u201d claim 7 of the \u2019120 patent. The district court found that the Cox patent \u201cdiscloses a printing press and not a table-top imprinter as embodied in Claim 7---- Although the Cox Patent 539,356 discloses two rollers capable of printing in opposite directions,\u201d the court concluded, \u201c... identification of the device embodied in the Cox patent as a printing press supports this court\u2019s conclusion that there is no identity of function between the two patents, and therefore no anticipation.\u201d 546 F.Supp. at 350. NBS principally contends that the differing embodiment of the Cox invention is \u201cinconsequential\u201d and furthermore is encompassed by Claim 7 which \u201cdoes not exclude the practice of its \u2018method\u2019 with a \u2018printing press\u2019 nor limit such practice to a \u2018table-top imprinter\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-20\">We think appellant erroneously minimizes the distinction drawn by the district court between the Cox printing press and the table-top imprinter. It is clear from the testimony of both parties\u2019 experts that the Cox device was intended for <em>printing </em>an ink impression on a single sheet of paper rather than <em>imprinting </em>from embossed plates to a carbon form set. The same testimony discloses that the rotation of the rollers on the Cox device differed from those in the imprinter and that the \u201cbed\u201d of the printing press moved during the printing process in contrast to the stationary bed of the imprinter.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>court cited this testimony in its opinion and plainly relied on the foregoing differences between the two patents when it distinguished the Cox device as a \u201cprinting press.\u201d Considering this distinction, we can not conclude that the Cox patent \u201ccontains all of the same elements operating in the same fashion to perform an identical function\u201d to the \u2019120 patent. See <em>Saunders v. Air-Flo Co., </em>646 F.2d at 1203. The district court correctly held that \u201cthere is no identity of function between the two patents, and therefore no anticipation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">D. <em>\u201cOn Sale\u201d Bar</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">NBS argues that claim 7 of the '120 patent is invalid because the invention it disclosed was \u201con sale\u201d more than one year before the date of the patent application. Title 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b) provides in part:</p>\n<p id=\"awt-dedup-0\">A person shall be entitled to a patent unless\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-6\">(b) the invention was ... in public use or on sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the United States____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1300-8\">We have held that \u201c \u2018[o]n sale\u2019 does not mean an actual accomplished sale but activity by the inventor or his company in attempting to sell the patented idea.\u201d <em>Amphenol Corp. v. General Time Corp., </em>397 F.2d 431, 433 (7th Cir.1968) (quoted in <em>Red Cross Mfg. v. Toro Sales Co., </em>525 F.2d 1135, 1139 (7th Cir.1975)). In <em>Red Cross </em>we also allocated the proper burden of proof between the parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-16\">When objection is asserted, the burden of establishing that the patented product was \u201con sale\u201d before the critical date is on the objector. This burden must be satisfied by clear and convincing evidence. Once such activity has been successfully -established, invalidity may be avoided by showing that the sales activity was \u201csubstantially for purposes of experiment.\u201d The burden of proving experimental purpose rests with the inventor and must be met with \u201cfull, unequivocal, and convincing\u201d evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1300-17\">525 F.2d at 1139-40 (citations omitted). Finally, the Federal Circuit recently reviewed the proper test for determining whether an activity was experimental. See <em>TP Laboratories v. Professional Positioners, Inc., </em>724 F.2d 965 (Fed.Cir.1984). The court quoted at length from <em>City of Elizabeth v. American Nicholson Pavement Co., </em>7 Otto 126, 97 U.S. 126, 24 L.Ed. 1000 (1877) where the Supreme Court stated the following general rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-18\">It is not public knowledge of his invention that precludes the inventor from obtaining a patent for it, but a public use or sale of it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1300-19\"><em>Id. </em>at 136. The Supreme Court then set out the following general guidelines for applying the on sale provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-20\">When the subject of invention is a machine, it may be tested and tried in a building, either with or without closed doors. In either case, such use is not a public use, within the meaning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>statute, so long as the inventor is engaged, in good faith, in testing its operation. He may see cause to alter it and improve it or not____ So long as he does not voluntarily allow others to make it and use it, and so long as it is not on sale for general use, he keeps the invention under his own control, and does not lose his title to a patent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1301-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-8\">In this case, the \u2019120 patent application was filed on October 22, 1964. October 22, 1963, therefore, is the critical date before which the invention could not be on sale. The dispute here resolves into a single question: was there clear and convincing evidence of \u201cactivity by the inventor or his company in attempting to sell the patented idea\u201d? While the record on appeal again presents a close question, we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cplaintiffs have not satisfied their burden of proving commercial activity of any kind with the requisite intention to exploit the \u2019120 invention.\u201d 546 F.Supp. at 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-9\">Four essential facts are undisputed: (1) in June of 1962 the American Association of Railroads (AAR) placed an order with AM for certain imprinters, without specifying imprinters embodying the \u2019120 invention; (2) in August of 1963 the \u2019120 invention was still being tested by AM engineers; (3) testing was largely completed when the product was released for factory production on September 28, 1963;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (4) the first actual sale of the machines to customers occurred sometime in late April or early May, 1964. There is also evidence that prior to October 22,1963 AM had tentatively assigned at least a wholesale price to the imprinters. Absent from the record, however, is any evidence that AM disclosed to AAR the \u2019120 invention or an imprinter embodying it. Before October 22 there is no evidence that AM even mentioned the model of imprinters it intended to ship to AAR. In sum, the evidence suggests an unusual circumstance where AM did not offer or attempt to sell its invention prior to October 22, 1963 because it already had an existing general order for imprinters. Evidence of AM\u2019s unilateral decision to fill the order with imprinters embodying the \u2019120 invention is insufficient to establish an attempt to sell without some evidence of relevant communications with the customer. See <em>Red Cross Mfg. Corp. v. Toro Sales Co., </em>525 F.2d 1135, 1140-41 (7th Cir.1975) (device displayed to potential customer); <em>Dart Industries v. E.I. DuPont DeNemours &amp; Co., </em>489 F.2d 1359, 1363 (7th Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>417 U.S. 933, 94 S.Ct. 2645, 41 L.Ed.2d 236 (1974) (device demonstrated to numerous customers); <em>Amphenol Corp. v. General Time Corp., </em>397 F.2d 431, 436 (7th Cir.1968) (device was \u201cplaced \u2018on sale\u2019 by submitting a sample with a quoted price to the customer\u201d). It is well established that \u201cmere existence of a sales contract is insufficient to establish a placing \u2018on sale\u2019.\u201d <em>Hobbs v. A.E.C., </em>451 F.2d 849, 859 (5th Cir.1971); see also <em>Application of Dybel, </em>524 F.2d 1393, 1400 (C.C.P.A.1975) (executory contract for sale insufficient where there was no evidence that purchaser knew how invention would perform).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1301-12\">VI. <em>Infringement </em>\u2014 Doctrine <em>of Equivalents</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1301-13\">The district court found that \u201cthe NBS accused imprinters do not \u2018fall clearly with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>in the claim,\u2019 and there is no literal infringement\u201d of the \u2019120 patent. The court then applied the doctrine of equivalents and held that \u201cthe NBS imprinters are \u2018the structural equivalent of the device described in\u2019 Claim 7 of the \u2019120 patent, and \u2018perform ... substantially the same function, in substantially the same way, to achieve the same results, even though ... [they] differ ... in form or shape.\u2019 \u201d Based on this finding, the district court found that the NBS imprinters infringed the \u2019120 patent. 546 F.Supp. at 349. NBS attacks this finding as \u201crooted in a misconception of law\u201d which led the district court to erroneously confine its inquiry to the language of claim 7. We disagree with appellants\u2019 characterization of the record and find no \u201cmisconception of law\u201d on the part of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">The Supreme Court described the theory of the doctrine of equivalents in <em>Machine Co. v. Murphy, </em>7 Otto 120, 97 U.S. 120, 125, 24 L.Ed. 935 (1878): \u201cif two devices do the same work in substantially the same way, and accomplish substantially the same result, they are the same, even though they differ in name, form, or shape.\u201d (quoted and approved in <em>Graver Mfg. Co. v. Linde Co., </em>339 U.S. 605, 608, 70 S.Ct. 854, 856, 94 L.Ed. 1097 (1950)). In <em>Graver Mfg. Co. v. Linde Co. </em>the Court also made it clear that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-5\">A finding of equivalence is a determination of fact. Proof can be made in any form: through testimony of experts or others versed in the technology; by documents, including texts and treatises; and, of course, by the disclosures of the prior art. Like any other issue of fact, final determination requires a balancing of credibility, persuasiveness and weight of evidence. It is to be decided by the trial court and that court\u2019s decision, under general principles of appellate review, should not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1302-8\">339 U.S. at 609-10, 70 S.Ct. at 857. Finally the Court listed several factors that could influence a determination of equivalence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-l\">Consideration must be given to the purpose for which an ingredient is used in a patent, the qualities it has when combined with the other ingredients, and the function which it is intended to perform. An important factor is whether persons reasonably skilled in the art would have known of the interchangeability of an ingredient not contained in the patent with one that was.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1302-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 609, 70 S.Ct. at 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-10\">The district court correctly followed the foregoing guidelines in applying the doctrine of equivalents. The court did limit its inquiry with respect to determining literal infringement, but its finding of equivalence is properly based on expert testimony regarding the interchangeability of the \u201cprinting device\u201d disclosed in claim 7 and the two embossed plates used in the NBS imprinters. The NBS imprinters print from one plate on the first stroke and a second plate on the return stroke. NBS argues that claim 7 is limited to imprinting \u201cfrom different portions of the same embossed printing device\u201d on opposite strokes. The court, however, specifically credited the testimony of AM\u2019s expert that \u201cat the time the \u2019120 invention was developed, up to the present, the imprinting art has used printing device to mean a credit card and station plate either separately or in combination.\u201d Thus, it is clear that claim 7 encompasses the variation practiced by NBS.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The district court, then, correctly held that, despite minor variations, the NBS imprinters performed the same function and achieved the same results as the invention disclosed in claim 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>VII. <em>Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Costs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1303-4\">The district court denied the NBS request for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs attributable to the two patents found invalid. The court held that, \u201cdespite the weight of the prior art, the issues of patent validity and infringement are sufficiently debatable to counsel against an award of treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees to plaintiffs under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 285.\u201d 546 F.Supp. at 364. The court repeatedly stressed the \u201ccloseness\u201d of the case, noting \u201cthat at any time the validity and infringement of the three patents was \u2018open to honest doubt.\u2019 \u201d NBS attacks this conclusion and argues principally that it is entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees because AM committed fraud on the Patent Office by violating its duty under 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.56 to disclose material prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-5\">Under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285 the district court \u201cin exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.\u201d We have consistently held that a refusal to award costs and fees under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285 will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. See, <em>e.g., Faulkner v. Baldwin Piano &amp; Organ Co., </em>561 F.2d 677, 685 (7th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 905, 98 S.Ct. 1450, 55 L.Ed.2d 495 (1978); <em>H.K. Porter Co. v. Black &amp; Decker Mfg. Co., </em>518 F.2d 1177, 1178-79 (7th Cir.1975). Further, we have restricted awards under section 285 to \u201cexceptional patent cases to prevent gross injustice where fraud and wrongdoing are clearly proved.\u201d <em>Faulkner v. Baldwin Piano &amp; Organ Co., </em>561 F.2d at 685. Finally, we note the well-established rule that \u201c[fjraud must be proved by clear and convincing evidence, and the party asserting it carries a heavy burden.\u201d <em>Kansas Jack, Inc. v. Kuhn, </em>719 F.2d 1144, 1151 (Fed.Cir.1983). To support a finding of fraud, the court \u201cmust determine not only that the undisclosed art or information was material, but that the one charged with nondisclosure knew or should have known of its materiality at the time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1153.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-8\">In its opinion the district court considered in detail each assertion of fraud and found that NBS had failed to satisfy its heavy burden of proving deliberate misrepresentations by \u201cclear, unequivocal and convincing evidence.\u201d 546 F.Supp. at 354-55 (citing <em>United States v. American Bell Tel. Co., </em>167 U.S. 224, 251, 17 S.Ct. 809, 814, 42 L.Ed. 144 (1897); <em>Scott Paper Co. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., </em>432 F.2d 1198, 1204 (7th Cir.1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>401 U.S. 913, 91 S.Ct. 882, 27 L.Ed.2d 812 (1971)). NBS fails to cite any part of the record to contradict this conclusion; particularly absent is evidence that AM knew or should have known of the materiality of the omitted prior art at the time of application. Under similar circumstances we have emphasized that \u201cthe district court was in the best possible position to assess attorneys\u2019 fees ... if it deemed it suitable to do so.\u201d <em>Faulkner v. Baldwin Piano &amp; Organ Co., </em>561 F.2d at 685. Because NBS has not convinced us that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to award fees, we will not disturb its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-9\">VIII. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1303-10\">We conclude that the district court was not bound by the findings of the Patent Office in the reissue proceeding with respect to patent validity and that the court correctly found the facts and properly applied the law in holding that claim 7 of the patent \u2019120 is valid. It is neither obvious under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103, nor anticipated under section 102(a), nor was it on sale under section 102(b) for more than a year before the original application. We conclude further that the district court properly applied the doctrine of equivalents in finding that claim 7 was infringed by the NBS imprinter. The-judgment of the district court is, therefore, affirmed and remanded for a determination of damages pursuant to the district court\u2019s order of September, 1982.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1303-11\">Affirmed and Remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1293-16\">.

The generality of the question and his answer, \"No, I do not,\" did little to mitigate the damage of the cross-examination or to enhance his credibility. The district court justifiably relied heavily on the cross-examination testimony.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1301-10\">. The district court also found that \"there is no evidence conclusive on whether the designed device was reduced to practice and was capable of being produced.\" The testimony of AM\u2019s expert, however, establishes that the imprinter had been thoroughly tested and found operable prior to its release for factory production. This is all that is required to show reduction to practice. See <em>CTS Corp. v. Piher Int'l Corp., </em>593 F.2d 777, 779 (7th Cir.1979). Despite this clearly erroneous finding, the record provides sufficient ground for affirming the district court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that the invention was not on sale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1301-15\">. We do not hold that the purchaser must have actual knowledge of the invention for it to be on sale. See <em>Application of Blaisdell, </em>242 F.2d 779, 783, 44 CCPA 846 (1957). We merely state the obvious requirement that to place an invention on sale a manufacturer ordinarily must have some communication with its customers regarding sale of the invention or the device that embodies it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1302-6\">. The Federal Circuit has noted that \"an invention representing only a modest advance over the prior art is given a more restricted (narrower range) application of the doctrine [of equivalents].\u201d <em>Thomas &amp; Betts Corp. v. Litton Systems, Inc., </em>720 F.2d 1572, 1580 (Fed.Cir.1983). Granting that the '120 invention is a \u201cmodest advance over prior art,\u201d the question remains whether the NBS variations are \"the same as, or an equivalent of, the improvement claimed by the patentee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There was substantial evidence to support the district court\u2019s finding that the NBS imprinter was the equivalent of the '120 invention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1303-6\">. In its reply brief NBS argues cursorily that the district court erred in issuing an injunction against further infringement. It now appears this issue is moot in the absence of further proceedings in the Patent Office. The patent was issued on September 13, 1966 for a 17 year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>term pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 154. The district court issued the injunction on September 13, 1982 but simultaneously stayed it pending this appeal. In the meantime, the patent expired on September 13, 1983 and \"the right to make, the right to sell, and the right to use\u201d the patented invention became \"public property.\u201d <em>Brulotte v.
