Any untimely appeal will be summarily dismissed by the Board for lack of jurisdiction.\u201d). However, we need not decide whether or not the 30-day limit is jurisdictional. Even if equitable tolling is available under the statute, the only ground that Townsend asserts as justification for his untimely notice of appeal is that the AU\u2019s order did not notify him of his appellate rights or the time limits relevant thereto. The regulations under the statute do not require the AU to notify a claimant of his appeal rights. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.477. Townsend was represented by counsel and could have easily determined the time for filing appeal, which is clearly stated on the face of the statute and regulations. Therefore, Townsend\u2019s failure to timely file his appeal was not on these facts justified by excusable neglect that might lead to an equitable tolling of the 30-day limit, even if such tolling is available under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">Accordingly, the Board\u2019s dismissal of Townsend\u2019s untimely appeal is</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b944-15\">.
