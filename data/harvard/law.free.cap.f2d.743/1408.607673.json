These claims arose from the airline\u2019s insistence that Hingson sit in a bulkhead seat, i.e., the front row of the passenger section of an aircraft. We affirm the entry of directed verdicts against Hingson. The district court erred, however, in the challenged evidentiary rulings. Because of this error, we reverse and remand this case for a new trial on Hingson\u2019s claims under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1374(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1475-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1475-11\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b1475-12\">Michael Hingson is blind and travels with a guide dog. On September 18, 1980, a PSA employee told Hingson he could not board PSA\u2019s 9:15 a.m. flight from Los An-geles to San Francisco because PSA policy required blind passengers to occupy bulkhead seats and these seats were full. Hingson then purchased a ticket for and boarded PSA\u2019s 10:15 a.m. flight. Crew members asked him to sit in a bulkhead seat. Hingson insisted that PSA policy did not require him to sit in the front row. The pilot, Captain Claessens, told Hingson to take a bulkhead seat or to leave the aircraft. After Hingson refused to leave, PSA\u2019s Customer Service Manager, Darrell Everage, summoned Los Angeles police officers, who escorted Hingson off the aircraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b1475-15\">Hingson thereafter filed suit in federal court alleging that PSA\u2019s actions constituted unlawful discrimination. His complaint listed fourteen causes of action under federal and state statutes and state common law. The case proceeded to trial before a jury on April 26, 1983. After the close of plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the district court granted PSA\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on all of the causes of action except Hingson\u2019s claims under section 404(b) of the Federal Aviation Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1374(b). On May 3, 1983, the jury returned a verdict for PSA. Hingson appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b1475-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1475-17\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1475-18\">We shall first consider whether the trial court erred in its challenged evidentiary rulings and thereafter determine whether the directed verdicts on various causes of action asserted by Hingson under state and federal law were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1475-19\">A. <em>The District Court\u2019s Evidentiary Rulings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1475-20\">In order to analyze the parties\u2019 arguments on the evidentiary issues, it is necessary to examine the features of a cause of action under section 404(b) of the Federal Aviation Act. That section provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1475-21\">No air carrier or foreign air carrier shall ... subject any particular person, port, locality, or description of traffic in air transportation to any unjust discrimination or any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1475-22\">49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1374(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1475-23\">Section 404(b) creates a private cause of action for passengers who suffer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1412\">*1412</page-number>unjust discrimination or unreasonable prejudice. <em>See Archibald v. Pan American World Airways, </em>460 F.2d 14, 16 (9th Cir.1972); <em>Fitzgerald v. Pan American World Airways, </em>229 F.2d 499 (2d Cir.1956). Handicapped passengers who are injured by unreasonable discrimination or prejudice on the part of air carriers may recover compensatory damages under section 404(b). Moreover, punitive damages are recoverable if the defendant has acted \u201cwantonly, or oppressively, or with such malice as implies a spirit of mischief or criminal indifference to civil obligations.\u201d <em>See Archibald, </em>460 F.2d at 16 (quoting <em>Wills v. Trans World Airlines, </em>200 F.Supp. 360, 367-68 (S.D.Cal.1961)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1476-4\">The contested evidentiary rulings arose from Hingson\u2019s efforts to show that PSA violated section 404(b) by insisting that Hingson take a bulkhead seat. The district court excluded the testimony of Norman Waters, PSA\u2019s Director of Planning and Control for Flight Operations, and limited the introduction of PSA policy manuals. Hingson contends these actions constitute reversible error. We agree with respect to the testimony of Waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1476-5\">Waters\u2019 testimony was offered to establish that PSA\u2019s official policy, as stated in the policy manuals and in documents filed with the Federal Aviation Administration, was that blind persons were not restricted to the bulkhead seats. The offer of proof indicates that Waters would have testified that PSA policies were not followed in this case, and that considerations of convenience and safety did not require that Hingson occupy a bulkhead seat. The district court refused to admit Waters\u2019 testimony on the grounds that Waters was not an officer or a director, and therefore his statements could not bind PSA. Hingson then sought to have Waters testify as an expert witness. The court refused on the grounds that Hingson wanted Waters to represent PSA in his testimony. The district court also initially refused to admit the PSA policy manuals, which state that blind passengers should be allowed to sit anywhere except by emergency exits. After Hingson concluded his presentation of evidence, the court admitted the relevant portions of the Station Operations Manual and the Flight Operations Manual.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1476-9\">The district court refused to allow Waters to testify as an expert for Hingson because Waters worked for PSA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Federal Rules of Evidence clearly indicate the desirability of testimony by a qualified expert if it \u201cwill assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 702. If the testimony is otherwise admissible under Rule 702, the fact that Waters worked for PSA does not preclude his appearance as an expert witness for Hingson. <em>Cf. Dunn v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>639 F.2d 1171, 1174, <em>modified on other grounds, </em>645 F.2d 511 (5th Cir.1981) (products liability defendant may offer employee as expert witness). The district court could use an appropriate instruction to prevent the jury from drawing any improper inferences from PSA\u2019s employment of Waters.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1413\">*1413</page-number>The district court\u2019s exclusion of Waters\u2019 testimony, however, cannot constitute reversible error unless Waters satisfied the requirements of Rule 702 for the admissibility of expert testimony. Consequently, we must be satisfied that his testimony would have assisted the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. PSA argues that Waters\u2019 testimony was needlessly cumulative and thus properly excluded under Fed.R.Evid. 403. Admission of the manuals made his testimony unnecessary. This argument has merit only to the extent Waters would have testified as to the <em>content </em>of the manuals. However, his testimony concerning the <em>preparation </em>of the manuals and the <em>considerations </em>that underlie the provisions related to seating of blind passengers clearly would have assisted the jury in understanding the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1477-5\">The testimony of Claessens strengthens our conviction that the offered testimony by Waters would have assisted the jury. The parties agree that the basic issue in this case is whether PSA acted unreasonably in demanding that Hingson take a bulkhead seat. Captain Claessens testified at length that safety concerns justified his actions. He also testified that under federal regulations, the pilot in command has the ultimate responsibility to make decisions for the safe operation of the aircraft.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When asked how he regarded the policy manuals, he stated that the provisions were intended only as a guide. Waters, according to the offer of proof, would have testified that the safety concerns expressed by Captain Claessens were already reflected in the policy manuals and that such concerns did not require that Hingson sit in a bulkhead seat. We doubt not that the testimony of Waters could have assisted the jury in determining if PSA\u2019s actions were unreasonable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1477-10\">The offer of proof also indicates that Waters was qualified to testify as an expert witness. Rule 702 states that an expert witness is qualified by his \u201cknowledge, skill, experience, training, or education.\u201d Waters worked for PSA for eight years and served as the airline\u2019s Director for Planning and Control for Flight Operations. In this capacity, he studied the problem of accommodating handicapped passengers and drafted the PSA policies stating that blind passengers should not be restricted to the bulkhead seats. It is difficult to imagine a person better qualified to comment on the preparation of the PSA policy manuals or to offer an opinion whether the circumstances justified a departure from the airline\u2019s own policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1477-11\">Because the exclusion of the testimony of Waters was manifestly erroneous and affected a substantial right of Hingson, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 103(a), we reverse the district court on this issue and remand the case for a new trial on Hingson\u2019s claims under section 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1477-12\">B. <em>The Directed Verdicts on the Section 404(a) Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1477-13\">The situation is different with respect to Section 404(a) of the Federal Aviation Act, however. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1477-14\">It shall be the duty of every air carrier to provide and furnish interstate and overseas air transportation, as authoriz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1414\">*1414</page-number>ed by its certif\u00edcate, upon reasonable request therefor and ... to provide safe and adequate service, equipment, and facilities in connection with such transportation ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1478-4\">49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1374(a).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1478-5\">The district court directed a verdict for PSA on Hingson\u2019s claims under section 404(a) on the grounds that there was no showing of damage. Hingson argues that he submitted evidence of damages sufficient for this issue to go to the jury. We need not resolve this dispute. This is because in reviewing the propriety of a directed verdict, we apply the same standard as does the district court: a directed verdict is proper if the evidence permits only one reasonable conclusion. <em>See, e.g., California Computer Products, Inc. v. IBM, </em>613 F.2d 727, 732-34 (9th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1478-6\">Inasmuch as we conclude that there is no private cause of action under section 404(a), we must affirm the district court, albeit on a ground other than that it employed. The Fifth Circuit refused to imply a private cause of action under Section 404(a) in <em>Diefenthal v. CAB, </em>681 F.2d 1039, 1049-50 (5th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1107, 103 S.Ct. 732, 74 L.Ed.2d 956 (1983). Its analysis and application of <em>Cort v. Ash, </em>422 U.S. 66, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975), which establishes the standard for determining if a statute creates an implied private cause of action, is quite persuasive. <em>Cf. In re Mexico City Aircrash of October 31, 1979, </em>708 F.2d 400, 406-408 (9th Cir.1983) (no implied private action for violation of safety provisions of Federal Aviation Act); <em>Montgomery v. American Airlines, </em>637 F.2d 607, 610 (9th Cir.1980) (no private action based on claim that airline\u2019s reduced fare policy for employees violated Federal Aviation Act), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 920, 101 S.Ct. 1368, 67 L.Ed.2d 347 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1478-10\">C. <em>The Directed Verdicts on the Claims Under Section 50b of the Rehabilitation Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1478-11\">Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 presents a different problem. It provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1478-12\">No otherwise qualified handicapped individual in the United States ... shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1478-13\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794.</p>\n<p id=\"b1478-14\">This court recognized a private cause of action for violations of section 504 in <em>Kling v. County of Los Angeles, </em>633 F.2d 876, 878 (9th Cir.1980). The district court, however, directed a verdict for PSA on the section 504 claims on the grounds that PSA does not receive \u201cfederal financial assistance.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1478-15\">Hingson insists that section 504 applies to PSA because it receives money from the government as payment for carrying the mail.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Government mail contracts, however, constitute \u201cfederal financial assistance\u201d for purposes of section 504 only if they involve a subsidy to the airline. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1415\">*1415</page-number><em>Jacobson v. Delta Airlines, </em>742 F.2d 1202, 1210 (9th Cir.1984). Whether an airline is receiving a subsidy will ordinarily be determined by reference to the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). <em>Id. </em>at 1210. The CAB\u2019s published chart listing which airlines were receiving subsidies under section 406 of the Federal Aviation Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1376 (1976), indicates that PSA was not receiving such a subsidy at the time the alleged discrimination against the plaintiff occurred. <em>See </em>14 C.F.R. Part 241 \u00a7 04 (1981); 45 Fed.Reg. 48867, 48870 (1980). We therefore conclude that section 504 does not apply to PSA and affirm the directed verdicts on plaintiffs claim under that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-4\">D. <em>The Directed Verdicts on Claims Under State Statutes and Common Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1479-5\">The district court also directed a verdict for PSA on Hingson\u2019s claims under California Public Utilities Code \u00a7 494 and Civil Code \u00a7 54.1, and under California common law for intentional infliction of emotional distress. On appeal, Hingson has not challenged the directed verdicts on the claims under Public Utilities Code \u00a7 494. With respect to his claim under Civil Code \u00a7 54.1, the district court held that 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1305(a) preempts the state law claims. Section 1305(a)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1479-6\">[N]o state or political subdivision thereof and no interstate agency or other political agency of two or more states shall enact or enforce any law, rule, regulation, standard, or other provision having the force and effect of law relating to rates, routes, or services of any air carrier having authority under Title IV of this chapter to provide interstate air transportation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1479-7\">Section 54.1 of the California Civil Code provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1479-10\">Blind persons, visually handicapped persons, deaf persons, and other physically disabled persons shall be entitled to full and equal access, as other members of the general public, to accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges of all common carriers, airplanes, motor vehicles, railroad trains, motorbuses, streetcars, boats or any other public conveyances or modes of transportation, ... subject only to the conditions and limitations established by law, or state or federal regulation, and applicable alike to all persons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1479-11\">Cal.Civ.Code \u00a7 54.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-12\">In addition, Civil Code \u00a7 54.3 currently provides that a person who violates section 54.1 shall be liable for actual damages and any additional amount up to a maximum of three times actual damages, as well as attorney\u2019s fees, and Civil Code \u00a7 55 authorizes private actions for injunctive relief.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1479-13\">Hingson argues that 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1305(a)(1) does not preempt his claims because Civil Code Section 54.1 does not conflict with federal law. This argument misses the point. Section 1305(a)(1) preemption is not limited to those state laws or regulations that <em>conflict </em>with federal law. It preempts state laws and regulations <em>\u201crelating </em>to rates, routes, or services.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1305(a)(1) (emphasis added). Regulation of air carrier seating policies for handicapped passengers involves the regulation of services within the meaning of section 1305(a)(1). <em>Cf. </em>47 Fed.Reg. 25,937 (1982) (CAB statement that accommodation of handicapped travelers is an important element of \u201cadequate service\u201d required by \u00a7 404(a)). Indeed, the Civil Aeronautics Board has adopted regulations applicable to certificated air carriers that specifically address discrimination against the handicapped. <em>See </em>14 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 382.2, 382.4, 382.5 (1983).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1416\">*1416</page-number>that Hingson\u2019s claims under California Civil Code section 54.1 are preempted.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1480-4\">Hingson\u2019s claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress, however, are not preempted. <em>Cf. Farmer v. United Brotherhood of Carpenters &amp; Joiners, </em>430 U.S. 290, 97 S.Ct. 1056, 51 L.Ed.2d 338 (1977) (National Labor Relations Act does not preempt tort action for intentional infliction of emotional distress). Nonetheless, a directed verdict was proper because the evidence was insufficient to support a finding against PSA. An essential element for a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress is outrageous conduct. <em>E.g., Life Insurance Co. of North America v. Capps, </em>660 F.2d 392, 394 (9th Cir.1981) (affirming summary judgment for defendant on claim under California law). The actions by PSA employees that Hingson complains of cannot plausibly be characterized as either extreme or outrageous. The district court properly directed a verdict for PSA. See <em>Godfrey v. Steinpress, </em>128 Cal.App.3d 154, 173, 180 Cal.Rptr. 95, 104 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-5\">E. <em>The Directed Verdicts on Claims for False Imprisonment and Assault</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1480-6\">Hingson also brought claims for assault and battery, false imprisonment, and the use of unnecessary force and violence in violation of Cal.Civ.Code \u00a7 2188. These claims are based on the actions of the Los Angeles police officers in removing Hing-son from the aircraft. The district court directed a verdict on these claims on the grounds that there was no evidence that PSA employees committed the alleged tor-tious acts. Hingson relies on <em>Hudson v. Nixon, </em>57 Cal.2d 482, 484, 20 Cal.Rptr. 620, 370 P.2d 324 (1962), to argue that the police officers were acting as PSA\u2019s agents, and PSA is therefore liable for their actions. <em>Hudson </em>states that a principal is liable for wrongs committed by an agent in transacting the principal\u2019s business; it does not, however, support Hingson\u2019s contention that the police officers were agents of PSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-11\">Under California law, the right of the alleged principal to control the behavior of the alleged agent is an essential element which must be factually present in order to establish the existence of agency. <em>DeSuza v. Andersack, </em>63 Cal.App.3d 694, 699, 133 Cal.Rptr. 920, 924 (1976). Hingson offered no evidence that PSA had the right to control the actions of the on-duty, Los Angeles police officers after they boarded the aircraft. In effect, Hingson argues that because PSA requested police assistance, the officers were transformed into agents of the airline. We reject this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1417\">*1417</page-number>proposition. PSA was entitled to directed verdicts on the claims for assault and false imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-7\">We reverse the judgment because of the district court\u2019s exclusion of the testimony of Norman Waters and remand this case for a new trial on Hingson\u2019s claims under section 404(b) of the Federal Aviation Act. The directed verdicts in favor of PSA on the remaining claims are affirmed. Each side shall bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-10\">AFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART and REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1475-13\">. As part of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, \u00a7 404(b) ceased to be in effect on January 1, 1983. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1551(a)(2)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1476-6\">. The district court did not commit reversible error in limiting the introduction of the policy manuals. The relevant portions of the manuals were introduced, and Claessens and Everage were questioned regarding their content. Hing-son argues that he was unable to use the manuals to prove PSA\u2019s policy for the seating of blind passengers because the district court admitted them for the limited purpose of proving the unreasonableness of PSA's actions. This argument is meritless. Hingson argued at length in his closing argument that PSA had acted inconsistently with its own procedures, and he read to the jury the relevant portions of the policy manuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1476-7\">Hingson\u2019s argument that he could not effectively examine Claessens and Everage because the manuals were admitted after they testified is also unpersuasive. Hingson questioned them about the manuals, and he could have asked that they return to the witness stand if further questioning was necessary after the manuals were introduced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1476-11\">. It is unclear whether Waters still worked for PSA when Hingson\u2019s case proceeded to trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1476-12\">. The district court initially excluded the testimony on the grounds that Waters was not authorized to make binding admissions on behalf of PSA. This ruling confuses the criteria for admissibility of testimony with that for determining if a corporation is legally bound by the acts of its employees. The district court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1413\">*1413</page-number>rule, and PSA has not argued, that Waters\u2019 testimony should be excluded pursuant to Fed.R. Evid. 403 because its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1477-8\">. Although Claessens did not refer to the specific regulation, 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 91.3 (1983) provides that the pilot in command of an aircraft is directly responsible for, and is the final authority as to, the operation of that aircraft. The trial judge included the language from this regulation in his instructions to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1477-15\">. We note that neither Claessens\u2019s good faith nor the responsibility and authority given a pilot by federal regulations precludes a finding that PSA violated \u00a7 404(b) by requiring Hingson to occupy a bulkhead seat. <em>Cf. Cordero v. Cia Mexicana de Aviacion, </em>681 F.2d 669, 671-72 (9th Cir.1982) (statutory provision in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1511(a) allowing carrier to exclude passengers for safety concerns does not limit protections afforded by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1374(b)). Instead, the test is whether the airline acted reasonably based on the information available when the decision was made. <em>See id. </em>at 672.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1478-7\">. The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 provided that \u00a7 404(a) ceased to be in effect on January 1, 1983, except insofar as the section requires air carriers to provide safe and adequate service. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1551(a)(2)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1478-8\">. Hingson incorrectly states that regulations adopted by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) to implement \u00a7 504 indicate that the statute applies to all airlines. In fact, the CAB concluded that \u00a7 504 itself applies only to air carriers receiving a subsidy under \u00a7\u00a7 406 or 419 of the Federal Aviation Act. See 47 Fed.Reg. 25,937 (1982). <em>See also </em>14 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 382.1-.25 (1983) (regulations implementing \u00a7 504). The CAB did conclude, however, that \u00a7\u00a7 404(a) and (b) of the Federal Aviation Act extend the principles of \u00a7 504 to all certificated air carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1478-17\">HEW and Department of Justice regulations defining \"federal financial assistance\u201d also do not support Hingson. Both the HEW regulations, 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 84.3(h) (1983), and the Department of Justice regulations, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 41.-3(e) (1983), indicate that federal financial assistance does not include government procurement contracts. <em>See also Cook v. Budget Rent-A-Car, </em>502 F.Supp. 494 (S.D.N.Y.1980) (auto rental contracts with federal agencies do not make rental company a recipient of federal financial assistance).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1479-8\">. Before \u00a7 54.3 was amended in 1981, <em>see </em>1981 Cal.Stat. ch. 395, \u00a7 1, the statute authorized recovery of actual damages and up to $1,000 in punitive damages for violations of \u00a7 54.1. <em>See </em>1977 Cal.Stat. ch. 881, \u00a7 1. Because the actions Hingson complains of occurred in 1980, it is the version of \u00a7 54.3 as amended in 1977 that is relevant to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1479-15\">. The CAB relied in part on the adequate-service provision of \u00a7 404(a) as authority for adopting these regulations. Courts have previously held that this provision authorizes CAB <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1416\">*1416</page-number>regulation of smoking aboard aircraft. <em>See Action on Smoking and Health v. CAB, </em>699 F.2d 1209, 1213-1215, <em>modified on other grounds, </em>713 F.2d 795 (D.C.Cir.1983); <em>Diefenthal, </em>681 F.2d at 1044-48.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1480-8\">. We are not persuaded by Hingson's reliance on 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1506, which provides that \"[n]othing in this chapter shall in any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by statute, but the provisions of this chapter are in addition to such remedies.\" <em>Id. </em>This section was enacted as \u00a7 1106 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, and was taken intact from a predecessor provision of the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938. <em>See Klicker v. Northwest Airlines, </em>563 F.2d 1310, 1314 (9th Cir.1977); H.R.Rep. No. 2360, 85th Cong., 2d Sess. 18-19, <em>reprinted in </em>1958 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3741, 3758.</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-9\">The legislative history of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 does <em>not </em>explain the relation between \u00a7 1506 and \u00a7 1305(a). A House report declares that \u00a7 1305(a) is intended to prevent conflicts and inconsistent regulations by preventing states from regulating routes, rates, or services of certain air carriers. H.R.Rep. No. 1211, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 16, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3737, 3752. The actual language in \u00a7 1305(a) was adopted in preference to an earlier Senate version of the Airline Deregulation Act that prohibited states \"from enacting any law, establishing any standard determining routes, schedules, or rates, fares or charges in tariffs of, or otherwise promulgating economic regulations for\" certificated air carriers. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1779, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 94-95 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-13\">Because California Civil Code \u00a7 54.1 would involve regulation of the services of an air carrier, we conclude that Hingson\u2019s claims under the state statute are preempted notwithstanding the savings clause in \u00a7 1506. <em>Cf. Nader v. Allegheny Airlines, </em>426 U.S. 290, 96 S.Ct. 1978, 48 L.Ed.2d 643 (1976) (\u00a7 1506 allows common law action for misrepresentation).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
