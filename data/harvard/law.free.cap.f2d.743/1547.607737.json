They were arrested when the U.S. Coast Guard boarded their vessel on October 23, 1981 and discovered its cargo of marijuana. All defendants were subsequently convicted on both counts. Four issues have been raised on appeal. All appellants contend that there was insufficient evidence to support their convictions and that there was an error in the jury instructions regarding reasonable doubt. In addition, Martin-Gonzalez and Cruz-Valdez argue that the government failed to prove jurisdiction and venue and that since their vessel was seized outside territorial waters they were improperly indicted and convicted under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1613-5\">The appellants were arrested when Coast Guard officers boarded their vessel anchored nine to ten miles west-northwest of Key West. The Coast Guard officers had been patrolling in the Smith Shoals area and noticed the shrimping vessel anchored but not fishing. The officers noted that a name \u201cMiss Tia\u201d was affixed to the stern of the board on a piece of plywood and that it did not display a flag. Petty Officer Politis boarded the vessel to insure compliance with all federal regulations. Once on board, he discovered the appellants and the captain of the boat.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When the captain failed to produce the proper documents, Officer Politis searched for the vessel\u2019s main beam number and upon opening the cargo hatch discovered the marijuana. Officer Politis noted that the fishing gear of the boat was rusted and appeared unusable. No signs that the vessel had been shrimping were found aboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-10\">After the appellants were transported to Key West, they were separately interviewed by Mary Martin, an immigration inspector. Martin asked each of the appellants a series of questions including ones about the circumstances of their voyage. Aside from the testimony of the Coast Guard boarding officer and that of a DEA agent who supervised the removal of the marijuana from the boat, the government\u2019s case rested upon Martin\u2019s testimony about the answers give by the appellants to her question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-11\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-12\">In challenging the sufficiency of the evidence, the defendants argue that the government only established their presence aboard the 68-foot vessel with marijuana in its cargo hold. Each appellant contends that his admissions regarding his role in the voyage, without further evidence by the government, fails to prove conspiracy or possession with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-13\">In assessing these claims, this court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, taking all inferences in its favor. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680, 704 (1942). Our review is limited to determining whether a reasonable trier of fact could find that the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Bell, </em>678 F.2d 547, 548 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-14\"><em>United States v. Alfrey, </em>620 F.2d 551, 556 (5th Cir.1980), established that a permissible inference of guilt regarding conspiracy with intent to distribute and possession of marijuana could be inferred from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1550\">*1550</page-number>the length of the voyage, the large quantity of marijuana aboard the ship and the necessarily close relationship between the captain and the crew. Presence aboard a ship during a long voyage would imply that crewmembers knew how the marijuana was taken on and where it was to be delivered. <em>United States v. Munoz, </em>692 F.2d 116, 118 (11th Cir.1982). If there was a large quantity of marijuana, the sheer bulk of the drug and its smell would normally make it impossible for crewmen to be unaware of the ship\u2019s cargo. <em>United States v. Ceballos, </em>706 F.2d 1198, 1202 (11th Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Stuart-Caballero, </em>686 F.2d 890, 893 (11th Cir.1982). Evidence revealing a close relationship between the captain and the crew, often inferable from the length of the voyage and the size of the ship, would make it highly unlikely that the crew was unaware of the purpose behind the voyage. The presence of all three factors would indicate that the individuals found aboard a vessel had knowledge of the cargo and the criminal nature of the voyage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-4\">To support the inference of guilt, courts have found additional facts to confirm that the defendant had knowledge of and participated in drug smuggling. Statements made by the individual himself, <em>United States v. DeWeese, </em>632 F.2d 1267 (5th Cir.1980), proof that the person was a member of the crew rather than a mere passenger, <em>United States v. Munoz, </em>692 F.2d at 118, and suspicious activity by those aboard the vessel when approached by the Coast Guard, <em>United States v. Alfrey, </em>620 F.2d at 553-56, have added support for the drawing of the inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-5\">Applying the <em>Alfrey </em>criteria and searching for additional supporting facts here leads us to conclude that there was sufficient evidence to convict Cruz-Valdez and Martin-Gonzalez. Both men admitted to joining the \u201cMiss Tia\u201d in Florida for the trip to Colombia and having been at sea for fifty days. They described themselves as crewmembers. Although both denied participating in the loading of marijuana, they did tell Inspector Martin that they knew what the cargo was. Cruz-Valdez also informed Martin that he knew that the ultimate destination of the boat was Key West. Martin-Gonzalez and Cruz-Valdez had been at sea for a long time, they knew about the large quantity of marijuana stored in the cargo hold and they necessarily had a close relationship with the captain. What makes the case against them is that they confessed, through their discussion with Inspector Martin, to most of the details that established guilt of the two offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-7\">The case against Ariza-Fuentes, however, stands in a different posture. Ariza-Fuentes made several statements to Inspector Martin which were exculpatory in nature. Although he described himself as a crewman, Ariza-Fuentes also told the immigration inspector that his normal job was that of a taxi driver and this voyage was his first. Ariza-Fuentes also said that he did not discover what the cargo of the vessel was until they had been at sea for three or four days. He told Martin that he boarded the ship in Los Muchiquitos, Colombia and that he did not know when or where the cargo was loaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-8\">The government argues that these are false exculpatory statements. The government primarily argues that the condition of the fishing equipment and the fact that there was no evidence of fishing activity would have made it impossible for the appellant to be unaware of the true nature of the ship\u2019s voyage. The question of when Ariza-Fuentes knew about the cargo was simply a jury question. The fact that the jury found Ariza-Fuentes guilty indicates that they found his story about being a crewman, while not knowing of the cargo or the destination of the ship, unbelievable. In response, appellant argues that it is just as likely that he joined the ship to go to America as it is that he joined in a drug smuggling conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-9\">In order to prove a criminal conspiracy, the government must present direct or circumstantial evidence of an agreement among the conspirators to commit the offense. There must be proof beyond a rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1551\">*1551</page-number>sonable doubt that the conspiracy existed, that the accused knew of it, and that he intended to join or associate himself with it. <em>United States v. Malatesta, </em>590 F.2d 1379, 1381 (5th Cir.1979) (en banc). Ariza-Fuentes joined the ship late in its voyage and told the immigration inspector that the ship left Columbia from the point where he boarded the ship. There was no evidence, therefore, that he knew from the ship\u2019s previous course the purpose of the voyage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-5\">The government never offered any evidence to show that Ariza-Fuentes must have known the purpose of the voyage and that the hold contained marijuana. There was no evidence that the presence of the large quantity of marijuana would have been apparent to someone boarding the vessel. Instead, the evidence before the jury was that the hatch to the hold was closed and that there was no odor of marijuana. The government also introduced no evidence about where the cargo was loaded in Colombia which might have indicated that Ariza-Fuentes knew about the marijuana before the ship was well out to sea. The paucity of evidence relating to whether Ariza-Fuentes was on a long voyage and knew about the ship\u2019s cargo weakens the case against him. This in turn made it hard for the government to offer evidence concerning the third <em>Alfrey </em>factor. The close relationship between the captain and crew can normally be inferred from the length of the voyage and the quantity of marijuana, but Ariza-Fuentes stands apart from the other appellants on precisely these issues. It is also difficult to find additional facts which would show guilt. Although Ariza-Fuentes identified himself as a crewmember, there was no evidence concerning how or why the captain took him on the vessel. While it might be true that Ariza-Fuentes\u2019 exculpatory statements were false, the government must do more than argue that his story is unbelievable. Since the case against the appellant rested solely upon the information he provided,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the government has not managed to prove more than his presence upon the vessel. Finding the evidence against Ariza-Fuentes insufficient, we reverse his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-15\">\n<em>Propriety of Indictments Under \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-17\">In 1980, Congress enacted 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 955a-955d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to curb possession of drugs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1552\">*1552</page-number>on the high seas. 1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm.News 2785. The statute was enacted to cure an earlier inadvertent repeal of the statute, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 184(a), which had prohibited possession of drugs aboard American ships on the high seas. <em>United States v. Riker, </em>670 F.2d 987, 988 (11th Cir.1982). Before \u00a7\u00a7 955a <em>et seq. </em>were passed, the Fifth Circuit extended the reach of \u00a7 841 to apply to drug smugglers arrested outside the territorial but inside the customs waters of the United States.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Baker, </em>609 F.2d 134 (5th Cir.1980).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 955a(c) by its terms prohibits possession with intent to distribute by any person on board any vessel within the customs waters. Since the appellants were arrested in 1981, more than a year after the enactment of this later statute, they could have been indicted under \u00a7 955a(c). Martin-Gonzalez and Cruz-Valdez argue that they <em>should </em>have been so indicted and the government\u2019s use of another, statute justifies reversal of their convictions. Appellants, in essence, argue that the passage of \u00a7 955 preempted the use of \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846 for smuggling within the customs waters. The government contends that it had discretion to charge under either statute and chose \u00a7 841 because there is an enhanced penalty available, fifteen years rather than five, if the quantity of marijuana exceeds one thousand pounds.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(6). Since the two statutes proscribe the same conduct and the later one does not expressly repeal the other, the appellants are left with arguing that there has been an implied repeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-4\">Repeals by implication are not favored. In the absence of an affirmative showing of an intention to repeal, the only justification for an implied repeal is when the earlier and later statutes are irreconcilable. <em>Morton v. Mancari, </em>417 U.S. 535, 549-50, 94 S.Ct. 2474, 2482, 41 L.Ed.2d 290, 300 (1974). A review of the legislative history accompanying \u00a7 955 reveals no intention by Congress to make \u00a7 955a(c) the sole statute for prosecution within the customs waters or to curb the use of \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846 in those circumstances. If Congress had meant to achieve either of those purposes, it could have done so.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Just as there is no affirmative showing of an intention to repeal, there is no showing that the statutes are irreconcilable. Differences in the statutes and their interpretation might lead the government to apply the statutes differently. One statute, \u00a7 841, may prescribe an enhanced penalty if a certain condition is met, but both statutes proscribe the same conduct. According to <em>United States v. Baker, </em>609 F.2d at 139, sections 841 and 846 are available for use against the crime of possession with intent to distribute so long as the government can prove that the intended distribution would occur in the United States. Section 955a(c) does not require such a showing and therefore places less of a burden on the government. These differences do not make the statutes irreconcilable. There has been no repeal by implication here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-11\">\n<em>Jurisdiction and Venue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AYKX\">Appellants Cruz-Valdez and Martin-Gonzalez contend that the government failed to prove jurisdiction and venue. Proof of jurisdiction and venue are essential elements of any crime in the sense that the burden is on the government to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1553\">*1553</page-number>their existence. <em>United States v. Barnes, </em>681 F.2d 717, 723 (11th Cir.1982). In this case the indictment read \u201con or about October 23, 1981, at a point approximately nine (9) miles West-Northwest of Key West, Monroe County, in the Southern District of Florida, the defendants ...\u201d Appellants claim that the government constructively amended the indictment by proving that the crime occurred on the high seas outside the territorial waters of the United States and the Southern District of Florida. Constructive amendment of an indictment occurs when the evidence presented at trial and the jury instructions so modify the elements of the crime charged that the defendant may have been convicted on a ground not alleged by the grand jury\u2019s indictment. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>679 F.2d 845, 851 (11th Cir.1982). If proven, such an amendment violates a defendant\u2019s right to be tried solely on the allegations returned by the grand jury and requires reversal. <em>Stirone v. United States, </em>361 U.S. 212, 215-218, 80 S.Ct. 270, 272-273, 4 L.Ed.2d 252 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-5\">The government did not constructively amend the indictment by proving that the crime occurred, as the indictment claimed, nine miles from Key West. <em>United States v. Baker </em>established that so long as it is clear that the intended distribution of the drugs would occur within the territorial United States, jurisdiction can be maintained where the defendants are arrested within the Customs waters. The trial court instructed the jury that they had to find a specific intent to distribute within the United States and the jury made such a finding. Once apprehended defendants were naturally taken to Key West, the closest point in U.S. territory, for formal arrest. Since Key West was used as the reference point for describing the location of the boarding and arrest, it was also natural to mention that the city was within the\u2019 Southern District of Florida. The government argues that the mention of the Southern District of Florida is mere surplusage and the proof at trial of where the crime occurred matched that alleged in the indictment. Finding this to be true, we refuse to reverse, the convictions of the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-9\">\n<em>Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-10\">Failure to make a timely objection to a jury instruction results in waiver unless the instruction constitutes plain error. Fed.R.Crim.P. 30; <em>United States v. Thevis, </em>665 F.2d 616, 645 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982). The plain error exception will not apply unless the charge is so clearly erroneous that there is the likelihood of a grave miscarriage of justice, <em>United States v. Varkonyi, </em>645 F.2d 453, 459 (5th Cir.1981), or it affects the fairness of the proceeding. <em>See United States v. Adams, </em>634 F.2d 830, 836 (8th Cir.1981). The defendants made no objection at trial to the charge on reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We must therefore examine the instruction to see if the court\u2019s use of \u201cshould\u201d instead of \u201cmust\u201d constitutes plain error. Appellants point to <em>United States v. Sheldon, </em>544 F.2d 213 (5th Cir.1976), as support for their position that \u201cshould\u201d was improper. In <em>Sheldon, </em>the court held that the district court should have instructed the jury that it must acquit the defendant if there is reasonable doubt. 544 F.2d at 221-222. What concerned the <em>Sheldon </em>court was that the word used by the court, \u201cmay,\u201d indicated that the jury had discretion about whether to find a defendant guilty if it had reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 222. The word \u201cshould,\u201d however, implies an obligation on the part of the jury rather than discretion. This is particularly true since in reviewing reasonable doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1554\">*1554</page-number>charges, this court must look to the whole instruction rather than isolate a particular part. <em>United States v. Schaffer, </em>600 F.2d 1120, 1123 (5th Cir.1979). The trial judge in this case gave a complete instruction regarding the government\u2019s burden of proof. The judge also told the jury that if it had reasonable doubt it \u201cshould, of course\u201d adopt the conclusion of innocence. The instruction made it clear to the jury what it was obligated to do if faced with reasonable doubt. We find no plain error in the jury instruction given here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the convictions of Cruz-Valdez and Martin-Gonzalez are AFFIRMED and that of Ariza-Fuentes is REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1613-6\">.

Unit B 1982), <em>aff'd, </em>462 U.S. 356, 103 S.Ct. 2398, 76 L.Ed.2d 638 (1983). With this firmly in mind, I suggest that the evidence presented to the jurors authorized them to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-8\">The <em>Miss Tia </em>left Florida with a captain and two crew members, sailed to Colombia to pick up 220 bales of marijuana, each weighing approximately forty-five pounds, and returned to the United States. <em>Miss Tia </em>was a 68-foot shrimp trawler. The fishing gear was obviously unusable, the booms, winches and tackle being rusted and bent. The hatch covers to the marijuana compartments were neither locked nor latched; they could be lifted easily by hand. The name \u201cMiss Tia\u201d was crudely affixed to the vessel\u2019s stern on a piece of plywood. The voyage back to the United States required ten days.</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-12\">Ariza-Fuentes joined the crew of the <em>Miss Tia </em>in Colombia, allegedly after the marijuana was loaded aboard. (ArizaFuentes told the Immigration Inspector who interviewed him after his arrest that he had worked as a city taxi driver before joining the <em>Miss Tia </em>and had no previous experience with boats, but the jury was entitled to disbelieve this self-serving statement.) From all of this evidence, the jurors were entitled to draw the following inferences, which, I submit, were dictated by \u201creason and common sense.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1618-13\">First, Ariza-Fuentes knew the purpose and destination of <em>Miss </em>Tia\u2019s voyage when he joined the crew; this is something any crewman would determine before signing on for a long voyage. He learned that the other crewmen were from the United States and that the vessel\u2019s destination was the United States. Ariza-Fuentes plainly saw that the <em>Miss Tia </em>lacked rigging for shrimping and knew that the purpose of the voyage was not fishing. <em>United States v. Ceballos, </em>706 F.2d 1198, 1202 (11th Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Bustos-Guzman, </em>685 F.2d 1278, 1281 (11th Cir.1982). In sum, the jurors could reasonably have found that Ariza-Fuentes knew, before the voyage began, that the <em>Miss Tia </em>was tak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1555\">*1555</page-number>ing a load of marijuana to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-4\">Second, Ariza-Fuentes, having never previously crewed on the <em>Miss Tia, </em>determined her seaworthiness before leaving port on the ten-day ocean voyage. His investigation into <em>Miss </em>Tia\u2019s condition was especially thorough because of the vessel\u2019s relatively small size (68 feet), general state of disrepair, and the fact that she was riding somewhat lower in the water on account of her five-ton cargo of marijuana. The covers to the hatches leading to the ship\u2019s hold were unlatched and the hold was readily accessible. During his examination of the boat, Ariza-Fuentes must have looked into the hold and discovered that it was stuffed with marijuana bales. Although the evidence does not indicate the extent of the odor the load of marijuana emitted, the jury, drawing on common sense, could conclude that it must have been overwhelming, just as it could conclude that the odor of a five-ton cargo of fresh tobacco would be pungent. In fact, the large quantity of marijuana alone authorized the inference that Ariza-Fuentes knew what the boat was carrying. <em>United States v. Mazyak, </em>650 F.2d 788, 791 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 922, 102 S.Ct. 1281, 71 L.Ed.2d 464 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-5\">Finally, Ariza-Fuentes was congenial with the other crew members and had joined in their enterprise. The three-man crew of a 68-foot boat loaded with marijuana would not have taken on an additional member for their ten-day trip to the Florida Keys without some assurance that he could be trusted. If he was not trustworthy, the three men ran the risk that he would cooperate with the authorities if they got arrested. Furthermore, logic tells us that the new sailor had to be loyal to the illicit venture. Had he not been loyal, the three men who brought the boat from Florida could just as easily have made the return trip without extra help. The jury could infer the close relationship between members of the crew merely from the length of the voyage and the size of the vessel. <em>Ce-ballos, </em>706 F.2d at 1202; <em>United States v. Munoz, </em>692 F.2d 116, 119 (11th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1221, 103 S.Ct. 1229, 75 L.Ed.2d 463 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-7\">We have said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1619-8\">the probable length of the voyage, the large quantity of marijuana on board, and the necessarily close relationship between the captain and his crew [are] factors from which the jury could reasonably find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1619-9\"><em>United States v. DeWeese, </em>632 F.2d 1267, 1272 (5th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 878, 102 S.Ct. 358, 70 L.Ed.2d 188 (1981). Certainly, these factors were present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-10\">Our job, in this case, is limited. We are only to determine whether twelve fair-minded jurors had enough evidence to convict; we are not to substitute our judgment for theirs. The majority have done just that, and I must dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1618-9\">. In this case, as in most criminal cases, the jurors are entitled</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1618-10\">to draw such reasonable inferences from the testimony and exhibits as [they] feel are justified in light of common experience. In other words, [they] may make deductions and reach conclusions which reason and common sense lead [them] to draw from the facts which have been established by the testimony and evidence in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1618-15\">Fifth Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions \u00a7 5 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-16\">While the district court did not give this specific instruction to the jury here, its charge, taken as a whole, communicated the essence thereof.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
