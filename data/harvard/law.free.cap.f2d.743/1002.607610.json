Early was initially determined by the Secretary to be disabled due to gouty arthritis as of May 28, 1976 and received disability benefits; however, the Secretary found that Early had ceased to be disabled as of December 1981 and was therefore not entitled to ben<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>efits as of February 1982.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A hearing was held before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), who concluded that Early had the ability to perform sedentary work and, consequently, was no longer disabled. After the Appeals Council denied Early\u2019s request for review, and the Secretary\u2019s decision became final, Early filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Both parties filed motions for summary judgment, the magistrate recommended that the Secretary\u2019s motion be granted, and the district court entered judgment for the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">The determinations of both the Secretary and the magistrate as to Early\u2019s burden to prove his disability predate this court\u2019s decision in <em>Kuzmin v. Sckweiker, </em>714 F.2d 1233 (3d Cir.1983). In <em>Kuzmin, </em>we held that in a termination proceeding, once a claimant introduces evidence, as here, that his or her condition \u201cremains substantially the same as at the time of the earlier determination, the claimant is entitled to the benefit of a presumption that his or her condition remains disabling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1237. The district court made an independent review of the record in light of <em>Kuzmin, </em>and found itself \u201cunable to conclude that any determination by the Secretary that Plaintiff\u2019s condition has so improved would [ ] be supported by substantial evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> App. at 56a. Consequently, the court found that Early\u2019s benefits could \u201cnot be terminated upon this basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, the court found that Early\u2019s admission that he could perform sedentary work \u201cmust be given substantial weight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It therefore concluded that the Secretary\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence on the basis that Early\u2019s testimony alone showed either that the initial determination was erroneous or that his condition had improved sufficiently to allow him to undertake gainful activity. <em>Id. </em>at 56a-57a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">We disagree because we conclude that Early\u2019s testimony does not constitute substantial evidence of the kind necessary to support the Secretary\u2019s finding of nondisa-bility, and that there is no other evidence on the record tending to show that Early\u2019s condition had improved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-10\">James Early was 44 years of age at the time of the administrative hearing and has a high school education. He has worked as a route salesman, truck driver, and welder. Early maintains that he continues to suffer, as he did at the time of the initial determination of disability in May 1976, from acute and painful exacerbation and swelling of his joints, occasional locking of the joints, and sudden flare-ups of his gouty condition, even while on prescribed medication for gout.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-11\">On December 4, 1981, Dr. Joseph R. Sgarlat, a general and orthopaedic surgeon, performed a consultative orthopaedic examination on Early.- Dr. Sgarlat reported that Early was being treated at the Veterans Administration Hospital and \u201ctakes gout medication regularly\u201d, and that he \u201ccontinues to have pain in his elbows, knees, hands, wrists and feet and walks with a cane.\u201d App. at 86a. Dr. Sgarlat also reported that there had been \u201crecurrences of subcutaneous nodules along the areas of the elbows ..., but not in the foot,\u201d and that Early had \u201cnormal\u201d ranges of motion in the shoulders, hips, knees, and ankles, \u201calmost full\u201d ranges of motion in both elbows, \u201cmild loss of full motion\u201d in the wrists, and \u201cfull opening and closing\u201d in the hands, except that his left small finger sometimes locks in flexion. <em>Id. </em>Dr. Sgarlat found \u201csome grating in the knees but no joint effusion.\u201d An x-ray was taken of Early\u2019s left knee, the joint he said gave him the greatest problem. <em>Id. </em>Dr. Sgarlat concluded that the x-rays were \u201cwithin normal limits\u201d and that there were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>\u201cno gouty arthritic signs present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Dr. Sgarlat\u2019s diagnosis of Early\u2019s condition was \u201cgouty arthritis involving primarily his elbows, ... a condition that is treatable with proper medication and when given properly should allow the patient to resume very nearly normal activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87a. Dr. Sgarlat\u2019s opinion was that in Early\u2019s present condition, he would be able to do \u201cat least a sedentary or even a light job.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\">Early\u2019s treating physician at the VA Hospital, Dr. Sharma, reported that Early suffered from pain and swelling in his knees and elbows that had grown progressively worse despite his medications, which included Allpurinol, Colchrin and Indocin, and that Early therefore had difficulty walking. Dr. Sharma\u2019s diagnosis was chronic tophaceous arthritis in the knees and elbows and mild mid-tender swelling of the both knees and elbows. App. at 115a-16a. In April 1982, Dr. Sharma concluded that Early was \u201cnot able to work because of his severe disability,\u201d App. at 121a, and several months later restated that Early was \u201ctotally disabled by gout.\u201d App. at 115a-17a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-6\">The medical records in 1981 and 1982 show several in-patient hospitalizations and out-patient treatments because of flare-ups of gout, App. at 81a-85a, 88a-113a, during which acute exacerbation and swelling was noted. App. at 85a, 94a-95a, 103a. The medical records also document Early\u2019s complaints of pain and stiffness in the joints despite the use of medication. App. at 103a, 105a, 109a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-7\">A review of the medical records of Early\u2019s treatment and hospitalizations from January 1982 to July 1982 reveals that Early \u201ccannot walk or stand and that both knees swell, [H]as pain in right instep\u201d (App. at 109a); \u201cleft knee swells [when] walking and is painful\u201d, \u201csudden pain in left knee\u201d, \u201chas gout involving both knees and walking ... is difficult for him\u201d (App. at 110a); \u201cpain and aches in various joints, knees, ankles and elbows\u201d, (App. at 111a); \u201cconsistently runs high uric acid\u201d (App. at 113a); \u201chas severe gout involving all his joints particularly both knees and ankles\u201d, \u201crequires frequent assistance and walks with a cane,\u201d \u201cis not able to work because of his severe disability.\u201d (App. at 114a); \u201cpain and swelling in all his joints involving toes, knees, elbows. Difficulty] in walking because of painful knees. [C]ondition got worse, progressively worse despite medication.\u201d (App. at 115a). \u201cChronic to-phaceous arthritis-knees and elbows mild-mod. Tender swelling left and right knees and left and right elbows\u201d (App. at 116a); \u201cunable to make fist (grasp) in either hand\u201d, \u201cHand x-rays are more consistent with severe gout.\u201d (App. at 118a). The record also refers to laboratory findings and x-ray reports (App. at 119a), which are the basis for Dr. Sharma\u2019s conclusion as to the severity of Early\u2019s impairment. After an examination in July 1982, Dr. Sharma reported that Early was suffering from a locking of the fifth finger of the left hand when in full flexion and a locking of the left knee, and that x-rays of Early\u2019s hands were consistent with severe gout. App. at 118a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-11\">At the hearing, Early testified that he experiences considerable pain when he walks or bends, Tr. at 37, and that he often sleeps only one hour per night because of his pain. Tr. at 45. He also testified that when he sits, his knees lock and he often must get help from his wife in order to straighten out his knees, Tr. at 35, that he has difficulty holding or gripping with his hands, Tr. at 36, and that he does not have the full use of his right elbow. Tr. at 48. Early testified that he follows the doctor\u2019s orders in regard to taking his medication and denied not taking medication as directed. Tr. at 33. In response to a question by the AU, Early said that he thought he could perform a sitting job where he could stand when he wanted and have to lift no more than two pounds, such as a cashier at a self-service gas station or a parking garage. Tr. at 28.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, when ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>tioned more fully on this issue, Early explained his earlier statement and gave details about his physical condition which throw considerable doubt on the Secretary\u2019s position and the district court\u2019s finding that Early categorically admitted he had the capacity for work:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-4\">Q: Well how long can you sit without having to get up, like you\u2019re sitting here now? And of course if you want to get up, feel free to get up. And of course we can still- proceed with the hearing. But how long can [you] sit like you\u2019re sitting now without having to get up, of course you\u2019ve already set [sic] for more than ten minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-5\">A: Well I can sit for about an hour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ6W\">Q: If you shift your position?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-6\">A: Shifted. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-7\">Q: And since you stopped working has your condition gotten better or worse or remained the same?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-8\">A: <em>My condition has got worse.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-9\">Q: Are you able to care for your personal needs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-10\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-11\">Q: Are you able to lift. Can you lift ten pounds?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-12\">A: No, I cannot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-13\">Q: Why can\u2019t you lift?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-14\">A: Cause I can show you why. I\u2019ll just lift this book for a minute, or whatever. My hand is swelling up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-15\">Q: Well you told me that you thought you could perform a job where you could alternate standing and sitting and lifting nore more than ten pounds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-24\">A: Yes, I gotta say why I can\u2019t lift. Just this little bit with this book, here will make my hand swell up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-25\">Q: Alright, you say you can\u2019t lift then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-26\">A: I can\u2019t lift.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-27\">Q: Okay. How do you think you could perform a job if...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-28\">A: You know what I think there... Q: How do you think you could perform a job if you can\u2019t lift?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-29\">A: <em>Well that\u2019s why I don\u2019t know if I can perform a job. </em>I cannot lift. This is my problem.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1070-30\">Tr. at 38-39 (emphasis added). Subsequently, Early testified that he could not stoop, squat, or kneel. Tr. at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-31\">The AU found that at the time of the termination hearing in June 1982 Early was suffering from gouty arthritis and was being treated at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. However, the AU concluded that Early\u2019s subjective complaints of pain were not supported by the objective evidence. He found that Early did experience pain, but that the record did not support the presence of such severe, persistent pain as would prevent him from working. The AU concluded that, on the basis of Dr. Sgarlat\u2019s report and Early\u2019s own testimony, Early did not have a severe impairment and was capable of performing sedentary work. The AU <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>made no findings as to the contrary medical evidence presented by Dr. Sharma.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">Although it is not in the record, the parties have confirmed that Early again applied for disability benefits in October 1982, and they were granted in November 1982. Thus, we are dealing with a closed benefit period of alleged nondisability, as in <em>Kuz-min, </em>714 F.2d at 1236.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-7\">In reviewing final determinations by the Secretary after an administrative hearing, courts are bound by the Secretary\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g); 1383(c)(3). Substantial evidence has been defined as such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1427, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971); <em>Dobrowolsky v. Califa-no, </em>606 F.2d 403, 406 (3d Cir.1979). A person is disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act \u201conly if his physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A) (1983); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-9\">Under the Act, the burden of proof as to the medical basis of a finding of disability remains on the claimant at all times, both in the initial proceeding to establish disability and in a subsequent termination proceeding. <em>Torres v. Schweiker, </em>682 F.2d 109, 111 (3d Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1174, 103 S.Ct. 823, 74 L.Ed.2d 1020 (1983). However, in a termination proceeding, after the claimant has introduced evidence that his or her condition remains essentially the same as it was at the time of the earlier determination, the burden shifts to the Secretary to \u201cpresent evidence that there has been sufficient improvement in the claimant\u2019s condition to allow the claimant to undertake gainful activity.\u201d <em>Kuzmin v. Schweiker, </em>714 F.2d at 1237.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-12\">On this record, we conclude that while Early has introduced evidence that his condition remains the same, the Secretary has failed to carry the burden to show Early\u2019s condition had sufficiently improved that he could undertake substantial gainful activity. As the district court found, the AU, whose decision predated <em>Kuzmin, </em>made no finding of medical improvement, and the district court was also unable to conclude from the evidence on this record that there was sufficient medical improvement to allow claimant to undertake gainful activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-13\">In addition, the AU did not make any reference to the medical evidence of disability presented by Early\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Sharma. The AU made no findings as to Dr. Sharma\u2019s detailed medical findings and conclusion that Early \u201cis not able to work because of his severe disability.\u201d App. at 114a.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This evidence, which was both extensive and detailed, conflicted with the brief report of the consultative physician, Dr. Sgarlat, on which the AU relied. As we stated in <em>Cotter v. Harris, </em>642 F.2d 700, 701, 706 (3d Cir.1981), \u201cthere is a particularly acute need for some explanation by the AU when s/he has rejected relevant evidence or when there is conflicting probative evidence in the record.\u201d Consequently, we cannot affirm termination of Early\u2019s benefits on the ground that there is substantial evidence that his medical condition had improved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-14\"> The remaining ground for termination on this record is Early\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>at the hearing, at which he was unrepresented by counsel, that he was capable of performing some kinds of sedentary work. However, Early\u2019s testimony was in fact equivocal and conflicting; although he indicated initially that he thought he could do some types of sedentary work, his answers to more specific questions were inconsistent with this conclusion. Thus, in response to questions, he testified that he could sit for a period of about one hour if allowed to shift his weight, that his knees often locked while sitting, and that he could not lift a book without his wrists swelling. This testimony as to physical limitations was supported by the reports of the treating physician, Dr. Sharma, who described Early as totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">In evaluating Early\u2019s testimony, it is significant that he was unrepresented by counsel. As we stated in <em>Dobrowolsky v. Califano, </em>606 F.2d at 407, when a claimant is unrepresented the AU has a \u201cduty to develop the record with special care.\u201d When we examine this record with the \u201cheightened level of care\u201d appropriate under <em>Dobrowolsky, </em>we are unable to affirm termination of Early\u2019s benefits on the basis of his equivocal testimony as to his capacity. At most, some of the statements taken out of context might be read as suggesting capacity to perform certain limited tasks, but the testimony read in its entirety, as it must be, is inconclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">We conclude that Early\u2019s testimony is not substantial evidence of improvement. Thus, neither the medical reports nor Early\u2019s testimony constitute substantial evidence to support a determination of nondis-ability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">The Secretary argues, nevertheless, that Early\u2019s condition was treatable but that he failed to take his medicine regularly.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The AU made no finding on the issue, and there is insufficient basis on the record for the court to do so as an initial matter. The record reveals that the treating physician, Dr. Sharma, merely speculated that Early\u2019s lack of improvement may have been caused by failure to take medication regularly; and Dr. Sharma noted that Early insisted this was not the case. The consultative physician, Dr. Sgarlat, reported that Early \u201ctakes his gout medicine regularly.\u201d This insubstantial evidence would be insufficient to support a termination of benefits, even had the AU addressed the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-10\">\u00cdV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-11\">We conclude there is no substantial evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s determination that Early was no longer disabled as of December 1981. Although we have previously affirmed our authority to direct the grant of summary judgment for the claimant, <em>see Dobrowolsky, </em>606 F.2d at 410, and a closed benefit period situation is one of the most appropriate circumstances in which to do so, <em>see Kuzmin, </em>714 F.2d at 1240, in this case the Secretary has not had the opportunity to address the question of Early's continued disability under the applicable <em>Kuzmin </em>standard, and the additional determination of disability in 1982. Accordingly, we will vacate the judgment of the district court and remand this case to the district court with directions that it be remanded to the Secretary for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1068-6\">.
