Appellant claims that because his sentence was \u201cillegal\u201d, the district court had jurisdiction under Rule 35 to entertain his motion. We hold that appellant\u2019s sentence was not illegal and that appellant\u2019s failure to file a timely motion deprived the court of jurisdiction to review his sentence. The decision by the district court denying appellant\u2019s motion is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Ames was convicted by a jury in the United States District Court for, <em>inter alia, </em>violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252, and was sentenced to a five year prison term. The maximum jail penalty for conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252 is imprisonment for ten years. Appellant\u2019s conviction was affirmed by this court, <em>United States v. Ames, </em>685 F.2d 421 (1st Cir.1982), and his petition for a writ of certiorari before the United States Supreme Court was denied on March 21, 1983, <em>United States v. Ames, </em>460 U.S. 1042, 103 S.Ct. 1437, 75 L.Ed.2d 795 (U.S. March 22, 1983). On July 26, 1983, one hundred and twenty-seven days later, appellant moved in the district court for an order to correct or reduce his sentence under Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The court denied appellant\u2019s motion on July 29, 1983, stating first that the district court lacked jurisdiction, and second that the court regarded the sentence as fair and reasonable. Appellant now claims that the district court, in determining his sentence, relied upon an ex parte report forwarded to the Parole Commission, which contained material misrepresentations as to appellant\u2019s identity and character. Appellant argues that such reliance makes his five year sentence illegal and that the sentence may be corrected or reduced upon motion at any time. The government responds that appellant\u2019s sentence is not illegal and that, consequently, his Rule 35 motion is time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">Rule 35 distinguishes between \u201cillegal sentences\u201d and sentences \u201cimposed in an illegal manner\u201d. While the sentencing court may correct an \u201cillegal sentence\u201d at any time, a sentence \u201cimposed in an illegal manner\u201d may only be corrected or reduced within 120 days of either the date of sentence or the date of the final appellate disposition having the effect of upholding the judgment of conviction. Fed.R.Crim.P. 35.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">For purposes of Rule 35, we have held that an \u201cillegal sentence\u201d is one which is ambiguous with respect to the time and manner in which it is to be served, is internally contradictory, omits a term required to be imposed by statute, is uncertain as to the substance of the sentence, or is a sentence which the judgment of conviction does not authorize. <em>United States v. Becker, </em>536 F.2d 471, 473 (1st Cir.1976). Appellant\u2019s five year sentence is not in excess of the ten year statutory maximum, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252, and is not otherwise contrary to the applicable law. Thus by the standards set forth in <em>Becker, </em>appellant\u2019s sentence is legal. <em>Id.; see also United States v. DeLutro, </em>617 F.2d 316, 318 (2d Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-13\">The question whether appellant\u2019s sentence was \u201cimposed in an illegal manner\u201d is not before us. A motion for correction of a sentence imposed in an illegal manner under Rule 35(a) must be made within 120 days after imposition of the sentence or \u201cwithin 120 days after entry of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>any order or judgment of the Supreme Court denying review of, or having the effect of upholding a judgment of conviction____\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b). <em>United States v. Ramsey, </em>655 F.2d 398, (D.C.Cir.1981). Appellant\u2019s failure to bring his Rule 35 motion within 120 days from the denial of his petition for a writ of certiorari deprived the district court of the power to consider his motion because the time limitations imposed by Rule 35 are jurisdictional. <em>United States v. Addonizio, </em>442 U.S. 178, 189, 99 S.Ct. 2235, 2242, 60 L.Ed.2d 805 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Finally, we note that even if there were no jurisdictional bar, the district court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion to correct or reduce sentence does not appear vulnerable. In his motion to correct, appellant has introduced no evidence to support his claim that his sentence was imposed in an illegal manner. He shows neither that the contents of the purported ex parte report were communicated to the district court, nor that the court relied upon any erroneous information in sentencing. <em>Knight v. United States, </em>611 F.2d 918, 923 (1st Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Appellant\u2019s motion to reduce, sentence is essentially a plea for leniency and is addressed to the sound discretion of the district court. The function of Rule 35 is to allow the district court to decide if, on further reflection, the sentence seems unduly harsh. <em>United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857 (9th Cir.1982); <em>United States v. Colvin, </em>644 F.2d 703, 705 (8th Cir.1981). Where the facts do not indicate an illegal sentence or that the trial court grossly abused its discretion in imposing sentence, the denial of a motion to reduce sentence will not be reversed on appeal. <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>711 F.2d 159, 160 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">On the facts alleged, the district court\u2019s summary dismissal of appellant\u2019s motion was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-7\">.
