Defendants appeal from the district court\u2019s dismissal of their counterclaims, entry of a permanent injunction against them, and award to plaintiff of attorney\u2019s fees. With the exception of the challenge to the award of attorney's fees, we find that none of appellant\u2019s objections require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-25\">I. FACTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-26\">A. <em>The Parties.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1444-27\">Sealy is an association of bedding manufacturers which owns and licenses the \u201cSealy\u201d trademark. Sealy, Inc. establishes standards for the manufacture of bedding products to be sold under its name.</p>\n<p id=\"AfCY\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>Danco, an organization of manufaeturer\u2019s representatives, advertises and sells a variety of bedding products, including those of defendant-appellant Pacifica.</p>\n<p id=\"AN7\">Pacifica, a bedding manufacturer located in San Diego, California, is wholly-owned by Ohio-Sealy Mattress Manufacturing Co. (\u201cOhio-Sealy\u201d). Ohio-Sealy itself manufactures bedding and, unlike its subsidiary Pacifica, is a Sealy licensee. In 1971, OhioSealy sued Sealy, Inc. under federal antitrust laws, claiming that its licensing arrangement perpetuated practices held illegal i<em>n United States v. Sealy, </em>388 U.S. 350, 87 S.Ct. 1847, 18 L.Ed.2d 1238 (1967). The long history of dissension between Sealy, Inc and Ohio-Sealy is recited m the antitrust counterclaim filed by Danco m this action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AGzb\">B. <em>The present case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"azj-dedup-1\">In May 1982, Danco began to offer genuine Sealy mattresses, acquired from an Ohio-Sealy subsidiary in Texas, together with non-Sealy Pacifica foundations made by Pacifica with identical fabric covering or \u201cticking.\u201d The foundations bore no identifying labels. The mattress and foundation combination thus gave the impression of , . . , . i , ti , being a matched set, and at Danco s sug-gesti\u00f3n were advertised by some retailers <em>as, </em>a \u201cSealy Back-Saver and matching foundation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AkqT\">Sealy, Inc. brought this suit against Dan-co in August 1982, seeking an injunction against sale of the mixed Sealy-Pacifica bed sets. Pacifica was joined as a defendant in October 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"ald-dedup-1\">Soon after the suit was filed, Pacifica began attaching labels to the top of each non-Sealy matching foundation identifying it as a \u201cQuality Foundation Manufactured by Pacifica Mattress Co.\u201d The label was usually concealed, however, when the foundation was displayed in stores beneath a mattress. After Sealy moved for a preliminary injunction, Pacifica began to attach a second label to the sides of the foundation, and to distribute signs to retailers for display with the Sealy-Pacifica sets. The signs stated: \u201cSleep on two great names in bedding * * * Mattresses by SEA-LY/Foundations by PACIFICA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"al4-dedup-0\">The district court entered &amp; pre]iminary injunction in December 1982, and in April 1983&gt; following a non-jury trial, entered a permanent injunction prohibiting defend-antg from gel]ing foundations covered with ticki gimi]ar or identical t that g , ^ unlegg each foundation wag \u00bf be]]ed Mtl to disclaim association ^ geal and unlegg ora] disclosure was made at the reta\u00fc int.of.sale that the foundation is not of Sealy brand or manufacture.</p>\n<p id=\"AJa5\">district court dismissed defendants counterclaim for lack of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"a2f-dedup-0\">On August 4, 1983, without \u00e1 separate evidentiary hearing, the district court filed its judgment awarding plaintiffs $300,328 in attorney\u2019s fees,</p>\n<p id=\"adl-dedup-1\">TT nrcoTTccTAM 11. DlbOUoolUJN.</p>\n<p id=\"ay_-dedup-0\">a. <em>Evidence of Contributory Infringement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AkRm\">, , . Appellants argue that there was insuffi-cjent evidence of contributory infringement of Sealy&gt;s trademark. We find that substantial evidence supported the district court&gt;s finding of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"AUCa\">A manufacturer may be held liable for contributory trademark infringement even if it does not itself mislabel goods or deceive consumers. The Supreme Court stated in <em>Inwood Laboratories v. Ives Laboratories, </em>456 U.S. 844, 854, 102 S.Ct. 2182, 2188, 72 L.Ed.2d 606 (1982):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1382\">*1382</page-number>[I]f a manufacturer or distributor intentionally induces another to infringe a trademark, <em>or if it continues to supply its product to one whom it knows or has reason to know is engaging in trademark infringement, </em>the manufacturer is contributorily responsible for any harm done as a result of the deceit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8ng\">The determination of contributory infringement thus turns on the defendant\u2019s intent and his knowledge of the wrongful activities of his distributors. <em>Compare In-wood Laboratories, supra, </em>(no liability for manufacturer of generic drug sold in gelatin capsules identical to plaintiffs\u2019 where defendant did not knowingly sell to infringing pharmacists) <em>with Warner &amp; Co. v. Lilly &amp; Co., </em>265 U.S. 526, 530, 44 S.Ct. 615, 617, 68 L.Ed. 1161 (1924) (contributory infringement where defendant\u2019s salesmen suggested to retailers that defendant\u2019s \u201cQuin-Coco\u201d could be sold as plaintiff\u2019s more expensive \u201cCoco-Quinine\u201d). A manufacturer may escape liability if it takes effective measures to prevent infringing uses by its distributors. Callman, <em>Unfair Competition, Trademarks, and Monopolies, </em>\u00a7 22.10 at n. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-4\">The district court found that defendants foresaw and intended that Pacifica foundations would be passed off as Sealy products. The identical ticking and the advertisements offering the Pacifica product as a \u201cmatching foundation\u201d for the Sealy mattress support this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-5\">The district court also found that defendants\u2019 remedial measures were inadequate. This finding is not clearly erroneous. The labels attached to the foundations could not easily be seen. Even if they were noticed, neither they nor the signs belatedly distributed to retailers explicitly denied that the Pacifica foundation was a Sealy product. Even a relatively sophisticated consumer might suppose that the \u201cmatching\u201d Pacifica foundation was made under license from Sealy, Inc. Plaintiff\u2019s witnesses testified at trial that retail salesmen made no attempt to correct their misunderstanding that the Sealy mattress and Pacifica foundation were both made by Sealy. Defendants\u2019 measures did not overcome the misleading impression conveyed by the matching fabric ticking.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-7\">B. <em>Exclusion of Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1446-8\">The district court excluded deposition testimony that would have shown that Sealy had never objected to Ohio-Sealy\u2019s established east-coast practice of selling non-Sealy \u201cpolybox\u201d foundations with matching ticking, similar to Pacifica\u2019s, together with Sealy mattresses. Appellants argue that Sealy\u2019s acquiescence in this practice demonstrates that Sealy did not consider the polybox foundation with matching ticking to be an infringing product.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-9\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by excluding this evidence. Unlike Pacifica\u2019s foundations, the east coast poly-box foundations were manufactured by Ohio-Sealy, a Sealy licensee, over which Sealy might exercise some degree of supervision and control. In any event, whether Sealy, under different circumstances, objected to sale of its mattresses with non-Sealy foundations in east coast markets is ultimately irrelevant to whether Pacifica and Danco intended that Pacifica\u2019s foundations would be passed off as Sealy products.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-10\">C. <em>Exclusion of Tauber Testimony.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1446-11\">The district court refused to allow the testimony of appellants\u2019 expert witness, Prof. Edward Tauber, because appellants had not provided Sealy with the \u201cshort narrative statement of qualifications of the expert and the testimony expected to be elicited at trial,\u201d as required by Central District of California Local Rule 9.4.6 (formerly 9.6.6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-13\">Appellants admit their failure to comply with the rule, but argue that a lesser penalty ought to have been imposed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-14\"> The district court may, in its discretion, exclude expert witnesses not disclosed in pre-trial as required by local rules. <em>Wirtz v. Hooper-Holmes Bureau, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1383\">*1383</page-number><em>Inc., </em>327 F.2d 939 (5th Cir.1964). Appellants offer no justification for non-compliance with the local rule. Failure to give notice of an expert witness\u2019s testimony until immediately before his appearance at trial was clearly prejudicial to opposing counsel. The district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit Tauber\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-5\">D. <em>Rulings on depositions in camera.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1447-6\">Rather than having deposition testimony read orally into the record, the district court required deposition transcripts to be submitted with marginal notations and counter-notations showing testimony to be offered and opposing counsel\u2019s objections. During the course of the trial, the deposition transcripts were returned with the courts\u2019 additional notations showing which objections had been sustained and which overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-7\">Appellants object to this procedure and urge that they are entitled to oral argument on evidentiary rulings. We do not find the district court\u2019s procedure was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-8\">Apart from general allegations that the procedure \u201cimpermissibly encumbered\u201d the defense, appellants have shown no way in which their trial presentation would have differed if they had known in advance the evidentiary rulings. Moreover, except for evidence concerning east coast distribution of Ohio-Sealy polybox foundations, discussed in section II B above, appellants point to no deposition evidence that they claim was erroneously excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-9\">Appellants have shown no prejudice to them from the district court\u2019s procedure. The district court\u2019s <em>in camera </em>review of written deposition testimony reduced the time required for trial, and was not an abuse of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-10\">E. <em>Did the district court\u2019s conduct prejudice appellant?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1447-11\">Appellants argue that the district judge displayed hostility and bias against them. Having reviewed the entire trial transcript, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-12\">The district judge showed no bias from any extrajudicial source. <em>United States v. Grinell Corp., </em>384 U.S. 563, 583, 86 S.Ct. 1698, 1710, 16 L.Ed.2d 778 (1966); <em>United States v. Azhocar, </em>581 F.2d 735 (9th Cir.1978) <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 907, 99 S.Ct. 1213, 59 L.Ed.2d 454 (1979). His questions and comments, which appellants attempt to characterize as prejudice, merely demonstrated familiarity with the trial briefs and deposition testimony. The trial judge cannot, and should not, erase from his mind all knowledge of the case before trial begins, and he need not passively refrain from interfering in the trial of matters before him.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1447-13\">It is the right and duty of the Federal trial judge to facilitate, by direct participation, the orderly progress of a trial. Queries by the judge which aid in clarifying the testimony of witnesses, expedite the examination or confine it to relevant matters in order to arrive at the ultimate truth, are eminently proper so long as the authority is exercised in a non-prejudicial manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1447-14\"><em>Richmond v. Weiner, </em>353 F.2d 41, 49 (9th Cir.1965), quoting <em>Ochoa v. United States, </em>167 F.2d 341, 344 (9th Cir.1948). The district judge\u2019s actions were properly within his discretion. Though he made no secret of his skepticism of appellants\u2019 position, appellants were permitted to respond to the district court\u2019s expressed concerns to the best of their ability. There is no ground for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-15\">F. <em>This action was not required to be a compulsory counterclaim in another case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1447-16\">The district court denied appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss on the ground that this case should have been filed as a compulsory counterclaim in an antitrust action brought by Pacifica and Ohio-Sealy against Sealy, Inc. in the Northern District of Illinois. We affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-17\">A compulsory counterclaim is one arising from the \u201csame transaction or occurrence\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1384\">*1384</page-number>as the original claim. F.R.Civ.P. 13(a). Here, the Illinois action challenges Sealy Inc.\u2019s refusal to license Pacifica to manufacture Sealy-brand products. The present case, on the other hand, concerns the imitation-Sealy products manufactured and sold by Pacifica despite that refusal. The cases involve completely different factual and legal issues, and arise from different transactions or occurrences. <em>See Kuster Laboratories v. Lee, </em>10 F.R.D. 350, 351 (N.D.Cal.1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-4\">G. <em>Dismissal of Danco\u2019s counterclaim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1448-5\">The district court dismissed a counterclaim filed by Danco alone, before Pacifica was made a defendant in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-6\">Danco\u2019s counterclaim recited a long history of acts by which Sealy Inc. had allegedly attempted to restrain Ohio-Sealy and its subsidiaries, including Pacifica, from competing freely with other Sealy licensees. It claims that these acts, including the present trademark infringement action, violate federal antitrust laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-7\">The counterclaim was properly dismissed for lack of standing. The conspiracy alleged in that pleading was aimed at Ohio-Sealy and Pacifica, not Danco itself. As a sales representative for Pacifica, Danco\u2019s alleged injury is not sufficiently direct to confer antitrust standing. <em>See Assoc. Gen. Contractors of Cal. v. Cal. St. Council, </em>459 U.S. 519, 103 S.Ct. 897, 74 L.Ed.2d 723 (1983); <em>Solinger v. A &amp; M Records, Inc., </em>586 F.2d 1304, 1311-12, n. 8 (9th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied </em>441 U.S. 908, 99 S.Ct. 1999, 60 L.Ed.2d 377 (1979) (employee has no standing to sue for antitrust injury to employer); <em>Calderone Enterprises Corp. v. United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc., </em>454 F.2d 1292, 1295 (2nd Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied </em>406 U.S. 930, 92 S.Ct. 1776, 32 L.Ed.2d 132 (1972) (landlord lacks standing to sue for antitrust injury to his tenant). The sole action taken by Sealy Inc. directly against Danco \u2014 this lawsuit \u2014 does not form the basis for antitrust liability. <em>See California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, </em>404 U.S. 508, 92 S.Ct. 609, 30 L.Ed.2d 642 (1972) (use of courts not a basis for antitrust liability without evidence that litigation is a sham or for purpose of harassment). <em>See also Coca-Cola v. Overland, Inc., </em>692 F.2d 1250, 1257 n. 17 (9th Cir.1982) (no authority for holding meritorious lawsuits to be \u201csham\u201d litigation viola-tive of antitrust laws).</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-9\">H. <em>A ttorneys </em>\u2019 <em>Fees.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1448-10\">Finally, appellants challenge the district court\u2019s award of $300,328 in attorneys\u2019 fees to Sealy. Since we find the record before us to be inadequate to permit review, we remand to the district court to make further findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-11\">Award of attorneys\u2019 fees is in the discretion of the district court, and we will not disturb an award unless the district court has abused its discretion. <em>Sapper v. Lenco Blade, Inc., </em>704 F.2d 1069 (9th Cir.1983); <em>Playboy Enterprises v. Baccarat Clothing Co., Inc., </em>692 F.2d 1272 (9th Cir.1982); <em>Kerr v. Screen Extras Guild, Inc., </em>526 F.2d 67 (9th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied </em>425 U.S. 951, 96 S.Ct. 1726, 48 L.Ed.2d 195 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-12\">Under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees may be awarded \u201cin exceptional [trademark] cases.\u201d A trademark case is exceptional for purposes of an award of attorneys\u2019 fees where the infringement is malicious, fraudulent, deliberate or wilful. <em>Playboy Enterprises v. Baccarat Clothing Co. Inc., </em>692 F.2d 1272, 1276 (9th Cir.1982). <em>See </em>Senate Report No. 93-1400, 93rd Congress, Second Session (1974), reprinted in 1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 7132.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-13\">The district court found that appellants\u2019 conduct constituted \u201cwilful and deliberate, bad faith infringement of Sealy\u2019s trademarks that was intended to and in fact did result in deception of the public.\u201d We conclude that this finding is supported by the record in this case. There was substantial evidence tending to show that appellants manufactured and sold their look-alike foundations deliberately to deceive consumers and to take advantage of Sealy\u2019s brand identification. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1385\">*1385</page-number>court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-4\">The amount of the award, however, is troubling. The district court\u2019s award, $300,328, is extraordinarily high and, although a proper record might support sucfy an award in this case, the record before us does not permit adequate review of the factors upon which the district court based its decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1449-5\">The district court appears to have accepted uncritically plaintiff\u2019s representations concerning the time expended on this case, and it awarded the entire amount requested by plaintiff. Such a procedure is inadequate. Though plaintiff\u2019s counsel submitted voluminous records to show that over 2,515.5 hours had actually been spent on this case, there is no showing that the time actually spent was reasonably necessary. \u201cCounsel for the prevailing party should make a good faith effort to exclude from a fee request hours that are excessive, redundant, or otherwise unneces-r sary.\u201d <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1939-1940, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). No such effort appears to have been made here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1449-6\">The district court\u2019s finding that the services rendered and the hours spent by plaintiffs counsel were \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d is conclusory and unsupported by any analysis of the time records actually presented in this case. Though a more detailed review of plaintiff\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fee request may support this claim, the present record does not permit adequate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-7\">Moreover, the district court presented no basis for its finding that the rates charged by plaintiff\u2019s counsel were reasonable. No effort appears to have been made to examine the \u201ccustomary fee\u201d prevailing in the community. <em>Kerr v. Screen Extras Guild, Inc., </em>526 F.2d 67, 70 (9th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 951, 96 S.Ct. 1726, 48 L.Ed.2d 195 (1976). Though the fee actually charged to the client may be an important factor, \u201cwhether or not [the client] agreed to pay a fee and in what amount is not decisive. * * * The criterion for the court is not what the parties agreed but what is reasonable\u201d <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., </em>488 F.2d 714, 718 (5th Cir.1974), quoting <em>Clark v. American Marine Corp., </em>320 F.Supp. 709 (E.D.La.1970), <em>affirmed </em>437 F.2d 959 (5th Cir.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-13\">We remand to the district court to permit it to conduct a more thorough and detailed inquiry concerning application to this fee request of the twelve factors listed in <em>Kerr, </em>particularly with respect to the number of hours reasonably expended by attorneys for Sealy Inc. and the prevailing fees for work of similar nature and quality in the area. We express no opinion as to the proper amount of the ultimate fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-14\">III. CONCLUSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-15\">The judgment of the district court granting a permanent injunction is AFFIRMED; the award of attorneys\u2019 fees is REVERSED AND REMANDED for further findings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1444-16\">.
