The question presented is whether services she performed as a speech therapist for a county hospital, wholly unrelated to her order, come within the exception to the definition of \u201cemployment\u201d for FICA tax purposes (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3121(b)(8)(A)), since she was directed by the order to accept the hospital\u2019s offer of employment and to perform the services after she had been appointed by the hospital. Trial Judge White ruled that the earnings were taxable, granted the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and dismissed the complaint. We have added a discussion of two matters which were not considered by him, and with these additions, we agree with his analysis and <em>affirm </em>the decision of the Claims Court on the basis of his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">1. Trial Judge White\u2019s construction of the applicable statutes and regulations is consistent with the position of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue as set forth in a number of revenue rulings which were not referred to in the trial judge\u2019s opinion. The general rule derived from these rulings is that where a member of a religious order enters into an employment relationship with a third party who is unrelated to the order, but who looks to the member rather than to the order for the performance of the duties, the member\u2019s earnings are subject to FICA taxation, even though the order directed the member to apply for the position and to perform the duties thereof. <em>See, e.g., </em>Rev.Rul. 84-13, 1984-4 Int.Rev.Bull. 5 (member\u2019s private practice as a psychologist); Rev.Rul. 83-127,1983-2 Cum.Bull. 25 (member employed as a teacher in a secular private school); Rev.Rul. 81-267, 1981-2 Cum.Bull. 196 (member employed by a private hospital not associated with the order\u2019s church); Rev.Rul. 79-132, 1979-1 Cum.Bull. 62 (member serving as an Army chaplain); Rev.Rul. 78-229, 1978-1 Cum.Bull. 305 (minister performing non-religious services for a manufacturing company); Rev.Rul. 76-323, 1976-2, Cum.Bull. 18 (members employed as a plumber and as a construction worker).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-14\">We are aware of revenue rulings dealing with different factual patterns, including situations where the services of members were performed when the member was acting as agent of the religious order or for another agency of the church or an associated institution. <em>See e.g. </em>Rev.Rul. 56-187, 1956-1 Cum.Bull. 483 (ordained minister serving as executive or administrative officer of a federation of churches); Rev.Rul. 68-123, 1968 Cum.Bull. 35 (nurse assigned as agent of religious order to perform duties for a hospital where she was under the supervision and control of the order at all times); Rev.Rul. 77-290, 1977-2 Cum. Bull. 26 (experienced secretary assigned to perform duties as the business officer of a church). Although taxpayer claims that Rev.Rul. 68-123 is inconsistent with the rulings holding that a member\u2019s employment by a third party, not associated with a church order, is subject to FICA taxation, we find this ruling is clearly distinguishable on its facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-15\">2. On appeal, taxpayer argues that taxation of her income from the hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>amounts to double taxation. Her order had elected to provide social security coverage for its members in accordance with 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3121(r)(l) and was making FICA payments on her behalf based on the fair market value of maintenance and benefits the order provided for her. She maintains, therefore, that the only lawful way she could be taxed for FICA purposes was through the payments made by her order under section 3121(r). We disagree. We think Trial Judge White correctly held that taxpayer\u2019s employment by the hospital was not covered by the exception of section 3121(b)(8)(A) of the Code, because her day-to-day activities were under the control and supervision of the hospital. By enacting the Social Security Amendments of 1972, Pub.L. 92-603 (86 Stat. 1329), Congress authorized religious orders to elect social security coverage for their members by filing an irrevocable certificate for that purpose. The legislative history of the 1972 amendments shows that Congress intended to limit the new coverage to the types of service excluded by section 2131(b)(8)(A) and to extend the new benefits to services rendered by members as employees of the order or for an autonomous subdivision of the order. H.R.Rep. No. 231, 92d Cong., 1st Sess., U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1972, pp. 4989, 5045, 5046, 5268 (1972-2 Cum.Bull. 739), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-4\">Under present law, the services performed by a member of a religious order who has taken a vow of poverty <em>which are in the exercise of the duties required by the order </em>are excluded from coverage under social security. Your committee\u2019s bill provides that such service <em>would be covered under social security as employment for the order </em>(or for an autonomous subdivision of the order) if the order (or subdivision) irrevocably elects coverage for its entire active membership, and if the order also makes an irrevocable election to cover its lay employees. (Emphasis supplied.) [742]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ahj-dedup-0\">Section 129(b) of the bill amends section 3121 of the Code by adding a new subsection (r). The new section 3121(r)(l) provides that a religious order whose members are required to take a vow of poverty, or any autonomous subdivision of such an order, may file a certificate with the Internal Revenue Service electing to extend social security coverage to the services performed by its members in the exercise of the duties required by such order or subdivision. The certificate of election by the religious order or autonomous subdivision must specify that the election of coverage will be irrevocable; that the coverage will apply to all current and future members of the order or subdivision; <em>that all services performed by a member of the order or subdivision in the exercise of duties required by the order or subdivision will be deemed to have been performed as an employee of the order or subdivision; </em>and that the religious order or subdivision will pay the tax on employees imposed by section 3101 of the Code and the tax imposed on employers by section 3111 of the Code, with respect to the wages of each active member. (Emphasis supplied.) [748-49]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">In accordance with the legislative history, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3121(r)(l)(C) provides that all services performed by a member of the order (covered by the election) in the exercise of duties required by the order shall be deemed to have been performed as an employee of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">The emphasis in the legislative history and in the language of the 1972 amendments is on the employment relationship between the order and its members. Although the members are not \u201cemployees\u201d of the order, Congress, as taxpayer suggests, has created a legal fiction by providing that they shall be deemed employees when performing duties required by the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">We agree with the government that the two FICA coverages are for two different purposes, much the same as when an individual holds more than one job. As indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>cated above, the purpose of the 1972 amendments was to authorize religious orders to elect social security coverage for their members who perform duties directly for the order or for an associated institution under circumstances which normally create an employer-employee relationship. <em>, </em>j ,, , ,, . We are not persuaded that there is anything in the legislative history or in the 1972 amendments which requires a holding that the section 3121(r) coverage for duties performed for the order and the separate coverage for work done by members while employees of a third party are mutually exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"app-dedup-0\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b949-11\">. Reported at 4 Cl.Ct. 325 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"auy-dedup-2\">FRIEDMAN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AMi\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"a9e-dedup-0\">I conclude that under the governing provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (Code) and the implementing Treasury Regulations, Sister Mary was not subject to Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) taxes on the salary she received from the St. Louis County Hospital (Hospital) for working there as a speech therapist, as her religious order (the Order) directed her to do.</p>\n<p id=\"ake-dedup-2\">The Code subjects to FICA (Social Security) taxes earnings paid \u201cwith respect to employment. I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3101, 3111 (1982). Employment is defined in pertinent part as any service, of whatever nature, performed .. by an employee for the person 812i(b)\\ ?CtWn 3121(b)(8)(A) excludes from the definition of employment \u201cservice performed ... by a member of a religious order in the exercise of duties required by such order ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A3H\">The parties conceded that before accepting the position as speech therapist with the Hospital, Sister Mary (1) was directed by her Order to apply for the position and (2) after being offered the position, was directed by her Order to accept it. The United States also concedes that there is no legally significant difference between the terms \u201cdirected\u201d and \u201crequired.\u201d Under the foregoing Code provisions, the relationship between Sister Mary and the Hospital was not one of employment for FICA purposes, since it involved service that Sister Mary was \u201crequired\u201d by her Order to perform. On the face of the Code, therefore, Sister Mary was not subject to FICA taxes upon the salary she received for perform-jng those services.</p>\n<p id=\"AtsR\">The court holds, however, that the Code . , \u2019 . t d\u00b0eS.not mean yhat says It interprets dutles ^ such order to mean duties the 0rder ha\u00ae the Power to eomPel *he member to Perform' As the Claims Court pointed out.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aog-dedup-0\">from the standpoint of reality, the Order could not <em>require </em>or <em>direct </em>the plaintiff to Per^orm the duties of the civil service position of Speech Therapist ... for the [Hospital]----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"afg-dedup-0\">----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"al3-dedup-0\">In essence, the Order\u2019s role was to grant (or deny) authorizations to the plaintiff with respect to her desire to participate in the county\u2019s appointing process. The Order could not \u2014 and did not \u2014 issue any mandatory requirement or directive controlling the appointing process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AedD\"><em>Samson v. United States, </em>4 Cl.Ct. 325, 329 (1984) (emphasis in original),</p>\n<p id=\"aga-dedup-0\">In effect, the court holds that for servic_ es performed by a member of a religious 0rder to be exempt from FICA taxes&gt; the relationship between the 0rder and its member with ect to the serv\u00a1ces must be that of employer and employee.</p>\n<p id=\"aay-dedup-0\">There are two answers to this theory, First, that is not what the statute says. It uses the unambiguous phrase \u201crequired by order/\u2019 If the 0rder reTres a mem' ber to P\u00aerffm P^ticukr service, as Sister Maryg 0rder re1ulred her to do m this ease\u2019 the Code exemPts the wa^es Paid for such service from FICA taxes because such servic\u00ae is not c\u2122sidered to be \u201cemploy-merd'</p>\n<p id=\"ahoa-dedup-0\">Second, and equally compelling, is the statement in the Treasury Department Regulation implementing this provision which, after stating that \u201c[sjervice performed by a member of a religious order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>... includes all duties required of the member by the order,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-4\">The nature or extent of such service is immaterial so long as it is a service which he is directed or required to perform by his ecclesiastical superiors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXTZ\">Treas.Reg. \u00a7 31.3121(b)(8)-l(d) (West 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Thus, under the governing regulation the \u201cnature or extent\u201d of the member\u2019s service is \u201cimmaterial.\u201d It is immaterial whether the member performs the service for the Order or for an outside agency, as in this case. The sole issue is whether \u201cit is service which he is directed or required to perform by his ecclesiastical superiors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">If, as the court holds, the critical inquiry in such a case is whether the service was performed as part of employment by the Order or by an outside entity, one would think that the regulation would have explicitly so stated, as it easily could have done. If that had been the standard the Treasury Department intended, it certainly would not have said that \u201c[t]he nature ... of such service is immaterial\u201d in determining whether it constitutes employment subject to FICA taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">Section 3121(b)(8)(A) was added to the Code by the Social Security Act Amendments of 1950, ch. 809, 64 Stat. 477. Most of the legislative history of that provision merely tracks the statutory language, and thus provides no aid in interpreting the language. Even the one item that appears to provide some support for the government\u2019s position (upon which the government, but not the court, relies), does not justify the court\u2019s interpretation of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">Both committee reports stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-9\">The exception contained in subparagraph (A) applies to the performance of services which are ordinarily the duties of ... members of religious orders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">S.Rep. No. 1669, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 138, <em>reprinted in </em>1950-2 C.B. 302, 342; <em>see </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1300, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 130 (1949), <em>reprinted in </em>1950-2 C.B. 255, 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-11\">The government has not shown, however, that in 1950 the performance of services for entities outside the Order, such as those Sister Mary was required to perform in this case, was not \u201cordinarily the duties of ... members of religious orders.\u201d Without such a showing this single sentence from the committee reports is too slim a reed upon which to build an exemption from what I view as the unambiguous language of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-12\">The court cites a number of revenue rulings from which it derives the \u201cgeneral rule ... that where a member of a religious order enters into an employment relationship with a third party who is unrelated to the order, but who looks to the member rather than to the order for the performance of the duties, the member\u2019s earnings are subject to FICA taxation, even though the order directed the member to apply for the position and to perform the duties thereof.\u201d These revenue rulings do not establish this \u201cgeneral rule.\u201d The first revenue ruling to deal with the specific statute involved in this case announced the following principle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-13\">In order for the employment of a member of a religious order to constitute the exercise of duties required by such order within the meaning of the Employment Tax Regulations, the services must be of the type that are ordinarily the duties of the order and must be performed by the member as part of the duties for and on behalf of the religious order as its agent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Am-v\">Rev.Rul. 76-323, 1976-2 C.B. 18, 19; <em>accord </em>Rev.Rul. 81-267, 1981-2 C.B. 196; Rev.Rul. 79-132, 1979-1 C.B. 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-14\">One of those revenue rulings stated that \u201c[ojrdinarily, a member is performing services as the agent of the religious order only if the order is engaged in the performance of the services as a principle. Ordinarily an order is not engaged in the performance of services as a principal where the legal relationship of employer and employee exists between the member and the third party with respect to the performance of such services.\u201d That ruling involved the services of a plumber and a construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>worker, one of whom lived outside the religious order and paid for his housing out of his earnings before turning the remainder over to the order. The ruling itself suggested that the result might be different in a case involving a nurse and a hospital. <em>See </em>1976-2 C.B. at 19 (discussing Rev.Rul. 68-123, 1968-1 C.B. 35).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">The latter revenue ruling, which the court says \u201cis clearly distinguishable on its facts,\u201d held that a nurse who was a member of a religious order was not subject to income tax on the salary she received for nursing services which the order directed her to perform at a hospital. Rev.Rul. 68-123, 1968-1 C.B. 35. Although a subsequent ruling distinguished Rev.Rul. 68-123 on the ground that the nurse was under the supervision and control of the Order in performing the services, Rev.Rul. 83-127, 1983-2 C.B. 25, there is nothing in Rev.Rul. 68-123 to indicate that that was the basis of the ruling. Rev.Rul. 68-123 does not even mention whether the hospital was religious or secular.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">The fact that the Commissioner has taken inconsistent positions in his rulings weakens their persuasiveness. <em>St. Louis Bank for Cooperatives v. United States, </em>624 F.2d 1041, 1051 (Ct.Cl.1980); <em>see Morton v. Ruiz, </em>415 U.S. 199, 237, 94 S.Ct. 1055, 1075, 39 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974). In any event, since these administrative interpretations are inconsistent with the statutory language, they are entitled to little weight. <em>Securities and Exchange Commission v. Sloan, </em>436 U.S. 103, 117-19, 98 S.Ct. 1702, 1711-12, 56 L.Ed.2d 148 (1978); <em>see United States v. Vogel Fertilizer Co., </em>455 U.S. 16, 102 S.Ct. 821, 70 L.Ed.2d 792 (1982). Furthermore, the revenue rulings fail to explain convincingly why the Commissioner read additional requirements (such as ordinary service and agency) into the clear statutory language, a failure that still further weakens any deference due those decisions. <em>St. Louis Bank, </em>624 F.2d at 1051 (citing <em>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 164, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944)).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">It may well be that, as a matter of policy, the salary Sister Mary received in this case should be subject to FICA taxes. Congress, however, has not so subjected them. I do not think it is appropriate for the court to extend the statute beyond what Congress provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">If Congress wishes to change the law to achieve the result the court reaches, it may do so. The Commissioner could amend his regulations to provide explicitly that service by a member of an Order is employment only if the member is subject to the control of the Order in performing the services. As the statute and the regulations now read, however, I see no basis for subjecting Sister Mary\u2019s earnings from the Hospital to FICA taxes.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
