Stephen Menzies, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his habeas corpus petition challenging his state conviction for aggravated rape and thirty-year prison sentence. The issue on appeal is whether Petitioner received a fair trial within the meaning of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"A18\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ake-dedup-1\">In April, 1975, Petitioner was tried before a jury in the 177th District Court of Harris County, Texas, for the alleged offense of aggravated rape. The state\u2019s case was based almost entirely on the testimony of the complainant, a cocktail waitress, who f ege$ that Petitioner, a customer of the bar where she worked, forced her into his automobile at approximately 3:30 a.m. on A drove her to another loca- , \u2022 ,, , , , . , , tion, then raped her, releasing her near her home approximately three hours later.</p>\n<p id=\"A7q\">Petitioner, who was represented by retained counsel at trial, maintained that he had merely given the complainant a ride home at her request, after which he stopped at a restaurant for a cup of coffee and then went home, arriving there before 4:00 a.m. Petitioner also testified that following this incident the complainant and an unidentified male had telephoned him and attempted to extort money from him by threatening to file a spurious charge of rape against him. The jury returned a verdict of guilty and assessed a thirty-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"ASN\">The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed this conviction and sentence in November, 1978, in an unpublished opinion. Petitioner then ffled a <em>pr0 se </em>federal habe. as corpus application in tbe Southern Dis. trict of TexaSj al]eging in substance the same claim made by his court-appointed appellate attorney before the Court of Criminal Appeals \u2014 that is, that the accusation by a defense witness during his trial that his trial counsel had suborned perjury created a \u201cconflict of interest\u201d invalidating his conviction. That application was denied *n November, 1979, as was a certificate of probable cause to appeal,</p>\n<p id=\"aq-dedup-0\">Petitioner then retained counsel, who applied both to this Court and to the Supreme Court of the United States for a certificate of probable cause based upon reformulated constitutional claims arising from essentially the same operative facts. Both this Court and the Supreme Court of the United States denied the certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"Avv\">Petitioner\u2019s counsel then filed a state post-conviction application for the writ of habeas corpus in the court of conviction in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>March, 1981, alleging the factual and legal grounds for relief asserted in this appeal. The state post-conviction application was forwarded by the trial court to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas in May, 1981, and the Court thereafter denied relief without written opinion in September, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Having thus exhausted state remedies, Petitioner\u2019s counsel filed the present federal habeas corpus proceeding in the Southern District of Texas in October, 1981. It was denied on the merits without a hearing in May, 1983, after the Court denied the state\u2019s motion to dismiss the proceedings for alleged abuse of the writ of habeas corpus. We granted a certificate of probable cause and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\n<em>The Alleged Intimidation of the Complainant Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">During the prosecution\u2019s direct examination of the complainant the following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">Q. (By Mr. Graham) [counsel for the state] Miss Stone, in the the middle part of July \u2014 excuse me. In the latter part of November, 1974, did you have an occasion to come in contact with certain people who harmed you physically that was related to this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-9\">MR. MOORE: [counsel for the Defendant] Same objection on the grounds that it's not material to any issue of this lawsuit. It is involving an extraneous offense which is obviously not connected with my client and I object to it on those grounds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-10\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-11\">Q. (By Mr. Graham) \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo.\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-12\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-13\">Q. Will you describe to the jury how that occurred, just what you saw and what was done to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-14\">A. Well, I had gone out, it was around noon, to get the mail, and there was no one. I mean, I didn\u2019t notice anyone around the house. I was in the house five minutes and the doorbell rang. When I opened the door, there were three men at the door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-15\">MR. MOORE: We\u2019ll renew our objection as to any of this line of testimony as some sort of extraneous offense not involving the defendant and not connected or material to any issue of the crime charged and as prejudicial and inflammatory and suggestive as to any involvement or proposed involvement of my client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-16\">MR. GRAHAM: It is material and we would show it in just a few more questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-17\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-18\">MR. MOORE: Note our exception, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-19\">THE COURT: Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-20\">Q. (By Mr. Graham) What did the three men do to you, if anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-21\">A. Two of them pinned me to the wall. The third one took a cigarette lighter to my arm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-22\">Q. What did he do to your arm?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-23\">A. Burned it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-24\">Q. And did they say why they were doing that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-25\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-26\">Q. And what was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-27\">MR, MOORE: Object to the hearsay, the extraneous offense on collateral matters not material to any issue, Your Honor, and this is some other alleged offense that took place in Harris County involving three unknown mysterious men and we have a matter of law that I would like to take up with the Court at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-28\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-29\">MR. MOORE: Note our exception. We have a motion we would like to take up with you at this time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-30\">The record reveals that at this point, the Court sent the jury out of the courtroom and then threatened to hold the Petitioner\u2019s attorney, Mr. Moore, in contempt. Petitioner\u2019s attorney then moved for a mistrial. Without responding to the motion, the Court ordered the jury back in:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-31\">MR. MOORE: At this time the defendant would move for a mistrial in the presence of the jury since we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>not been allowed to make one in the absence of the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-4\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">MR. MOORE: Note our exception. We would next ask while still insisting on a motion for mistrial be made in the absence of the jury which we had to make in the presence of the jury that the Court instruct the jury to disregard the line of questioning which he elicited involving extraneous offenses involving three mysterious unnamed strangers at a time in November \u2014 November 18, far apart from the date of the alleged offense which is not material or admissible and had nothing to do with the facts of the crime charged and it\u2019s prejudicial and inflammatory to the defense in the trial of the case of aggravated rape on or about August 17, 1974.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">MR. MOORE: Note our exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">THE COURT: Go ahead, Mr. Graham.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-9\">Q. (By Mr. Graham) All right. These three people came into your home and pinned you to the wall and burned you with a cigarette. Did they say anything while this was going on, did they tell you why they were doing this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-10\">MR. MOORE: This is rank hearsay as to something stated out of the presence\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-11\">THE COURT: Overruled. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-13\">Q. (By Mr. Graham) Will you tell us what they said while they were doing this to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-14\">A. They stated that to go down and drop charges against Steve Menzies, and if I didn\u2019t, something else would happen to me, and continue to happen to me, and not only me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-15\">Q. And do you still have scars from that burning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-16\">A. Yes, sir, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-17\">Q. Will you walk over here and demonstrate to the jury those scars? Show them the scars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-18\">MR. MOORE: This is highly prejudicial to the defendant. If somebody did burn this person at any time, it wouldn\u2019t be admissible as to my client for the offense which he\u2019s on trial today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-19\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-20\">MR. MOORE: Note our exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-O\">Q. (By Mr. Graham) Would you step over here, please, ma\u2019am. I'll ask you to show the jury where it happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahcb\">A. Right here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-21\">Q. Would you point to the jury where it is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-22\">A. The mark here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-23\">Q. Could you walk out here and just hold you hand out so they can see? A. (Witness complying).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-24\">MR. MOORE: We will renew our objection to this person showing her scar as not being material to any issue and also that it\u2019s highly prejudicial, suggestive of another offense and we would object to it on those grounds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-25\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-26\">MR. MOORE: Note our exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ar-dedup-0\">Q. (By Mr. Graham) And are you at this time afraid for your life?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-27\">A. Yes, I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-28\">Q. And have you moved to a different residence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-29\">A. Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-30\">Q. You don\u2019t have to tell us where.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-31\">THE COURT: Don\u2019t say where it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aln-dedup-0\">Q. (By Mr. Graham) Did you meet the defendant the next day like you told him you would?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-32\">A. No, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-33\">MR. GRAHAM: I pass the witness, Your Honor. (R. 288-304; emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-34\">Thereafter the prosecution in its closing argument to the jury made the following allegations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-35\">\u201cI think you can see a pattern, Ladies and Gentlemen. In this case, from the very beginning, even back when Linda Bivin was raped, of a defendant and his attorney setting up an alibi, having witnesses testify to certain things, <em>threat</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number><em>ening witnesses. </em>There\u2019s a pattern throughout this whole episode with this defendant and the evidence that you heard, I think, shows you that. Now, Sylvia Aiken down to Deborah Stone being threatened, down to Linda Bivin and the call about the alibi, he picks on women, picks on women in bars specifically hoping they will be too embarrassed to file charges because they were in a bar. <em>Then he frightens them into dropping the charges. </em>We don\u2019t know what he\u2019s done on other dates, Ladies and Gentlemen. All you know is what\u2019s in evidence and that\u2019s all you can consider. But it\u2019s certainly in those instances we\u2019ve been able to bring to you, it certainly shows a specific scheme and design of taking women, after raping them, <em>and scaring them into dropping charges.\" </em>(R. 772-73; emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The only evidence which possibly linked Petitioner with the alleged attack by the three unidentified men was the complainant\u2019s testimony that the Petitioner had threatened her on a prior occasion. Respondent has argued that this testimony by the complainant constituted circumstantial evidence of Petitioner\u2019s link with the alleged extraneous offense and that the complainant\u2019s subsequent testimony as to the alleged attack by the three unidentified men was properly bootstrapped into admissibility. We agree with the Court below which, in denying Petitioner\u2019s application for a writ, conceded that \u201c[tjhere was no evidence presented at trial that linked petitioner with the alleged attack.\u201d (Tr. 12) That the jury was allowed to consider the testimony concerning the alleged extraneous offense and that, in summation, the prosecutor was allowed to argue it and implicate the Petitioner, strongly supports the Petitioner\u2019s claim that he received a constitutionally unfair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Although this episode in itself, even when coupled with the prosecutor\u2019s improper closing argument, probably could not be considered \u201ca crucial, critical, highly significant factor in the jury\u2019s determination of guilt,\u201d <em>Whittington v. Estelle, </em>704 F.2d 1418, 1422 (5th Cir.1983), and therefore would not justify, federal habeas relief, it did serve as an important backdrop for a second occurrence which effectively foreclosed any remaining chance that Petitioner may have had of receiving a constitutionally fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">\n<em>The Alleged Subornation of Perjury by Defense Counsel Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">To support Petitioner\u2019s version of the events, the defense called one of his former employees who testified on direct examination that she had seen Petitioner in the restaurant drinking coffee at 3:30 a.m. on the morning in question. On cross-examination, however, the following transpired in the presence of the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-10\">Questioning by Mr. Graham:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-11\">Q. Have you been told what to say in this case? \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-12\">A. I really don\u2019t want to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-13\">Q. Well, are you afraid?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-14\">THE COURT: You have to answer the question. Go ahead and answer the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-15\">THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-16\">Q. (By Mr. Graham) You have been told what to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-17\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-18\">Q. Did they tell you to come here and say that Steve Menzies was in Denny\u2019s Restaurant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-19\">A. I don\u2019t feel very good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-20\">Q. I beg your pardon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-21\">A. I don\u2019t feel very good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-22\">Q. I can understand that, ma\u2019am. I have to have an answer to that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-23\">Did they tell you to come in here and say that Steve Menzies was in Denny\u2019s Restaurant at 3:30 in the morning on August 17?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-24\">A. I really don\u2019t feel very good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-25\">Q. Can you answer that \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-26\">A. (No response).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-27\">Q. Are you afraid at this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-28\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Q. Are you afraid of what might happen to you if you answer that question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-4\">A. I just don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">Q. Are you afraid of this defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">Q. Are you afraid of anybody that works for this defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-8\">A. (No response).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-9\">Q. What are you afraid of?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-10\">A. Right now, I\u2019m just very much afraid of everything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-11\">Q. Well, you\u2019re under oath to tell the truth. If you tell the truth, there\u2019s nothing that can be done to you, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-12\">A. Okay. Okay. I forgot what you were asking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-13\">Q. Did they tell you to come in here and say that you were in Denny\u2019s at 3:30?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-14\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-15\">Q. And did they come in here and tell you to say that you saw the Defendant in Denny\u2019s, did they tell you to come in here and say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-16\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-17\">Q. And did you really see the defendant in Denny\u2019s at 3:30?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-18\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-19\">Q. And who was it that told you to say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-20\">A. I really don\u2019t feel very good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-21\">Q. Ma\u2019am, you will be afforded protection, but we need to know the answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-22\">A. I\u2019m sorry. I forgot what you asked me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-23\">Q. Who was [it] that told you to come in here and tell this jury you saw the defendant in Denny\u2019s?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-24\">A. Well, several people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-25\">Q. Who?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-26\">THE COURT: You may answer it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-27\">THE WITNESS: Well, everybody that was involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-28\">Q. (By Mr. Graham) All right. And who would that include?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-29\">A. Will they get in trouble?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-30\">Q. That doesn\u2019t concern you, ma\u2019am. That\u2019s for someone else to decide. Your only job is to tell the truth while you\u2019re under oath on the witness stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-32\">A. Golly! Golly! Just everybody that was involved in it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-33\">Q. Does that include the defendant\u2019s family, the defendant\u2019s lawyers; who does it include?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-34\">A. Well, I can\u2019t really say that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-35\">MR. MOORE: Your Honor, could I have this witness on voire dire. This is a serious accusation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-36\">THE COURT: No, sir. Go ahead. You may answer the question. Don\u2019t worry. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-37\">THE WITNESS: Well, to begin with, I really can\u2019t say <em>that </em>\u2014 I <em>really can\u2019t say that Steve is responsible for it now, </em>because, you know, he hasn\u2019t been around for a long time. He\u2019s been gone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-38\">Q. (By Mr. Graham) Responsible for what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-39\">A. For me saying this and honest to God, what I\u2019m saying is the truth, and I really can\u2019t remember if he asked me \u2014 I swear to God, I just can\u2019t remember if he did. I remember that he did approach me. That was the truth when I worked for him, and he did tell me the situation he was in, and he was concerned about it. But I can\u2019t remember if he did ask me to do this or not. I swear to God, my mind is blank. I can\u2019t remember because it\u2019s been a long time ago since I talked with Steve. This was before he went, you know, before he left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-40\">But then his wife knew about it, and she wanted me to because she was very concerned about their little girl and Steve, and she, you know, <em>and Mr. Moore knew about it, </em>and then his lawyer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-41\">Q. Is that the man that just stood up over there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-42\">A. And that\u2019s all. Everybody that was involved, and Mark knows my fiance and me \u2014 knew about it. He was aware of it. They knew I wasn\u2019t in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Denny\u2019s, and that\u2019s all that I can remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">Q. And was there threats made to you if you did not testify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">A. Well, no, exactly, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">Q. Was there money offered?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">A. No, sir. I was not paid any money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-9\">Q. And were you afraid not to testify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-10\">A. Well, I guess I was afraid to do it. As it all came down to it, I was \u2014 I was just afraid both ways. (R. 573-78; emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">On cross-examination Petitioner\u2019s attorney attempted unsuccessfully to refute the accusation that he knew of or participated in the alleged efforts to suborn perjury by showing the witness written statements she had signed under oath, attesting to her having seen Petitioner on the occasion in question. The following transpired in the presence of the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-12\">Q. (By Mr. Moore) Sylvia, think very carefully. Have I ever at any time suggested what your testimony should be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-13\">A. (No response).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-14\">Q. Have I ever said, \u201cSylvia, say thus and so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-15\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-16\">Q. And I said to tell the truth, did I not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-17\">A. Well, yes, sir. <em>But you knew it wasn\u2019t the truth.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-18\">Q. Well, you knew it wasn\u2019t the truth, Sylvia. But I\u2019m saying when I told you to testify, I said, \u201cSylvia, tell the truth.\u201d Did I not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-19\">A. <em>You told me to tell what\u2019s on that paper.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-20\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-21\">Q. Well, now when you wrote out that statement, you say now that\u2019s not true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-22\">A. Well, yes, sir. <em>Mr. Moore, you knew that.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-23\">Q. How could I have known if I never had any conversation with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-24\">A. <em>I told you, Mr. Moore.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-25\">Q. When did you tell me that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-26\">A. Well, you, personally, yesterday. <em>But the other [defense] lawyers knew it before.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-27\">Q. You told me this yesterday, where?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-28\">A. Are you trying to say that I\u2019m lying, Mr. Moore, now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-29\">Q. Sylvia, what we would like to know is when did you say that you told me about this statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-30\">A. Yesterday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-31\">Q. What time and where?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-32\">A. You, personally, but the other guys already knew.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-33\">Q. Do what now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-34\">A. The other [defense] lawyers already knew.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-35\">Q.

When?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-38\">A. Yesterday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-39\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-40\">Q. Is it your testimony that you said to me yesterday, \u201cthat I gave you a false statement\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-41\">A. I don\u2019t understand.

Well, how did I know if you didn\u2019t tell me any such thing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-49\">A. (No response).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-50\">MR.. MOORE: I\u2019m upset, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-51\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-52\">THE WITNESS: Are you finished with me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-53\">MR. MOORE: If the Court, please I would like to introduce into evidence Exhibits 8 and 9 [the witness\u2019s written statements].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>THE COURT: Admitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Petitioner\u2019s lawyer then further cross-examined the witness in an effort to discredit her apparently unexpected subornation allegations. Although the witness stuck with her accusations, she continued to direct them at Petitioner\u2019s lawyers and not at the Petitioner himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Petitioner\u2019s lawyer then called a succession of witnesses, including Petitioner\u2019s wife; Michael Eheman and Nathan J. Hel-iums, two attorneys associated with Mr. Moore in the practice of law who had participated in the preparation arid execution of Ms. Aiken\u2019s written statements; and Wanda Taylor, Mr. Moore\u2019s secretary. Each of these witnesses stated that Ms. Aiken had never denied the truthfulness of her written statements prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">When Petitioner took the stand, he testified that he was in fact at the Denny\u2019s restaurant on the morning in question but that he had not seen Ms. Aiken there. He also testified that it was Ms. Aiken who initially advised him that she had seen him on that occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">There is no evidence in the record that Petitioner himself knowingly participated in a scheme to secure perjured testimony from Ms. Aiken or that he otherwise had any reason to believe that Ms. Aiken would testify falsely at his trial. Nevertheless, during his closing argument to the jury, counsel for the state repeatedly asserted that defense counsel had actively suborned perjury, and implied that the Petitioner was involved in that misconduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-8\">\u201c * * * I cannot imagine the gall it must take for him [Mr. Moore] to get up here and tell you what he\u2019s told you about Sylvia Aiken and me or this office having something on Sylvia Aiken, his witness who he called up here, who was so scared that she fell apart on the witness stand before he started talking to her, and after being caught in one lie, told him that she wasn\u2019t going through with it any more, <em>and she wasn\u2019t going to lie for him and his people or the defendant and his people. </em>You can decide whether I\u2019ve got something on Sylvia Aiken. I\u2019m the one that caused her to tell the truth. That\u2019s all I can say. <em>[Mr. Moore is] up here trying to save his own skin and all the lawyers that work with him as well as the defendant.\u201d </em>(R. 761-62; emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-10\">s\u00a1&lt; * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-11\">\u201cThen the defense starts bringing all the lawyers and people involved in these false statements taken from Sylvia Aiken trying to save their own necks and what else are they going to say except, T didn\u2019t do anything.\u2019 \u201d (R. 779-80).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-12\">\n<em>The Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b364-13\">Based on these facts, Petitioner\u2019s conviction quite possibly would have been reversed had these same claims been presented to the state court on direct appeal. <em>See, e.g., Guerrero v. State, </em>650 S.W.2d 102, 104 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014 Houston [14th] 1983, no writ). However, \u201cwe do not sit as a \u2018super\u2019 state supreme court in a habeas corpus proceeding to review errors under state law.\u201d <em>Cronnon v. State of Alabama, </em>587 F.2d 246, 250 (5th Cir.1979) (quoting <em>Martin v. Wainright, </em>428 F.2d 356, 357 (5th Cir.1970)). Rather, the issue before us is whether Petitioner was denied the fundamentally fair trial he is entitled to under the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-14\">An unfair trial has been characterized as one that has been \u201clargely robbed of dignity due a rational process.\u201d <em>Houston v. Estelle, </em>569 F.2d 372, 383 (5th Cir.1978). Whether a criminal defendant has received such a \u201cdignified\u201d or \u201cfair\u201d trial, as mandated by the fourteenth amendment, must be determined by examining the particular facts of each individual case. \u201c[A] trial that is unfair, whatever the cause of such unfairness, violates Fourteenth Amendment due process.\u201d <em>Fitzgerald v. Estelle, </em>505 F.2d 1334, 1336 (5th Cir.1975). However, the mere erroneous admission of prejudicial testimony does not, in itself, justify federal habeas relief unless it is \u201cmaterial in the sense of a crucial, critical, highly significant factor,\u201d in the context of the entire trial. <em>Porter v. Estelle, </em>709 F.2d 944, 957 (5th Cir.1983). Likewise, a prosecutor\u2019s improper argument will, in itself, exceed constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>limitations in only the most \u201cegregious cases.\u201d <em>Houston v. Estelle, </em>569 F.2d 372, 382 (5th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">In some cases, an accused can be denied due process of law because extraneous considerations render improbable or impossible an impartial judgment as to guilt, wholly apart from defense counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness in preventing the prejudice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In other cases, an accused is denied due process precisely because the extraneous considerations effectively crippled the ability of the Defendant\u2019s lawyer to present his defense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The excerpts from Petitioner\u2019s trial quoted above reveal that his trial was infected with extraneous considerations of both varieties.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">We emphasize that this trial essentially involved a credibility choice between the testimony of the complainant and the Petitioner and, thus, was not a case in which the prosecutor introduced overwhelming evidence of guilt. Nor, was this trial one in which \u201cthe trial court took special pains to correct any impression that the jury could consider the prosecutor\u2019s statements as evidence,\u201d as was the case in <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, </em>416 U.S. 637, 644, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 1872, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Further, we do not hold that any single passage of testimony or prosecutorial comment which transpired during the course of Petitioner\u2019s trial was a per se violation of due process. We have concluded only that the quoted passages and comments, when evaluated in the context of the trial as a whole, were extraneous considerations which unfairly prejudiced the jury against the Petitioner and, perhaps more importantly, crippled the ability of the Petitioner\u2019s lawyer to present an effective defense on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">We therefore hold that the testimony concerning the alleged threats, as well as the testimony concerning the alleged subornation scheme, when combined with the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument in which he, without an evidentiary basis, implied that the Petitioner was somehow directly involved in both of these extraneous and prejudicial matters, denied D. Stephen Menzies that fundamentally fair trial to which he was entitled by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. The denial of the petition for habeas corpus is reversed. The writ must issue. The case is remanded with instructions that the district court set a reasonable time within which Texas may try Menzies again.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-13\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-7\">. Familiar examples of instances in which actual or potential prejudice to the accused has unacceptably affected the deliberative processes of the jury are those involving mass media publicity, <em>Sheppard v. Maxwell, </em>384 U.S. 333, 86 S.Ct. 1507, 16 L.Ed.2d 600 (1966); <em>Estes v. Texas, </em>381 U.S. 532, 85 S.Ct. 1628, 14 L.Ed.2d 543 (1965); cases involving mob-dominated proceedings such as <em>Moore v. Dempsey, </em>261 U.S. 86, 43 S.Ct. 265, 67 L.Ed. 543 (1923); and, the trial of an accused in a prison uniform or shackles, <em>Boswell v. Alabama, </em>537 F.2d 100 (5th Cir.1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b365-8\">. <em>E.g., </em>in <em>Houston v. Estelle, </em>569 F.2d 372 (5th Cir.1978), the prosecutor repeatedly attacked the motives of both the defendant and his lawyer, including references to the defense motions for mistrial and objections as thinly disguised efforts to keep both the truth of the case and its decision from the jury. We held that the trial was fundamentally unfair and set aside the conviction; <em>cf. United States v. Gonzalez, </em>547 F.2d 291, 294-97 (5th Cir.1977) where we reversed because of a combination of improper cross-examination of defense witnesses and the trial judge\u2019s disparagement of counsel in the presence of the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
