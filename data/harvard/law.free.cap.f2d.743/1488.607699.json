The dis- , . , , .. . , . , , trict court dismissed the suits against two . \u201e . . . of the appellees and granted the other three appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment. We reverse and remand to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"A1zb\">T p ,</p>\n<p id=\"AP2j\">Diana Dykes and Roger Francis \u201cBuzzy\u201d Dykes, Jr. (\u201cBuzzy\u201d) began experiencing marital difficulties in 1977. In November i977( Buzzy took the couple\u2019s only child, three-year-old Aaron Matthew Dykes (\u201cAaron\u201d), the other appellant, from their Pennsylvania home to the Florida home of Buzzy\u2019s father and stepmother, Judge Roger F. Dykes (\u201cJudge Dykes\u201d) and Alpine Dykes. The circumstances of this incident are \u2122 disPute-</p>\n<p id=\"aej-dedup-1\">What happened next is not altogether clear either. The appellants contend that Buzzy and Judge Dykes formulated a plan to obtain a colorable court order awarding custody of Aaron to Buzzy. According to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1491\">*1491</page-number>the appellants, Judge Dykes, who is a Bre-vard County, Florida Circuit Court judge, telephoned Judge Anthony Hosemann, Jr., (\u201cJudge Hosemann\u201d), another Brevard County Circuit Court judge then assigned to the Juvenile Court, for advice. Judge Hosemann suggested that Buzzy come to him with a \u201cdependency\u201d petition, and referred Judge Dykes to the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services (\u201cHRS\u201d), the state social service agency in charge of dependent and delinquent children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1555-4\">On the evening of November 21, Judge Dykes and Buzzy went to an HRS office and requested assistance in filing a dependency petition. The agency official on duty there, Kendrick Lofback, explained that the Juvenile Court\u2019s authority to award custody was restricted to dependent or delinquent children, and Aaron did not qualify:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"aet-dedup-2\">I told them that I wouldn\u2019t be able to help them, you know, that what we had to offer wasn\u2019t relevant to their situation, that they needed to get a lawyer and have something done through Circuit Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1555-5\">Lofback Deposition at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1555-6\">According to Lofback, Judge Dykes persisted in the request, and Lofback called his supervisor, Thomas Weinberg, at home, to discuss the matter. Weinberg and Lof-back finally agreed to go along with the petition, as long as it was not officially sponsored by HRS. Weinberg concedes that he might have told Lofback to help with the petition because Judge Dykes was a judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1555-19\">The next morning Weinberg presented a petition on behalf of Buzzy to Judge Hosemann, alleging as a basis for seeking custody the \u201creal danger\u201d that Diana might try to \u201cabduct\u201d Aaron. Buzzy had signed the petition and Weinberg had notarized it, although Weinberg admits that he did not administer an oath to Buzzy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Buzzy waited outside Judge Hosemann\u2019s chambers while Weinberg presented the petition. Judge Hosemann signed the order finding Aaron to be a \u201cdependent child\u201d and awarded custody to Buzzy without any receipt of evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Judge Hosemann admits that he had no basis for awarding custody of Aaron to Buzzy other than the fact that his father was a judge and the fact that the petition was presented by an HRS official.</p>\n<p id=\"b1555-20\">No summons was ever directed to Diana, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1492\">*1492</page-number>as the statute required,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> nor was Diana ever informed prior to the November 22 proceeding that a custody order would be sought. Buzzy did call Diana after he had obtained the order and inform her that he had a court order preventing Aaron\u2019s removal from Florida. Diana did not believe him because she had consulted an attorney who had told her that a court could not award custody or prevent a child\u2019s removal from a state unless a divorce action had been commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1556-4\">Shortly after the dependency proceeding, Buzzy, Diana, and Aaron got back together briefly. They closed up their Pennsylvania apartment, returned to Florida, and moved in with Judge Dykes and his second wife, Alpine. They soon moved again, this time in with Buzzy\u2019s mother, Judge Dykes\u2019 ex-wife Marilu.</p>\n<p id=\"b1556-5\">On approximately January 23, 1978, Diana traveled with Aaron from Florida to her parents\u2019 home in Maryland. The circumstances of this move are in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1556-6\">After Diana left Florida, the Dykes family retained an attorney, Kenneth McIntosh, to help secure Aaron\u2019s return to Florida. A meeting was held between Buzzy, Judge Dykes, Judge Hosemann, Weinberg, and another HRS employee in Judge Hosem-ann\u2019s chambers on January 23, 1978. The group allegedly formulated a plan to bring Aaron back to Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b1556-7\">The next day, in accordance with the plan, Buzzy filed a petition for dissolution of marriage in Brevard County Circuit Court. The dissolution case was assigned to Judge Muldrew, another judge on the Brevard County Circuit Court bench. Judge Muldrew issued three orders <em>ex parte: </em>one granting temporary custody of Aaron to Buzzy and two Requests for Assistance to the Maryland juvenile authorities. Judge Hosemann also issued an <em>ex parte </em>order for Aaron\u2019s return and requesting the assistance of Maryland authorities. All four orders were based upon and referred to Judge Hosemann\u2019s original November 22, 1977 custody order. Each judge ordered Diana to appear in a different court on February 13, 1978 at 10:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b1556-12\">On January 30, armed with the Florida orders, Buzzy flew to Maryland and proceeded to the Maryland Circuit Court, where he obtained a custody order requiring Diana to surrender Aaron. That night, accompanied by a Baltimore County Deputy sheriff, Buzzy went to Diana\u2019s parents\u2019 home, picked up Aaron, and returned to Florida. This was the first time that Diana received formal notice of the November 1977 custody adjudicated by Judge Hosemann.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1556-13\">In February 1978, Diana flew to Florida to be with Aaron and to appear at the custody hearing before Judge Muldrew. On February 22, 1978, Judge Muldrew ordered HRS to do a social investigation of both parents\u2019 suitability as custodians; the study was to be completed within 60 days. The report, which made no custody recommendation, was finally completed almost nine months later, only after Diana\u2019s counsel had filed a contempt motion against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1493\">*1493</page-number>HRS based on the delay. During all this time, Buzzy had custody of Aaron.</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-5\">On August 15, 1978, Judge Muldrew issued a final judgment of dissolution of marriage. On February 22,1979, he granted a permanent custody of Aaron to Buzzy. One of the primary reasons cited by Judge Muldrew for his decision was the fact that Buzzy had been the custodial parent during the past year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-6\">Subsequently, Diana sought post-judgment relief, including the right to take post-trial discovery, on the grounds of judicial impropriety and undue influence in the custody proceedings. All these motions were denied. After her state appeals were denied, she filed this \u00a7 1983 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-7\">In Diana\u2019s original complaint, both she and her son Aaron were named as plaintiffs. The four-count complaint alleged deprivation of the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985 by appellees Judge Hosemann, Judge Dykes, Buzzy Dykes, Thomas Weinberg, Kenneth McIntosh, and Alpine Dykes. Specifically, she claimed that the appellees, individually, and as part of a conspiracy, deprived her of custody of Aaron in violation of her procedural and substantive due process rights and her right to equal protection under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Chief Judge George C. Young dismissed this original complaint for failure to comply with Federal Civil Rule of Procedure 8(a). The plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint against all previously named defendants except Alpine Dykes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-8\">The district court dismissed the \u00a7 1985 actions for lack of an allegation of class-based animus. The appellants do not appeal this decision. The district court also dismissed Aaron as a party plaintiff on the grounds that he had not suffered any damages. The claim against Judge Hosemann was dismissed on the grounds of judicial immunity, and the claim against McIntosh was dismissed for lack of state action and insufficient allegations. The trial court also granted motions for summary judgment filed by Judge Dykes, Buzzy, and Weinberg. Diana and Aaron appeal all these orders.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1557-13\">II. Section 1983 Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-14\">At the outset, we address the basis for the appellants\u2019 rather novel claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-15\">Section 1983 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1557-16\">\u00a7 1983. Civil action for deprivation of rights</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1557-17\">Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1557-18\">Two primary issues in a \u00a7 1983 action are (1) whether the defendants violated the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights, and (2) whether such violation was under color of state law. <em>Scott v. Dixon, </em>720 F.2d 1542, 1545 (11th Cir.1983); <em>Brown v. Miller, </em>631 F.2d 408, 410 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-19\">The gravamen of Diana\u2019s complaint and her basis for appeal is that her parental rights were terminated without notice and a hearing by means of an official act of a judge, which was the product of a corrupt conspiracy between the judge and the other appellants. Diana correctly points out that \u201cthe relationship of love and duty in a recognized family unit is an interest in liberty entitled to constitutional protection.\u201d <em>Lehr v. Robertson, </em>463 U.S. 248, 103 S.Ct. 2985, 2991, 77 L.Ed.2d 614 (1983). \u201c[Sjtate intervention to terminate [such a] relationship ... must be accomplished by procedures meeting the requisites of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1494\">*1494</page-number>Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>Id., quoting Santosky v. Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 1393, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982). At a minimum, due process requires timely notice, in advance of a hearing in which parents\u2019 rights to custody are at stake. <em>Application of Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 1447, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967). Furthermore, \u201cbefore a person is deprived of a protected interest, he must be afforded an opportunity for some kind of hearing, \u2018except for extraordinary situations where some valid governmental interest is at stake that justified postponing the hearing until after the event.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith v. Organization of Foster Families for Equality and Reform, </em>431 U.S. 816, 97 S.Ct. 2094, 2111, 53 L.Ed.2d 14 (1977), <em>quoting Boddie v. Connecticut, </em>401 U.S. 371, 379, 91 S.Ct. 780, 786, 28 L.Ed.2d 113 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-4\">The \u201ccolor of state law\u201d component of \u00a7 1983 may be satisfied by showing that an official act of a defendant judge was the product of a corrupt conspiracy involving the judge and other private parties. <em>Dennis v. Sparks, </em>101 S.Ct. 183, 186 (1980). Even if th\u00a3 judge himself is held to be absolutely immune from suit (see section IIB <em>infra), </em>the private parties who conspire with the judge act under color of state law for \u00a7 1983 purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-5\">Here, Diana alleges, and the other parties do not dispute, that Diana was not given notice or a hearing before the dependency adjudication deprived her of custody of Aaron. She also alleges that the dependency adjudication was the product of a corrupt conspiracy between a judge and private parties. We conclude that Diana has at least stated a \u00a7 1983 procedural due process claim. Accordingly, we address seriatim the appellees\u2019 liability for that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-10\">III. The Appellees\u2019 Liability</p>\n<p id=\"AB5\">A. Judge Hosemann</p>\n<p id=\"AUPr\">The claim against Judge Hosemann was dismissed on the grounds of absolute judicial immunity. It is well established that judges are immune from lawsuits for damages<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for all judicial acts not taken in the clear absence of jurisdiction. <em>Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978); <em>Pierson v. Ray, </em>386 U.S. 547, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967); <em>Bradley v. Fisher, </em>13 Wall. 335, 20 L.Ed. 646 (1871); <em>Randall v. Brigham, </em>7 Wall. 523, 19 L.Ed. 285 (1868). The appellants here argue that Judge Hosemann is not immune because (1) some of the acts complained of are nonjudicial in nature, and (2) his judicial acts were taken in the clear absence of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-11\">1. Nonjudicial Acts</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-12\">The appellants do not contend that Judge Hosemann\u2019s participation in the dependency proceeding was not a \u201cjudicial act.\u201d Rather, they maintain that Judge Hosemann\u2019s implicit or explicit agreement prior to the dependency proceeding to grant Buzzy custody was a nonjudicial act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1558-13\">In <em>Stump v. Sparkman, </em>the Supreme Court discussed with approval the Fifth Circuit standard for what constitutes a judicial act for purposes of judicial immunity. 98 S.Ct. at 1107, <em>citing McAlester v. Brown, </em>469 F.2d 1280, 1282 (1972). The Court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1558-14\">... the factors determining whether an act by a judge is a \u201cjudicial\u201d one relate to the nature of the act itself, i.e., whether it is a function normally performed by a judge, and to the expectations of the parties, i.e., whether they dealt with the judge in his judicial capacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1558-15\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-16\">The appellants rely on <em>Rankin v. Howard, </em>633 F.2d 844 (9th Cir.1980), <em>cert. de</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1495\">*1495</page-number><em>nied </em>451 U.S. 939, 101 S.Ct. 2020, 68 L.Ed.2d 326 (1981), where that court concluded that a judge\u2019s private, prior agreement to decide in favor of one party is not a judicial act. <em>Id. </em>at 847. Applying the <em>Stump </em>definition of \u201cjudicial act,\u201d the <em>Rankin </em>court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1559-5\">Although a party conniving with a judge to predetermine the outcome of a judicial proceeding may deal with him in his \u201cjudicial capacity,\u201d the other party\u2019s expectation, <em>i.e., </em>judicial impartiality, is actively frustrated by the scheme. In any event, the agreement is not \u201ca function normally performed by a judge.\u201d It is the antithesis of the \u201cprincipled and fearless decision-making\u201d that judicial immunity exists to protect. <em>See Pierson v. Ray, </em>386 U.S. 547, 554, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 1217, 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967); <em>Gregory v. Thompson, </em>500 F.2d [59] at 63 [9th Cir.1974].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1559-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1559-7\">While it could be urged that the <em>Rankin </em>reasoning is persuasive, it appears that this circuit has, at least in dicta, rejected <em>Rankin\u2019s </em>conclusion concerning the nonjudicial character of prior agreements. In <em>Harper v. Merckle, </em>638 F.2d 848 (5th Cir. Unit B), <em>cert. denied </em>454 U.S. 816, 102 S.Ct. 93, 70 L.Ed.2d 85 (1981), this court stated, \u201cwe note that even a judge who is approached as a judge by a party for the purpose of conspiring to violate \u00a7 1983 is properly immune from a damage suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 856 n. 9. The <em>Harper </em>court relied on <em>Dennis v. Sparks, </em>449 U.S. 24, 101 S.Ct. 183, 66 L.Ed.2d 185 (1980), where the Supreme Court stated in reference to the dismissal of a judge alleged to have conspired with private parties: \u201cThe courts below concluded that the judicial immunity doctrine required dismissal of the \u00a7 1983 action against the judge who issued the challenged injunction, and as the case comes to us, the judge has been properly dismissed from the suit on the immunity grounds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186. Subsequently, the Eleventh Circuit, in dismissing a claim against a court clerk on the grounds of judicial immunity, held that immunity would be assured despite the appellants\u2019 assertion that the court clerk and another defendant conspired with one another or reached an understanding about the judicial act to be performed. <em>Scott v. Dixon, </em>720 F.2d 1542, 1546-47 (11th Cir.1983). Although we think the <em>Rankin </em>opinion is well-reasoned on this point, we follow <em>Scott, </em>and hold that even advance agreements between a judge and other parties as to the outcome of a judicial proceeding do not pierce a judge\u2019s immunity from suits for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1559-9\">2. Absence of Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b1559-10\">The appellants also argue that Judge Ho-semann is not immune from liability because he acted in the absence of either subject matter or personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1559-11\">a. Subject matter jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b1559-12\">It is clear that a judge who acts in the absence of subject matter jurisdiction may be held liable for his judicial acts. <em>Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978); <em>Bradley v. Fisher, </em>13 Wall. 335, 20 L.Ed. 646 (1872). The rationale for this limitation on judicial immunity is set out in <em>Bradley v. Fisher </em>and reiterated in <em>Stump v. Sparkman: </em>\u201cWhere there is clearly no jurisdiction over the subject-matter any authority exercised is a usurped authority, and for the exercise of such authority, when the want of jurisdiction is known, no excuse is permissible.\u201d <em>Stump, </em>98 S.Ct. at 1104 n. 6, <em>quoting Bradley, </em>13 Wall, at 351, 20 L.Ed. 646. <em>Stump </em>also points out that subject matter jurisdiction must be broadly construed where the issue is a judge\u2019s immunity, and notes a distinction between lack of jurisdiction and excess of jurisdiction. 98 S.Ct. at 1105. Illustrative of a clear lack of subject matter jurisdiction would be a situation where a probate judge, with jurisdiction only over wills and estates, would try a criminal case. The probate judge would not be immune from suit. On the other hand, if a judge of a criminal court convicted a defendant of a nonexistent crime, he would merely be acting in excess of his jurisdiction and would be immune. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1496\">*1496</page-number>n. 7, <em>citing Bradley, </em>13 Wall, at 352, 20 L.Ed. 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b1560-4\">In the instant case, the appellants\u2019 argument regarding lack of subject matter jurisdiction is that because Aaron could not qualify as a \u201cdependent\u201d under Florida law, <em>see </em>note 1 <em>supra, </em>and accompanying text, Judge Hosemann was without jurisdiction over the case. This argument must fail. Section 39.02 of the 1977 Florida Statutes states that, \u201cThe circuit court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction of proceedings in which a child is alleged to be dependent or delinquent____\u201d There is no question that Judge Hosemann was a circuit court judge, and that the petition presented to Judge Hosemann on November 22, 1977 alleged that Aaron was a \u201cdependent\u201d child. Accordingly, Judge Ho-semann had subject matter jurisdiction of the case. Whether or not Judge Hosemann erred in his determination that Aaron was a \u201cdependent\u201d child is irrelevant to the issue of whether Judge Hosemann had subject matter jurisdiction to make such a determination. <em>See Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 1106, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978); <em>Scott v. Hayes, </em>719 F.2d 1562, 1566-67 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1560-7\">b. Personal jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"ap1q-dedup-0\">Although we conclude that Judge Ho-semann had subject matter jurisdiction to enter the order complained of, the appellants also contend that Judge Hosemann did not have personal jurisdiction to enter the order, and that such lack of personal jurisdiction abrogated his judicial immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1560-8\">This is a question of first impression in the Eleventh Circuit.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Only the Ninth Circuit has thoroughly addressed this issue. <em>Rankin v. Howard, </em>633 F.2d 844 (9th Cir.1980), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>451 U.S. 939, 101 S.Ct. 2020, 68 L.Ed.2d 326 (1981). <em>But cf. Green v. Maraio, </em>722 F.2d 1013 (2d Cir.1983); <em>Martin v. Aubuchon, </em>623 F.2d 1282 (8th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1560-11\">In <em>Rankin, </em>the parents of a member of the Unification Church instituted guardianship proceedings in a Kansas probate court as part of a \u201cdeprogramming\u201d plan. The judge granted the guardianship petition in an <em>ex parte </em>hearing without notice to the son, even though the son was then a resident of Missouri, a fact allegedly known by the judge. Subsequently, the son was lured away from his Missouri home and taken to Arizona for nine days of \u201cdeprogramming.\u201d He escaped and sued his parents, the deprogrammers, the lawyer involved, and the Kansas judge in a \u00a7 1983 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1560-12\">In regard to whether absence of personal jurisdiction would abrogate judicial immunity, the <em>Rankin </em>court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1560-13\">When the Supreme Court first formulated the \u201cclear absence\u201d standard, ... it stated that the principle of immunity applied when there was \u201cjurisdiction of both subject and person.\u201d <em>Bradley v. Fisher, </em>80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 335, 352 (1872), 20 L.Ed. 646.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1560-14\">An absence of personal jurisdiction may be said to destroy \u201call jurisdiction\u201d because the requirements of subject matter and personal jurisdiction are conjunctional. Both must be met before a court has authority to adjudicate the rights of parties to a dispute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1560-15\">If a court lacks jurisdiction over a party, then it lacks \u201call jurisdiction\u201d to adjudicate that party\u2019s rights, whether or not the subject matter is properly before it. <em>See, e.g., Kulko v. Superior Court, </em>436 U.S. 84, 91, 98 S.Ct. 1690, 1696, 56 L.Ed.2d 132 (1978) (\u201c[i]t has long been the rule that a valid judgment imposing a personal obligation or duty in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1497\">*1497</page-number>the plaintiff may be entered only by a court having jurisdiction over the person of the defendant\u201d) (citations omitted)... Because the limits of personal jurisdiction constrain judicial authority, acts taken in the absence of personal jurisdiction do not fall within the scope of legitimate decisionmaking that judicial immunity is designed to protect. <em>See Gregory v. Thompson, </em>500 F.2d at 63. We conclude that a judge who acts in the clear and complete absence of personal jurisdiction loses his judicial immunity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1561-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 848-849 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-6\">We agree with the <em>Rankin </em>court\u2019s analysis. We point out in addition, that the rationale for the limitation on judicial immunity when subject matter jurisdiction is lacking applies with equal force when personal jurisdiction is lacking. In <em>Bradley v. Fisher, </em>the court stated that where there is no jurisdiction over the subject matter, any authority exercised is a usurped authority. 13 Wall, at 351, 20 L.Ed. 646. Although the modern conception of personal jurisdiction generally refers to due process, <em>see, e.g., International Shoe Co. v. Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945), the foundation of personal jurisdiction has always been a court\u2019s power to act. <em>McDonald v. McBee, </em>243 U.S. 90, 37 S.Ct. 343, 61 L.Ed. 608 (1917); <em>Pennoyer v. Neff, </em>95 U.S. 714, 24 L.Ed. 565 (1878). When a court acts without personal jurisdiction, its authority is as much a usurped authority as when the court acts without subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-7\">We also agree with the <em>Rankin </em>court that immunity for judicial acts in the clear absence of jurisdiction is lost only if the judge knows that he lacks jurisdiction, or acts in the face of clearly valid statutes or case law expressly depriving him of jurisdiction. <em>See </em>633 F.2d at 849. Issues of jurisdiction are often complex, and judges should be free to decide them without concern that their errors may subject them to liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-12\">In the instant case, the federal district court judge assumed that a court which had subject matter jurisdiction did not act in the clear absence of jurisdiction. The court refused to reconsider its ruling when the appellants introduced <em>Rankin </em>as new authority. Because the issues of whether Judge Hosemann knew he lacked personal jurisdiction or acted in the face of clearly valid statutes or ease law expressly depriving him of jurisdiction are matters for initial determination in the district court, we reverse the order dismissing the claim against Judge Hosemann and remand to the district court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1561-13\">B. Thomas Weinberg</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-14\">The district court granted summary judgment to Florida Health and Rehabilitative Services official Thomas Weinberg because it found that as a state executive official he was entitled to qualified immunity-</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-15\">The standard for such qualified immunity is set out in <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1561-16\">... government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shield<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1498\">*1498</page-number>ed from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1562-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 2738. <em>See also Zeigler v. Jackson, </em>716 F.2d 847, 849 (11th Cir.1983). Where an individual official would be expected to know that certain conduct would violate statutory or constitutional rights he should be made to hesitate. <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>102 S.Ct. at 2739; <em>Scott v. Dixon, </em>720 F.2d 1542, 1548 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-5\">Weinberg does not argue that he should not be expected to know that adjudicating Diana\u2019s right to custody without notice to her would violate her constitutional rights. Instead, he asserts that he just did his job and that at any rate it was not his duty to notify Diana of the dependence proceeding. His position is that <em>he </em>did not deprive the appellants of any constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-6\">However, Weinberg does not adequately address the appellants\u2019 contention that Weinberg acted as part of a conspiracy to deprive the appellants of their constitutional rights. To show a conspiracy to violate \u00a7 1983, the appellants must show that the appellees \u201creached an understanding\u201d to violate their rights. <em>Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1605, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970); <em>Dennis v. Sparks, </em>449 U.S. 24, 101 S.Ct. 183, 66 L.Ed.2d 185 (1980); <em>Crowe v. Lucas, </em>595 F.2d 985 (5th Cir.1979). <em>See also Cole v. Gray, </em>638 F.2d 804 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 838, 102 S.Ct. 144, 70 L.Ed.2d 120 (1981). Even if it was not Weinberg\u2019s personal statutory duty to notify Diana, he could be held liable on a conspiracy theory if he reached an understanding with the other appellees to violate Diana\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-7\">Summary judgment is inappropriate where the record, examined in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion shows any material facts in dispute. <em>Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>90 S.Ct. at 1609. Weinberg\u2019s participation in the petition process on his day off, the testimony of HRS official Kenneth Lofback concerning the propriety of a dependency proceeding under the circumstances of the case, the meeting between Weinberg, Judge Dykes, Buzzy and Judge Hosemann in Judge Hosemann\u2019s chambers to formulate a plan to regain physical custody of Aaron and other evidence in the record at least indicates that fact issues exist as to whether Weinberg took part in a conspiracy to violate the appellants\u2019 constitutional rights. Accordingly, summary judgment for Weinberg is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-10\">C. Judge Dykes and Buzzy Dykes</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-11\">The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Judge Dykes because his actions constituted normal grandfatherly concern rather than action under color of state law. However, as previously discussed <em>{see </em>section IIA <em>supra), the </em>requisite element of action under color of state law for \u00a7 1983 purposes is provided by Judge Hosemann\u2019s alleged participation in the alleged conspiracy, whether or not Hosemann is held to be immune from suit. <em>Dennis v. Sparks, 101 </em>S.Ct. at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-12\">The appellants have presented documentary evidence in the form of Judge Dykes\u2019 notes both before and after the custody order, from which inferences can be drawn that Judge Dykes was the instigator of the dependency petition and the plan to regain physical custody of Aaron by means of the original order. These notes, in addition to other testimonial and circumstantial evidence in the record convince us that triable fact issues exist as to Judge Dykes' participation in a conspiracy to deprive the appellants of their constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-13\">As to Buzzy Dykes, the district court concluded that the undisputed facts failed to show that Buzzy was a willful participant in joint action with the other defendants.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To the contrary, we find suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1499\">*1499</page-number>ficient evidence that Buzzy participated in joint action with the other appellants. He gave Weinberg the information for the dependency petition, he met with several of the appellants in Judge Hosemann\u2019s chambers to plan how to regain custody of Aaron, and he flew to Maryland with all the court orders and picked up Aaron. The real question is whether there was a conspiracy to violate the appellants\u2019 constitutional rights. Because a jury could draw inferences of a conspiracy from the evidence presented, we hold that the summary judgment in favor of Buzzy was unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1563-5\">D. Attorney McIntosh</p>\n<p id=\"b1563-6\">The district court dismissed attorney Kenneth McIntosh as a party defendant on the basis that, Judge Hosemann already having been immunized, McIntosh did not act under color of state law. As previously discussed <em>(see </em>section IIA <em>supra), </em>private parties who conspire with an immune judge in connection with the judge\u2019s official acts are acting under color of state law and may be held liable under \u00a7 1983. <em>Dennis v. Sparks, </em>102 S.Ct. at 186. Accordingly, the ground upon which the district court rested its dismissal of McIntosh is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1563-7\">However, the district court also mentioned in passing on attorney McIntosh\u2019s motion to dismiss that he did not think that there were sufficient allegations against McIntosh. On appeal, McIntosh argues that we should affirm the district court on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1563-8\">With regard to a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a \u00a7 1983 complaint should not be dismissed unless it appears that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts which would entitle him to relief. <em>Doe v. Public Health Trust of Dade County, </em>696 F.2d 901, 907 (11th Cir.1983) (Hatchett, J., specially concurring); <em>Richardson v. Fleming, </em>651 F.2d 366, 368 (5th Cir.1981). For purposes of testing sufficiency of the complaint, the allegations of the complaint must be taken as true. <em>Richardson, </em>651 F.2d at 368. Furthermore, private attorneys alleged to have conspired with immune state officials may be held liable under \u00a7 1983. <em>Id. </em>at 371. Here, the appellants allege that the appellees, including McIntosh, conspired to utilize the allegedly illegal November 22, 1977 custody order to obtain permanent custody of Aaron, and that McIntosh knew or should have known that that order was improper and illegal. Taking these allegations as true, we hold that if proven, they could entitle the appellants to \u00a7 1983 relief against McIntosh. Accordingly, dismissal of the appellants\u2019 complaint against McIntosh is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1563-12\">IV. Other Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b1563-13\">A. Dismissal of Aaron as a plaintiff</p>\n<p id=\"b1563-14\">The district court dismissed Aaron as a plaintiff <em>sua sponte </em>because of the court\u2019s conclusion that Aaron had suffered no damages. This ruling was made from the bench without motion, briefing or argument, in response to a different motion to dismiss Aaron as a plaintiff on the grounds that Diana was not a proper person to sue as Aaron\u2019s next friend while Buzzy was his legal guardian. Diana and Aaron appeal this dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1500\">*1500</page-number>Damages for mental and emotional stress caused by the denial of procedural due process may be awarded in a \u00a7 1983 action. <em>Carey v. Piphus, </em>435 U.S. 247, 264, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 1052, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978). Absent proof of actual injury, nominal damages may be awarded. <em>Id. </em>at 266-67, 98 S.Ct. at *1053-1054. Punitive damages may be awarded in a \u00a7 1983 action even without a showing of actual loss by the plaintiff if the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights have been violated. <em>McCulloch v. Glasgow, </em>620 F.2d 47, 51 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1564-4\">In the instant case, Diana testified in her deposition that Aaron suffered emotional distress as a result of being deprived of his mother\u2019s care and companionship. If Aaron\u2019s constitutional rights were violated, he might have been entitled to nominal damages even without proof of actual injury. Because an issue of material fact remained as to whether Aaron suffered damages, his dismissal as a plaintiff on this ground was error.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1564-5\">B. Res Judicata</p>\n<p id=\"b1564-6\">The appellees argue that the appellants have litigated or have had the opportunity to litigate their due process claims in state court and that therefore they should be precluded from reasserting them in federal court.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The district court agreed with the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1564-7\">A recent Supreme Court case holds that a state court judgment has the same claim preclusive effect in a \u00a7 1983 suit in federal court as that judgment would have in courts of the state from which it was issued. <em>Migra v. Warren City School District Board of Education, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 104 S.Ct. 892, 898, 79 L.Ed.2d 56 (1984). Furthermore, both sides agree that a recent Florida case clearly sets forth Florida law on claim preclusion. <em>Albrecht v. State, </em>444 So.2d 8 (Fla.1984). There the Florida Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1564-13\">[W]hen the second suit is between the same parties, but based upon a different cause of action from the first, the prior judgment will not serve as an estoppel except as to those issues actually litigated and determined in it____ Therefore, if the cause of action is not the same there will be no estoppel as to those issues which <em>could </em>have been litigated in the previous action. The determining factor in deciding whether the cause of action is the same is whether the facts or evidence necessary to maintain the suit are the same in both actions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1564-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 12 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1564-16\">As in <em>Migra, </em>it is not apparent whether the district court in the instant case applied state or federal law in concluding that \u201cthe state decisions would seem to put this matter to rest ____\u201d Therefore, like the <em>Migra </em>court, we remand to the district court for initial interpretation and application of Florida law on this point. <em>See Migra, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 104 S.Ct. at 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b1564-21\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1564-22\">We reverse the district court\u2019s judgments as to each of the appellees and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. The appellees\u2019 requests for attorney fees are accordingly DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1564-23\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1555-7\">.

The determination of dependency was permissible only upon a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 39.09(1 )(b). Furthermore, once a child had been adjudicated a dependent, the court was required to hold a disposition hearing, at which it was to consider a predisposition study presented by an agent of HRS. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 39.-09(3). Here, the adjudication and the disposition were combined into one hearing where no evidence was presented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1556-8\">.

We note that the Supreme Court this term has held that judicial immunity is not a bar to prospective injunctive relief against a judicial officer. <em>Pulliam v.

The appellees argue that the appellants failed to raise the nonjudicial act theory in the district court. The appellees are mistaken. The appellants raised the nonjudicial act theory in a Motion for Reconsideration of the Order Dismissing Judge Hosemann in Light of New Authorities. The district court denied this motion on June 3, 1981, and the appellants noted an appeal of this denial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1560-9\">. The Supreme Court in <em>Stump v.

However, as the <em>Rankin </em>court noted, the Supreme Court did not explicitly consider whether Judge Stump acted in the clear absence of personal jurisdiction or whether such action would be protected by judicial immunity. 633 F.2d at 848.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1561-8\">. Judge Hosemann argued in his brief that Florida statutes required only personal jurisdiction over the child Aaron in dependency cases. He based this argument on \u00a7 39.06(7), which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1561-9\">(7) The jurisdiction of the court shall attach to the child and the case when the summons is served upon the child, a parent or legal or actual custodian of the child...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1561-10\">Although no summons was served on anyone in the case, Hosemann pointed to \u00a7 39.06(1), which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1561-17\">(1) Personal appearance of any person in a hearing before the court shall obviate the necessity of serving process on that person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqAK\">According to Hosemann, the fact that Buzzy's name was on the petition and Buzzy\u2019s presence outside the judge's chambers constituted constructive appearance, obviating the need for service on Buzzy, and attaching the jurisdiction of the court to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-18\">When questioned at oral argument, Hosem-ann\u2019s attorney seemed to concede that personal jurisdiction over Diana was necessary for the entry of the custody order, and that it did not exist.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1562-8\">. The district court also held as a matter of law that Diana\u2019s constitutional rights had not been violated since Buzzy told her that he had a court order preventing Aaron's removal from Florida. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1499\">*1499</page-number>In light of the lack of formal notice to Diana <em>before </em>entry of the order, and Diana\u2019s testimony that she did not believe Buzzy, we cannot hold such \"notice\" constitutionally adequate as a matter of law.

We note first of all that this circuit has not applied the <em>Thompson </em>case to situations other than employee terminations. Furthermore, in this \u00a7 1983 action, the question of whether Diana was injured as a result of the November 1977 custody order, or whether the subsequent custody proceedings did cure the original lack of notice, is one for the jury. In this context, we point out that all court orders in the state custody proceedings were based on and referred to the original November 1977 order, and that the final custody order was based largely on the fact that because of the original order Buzzy had already had custody of Aaron for a year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1564-10\">.

Appellees Weinberg and Hosemann also argue that because federal courts do not have jurisdiction to review, modify, or nullify an order of a state court, the federal district court was without jurisdiction in the instant case. This argument is without merit.

HILL, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AG_G\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1564-25\">This section 1983 action arises as the result of a very unfortunate dispute between an estranged husband and wife over the custody of their child. If there are any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1501\">*1501</page-number>cases where eonclusory allegations of conspiracy and wrongdoing are likely to be made against a judge and other persons involved in the dispute, they are cases such as this, where the strongest emotions of both parties are unleashed. A court must strictly scrutinize eonclusory allegations in a case like this, given the ease with which they can be made by a disappointed party.</p>\n<p id=\"b1565-5\">It is easy to sympathize with appellant Diana Dykes' plight under the unusual facts of this case. There is little doubt that Buzzy Dykes occupied a favorable position in litigating against Diana in the Florida courts, due to Buzzy\u2019s father\u2019s position as a Florida circuit court judge. However, I do not know how the law can remedy this situation, short of holding that a judge or his family may not litigate contested issues in court without being subject, along with the judge that hears the issues, to a charge of conspiracy. Thus, although I assume that appellant\u2019s allegations of conspiracy are sufficient to state a claim under section 1983,1 dissent from the majority because it is clear to me that these allegations are unfounded and without support on the record of this case; and therefore that the dismissal of all defendants by the district judge was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1565-6\">I. JUDGE HOSEMANN</p>\n<p id=\"Ax7D\">In considering judicial immunity, two things must be kept in mind. First, immunity is designed to prevent a disgruntled litigant from hauling a judge into court and requiring him to justify and defend his decision. <em>See Beard v. Udall, </em>648 F.2d 1264, 1269 (9th Cir.1981). In this respect, a policy determination has been made that the public interest in ensuring the independence of the judiciary outweighs the likelihood that a certain number of bad acts by specific judges will go unpunished. Second, immunity is meaningless if it is granted only to those who do nothing wrong. Judicial immunity is intended not to protect wrongdoers, but to protect all judges who undertake to resolve issues thrust upon them that they are in no position to decline. However, if immunity is to amount to anything, there will be immunity for very bad conduct. A judge may rule incorrectly, or even in bad faith, in which case there may be a temptation to express strong disapproval of his actions by finding that he has made himself liable for damages. This temptation must be resisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1565-9\">It is undisputed that Judge Hosemann erred in granting the November 22, 1977, temporary custody order based on the dependency petition presented to him. However, this error should not deprive him of judicial immunity under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1565-10\">A. <em>Nonjudicial Acts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1565-11\">The majority follows <em>Scott v. Dixon, </em>720 F.2d 1542 (11th Cir.1983), and <em>Harper v. Merckle, </em>638 F.2d 848, 856 n. 9 (5th Cir. Unit B), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 816, 102 S.Ct. 93, 70 L.Ed.2d 85 (1981) in holding that \u201ceven advance agreements between a judge and other parties as to the outcome of a judicial proceeding do not pierce a judge\u2019s immunity from\" damage suits. I completely agree, and write here merely to express displeasure over the majority\u2019s approval of the reasoning of <em>Rankin v. Howard, </em>633 F.2d 844 (9th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 939, 101 S.Ct. 2020, 68 L.Ed.2d 326 (1981), which held the opposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b1565-12\">When a judge is approached by a litigant and presented with a petition, it is his duty to rule on the petition. In doing so, he is performing a normal judicial function and is immune from suit, regardless of the fact that he may have earlier agreed to decide in favor of one party.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Harper v. Merckle, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1502\">*1502</page-number>638 F.2d at 856 n. 9, 859; <em>see Dennis v. Sparks, </em>449 U.S. 24, 26-27, 101 S.Ct. 183, 185-186, 66 L.Ed.2d 185 (1980). The <em>Harper </em>case emphasized the narrow factual circumstances under which a judge\u2019s acts will be found non-judicial and thus subject him to liability.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These circumstances are not present in Judge Hosemann\u2019s situation, even if we were to assume that he reached a prior agreement to rule in favor of Buzzy Dykes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1566-4\">The grave implication of the <em>Rankin </em>decision is that, based on conclusory allegations of conspiracy and prior agreements, judges will often be called into court and examined and cross-examined about their judicial decisions merely because they were called upon as judges to deal with unpleasant cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1566-5\">B. <em>Personal Jurisdiction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1566-6\">The majority opinion relies on <em>Rankin v. Howard, </em>633 F.2d 844 (9th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 939, 101 S.Ct. 2020, 68 L.Ed.2d 326 (1981) in remanding to the district court to determine whether Judge Hosemann knew that he lacked personal jurisdiction or acted in the face of clearly valid law expressly depriving him of personal jurisdiction. I strongly dissent from this portion of the opinion, which represents an alarming break with what has generally been considered necessary to pierce judicial immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1566-7\">In <em>Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978), the Supreme Court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABYv\">the scope of the judge\u2019s jurisdiction must be construed broadly where the issue is the immunity of the judge. A judge will not be deprived of immunity because the action he took was in error, was done maliciously, or was in excess of his authority; rather, he will be subject to liability only when he has acted in the \u201cclear absence of all jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1566-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 356-57, 98 S.Ct. at 1105 <em>(citing Bradley v. Fisher, </em>80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 335, 351, 20 L.Ed. 646 (1872)). The court further explained that \u201c[a] judge is absolutely immune from liability for his judicial acts even if his exercise of authority is flawed by grave procedural errors,\u201d such as the \u201cfailure to comply with elementary principles of procedural due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359, 98 S.Ct. at 1106.</p>\n<p id=\"b1566-12\">The majority opinion in this case goes much farther towards abrogating judicial immunity than <em>Stump </em>indicates is appropriate. Indeed, the <em>Rankin </em>holding on personal jurisdiction has been severely limited by subsequent Ninth Circuit cases, indicating an almost immediate realization by that circuit that it had gone too far in <em>Rankin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1566-13\">In <em>O\u2019Neil v. City of Lake Oswego, </em>642 F.2d 367 (9th Cir.1981), the Ninth Circuit determined that a pro tern municipal judge\u2019s action in convicting a defendant of contempt (an offense generally within his court\u2019s jurisdiction) without requisite papers to confer jurisdiction over the particular alleged commission of the offense, corn stituted merely an act in excess of jurisdiction, and not an act in the clear absence of jurisdiction; thus the judge was held immune from liability. The court distinguished the situation in which a judge violates a rule of law <em>expressly </em>depriving it of jurisdiction (no immunity), from the ease where a court merely fails to \u201ccomply with all the [procedural] requirements of a statute conferring jurisdiction,\u201d in which case the judge is still immune. <em>Id. </em>at 369-70. In explanation, the court stated that \u201cfear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1503\">*1503</page-number>less decision-making is fostered by granting judges immunity ... even when they fail to comport with procedural niceties necessary to give the court power over the particular matter.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1567-5\"><em>Beard v. Udall, </em>648 F.2d 1264 (9th Cir.1981), involved facts surprisingly similar to our present case. Following a divorce decree under which the father was awarded custody of the children, the mother moved to another county and began working for a lawyer. While the children were visiting the mother, the lawyer petitioned a judge to modify the original divorce decree and to award custody of the children to the mother. The judge set a hearing on an order to show cause and entered a temporary restraining order preventing the father from removing the children from the county. Before the judge could rule on the petition for modification, the father \u201ckidnapped\u201d the children and took them back to his home. The father was then arrested for kidnapping and other felonies, though never prosecuted. He brought a \u00a7 1983 action alleging that the judge, the mother\u2019s lawyer, and the sheriff acted to deprive him of his civil rights. In particular, he alleged that the judge had acted in the clear absence of jurisdiction by failing to follow certain applicable statutory procedural requirements, related to notice and hearing,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> before issuing the order to show cause and the TRO. <em>Id. </em>at 1268. The Ninth Circuit held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1567-6\">The fact that a judge commits \u201cgrave procedural errors\u201d is not sufficient to deprive a judge of absolute immunity. <em>Stump, </em>435 U.S. at 359, 98 S.Ct. at 1106. Thus, even if Beard\u2019s allegations that Judge Greer failed to adhere to the procedural rules established by the Arizona statutes are true, judicial immunity precludes Beard from recovering for this alleged wrongful act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1567-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 1269.</p>\n<p id=\"b1567-12\">In our present case, it is undisputed that appellant Diana Dykes did not receive notice or a hearing prior to the entry of the November 22, 1977, temporary custody order. I assume, although it is certainly not clear,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that notice to the mother was required in order to obtain personal jurisdiction over the child and the case. Even so, this is squarely the situation faced in the <em>Beard </em>case, and analogous to the situation in <em>O\u2019Neil. </em>Although Judge Hosemann may have proceeded erroneously, the most that can be said is that he committed a \u201cgrave procedural error\u201d by failing to comply with all of the \u201cprocedural niceties\u201d necessary to confer jurisdiction. In no respect did he act in such a \u201cclear absence\u201d of jurisdiction as to deprive him of his judicial immunity. The absence of notice and hearing is a flaw in the order itself, to be corrected on appeal or collateral attack, not by a section 1983 damages action brought against the judge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1567-13\">II. THOMAS WEINBERG</p>\n<p id=\"AzWE\">The majority states the correct standard for granting qualified immunity to a state executive official, but then fails to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1504\">*1504</page-number>the facts of this case in reversing summary judgment, which was granted on the basis of that immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1568-4\">The district court opinion granting summary judgment in this case sets out Weinberg\u2019s statutory duties in the processing of a dependency petition. <em>Dykes v. Weinberg, </em>564 F.Supp. 536, 541-42 (M.D.Fla.1983). The facts show that Weinberg properly concluded that the HRS would not initiate a dependency proceeding on behalf of Buzzy Dykes, and then, as required by the Florida statute, he advised Buzzy and Judge Dykes that they had a right to file their own petition. Weinberg and Kenneth Lofback also assisted the Dykes in the preparation of the petition and its presentment to Judge Hosemann; but affidavits from Weinberg and three other HRS employees state that this was a customary HRS practice, and the appellant has presented no evidence to the contrary. Weinberg did meet with Hosemann and the Dykes to discuss the possibilities for regaining custody of the child after Diana took the child back to Maryland with her; but again, the HRS affidavits indicate that the HRS is an arm of the court in juvenile matters, with a duty to advise the judge when he asks for assistance in a juvenile case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1568-5\">In short, appellant\u2019s bald assertions that Weinberg was participating in a conspiracy are met by undisputed facts which indicate that Weinberg was merely acting according to his statutory duty and customary HRS practice and procedure. If there is such a thing as qualified immunity for a state official, then nothing has been shown here to pierce it. Summary judgment was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1568-6\">III. ATTORNEY MCINTOSH</p>\n<p id=\"b1568-7\">Appellant\u2019s only allegations as to McIntosh\u2019s participation in the \u201cconspiracy\u201d is that he planned with Buzzy and Judge Dykes to use the \u201cillegal and improper\u201d November 22nd custody order, which he knew or should have known was illegal. Amended Complaint, 1114. This is probably sufficient to satisfy the \u201cunder color of state law\u201d requirement in section 1983, since this conspiracy allegedly involved two state agents, Judge Dykes and HRS official Weinberg. <em>See Dennis v. Sparks, </em>449 U.S. 24, 101 S.Ct. 183, 66 L.Ed.2d 185 (1980). However, the complaint sets forth absolutely no acts of conspiracy or active cooperation between McIntosh and the other defendants in this case, outside of actions within the normal attorney-client relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b1568-11\">McIntosh was retained by Buzzy and Judge Dykes around the end of January, 1978, about two months after the disputed November 22, 1977, order had been entered. This order was facially valid; it had never been appealed or held unlawful. McIntosh, representing Buzzy, filed a petition in the Florida courts for dissolution of marriage and custody of Aaron. It is undisputed that McIntosh never had any contact with Weinberg, and met Judge Hosemann only at a February show cause hearing in which he represented Buzzy. Appellant alleges no other conduct by McIntosh that would lend any support to her conspiracy claim. Her allegations indicate only that McIntosh was acting properly as an advocate, using each arsenal at his disposal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1568-12\">It is unclear whether the district judge dismissed McIntosh for failure to show state action, or for failure to state a claim. But it is clear that McIntosh can properly be dismissed for failure to state a claim, since the complaint is totally devoid of any allegation setting out an act of conspiracy between McIntosh and the other defendants, outside of the normal attorney-client relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b1568-13\">IV. JUDGE AND BUZZY DYKES</p>\n<p id=\"ASXU\">As was the situation with McIntosh, there are sufficient allegations of cooperation between the Dykes\u2019 and the two state agents in this case to satisfy the \u201cunder color of state law\u201d requirement pursuant to <em>Dennis v. Sparks, </em>449 U.S. 24, 101 S.Ct. 183, 66 L.Ed.2d 185. However, a careful review of the record indicates that both Judge and Buzzy Dykes are properly entitled to summary judgment in this case. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to appellant, there is no genuine issue as to the existence of a conspiracy. Appellant\u2019s allegations in this case stem merely from the fact that the child\u2019s grand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1505\">*1505</page-number>father happened to be a judge.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Murky allegations of a conspiracy, combined with proof of mere contact between the defendants and the fact of a favorable ruling on the petition at issue, are insufficient to raise a fact issue for trial on a conspiracy complaint under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Cole v. Gray, </em>638 F.2d 804, 811 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 838, 102 S.Ct. 144, 70 L.Ed.2d 120 (1981). Thus, summary judgment was properly granted to both Judge and Buzzy Dykes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1569-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1569-5\">In sum, the possibility that Buzzy Dykes may have occupied a favorable litigating position by virtue of his father\u2019s position as a state court judge is insufficient to sustain a \u00a7 1983 conspiracy claim against all parties involved in the original lawsuit, where certain of the defendants were immune to suit, and the underlying actions of the other defendants do not substantiate the conspiracy allegations.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1565-7\">. Judge Hosemann\u2019s ruling on the dependency petition satisfies this circuit\u2019s four factor test for a judicial act, in that: (1) the events involved occurred in Judge Hosemann's chambers; (2) the controversy centered around the dependency case pending before the Judge; (3) the confrontation arose directly out of a visit to Judge Hosemann in his official capacity; and (4) the precise act complained of, Judge Hosemann\u2019s ruling on the petition, is a normal judicial function. <em>See Harper v. Merckle, </em>638 F.2d at 858.</p>\n<p id=\"b1565-14\">It is improper and overly formalistic to separate a judge\u2019s prior agreement to decide in favor of one party from the specific act of ruling on the case itself, as the <em>Rankin </em>court did, 633 F.2d at 847, because that separates the rationale be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1502\">*1502</page-number>hind the decision from the decision itself. As mentioned earlier, judicial immunity is intended to protect a judge from being brought into court and forced to justify each decision that he makes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1566-9\">. The \"exceedingly narrow\u201d holding in <em>Harper </em>was that a judge's actions are not \"judicial acts\u201d only when \"it is beyond reasonable doubt that a judge has acted out of personal motivation and has used his judicial office as an offensive weapon to vindicate personal objectives, and it further appears that no party has invoked the judicial machinery for any purpose at all.\" 638 F.2d at 859.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1566-15\">. A judge who conspires to rule in favor of a party in a pending case is a bad judge who is performing improper and unethical acts; but this should be remedied by impeachment, or at the following judicial elections, and not by a section 1983 action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1567-7\">. It was alleged in <em>Beard </em>that the judge violated one Arizona statute requiring a notice and hearing before an order to show cause on a petition for modification could be issued, and another statute requiring that a TRO issued without notice \"define the injury and state why it is irreparable and why the order was issued without notice.\" <em>Beard, </em>648 F.2d at 1268 n. 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1567-8\">. Footnote 10 of the majority opinion clearly illustrates that there is a good deal of uncertainty as to the Florida statutory requirements for personal jurisdiction in a dependency case. Florida Statutes \u00a7 39.06(7) states that jurisdiction attaches to the child and the case when a summons is served upon the child or \u201ca parent,\u201d and \u00a7 39.06(1) provides that personal appearance of any person at a hearing obviate's the necessity of serving a summons. This is a notice requirement, and there is no doubt that Buzzy, who is \u201ca parent,\u201d had actual notice of the dependency proceedings, whether or not he \"constructively\" appeared before Judge Hosem-ann.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1567-15\">. It is interesting to note that Diana never attempted to appeal the November 22nd order. Moreover, that order merely provided for temporary custody, with a full hearing on custody to be held later. Diana appeared at a Florida custody hearing before Judge Muldrew in February, 1978, at which it was determined that Buzzy would retain temporary custody pending an HRS report on the parents\u2019 suitability as permanent custodians.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1568-8\">. Most lawyers \u201cconspire\u201d with their clients, in the sense of discussing and planning the strategy of a case. There is nothing alleged here other than this normal planning between an attorney and his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b1568-9\">A lawyer is not required to inquire into the circumstances under which each facially valid order that he comes into contact with was issued. If a lawyer did find out that a previous order favoring his client was improperly entered he might be justified in refusing to use the order and recusing from the case. But if he merely takes an order sufficient on its face and uses it in advocating his client's rights, there can be no liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1569-12\">. If a prominent doctor, clergyman or industrialist in Brevard County had telephoned Judge Hosemann in the same situation, and an identical set of events had unfolded, it is doubtful that appellant would have gone very far with her conspiracy claim. The law should be no different when a judge\u2019s or a lawyer's family is involved in litigation. Otherwise, we are effectively holding that a judge or his family may not litigate contested issues in court without being subject to a conspiracy charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b1569-6\">ON PETITION FOR REHEARING AND PETITION FOR REHEARING EN BANC</p>\n<p id=\"b1569-7\">Before GODBOLD, Chief Judge, RO-NEY, TJOFLAT, HILL, FAY, VANCE, KRAVITCH, JOHNSON, HENDERSON, HATCHETT, ANDERSON and CLARK, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1569-8\">BY THE COURT:</p>\n<p id=\"b1569-9\">A member of this Court in active service having requested a poll on the application for rehearing en banc and a majority of the judges in this Court in active service having voted in favor of granting a rehearing en banc,</p>\n<p id=\"b1569-10\">IT IS ORDERED that the cause shall be reheard by this Court en banc <em>with </em>oral argument on a date hereafter to be fixed.
