The district court on cross-motions for summary judgment upheld the Department of Correction\u2019s mandate as reasonably related to correctional needs for order and security. Because important factual questions that may affect our interpretation of the relevant District of Columbia statute remain unresolved, we remand for further findings by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-18\">I. Statutory and Regulatory Background</p>\n<p id=\"b107-19\">The Volunteer Services Act of 1977<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (the Act) was adopted in order to reverse a longstanding rule against the use of volunteers in most District of Columbia programs and agencies.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Act established the broad policy under which the District would \u201cutilize volunteer citizens in as many governmental programs as is practicable to serve the interests of the community.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Act provided that volunteers may not, however, \u201cbe used to fill any position or perform any service which is currently being performed by an employee of the District of Columbia Government.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cVolunteer\u201d is defined as \u201ca person who donates his or her services to a specific program or department of the District of Columbia government by his or her free choice and without payment for the services rendered\u201d;<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number><footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in contrast, an \u201cemployee\u201d is defined as \u201ca person who is paid by the District of Columbia government ... for his or her services.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under the Act, volunteers are \u201cconsidered employees of the District of Columbia government\u201d for purposes of insulation from liability for certain torts committed within the scope of their service;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the District assumes liability to third parties \u201cfor tortious injury caused by volunteers under its supervision and control.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Like employees, individuals injured while performing volunteer service are eligible for disability compensation benefits,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and volunteers are subject to policies against conflicts of interest, including restrictions on political activity.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In other respects, however, volunteers are treated differently from employees under the Act. Although certain expenses may be reimbursed,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> volunteers are not, of course, entitled to compensation. Nor are they entitied to retirement or unemployment benefits, or to life or health insurance based on their volunteer service.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-14\">The Volunteer Services Act was not self-executing; instead, the Act became effective upon the promulgation of implementing regulations by the Director of Personnel, acting under the delegated authority of the Mayor.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Under these regulations, the decision whether to use the services of a particular volunteer is left to the discretion of each District agency.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Agencies may supplement the personnel regulations \u201cwhen appropriate,\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> but may not \u201climit, waive, amend, or otherwise modify the restrictions and requirements on the use of voluntary services set forth in [the personnel regulations] without the approval of the Director of Personnel.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The supplemental Corrections Department regulations are not in dispute in this case.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>The present controversy centers principally<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> on the requirement that volunteers execute a \u201cVolunteer Services Agreement\u201d (Agreement), a standard form published by the Office of Personnel. It is unclear whether the Office of Personnel regulations make the use of this particular form mandatory.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Agreement sets out the names of the volunteer and of the volunteer\u2019s supervisor, the duties to be performed by the volunteer, and the volunteer\u2019s duty location and schedule. The Agreement concludes with the following statement:</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\n<em>Declaration of Volunteer</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">I hereby agree to donate my service to the D.C. Government in performing the duties described above. I understand that I will not be compensated for my services and that I am not entitled to other monetary benefits in connection with my volunteer work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">I will accept my instructions from the supervisor named above. I understand that my work assignment is limited to the duties described in this agreement unless otherwise authorized by my supervisor. I will keep my supervisor informed of my progress and will notify him/her if I am unable to report as scheduled or if I decide to terminate this agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-10\">As a volunteer member of the D.C. Government workforce, I will not engage in any form of political activity during the hours I render service for the D.C. Government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-11\">I understand that this agreement may be terminated at any time by the D.C. Government.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-12\">At the heart of this dispute is whether a minister, who for sincere religious reasons is unable to endorse these statements, must nevertheless execute this Agreement as a prerequisite to gaming access to the District\u2019s prisons to perform religious services for inmates requesting his ministry.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-13\">II. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b109-14\">Appellant Elijah Karriem is a minister of the Nation of Islam, also known as the Black Muslims, a Black nationalist sect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>popularized by Elijah Muhammad.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In November 1981 Minister Karriem was asked by Elroy Lewis, then an inmate at the District of Columbia\u2019s Minimum Security Facility at Lorton, Virginia (Lorton), to conduct religious services for inmate members of the Nation of Islam. In accordance with Corrections Department procedures,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Lewis wrote to Lorton administrators asking that Minister Karriem be permitted to hold services on a regular basis within the facility.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Delbert Jackson, at that time the Director of the Department of Corrections, approved Lewis\u2019 request, and Minister Karriem was authorized to enter the facility to conduct religious services and classes on a biweekly basis.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Although the Volunteer Services Act and regulations promulgated thereunder were then in ef-feet, Minister Karriem was not asked to subscribe a Volunteer Services Agreement when permission was initially granted for him to enter the prison regularly in a pastoral capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">Between December 1981 and April 1, 1982, Minister Karriem made approximately twenty visits to Lorton for the purpose of conducting religious services and classes.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Throughout this period, he followed the normal sign-in, identification, and inspection procedures required of all visitors to Lorton. On each occasion he indicated the purpose of his visit as \u201creligious.\u201d In addition, both inmates and outside visitors attending the Nation of Islam services within Lorton were required to sign a second log sheet identifying them<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>selves. Minister Karriem\u2019s entries on the second log sheet consistently noted his status as \u201cMinister\u201d or \u201cGuest Minister.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A60\">On April 1, 1982, for reasons that are not sufficiently clear from the record, Minister Karriem\u2019s visits to the facility to conduct religious services were abruptly halted. It is undisputed that at no time during the period in which he had been coming to Lorton did Minister Karriem violate any prison regulations or otherwise pose a threat to prison order and security, and that neither the character of the Minister\u2019s activities within the prison nor the Correction Department\u2019s regulations regarding the entry of ministers had changed. It appears, rather, that the Department of Corrections had inadvertently construed a March 23, 1982 letter from Minister Karriem as being a formal request for volunteer status.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> For that reason \u2014 and, according to the Department of Corrections, <em>solely </em>for that reason \u2014 Lorton officials decided that in order to continue his visits, Minister Karriem would be required to sign a Volunteer Services Agreement. But as Minister Karriem points out and as the record plainly shows, Minister Karriem did <em>not </em>request volunteer status in the letter upon which the Department evidently and mistakenly relied.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">Minister Karriem was unable for religious reasons<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> to comply with this demand. Four features of the Volunteer Services Agreement were problematic from the standpoint of Minister Karriem\u2019s religious views. First and most important, the Agreement required the signator to stipulate that he was donating his time and services to the District of Columbia government, thus identifying the volunteer with the prison administration. Minister Karriem insists that he is <em>not </em>volunteering his efforts to the District government but rather to the inmates of Lorton as individuals. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>This distinction is important to Minister Karriem because Black Muslims believe that the government is an unholy instrument of the White establishment in the oppression of Black people; \u201c[according to [Elijah] Muhammad, the American government is unjust and corrupt in the eyes of Allah, and therefore it is sinful for righteous Muslims to participate in its affairs.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">The Agreement also requires the volunteer to submit to the supervision of and to accept instruction from a specified official. This requirement presents two difficulties. First, at the time Minister Karriem was asked to sign the form, the name of the supervising official was left blank, but all concerned understood that the supervisor would be Imam Ba\u2019th, the prison\u2019s Islamic chaplain. Chaplain Ba\u2019th is a former member of the Nation of Islam who \u201cleft the fold\u201d; Minister Karriem believes that he is not permitted to associate with an \u201capostate\u201d such as Imam Ba\u2019th.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> After Minister Karriem filed suit, corrections authorities agreed to substitute the prison administrator for Chaplain Ba\u2019th as supervising official.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> This accommodation, however, does not respond to Minister Karriem\u2019s second concern \u2014 the scope of supervision. The term \u201csupervision\u201d is not defined in the Agreement. The personnel regulations indicate that, in most contexts, supervision would include assignment of the work to be performed and instructions as to the manner in which the assigned work is to be accomplished.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Although Minister Karriem is willing to agree in writing to abide by prison rules and regulations, he cannot, consistent with his religious beliefs, accept instruction from any representative of the District of Columbia government as to the manner in which his ministry is to be conducted.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Prison officials have stated, again after suit was filed, that they intend supervision to extend only to the scheduling of visits and services and the enforcement of prison rules and regulations.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Yet, nowhere has this construction of the Agreement been reduced to writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-13\">Moreover, the Agreement prohibits volunteers from \u201cengaging] in any form of political activity\u201d during their hours of service. Again, the term \u201cpolitical activity\u201d is undefined in the Agreement. Minister Karriem\u2019s religion is inextricably intertwined with sociological, economic, and political beliefs.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Consequently, he refuses to sign an Agreement that might prevent him from preaching his religio-political views. The Corrections Department, on the other hand, represented at oral argument that the prohibition extends only to partisan electioneering, an activity in which Minister Karriem has expressed no interest. The Department\u2019s understanding of the prohibition has not been made explicit in writing, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-14\">Finally the Agreement purports to be terminable at will by the Department. Obviously, the Department could not terminate Minister Karriem\u2019s visits for a constitutionally impermissible reason. Yet, Minister Karriem fears that the Department might attempt to terminate his visits because of the content of his teaching and, therefore, declines to place his \u201cwhole ministry ... under the direct power of Government,\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> rather than his God, Allah, by executing what might in the future be construed as a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-15\">As a result of his refusal to execute the Agreement, Minister Karriem was prohibited from further entering Lorton to conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>religious services for members of his faith.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Minister Karriem first attempted to resolve his difficulties concerning the Agreement through the administrative processes of the Department of Corrections.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> When these efforts proved fruitless, Minister Karriem, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia seeking damages and injunctive relief. His complaint alleged that he was not a volunteer within the meaning of the Volunteer Services Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The complaint further asserted that application of the Act and regulations to him\u2014 effectively requiring him to become a non-paid employee of the District of Columbia government in order to continue his religious ministry in the District\u2019s prisons \u2014 violated the establishment and free exercise clauses of the first amendment as well as his fifth amendment right to equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">On October 18, 1982, the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing confined to the single issue of whether Minister Karriem had been treated differently from other ministers with respect to the requirement of compliance with the Volunteer Services Act and regulations.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Following the hearing, the district court rendered judgment in favor of defendants on the equal protection question.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The court found that all ministers had been required to sign Volunteer Services Agreements in order to enter Lorton on a regular basis and that, therefore, Minister Karriem had not received discriminatory treatment.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The court also suggested several reasons\u2014 probable frequency of entrance, relationship with inmates, extent of access within the facility \u2014 justifying the difference in treatment between ministers and other individuals and groups, such as fashion models and musical ensembles, who enter as \u201cguest lecturers\u201d and who do not have to comply with the Volunteer Services Act.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The district court also granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on the remaining issues raised by the complaint. The court held first that Minister Karriem was a volunteer within the meaning of the Volunteer Services Act and regulations and was, therefore, required to sign an Agreement before entering Lorton to conduct services on a regular basis.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The court also rejected appellant\u2019s establishment clause claim, holding that the Agreement has neither \u201cthe purpose [nor] the primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion.\u201d<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number><footnotemark>44</footnotemark> The court found that the Agreement is not directed solely at ministers and is not a \u201cruse to keep ministers out of the prison.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Nor was the Agreement employed selectively, to inhibit particular religions and their representatives.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Rather, the Agreement \u201cis nothing more than an administrative tool to monitor activity within the prison; to ensure a peaceful, orderly environment within the institution, and to ensure that there is no misunderstanding about a visiting minister\u2019s right to compensation for his services.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Moreover, the court held that the Agreement\u2019s restrictions on political activity did not infringe the first amendment right to freedom of speech. Finding that the restriction was limited to partisan political activity, such as campaigning, the court concluded that the stricture was reasonably related to the maintenance of a peaceful and orderly prison environment.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">The court rejected Minister Karriem\u2019s contention that the Agreement violated his first amendment right to exercise his religious convictions freely. While acknowledging that Minister Karriem\u2019s \u201cdesire to enter the prison is religiously motivated,\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> the court held that \u201c[pjlaintiff\u2019s status as a minister does not convert an otherwise permissible regulation into an impermissible interference with the free exercise of religion.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Noting the discretion ordinarily accorded to the decisions of prison administrators concerning access to the institutions, the court concluded that the Agreement was essentially a time, place, and manner restriction, reasonably related to the \u201csafe, orderly and efficient operation of a correctional institution and ... not inconsistent with Plaintiff\u2019s first amendment rights.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> On February 4, 1983, Minister Karriem filed a Notice of Appeal. Minister Karriem\u2019s motion to proceed on appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>was granted by this court,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> and counsel was appointed to represent him on appeal.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-16\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b114-17\"> Minister Karriem raises a multitude of statutory and constitutional claims on this appeal.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> But the central issue before us is whether Minister Karriem is <em>required </em>to be a volunteer under the Volunteer Services Act, and thus must submit to its statutory obligations. Despite the potential gravity of the appellant\u2019s constitutional claims, it is the general policy of the federal courts to avoid addressing broad constitutional issues unless their resolution is imperative in the context of the case at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>hand.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> There is ambiguity in the factual record over whether the District of Columbia is requiring Minister Karriem, and other ministers similarly situated, to sign a Volunteer Services Agreement. As we previously observed, it appears from the record that the Department of Corrections mistakenly imposed this requirement only because of a mispereeived request for assignment to volunteer status by Minister Karriem.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\"> Furthermore, we have been directed to no pronouncement by the Department of Personnel, which is charged with the construction and enforcement of the relevant statute,<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> indicating that all clergy members seeking to minister on a regular basis are required to execute an Agreement as volunteers. As this court was informed by appellant at oral argument, ministers were routinely permitted to visit inmates and to perform religious services at Lorton, and, we may presume, at other District institutions throughout the period prior to adoption of the Act. Ministers operating in a capacity similar to that of Minister Karriem were not considered to be volunteers before the Act was adopted, and there is nothing in the terms of the Act or regulations that woujd suggest any intention to alter the status of such individuals or to force them to become volunteers of the government as a requisite to continuing their ministries.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">Here, appellant presents strong arguments that the Volunteer Services Act was never intended to apply to situations such as his. He points out that the Act defines a \u201cvolunteer\u201d as \u201ca person who donates his or her services to a specific program or department of the District of Columbia Government, by his or her free choice and without payment for the services rendered.\u201d <footnotemark>58</footnotemark> This language suggests that a volunteer must meet three conditions. First, there must be an affirmative and voluntary choice to volunteer; one may not be compelled to become a volunteer. Second, the service must be offered <em>to the District of Columbia government. </em>Third, the service must assist some government agency or program in carrying out its mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>sion. Minister Karriem\u2019s involvement with the prison may well assist the chaplains\u2019 program in carrying out its mission; nevertheless, it seems clear from, the record that it fails to fulfill the first two conditions. He has not <em>volunteered; </em>rather, volunteer status is being thrust upon him as a precondition to his continued access to the facility. Moreover, he does not wish to participate in any government program; he merely desires to extend his pastoral services to incarcerated members of his faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Therefore, it appears that the imposition of a \u201cvolunteer\u201d status upon the appellant was the result of a misreading by the District of Columbia of the letter from Minister Karriem. The District of Columbia has also suggested quite strongly that an Agreement is not necessary in all cases. In fact, Minister Karriem is currently visiting the prison as a guest lecturer on a regular basis without having signed an Agreement.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> On remand, the district court should determine whether, and in what manner, Minister Karriem is presently being restricted by not signing the Agreement. The district court should determine whether ministers can generally forego becoming volunteers if they adhere to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions imposed by the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">So far we have observed that it does not appear that the Act and accompanying regulations necessarily require Minister Kar-riem to sign the Agreement before he can be permitted to resume his ministerial activities at Lorton. But if the Department of Corrections nevertheless intends on its own initiative to require all ministers regularly entering Lorton to execute a Volunteer Agreement, then the constitutional questions posed by Minister Karriem must be addressed. We are not ready today, however, to resolve those questions since the record is incomplete and since the \u00e9x-tent of the burden actually imposed on Minister Karriem is unclear.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">This court has been presented with evidence that the Department of Corrections has already undertaken some steps towards clarification of its policy that appears to ameliorate the conflict between the parties in this case. Further clarification of the Department\u2019s policy may resolve most, if not all, of the factual ambiguities confronting this court, and may even lead to a mutually agreeable resolution of the instant controversy. The district court on remand should establish whether the standard form agreement\u2019s particular language is currently required.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> If it is not, the District of Columbia may consider substituting language that would avoid the appellant\u2019s religious concerns and still accommodate the appellee\u2019s interests in prison security.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Minister Karriem has maintained that he is willing to submit to reasonable time, place, or manner regulations controlling access to and activities within Lorton in the interests of institutional security and order.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">Furthermore, the four specific requirements of the Volunteer Services Agreement, which appeared problematic from the standpoint of Minister Karriem\u2019s religious views, need further factual clarification. Here we neither decide nor urge upon the parties or the district court a \u201ccorrect\u201d resolution of these specific issues. Instead we remand to determine what genuine justiciable issues remain in contention. Such clarification will be essential to any later analysis of the constitutional questions that are potentially at stake.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-13\">First, the requirement that the signator stipulate that he was donating his time or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>services <em>to the District of Columbia government </em>may be modified or not necessary under the Department\u2019s policy. The district court should determine whether such a requirement may be meant simply to identify the volunteer status of the appellant\u2019s work. If so, the Agreement may be modified to state that Minister Karriem was volunteering his services <em>to the inmates </em>of Lorton.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Second, Minister Karriem\u2019s objection to the scope of supervision may no longer be at issue because the appellees have indicated that any such supervision was intended to involve restrictions on time, place, and manner, rather than substance.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> As we previously noted, correction authorities have already substituted the prison administrator for Chaplain Ba\u2019th as supervising official in response to a request from the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Third, the Agreement\u2019s prohibition against political activity was conceded by the appellees to preclude only partisan political activities during working hours.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> The Agreement may need simply to be clarified to reflect this position. Minister Karriem indicates that he has no desire to engage in such partisan political activity as long as he can continue to preach about \u201cmatters of politics, economics, and sociology as well as spiritual matters.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Finally, Minister Karriem\u2019s objection that the Agreement is terminable at will may be met if the appellees modify the Agreement to indicate that the Department could not terminate his visits for a constitutionally impermissible reason, such as to restrict the substance of the appellant\u2019s ministry. Both parties may concede that the Agreement was not meant as a waiver of constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b117-12\">The Department of Corrections has thus far proceeded on the theory that it is obliged by the terms of the Act and regulations to require Minister Karriem to sign the Agreement before he can be permitted to resume his ministerial activities at Lor-ton. As we have seen, this construction is not compelled by the Act itself. We therefore remand to the district court for a determination as to whether the Corrections Department\u2019s interpretation of the Act is required by the Department of Personnel. If such a construction is not required, the district court should determine whether the Department of Corrections nevertheless intends on its own initiative to require all ministers regularly entering Lorton to execute a Volunteer Services Agreement as a security or administrative procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">If the Department of Personnel adopts the Corrections Department\u2019s construction of the Act, or if the Department of Corrections intends to enforce the signature requirement as a purely internal regulation, the district court will need to determine if these regulations permit a revised form of a Volunteer Services Agreement. Alternatively, the District might waive the requirement for those who, like Minister Karriem, are unable for religious reasons to comply, or might substitute other security devices, such as scheduling, searches, and identification procedures in order to facilitate the objectives of prison administrators without engendering unnecessary conflicts. We withhold final judgment on any constitutional objections until the Department has, on remand, been given an opportunity to clarify its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">\n<em>Vacated and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-11\">.

In first amendment jurisprudence, for example, the development of a complete factual record is critical to the task of striking a balance between competing interests. <em>See e.g., Dreibel-bis </em>v. <em>Marks, </em>675 F.2d 579, 581 (3d Cir.1982); <em>Shabazz v. Barnauskas, </em>598 F.2d 345, 347-48 (5th Cir.1979); <em>Burgin v. Henderson, </em>536 F.2d 501, 504 (2d Cir.1976). The statutes and regulations must serve well-articulated security-related interests and be narrowly drawn to accomplish these interests. <em>See Procunier v. Martinez, </em>416 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>U.S. 396, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974); <em>Cruz v. Beto, </em>405 U.S. 319, 92 S.Ct. 1079, 31 L.Ed.2d 263 (1972). In the instant case, however, we do not yet decide any of the constitutional issues raised in the district court, pending completion of a full factual inquiry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"64\">\n<p id=\"b117-14\">. <em>See supra </em>p. 36; <em>see abo </em>Appendix at 214; Appellees' Brief at 12, n. 21.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"65\">\n<p id=\"b117-15\">. <em>See supra </em>pp. 36-37; <em>see abo </em>Appellees\u2019 Brief at 25.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"66\">\n<p id=\"b117-16\">.
