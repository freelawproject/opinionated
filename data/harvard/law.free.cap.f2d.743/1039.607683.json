(Sweetheart) appeals from the judgment entered on the jury verdict in favor 0f defendant Detroit Forming, Inc. (Detroit). Sweetheart claims the district court erred in: (1) denying Sweetheart\u2019s motion to amend its complaint; (2) refusing ac*m^ evidence of actions taken by Sweetheart against other manufacturers of substantially similar designs, and then charging the jury ^ to consider whether Sweetheart, by taking no action against \u00b0tber manufacturers, acquiesced in the manufacture of the dishes by others or abandoned its rights; (3) admitting evidence of the existence of other manufacturers of similar designs; (4) charging the jury that evidence of Sweetheart\u2019s delay in taking action against other infringers could be considered relevant to Detroit\u2019s defenses of estoppel by acquiescence and abandonment; (5) submitting Detroit\u2019s defenses to the jury; and (6) refusing to grant a continuance of the trial. Finding that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to permit Sweetheart to amend its complaint under the circumstances; erred \u00a1n charging the jury that the evidence of Sweetheart\u2019s failure to control other manufacturers could be considered relative to Detroit\u2019s defenses of estoppel by acquiesCence and abandonment; and erroneously submitted the defense of abandonment to the jury, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"abv-dedup-0\">I</p>\n<p id=\"amt-dedup-0\">This action concerns a series of four disposable plastic ice cream dishes which have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>been marketed by Sweetheart for the past twenty-five years. Two are rowboat-shaped dishes for banana splits, and two are bowl-shaped dishes for sundaes. Sweetheart does not have a registered trademark on the dish designs,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but does own a registered trademark on the mark \u201cBanana Boat.\u201d Sweetheart alleged in its complaint that by virtue of its having sold billions of the dishes, and spent considerable sums Advertising and promoting them, the designs have come to identify its products as originating from a single source, Sweetheart.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">During the 1960\u2019s a company called Van Brode Milling Company (Van Brode) marketed a boat-shaped plastic ice cream dish. This practice was discontinued when Sweetheart asked Van Brode to stop. More recently, three other companies marketed lines of plastic disposable ice cream dishes which were substantially similar in design to Sweetheart\u2019s line. These companies are Formfit Plastics, Inc. (Formfit), Douglas Stephens Plastics, Inc. (Douglas Stephens), and defendant Detroit. In addition to the instant litigation, Sweetheart has filed a companion case in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Douglas Stephens.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-5\">On July 19, 1983, six days before trial commenced, Sweetheart received certain documents it had requested from Detroit on January 28, 1983. Although the documents were ones in which Detroit had claimed that trade secrets were contained, a stipulated protective order had been entered by the court on June 9, 1983 which provided that confidential documents filed with the court would be sealed and segregated in the court\u2019s files. One of the documents received by Sweetheart on July 19, 1983 was an invoice on which Detroit had described certain of its dishes as \u201cBanana Boat Trays.\u201d On the first day of trial Sweetheart moved to amend its complaint to include a count for trademark infringement under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1). Detroit opposed the motion as untimely. The district court denied the motion, stating: \u201cI deny your motion, plaintiff\u2019s motion, comes too late. If that\u2019s all the proof you\u2019ve got, you should have had it before then.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-8\">Trial began on July 25, 1983. During cross-examination of one of Sweetheart\u2019s witnesses, counsel for Detroit was permitted to inquire, over Sweetheart\u2019s objection, as to Sweetheart\u2019s knowledge of the use by Van Brode of a design alleged by Detroit to be similar to one of the designs in question. Also over Sweetheart\u2019s objection, Detroit was permitted to publish deposition testimony of Stewart M. Graff, president of Douglas Stephens, and Norman Thrope, president of Formfit, which showed the use by both companies of dishes similar in design to the dishes manufactured by Sweetheart.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-9\">The district court then permitted counsel for Sweetheart, by way of cross-examination, to publish other portions of the same depositions which revealed acts taken by Sweetheart against the two companies. Specifically, the portion of the Thrope deposition published by Sweetheart showed that Sweetheart had notified Formfit that it was unhappy with Formfit\u2019s shipping of boat-shaped dishes, and considered Formfit\u2019s acts to be infringements on Sweetheart\u2019s trademark rights. The portion of the Graff deposition published by Sweetheart showed that Sweetheart asked Douglas Stephens to cease manufacturing rowboat-shaped dishes and subsequently brought suit in New Jersey against Douglas Stephens for manufacturing the products.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-10\">Later in Sweetheart\u2019s rebuttal case, the trial court permitted Sweetheart\u2019s president to testify that Sweetheart had complained to Van Brode about the boat-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>shaped dish it produced, and that Van Brode thereafter stopped producing it. However, the trial judge prohibited Sweetheart from introducing in its rebuttal case evidence of the remedial actions taken by Sweetheart against Douglas Stephens and Formfit because there had been no formal adjudications in those actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-4\">Subsequently, the court instructed the jury to consider remedial actions taken by Sweetheart against the other manufacturers in determining whether Sweetheart acquiesced in the manufacture of similar dishes by others or abandoned its rights in the designs in question. These comments were reiterated when the district court, at the jury\u2019s request, recharged the jury as to Detroit\u2019s defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">The initial question to be decided is whether the district court erred in denying Sweetheart\u2019s motion to amend its complaint. Detroit asserts Sweetheart could have included the count for trademark infringement in its complaint as originally filed, or moved to amend its complaint earlier because the words \u201cBanana Boat\u201d had previously appeared in certain documents which Detroit produced at the time it filed its answer and counterclaim. Detroit further contends it would have been unduly prejudiced if Sweetheart had been permitted to add a count for trademark infringement on the first day of trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1107-8\">Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that leave to amend a pleading \u201cshall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d The United States Supreme Court has admonished that \u201cthis mandate is to be heeded.\u201d <em>Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 230, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962). In <em>Foman v. Davis, </em>the Court stated further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1107-9\">If the underlying facts or circumstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a proper subject of relief, he ought to be afforded an opportunity to test his claim on the merits. In the absence of any apparent or declared reason \u2014 such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc. \u2014 the leave sought should, as the rules require, be \u201cfreely given.\u201d Of course, the grant or denial of an opportunity to amend is within the discretion of the District Court, but outright refusal to grant the leave without any justifying reason appearing for the denial is not an exercise of discretion; it is merely abuse of that discretion and inconsistent with the spirit of the Federal Rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1107-10\">Id. at 182, 83 S.Ct. at 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-11\">No apparent or declared reason for denial of the motion to amend exists in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>instant case. Detroit\u2019s assertion that Sweetheart should have included a count for trademark infringement in its complaint as originally filed is without merit. Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as it existed at the time Sweetheart\u2019s complaint was filed on January 28, 1983 provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1108-4\">Every pleading of a party represented by an attorney shall be signed by at least one attorney of record in his individual name, whose address shall be stated ... The signature of an attorney constitutes a certificate by him that he has read the pleading; that to the best of his knowledge, information, and belief there is good ground to support it; and that it is not interposed for delay.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ak4-dedup-0\">Clearly, Sweetheart\u2019s counsel could not in good faith have included in his complaint a count for trademark infringement before he was aware of evidence to support such a claim. Such conduct would have violated both the letter and the spirit of Rule 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-5\">Detroit also asserts that Sweetheart could have moved to amend its complaint earlier because the mark \u201cBanana Boat\u201d appeared on certain documents submitted previously by Detroit. Detroit fails to cite to any evidence in the record which supports this contention. Our review of the record reveals only two documents, a blueprint drawing clearly designed for internal use by Detroit containing the words \u201cBanana Boat Tray,\u201d and a letter to the secretary of Detroit from a distributor in which the distributor referred to Detroit\u2019s dishes as large and small \u201cBanana Boat[s].\u201d There was no evidence that this distributor ever used the term \u201cBanana Boat\u201d in the promotion or sale of Detroit\u2019s dishes. Rather, the evidence shows that soon after receipt of the letter Detroit\u2019s secretary admonished the distributor not to use the name \u201cBanana Boat\u201d with reference to Detroit\u2019s products, and that this instruction was heeded. Certainly, Sweetheart\u2019s knowledge of these documents was insufficient evidence upon which to base a claim for infringement of its trademark in connection with the sale and distribution of the dishes in interstate commerce. \u201cGood ground\u201d to support the claim under Rule 11 only came later, when Detroit produced an invoice containing the words \u201cBanana Boat Trays\u201d less than a week prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-8\">Finally, the mere fact that the motion to amend was made the day of trial did not unduly prejudice Detroit so as to require denial of the motion. Absent prejudice to the opposing party, the mere fact that an amendment is offered late in the case is not enough to bar it. 3 J. Moore, Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 15.08[4] (2d ed. 1984); <em>Howey v. United States, </em>481 F.2d 1187 (9th Cir.1973); <em>Hanson v. Hunt Oil Company, </em>398 F.2d 578 (8th Cir.1968). The district court made no finding of prejudice to Detroit, concluding only that \u201cplaintiff\u2019s motion comes too late.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-9\">Moreover, the record fails to show any basis for finding that the proffered amendment would have unduly prejudiced Detroit under the circumstances. Sweetheart\u2019s original two counts for false designation of origin and unfair competition arise out of the sale and distribution by Detroit of plastic dishes having configurations which Sweetheart asserts are proprietary to it, including two boat-shaped dishes. The count for trademark infringement in connection with the sale and distribution of these dishes which Sweetheart sought to add by amendment is grounded on at least one of the same acts by Detroit that form the basis of the original two counts. Thus, Detroit has been aware since the filing of Sweetheart\u2019s complaint of the circumstances from which the trademark infringement count arose. Moreover, Detroit was in possession of the document which forms the basis of Sweetheart\u2019s motion to amend until six days before the motion was made, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>and thus cannot be heard to complain of unfair surprise by the inclusion of the additional count. Under these circumstances, Detroit would not have suffered undue prejudice from the amendment of the complaint immediately prior to trial. Since Sweetheart could not have brought a claim for trademark infringement earlier because Detroit did not produce the evidence of infringement until a few days before trial, and since Detroit would not have been unduly prejudiced by the amendment, the district court\u2019s refusal to permit Sweetheart to amend its complaint was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">In addition, Sweetheart argues that the district court committed prejudicial error by refusing to admit evidence of remedial actions taken by Sweetheart against other manufacturers, and then instructing the jury to consider whether Sweetheart, by taking no action against the third party manufacturers, acquiesced in the manufacture of its dish designs by others or abandoned its rights. Sweetheart admits that it was permitted to read into the record part of the Thrope deposition which established that Sweetheart had notified Formfit that it considered the marketing of boat-shaped dishes by Formfit as an infringement of Sweetheart\u2019s rights. However, Sweetheart asserts that all of its other efforts to introduce evidence of actions it took against the other manufacturers of boat-shaped dishes, Douglas Stephens and Van Brode, were \u201cfirmly and emphatically denied by the trial court.\u201d This contention is utterly without support in the record. The record reveals the trial court also permitted Sweetheart to publish the part of the Graff deposition showing remedial acts Sweetheart had taken against Douglas Stephens, and to introduce rebuttal evidence of remedial acts taken by Sweetheart against Van Brode. Thus, even if the trial court erred in refusing to permit Sweetheart to admit in its rebuttal case evidence of the remedial acts it took against Douglas Stephens and Formfit, such error was harmless because the evidence had previously been published to the jury by Sweetheart. However, upon retrial the district court should allow Sweetheart full opportunity to prove all remedial actions taken against other manufacturers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-8\">We also reject Sweetheart\u2019s argument that the trial court\u2019s admission of Detroit\u2019s evidence of the existence of other manufacturers of similarly designed dishes constituted prejudicial error. Evidence of the existence of manufacturers other than the defendant has certain relevance in this false designation of origin and unfair competition case. For example, with reference to a determination of whether Sweetheart had any proprietary rights in the unregistered designs of its dishes, evidence of the use of substantially identical designs by others was admissible as to the issue of whether secondary meaning attached to Sweetheart\u2019s designs. Such evidence is probative of the extent and nature of exclusivity of use by Sweetheart. <em>See Carter Wallace, Inc. v. Proctor &amp; Gamble Co., </em>434 F.2d 794, 802 (9th Cir.1970); <em>Universal City Studios v. Nintendo Co., </em>578 F.Supp. 911, 926 (S.D.N.Y.1983); <em>Miller Brewing Co. v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., </em>503 F.Supp. 896 (D.C.Rhode Island 1980). Thus, the district court did not err in permitting the jury to consider evidence of the existence of third party manufacturers of substantially similar dishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-10\">Related to Sweetheart\u2019s argument that the admission of Detroit\u2019s evidence of other manufacturers was prejudicial is it\u2019s contention that the trial court committed prejudicial error in instructing the jury to consider evidence of Sweetheart\u2019s delay in enjoining the other manufacturers in determining whether Sweetheart acquiesced in the use of the dish designs by others or abandoned its rights in the dish designs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-11\">With respect to Detroit\u2019s defense of es-toppel by acquiescence the trial court instructed the jury in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3XW\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>The defendant, thus, alleges that the plaintiff has acquiesced in such manufacture, sales by the other manufacturers and should now be estopped from asserting its rights, if any it has, in the design or configuration of its relevant containers against anyone, including this defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"afg-dedup-1\">If you should find from the preponder-anee of the evidence that others were manufacturing and selling containers very similar to the relevant containers of the plaintiff for a long period of time, and that plaintiff was aware of such manufacture and sale, then you must decide whether by taking no action against other manufacturers the plaintiff <em>tes, </em>agreed or acquiesced that the others can manufacture its very similar products. If you so decide, then the plaintiff may not now assert its rights against the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4L7\">As distinguished from laches, acquiescence constitutes a ground for denial of relief only upon a finding of conduct on the plaintiff\u2019s part that amounted to an assurance to the defendant, express or implied, that the plaintiff would not assert his trademark rights against the defendant, Carl <em>Zeiss Stiftung v. Veb Carl Zeiss Jena, </em>433 F.2d 686, 704 (2nd Cir.1970), <em>cert. denied </em>403 U.S. 905, 91 S.Ct. 2205, 29 L.Ed.2d 680 (1971); <em>Exxon Corp. v. Humble Exploration Co., Inc., </em>524 F.Supp. 450, 467 (N.D.Tex.1981), aff<em>'d in part, rev\u2019d and remanded in part, </em>695 F.2d 96 (5th Cir.1983). Acquiescence may be inferred from the trademark owner\u2019s affirmative conduct toward the defendant. For example, in <em>Ambrosia Chocolate Co. v. Ambrosia Cake Bakery, </em>165 F.2d 693 (4th Cir.1947), ce<em>rt. denied </em>333 U.S. 882, 68 S.Ct. 914, 92 L.Ed. 1157 (1948), not only was the plaintiff aware that the defendant was using the plaintiff\u2019s registered trademark \u201cAmbrosia\u201d for eight years but also the plaintiff attempted to sell ingredients to the defendant to be used in making \u201cAmbrosia\u201d cakes to be marketed under that name. The court found this to be \u201cactive encouragement\u201d by the plaintiff to induce the defendant to sell its cakes under the name \u201cAmbrosia\u201d, and injunctive relief was denied. Estoppel by acquiescence focuses on a plaintiffs acts toward the defendant, not toward other manufacturers, <em>See, e.g., id. </em>Although Sweetheart\u2019s delay in enjoining Detroit may be relevant to the question of whether Sweetheart acquiesced in Detroit\u2019s manufacture of the dishes in question, Sweetheart\u2019s delay in prosecuting infringers other than Detroit has no rele-vanee to the defense of estoppel by acquiescence. While abandonment results in a loss of rights as against the whole world, laches or acquiescence is a personal defense which merely results in a loss of rights as against one defendant. 2 J.T. McCarthy, <em>Trademarks and Unfair Competition </em>\u00a7 31:14 at 587 (2d ed. 1984). ThuS) assuming that Sweetheart estab-lighed it had proprietary rights in its unregistered dish designs, the fact that Sweetheart may have delayed in enjoining other manufacturers from using the dish designs would not amount to an assurance to Detroit that Sweetheart would not assert its trademark rights against Detroit. The trial court\u2019s instruction that the jury should consider the acts of Sweetheart toward third party manufacturers of similar designs rather than the acts of Sweetheart toward Detroit in determining estoppel by acquiescence was therefore erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"aus-dedup-0\">,. . ,. .. rffms. whether evide\"ce of S7ethearts delfy \u201c <em>^mmg </em>other manufacturers is relevant to a determma-tlon of the of abandonment. With resPect to the evidence of Sweetheart s de-la^ m enjoining other manufacturers, the court mstracted the jury on abandonment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APlk\">If y\u00b0u should find from the preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiff knowingly permitted other manufacturers to use the designs without any control, then you would find that plaintiff had abandoned or lost such rights,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ang-dedup-1\">There has been little uniformity among the courts as to the impact of a plaintiff\u2019s failure to sue other infringers on the defense of abandonment. The line of cases relied on by Sweetheart states that evidence of a plaintiff\u2019s failure to sue other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>infringers is totally irrelevant in an unfair competition case because \u201cit is no excuse for [a defendant] to say that others have been guilty of the same wrong.\u201d <em>National Lead Company v. Wolfe, </em>223 F.2d 195, 204 (9th Cir.1955); <em>United States Jaycees v. San Francisco Jr. Chamber of Commerce, </em>354 F.Supp. 61, 73 (N.D.Cal.1972), <em>aff'd </em>513 F.2d 1226 (9th Cir.1975) (and cases cited therein). Although this theory is appealing because no one should be exculpated from his own wrongful conduct merely because others are also guilty, the view \u201cassumes that the case of infringement has already been proven and that failure to prosecute, and its possible impact on customer perception, is irrelevant to the issue of likelihood of confusion.\u201d 1 J.T. McCarthy, <em>Trademarks and Unfair Competition </em>\u00a7 17:5 at 778 (2d ed. 1984). As discussed previously, the evidence of Sweetheart\u2019s delay or failure to enjoin other manufacturers is not totally irrelevant in this case where Sweetheart has the burden of proving secondary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-4\">On the other hand, two of the cases relied on by Detroit, <em>Denison Mattress Factory v. Spring-Air Company, </em>308 F.2d 403 (5th Cir.1962); <em>Sheila\u2019s Shine Products, Inc. v. Sheila Shine, Inc., </em>486 F.2d 114 (5th Cir.1973) are of no help in determining this issue. Those cases merely recognize the rule that a trademark owner\u2019s uncontrolled or \u201cnaked\u201d licensing of a mark may result in the trademark ceasing to function as a symbol of quality and controlled origin, which has been characterized as abandonment. This rule of uncontrolled licensing of a trademark is inapplicable to the instant case as no evidence of licensing has been presented. The other case relied on by Detroit, <em>Saxlehner v. Eisener &amp; Mendelson Co., </em>179 U.S. 19, 21 S.Ct. 7, 45 L.Ed. 60 (1900) does note the remedial actions taken by a trademark owner against other infringers in its discussion of abandonment; however, <em>Saxlehner </em>is factually distinguishable from the instant case because in <em>Saxlehner </em>the plaintiff\u2019s mark \u201cHunyadi\u201d was found to have become the generic name in this country for a type of water after others had used the name for twenty years without being sued by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-7\">Section 45 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127(b) provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-8\">A mark shall be deemed to be \u201cabandoned\u201d \u2014 (b) When any course of conduct of the registrant,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> including acts of omission as well as commission, causes the mark to lose its significance as an indication of origin.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1111-9\">\u201cActs of omission\u201d causing a mark to lose its significance as an indication of origin have been held to include failing to take action against infringers. <em>Wallpaper Mfgs. Ltd. v. Crown Wallcovering Corp., </em>680 F.2d 755, 766 (CCPA 1982). As noted by Professor McCarthy,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-10\">[I]t appears that the only relevancy of failure to prosecute others is as to the possible impact such failure may have on the strength of the plaintiff\u2019s mark. It is possible that plaintiff\u2019s mark has been \u201cweakened\u201d by widespread use in the market and that such use resulted from plaintiff\u2019s failure to sue infringers ____ Of course, if, through failure to prosecute, a mark continually loses \u201cstrength\u201d and \u201cdistinctiveness\u201d, it will eventually hemorrhage so much that it dies as a mark. That would be \u201cabandonment\u201d through acts of omission ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-13\">In the typical trademark litigation, the relevance of failure to prosecute others is not to \u201cabandonment\u201d, but to \u201cstrength\u201d. The issue is hardly ever \u201cabandonment\u201d, because that requires proof that the mark has lost all significance as an indication of origin. That is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>the mark is completely without signs of life. The only relevance in the typical case of failure to prosecute others is as to the element of strength of the mark. That is, the mark is so crowded in by similar marks used by competitors that the mark is alive, but weakened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">1 J.T. McCarthy, <em>Trademarks and Unfair Competition </em>\u00a7 17:5 at 779-780 (2d ed. 1984) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">The district court's instruction that the plaintiff abandoned its rights by having \u201cknowingly permitted other manufacturers to use the designs without any control\u201d is thus erroneous in this case which does not involve licensing by Sweetheart. Evidence of a trademark owner\u2019s failure to prosecute infringers is relevant to a determination of the defense of abandonment only where such failure amounts to the mark\u2019s losing significance as an indication of source. Id. at 779-780; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-7\">Finally, Sweetheart argues that, even assuming the court\u2019s charge regarding lach-es, acquiescence, and abandonment was correct, there was insufficient evidence upon which the jury could have found for Detroit and thus the defenses should not have been submitted to the jury. Sweetheart agrees with the portion of the charge on estoppel by acquiescence and laches which provided that Detroit had the burden of showing detrimental reliance, but contends Detroit presented no evidence that it relied to its detriment on Sweetheart\u2019s delay in bringing suit. However, the president of Detroit testified that his company advertised its ice cream dishes by preparing window banners, a sales flyer, and certain sales letters. Sums for such advertising would not have been expended had Detroit not relied on Sweetheart\u2019s two and one-half year delay in complaining to Detroit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-8\">In addition, Sweetheart agrees with the portion of the charge relative to the abandonment defense which provided that Detroit must show discontinuance of use by Sweetheart and intent not to resume the use of its trademark to prove actual abandonment. However, Sweetheart contends the defense of abandonment should not have gone to the jury since no evidence of either discontinuance of use or intent was shown by Detroit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-10\">As mentioned previously, discontinuance of use, though the typical evidence, is not always required for a finding of abandonment. A party may be deemed to have abandoned a valid trademark by permitting such excessive adverse use of a mark that it has lost its significance as an indication of origin. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127(b); 1 J.T. McCarthy, <em>Trademarks and Unfair Competition, </em>\u00a7 17:5 (2d ed. 1984). In the instant case no evidence was presented that Sweetheart had discontinued its use of the dish designs since it began manufacture of the dishes in 1957. Although Detroit presented evidence that two other manufacturers, Formfit and Douglas Stephens, manufactured dishes of substantially similar designs for approximately five years, Sweetheart presented evidence that it took remedial action against each of these third party manufacturers. In the absence of any evidence that the adverse use of the dish designs was so extensive that the designs lost their significance as an indication of source, the court\u2019s permitting the jury to consider the defense of abandonment was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-11\">In light of our decision to reverse, it is unnecessary for us to decide whether the district court erred in refusing to grant a continuance of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-12\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1106-6\">. Sweetheart's attempts to register its \"marks;\u201d i.e., its designs, on the Principal Register have been refused to date because in each case \"the matter presented for registration constitutes a configuration of the goods and, as such, is merely descriptive of the goods. In the absence of evidence that it has a secondary meaning or has become distinctive as applied to the goods, it may not be registered on the Principal Register.\u201d Sweetheart has been invited by the United States Patent and Trademark Office \u201cto submit additional evidence of secondary meaning that clearly shows that the matter presented for registration has been promoted and is recognized as a trademark;\" hence, this lawsuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1107-7\">. Detroit also asserts that the motion to amend was properly denied because Sweetheart could have pursued production of Detroit\u2019s confidential documents more vigorously, and adds that \"there was never any request by Sweetheart subsequent to the protective order entered by the Court on June 9, 1983 for immediate production of the documents by Detroit.\u201d The \"egregious\u201d nature of these statements prompted Sweetheart to file with this Court a Motion to Strike these \u201coffending\" portions of Detroit\u2019s brief. The latter statement of Detroit to the effect that Sweetheart never requested the documents after June 9 was retracted by Detroit in a letter filed with this court and thus will not be considered for purposes of this appeal. As for Detroit\u2019s assertion that Sweetheart could have pursued production of Detroit\u2019s documents more vigorously, we find it unnecessary to grant Sweetheart's Motion to Strike because we find Detroit\u2019s claim of undue delay to be without merit in this case. While unjustified delay on the part of a movant may constitute grounds to deny a motion to amend, <em>Woodson v. Fulton, </em>614 F.2d 940 (4th Cir.1980), the record and the documents submitted by the parties with respect to the Motion to Strike reflect that Sweetheart was diligent in its efforts to conduct discovery and repeatedly offered to enter into a suitable protective order to secure the discovery of Detroit\u2019s confidential information. Although Sweetheart forwarded the stipulated protective order to Detroit on May 16, 1983 in the exact form later entered by the trial court, counsel for Detroit did not send the order to the district court until June 6, 1983. Moreover, though the protective order was entered by the court on June 9, 1983 Detroit did not produce the confidential documents until July 19, 1983. Once Sweetheart received the documents it promptly filed its motion to amend.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1108-6\">. This portion of Rule 11 was amended effective August 1, 1983. As amended the Rule emphasizes attorneys\u2019 responsibilities and provides for the imposition of sanctions where abuses in pleadings occur, which \"should discourage dilatory or abusive tactics and help to streamline the litigation process by lessening frivolous claims or defenses.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 advisory committee note.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1111-5\">. That Sweetheart has not registered its dish designs does not make this statutory defense of abandonment inapplicable. Section 1127 provides that \"the term 'mark' includes any trademark ... entitled to registration under this chapter whether registered or not.\u201d Certainly the design of an article can function to identify the source of the article and thus be protected as a trademark, e.g., <em>In re Morton-Norwich Products, Inc., </em>671 F.2d 1332, 1336 (CCPA 1982). Of course, if Sweetheart fails to establish it has proprietary rights in the designs, the defense of abandonment need not be considered.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
