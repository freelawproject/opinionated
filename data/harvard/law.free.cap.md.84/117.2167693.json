Photographs of localities, buildings, etc., are only admissible when there is evidence that they are fair and accurate representations. 1 <em>Greenleaf\u2019s Evidence, </em>sec. 82, note <em>(a) </em>15th ed.; <em>People </em>v. <em>Beiddinsieck, </em>103 N. Y. 487, 500; <em>Blair </em>v. <em>Pelham, </em>118 Mass. 421; <em>Marcy </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>16 Gray, 161, 163. There -was no evidence in this case to show that these photographs were correct and accurate, but on the contrary the testimony of the photographer who took them, is, that he had altered the negatives, and he could not even swear that there were cracks in the house where he showed them in the picture. The effect of these photographs was clearly to mislead the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-5\">The subject of the second bill of exceptions is the ruling of the Court in granting the first, fifth and seventh prayers of the appellee, and rejecting the appellant\u2019s first, fourth and fifth prayers and second and third, special interrogatories.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-6\">The Court below should have rejected the plaintiff\u2019s fifth prayer, because the agreement gave to the defendant the right to extend upwards or increase the height of the wall in question. Either owner of a party wall may increase the height of said wall, and if no damage is done to the wall he is not liable ; he does not commit a trespass by so doing. <em>Lloyd on Buildings, </em>343; <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>50 N. Y. 639; <em>Musgrave </em>v. <em>Sherwood, </em>54 Plow. Pr. 338. An easement for the use of a wall as a party wall may be conveyed by deed and embraces every right incident to the absolute ownership of a party wall; therefore it must include the right to increase the height of said wall. This proposition is fully sustained by this Court in the recent decision of <em>Poultney </em>v. <em>Depkin, </em>80 Md. See also <em>Putzel </em>v. <em>Drovers' and Mechanics' Bank, </em>78 Md. 349. It is submitted that the agreement in this case passes the right or easement to use this wall in question as a party wall. The terms of the same are : the full right, privilege and license to place joists to the depth of four inches, and to otherwise build into and against the westernmost wall of the said Engelina Haber-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>sack\u2019s house, above mentioned, <em>and to otherwise use the same as a party wall or division wall; </em>also to extend said division wall southerly for the distance of about twelve feet further upon said Habersack\u2019s ground,\u201d etc. What construction could be placed on the expression \u201c otherwise use the same as a party wall \u201d save that which is patent on its face. The only possible ground for the contention that every right incident to ownership of a party wall, did not pass, is that the expression of certain specific rights in the grant, intended to be conveyed thereby, restricted the same to those \u2019rights thus enumerated, despite the phrase \u201c and to otherwise use the same as a party or division wall,\u201d and that said phrase was rendered nugatory, on the principle tha.t <em>expressio unius, est exclusio alterius, </em>and <em>expressum facit, cess are taciturn.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-5\">It is submitted that such is not the law, and the principle of the above maxim is merely that where in a grant or other disposition of property, certain rights passed by implication of law though they be not mentioned, yet wrhen the instrument mentions certain of those rights and is silent as to the rest, then those as to which there is no reference are held to be excluded, if there is nothing in the instrument to show that the intention was to include them. See <em>Broom's Legal Maxim, </em>651.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-6\">This is a narrow'technical rule of construction arising from the principle that the intention of the parties will be presumed, from the words used ; but if there be anything in the instrument to rebut this presumption and show that such is not the intention of the parties, the principle has no application: \u201c It (this maxim) is not of universal application, but depends upon the intention of the party as discoverable upon the face of the instrument.\u201d <em>Broom's Legal Maxims, </em>653.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-7\">Although the acts of the appellant may have constituted a trespass, and caused certain injury to appellee\u2019s premises, if the appellee by neglect and failure to use ordinary care and prudence for the protection of her property increased and aggravated damages to same, then as to such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>damage as was caused by said failure and neglect she cannot recover. <em>Owings </em>v. <em>B. &amp; O. R. R., </em>35 Fed. Rep. 715; <em>Plummer </em>v. <em>Penobscot Association, </em>67 Me. 363, refers to the rule but does not decide it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-5\">The Court below should have granted the defendant\u2019s, fifth prayer, because if the jury found the facts therein recited the appellee would have been estopped to assert her rights against the appellant. Suppose for the purpose of argument that the appellant had no right to increase the height of the wall or to extend the same back 12 feet, or to, place his steps where he did, then the appellee knew that he had no right to do so, according to her own testimony, but according to the testimony of the appellant and appellee she made no complaint that he heard of until after the house was almost completed and the steps were put up, and the appellant was under the impression that he possessed the rights to do the acts complained of. This conduct, it is submitted, brings the appellee within the doctrine of estoppel. 2 <em>Pomeroy's Equity Jurisprudence, </em>sec. 805; <em>Md. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gus</em>dorf, 43 Md. 514; <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>96 U. S. 716, 720; <em>Homer </em>v. <em>Grosholz, </em>38 Md. 527; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Trustees, </em>37 Md. 108, 124.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b147-6\"><em>Juliaii J. Alexander </em>and <em>Otto Hunckel </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-7\">1. The 1st exception was taken to the admission in evidence by the Court of photographs of plaintiff\u2019s house. As the defendant himself subsequently did the same thing he ought to be taken to have waived this exception, since a party cannot blow hot and cold on the same question. But since the Act of 1888, ch. 545, at least it has been the constant practice to offer photographs in evidence. The offer stands upon the same ground as the offer of a plat drawn to scale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-8\">2. It will be insisted that the Court properly granted the plaintiff\u2019s prayers and rejected the defendant\u2019s contrary prayers. <em>Washburn Easements, </em>565; <em>Price </em>v. <em>McConnell, </em>27 Ill. 255; <em>Matt </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>5 Taunt, 20; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Otto, </em>40 Md. 15.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>3. The Court erred in granting the defendant\u2019s second prayer in the terms granted. Since according to it, if the steps had been placed ten feet beyond the line of the division wall on plaintiff\u2019s land this would have been permissible under the agreement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-5\">4. The power alleged to have been given in the deed to extend .the wall of plaintiff\u2019s house southerly, <em>about </em>twelve feet was void, and the plaintiff\u2019s 3rd prayer ought to have been granted. In <em>Moale </em>v. <em>Buchanan, </em>11 G. &amp; J. 327/ \u201cabout\u201d was held to go up to the number \u201c seven.\u201d- <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Inloes, 6 </em>Gill 157; <em>Budd </em>v. <em>Brooke, </em>3 do. 231.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-6\">5. The Court refused to instruct the jury that if in extending the plaintiff\u2019s wall southerly the defendant built it materially lower th\u00e1n the height of the wall, he was not protected by the deed, on the ground that the plaintiff could not recover in trespass for an abuse of the authority given by the party. But the authority given was to extend the <em>wall </em>of plaintiff\u2019s house, <em>i. e., </em>the whole wall. And therefore in not building this wall of the proper height, defendant was not acting under the license he had, and the truth of part of his justification-was negatived. Indeed such a limited right to enter, &amp;c., was held in <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>34 N. H. 454; see <em>Lyford v. Putnam, </em>35 N. H. 563, to be an authority given by law.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b148-7\">Boyd, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ath\">delivered the opinion of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">The appellee was the owner of a house and lot in the city of Baltimore which adjoined a vacant lot owned by the appellant which he was about to improve. Some negotiations for the use of the wall of the appellee\u2019s house resulted in the execution of an agreement under seal between them, which was acknowledged and recorded in the Land Records of Baltimore City. After reciting the ownership of the respective properties, Mr. Dorsey\u2019s desire to build a three-story brick building and that he \u201c has agreed to purchase the right to use the westernmost wall of said Habersack\u2019s house as a party or division wall, and the right to build <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>into and-against the same,\u201d Mr. and Mrs. Habersack, in consideration of thirty-five dollars, granted to him \u201c the full right, privilege and license to place joists to the depth of four inches and to otherwise build into and against the westernmost wall of said Engelina Habersack\u2019s house above mentioned, and to otherwise use the same as a party or division wall; also to extend said division wall southerly for a distance of about twelve feet further upon said Haber-sack\u2019s ground; provided, however, the said William C. Dorsey will promptly repair, or cause to be repaired, all damages done to the said Engelina Habersack\u2019s house by reason of the exercise of the rights and privileges hereby granted him,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The appellee, who was plaintiff below, sued the appellant for damages. The declaration, which is peculiarly drawn, contains three counts, and the defendant plead the general issue as to certain allegations and license under the above agreement or deed, as it is called in the plea, as to the others. The plaintiff claimed that the agreement had been altered after its execution, and a great deal of the evidence was on that question, which, however, is not before us. The first exception was taken to the ruling of the Court in admitting some photographs offered by the plaintiff The objection to them is upon the ground that there was no evidence to show that they were correct and accurate ; but that on the contrary the testimony of the photographer was to the effect that he had altered the negatives. But there is nothing substantial in this objection, as there is sufficient evidence of the experience, etc., of the photographer to justify the Court in admitting them, and as both sides had photographs in evidence the jury could judge of their accuracy from the testimony of the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The important question in the case is whether the Court below erred in granting the plaintiff\u2019s fifth prayer, which instructed the jury that if they found \u201c that the defendant built on top of the west wall of the plaintiff\u2019s house a wall two or three feet in height and extended the materials of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>said wall so built by him over the whole thickness of the plaintiff\u2019s said west wall for its whole length, and built upon the plaintiff\u2019s chimneys several courses of brick, increasing thereby the height thereof, then the defendant is not entitled to rely on said deed as a defence against his so building his said wall on the whole thickness of the plaintiff\u2019s said west wall or against his so building on the plaintiff\u2019s chimneys.\u201d The effect of granting that was to instruct the jury that the defendant had no right under the agreement to build on the wall of the plaintiff, or raise it higher than it was. In thus construing the agreement we think the Court erred. The plaintiff was not only authorized to place joists to the depth of four inches and to otherwise build into \u00aband against the wall, but to <em>\u201cotherwise use the same as a party or division wall.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">It is no longer an open question as to whether one having the use of a party wall can build on it. In the recent case of <em>Poultney </em>v. Depkin, decided at the October term, 1894, of this Court, and referred to in 80 Md., xviii, in the list of cases designated \u201cNot to be Reported,\u201d which can be found in 30 Altantic Reporter, 705, the Court said in reference to an agreement that the defendant might have the right to use the wall of the plaintiff\u2019s warehouse as a party wall: \u201c Under this agreement the defendant had the right, upon the payment or tender of the sum agreed upon, to use the wall for the purposes to which a party wall can be subjected <em>i. e., </em>to build upon it or to insert his joist in it or even to tear it down and build a new wall; provided, the plaintiff\u2019s rights were properly protected, or he was paid all damages to which he might be thereby subjected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">It makes no difference whether the wall be partially on the land of each contiguous owner, or only on the land of one, for although the term \u201cparty wall,\u201d may ordinarily refer to the prior case, \u201cA division wall may become a party wall by agreement, either actual or presumed, and although such wall might have been built exclusively upon the land of one.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Werner, </em>40 Md. 20. In this case the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>of the wall was purchased as a <em>party or division wall, </em>and the consideration agreed upon by the parties paid. The special mention of the right to place joists to the depth of four inches and to otherwise build into and against the wall cannot exclude or limit the other and important provision. In contracting for the use of the wall as a party wall it wras perfectly competent for them to determine the depth to which the joists should be inserted, and although unnecessary to state it, as it would have been covered by the agreement for the use of the party wall, the provision to otherwise build into and against the wall does not exclude the general provision. Ascertaining the intention of the parties from the written instrument, as we must do, it is perfectly manifest the plaintiff intended to sell and the defendant intended to purchase the right to use the westernmost wall of Mrs. Habersack\u2019s house as a party wall. If there could be any doubt about it, the recital in the agreement would seem to settle it, as it says, \u201c Whereas the said William C. Dorsey being the owner of a vacant lot of ground immediaaely adjoining the lot above described on the west, and anxious to erect thereon a three-story brick building, <em>has agreed to purchase the right to use the westernmost wall of the said Haber sack's house as a party or division tv all and the right to build into and against the same.\" </em>There is nothing from which we can infer that it was intended to prohibit Mr. Dorsey from building his house higher than the appellee\u2019s. The only possible limitation as to the height that can be inferred is from the recital that it was to be a three-story house, which it is. The agreement protected the appellee by requiring Dorsey to promptly repair all damages done to her house by reason of the exercise of the rights and privileges, etc., granted to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The theory of the plaintiff\u2019s seventh prayer is 'for the most part correct. In view of what we have said about the 5th, the reference to raising the wall might be misleading, and it might be more distinctly brought to the attention of the jury that the alleged loss for the \u201c non-occupation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>her house by tenants \u201d must be occasioned by the damaged condition of the house owing to the acts of the defendant. The defendant\u2019s fourth prayer was properly rejected. It was the duty of the appellant, under the very terms of the contract,-to repair all damages done to the house, and such an instruction would have been misleading. \u25a0 It is not necessary to discuss the defendant\u2019s fifth prayer or the second interrogatory, and we do not understand that the exception to the rejection of the third interrogatory is pressed in this Court.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b152-8\">(Decided June 18th, 1896.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">It is sufficient to say that it would be taking.a very broad view of chapter 185, of the laws of 1894, to suppose that it required or authorized, the Court to have the jury determine the <em>amount </em>of injury occasioned by <em>some </em>of a number of acts done by the defendant. In many cases it might be impossible for them to determine definitely what proportion of an alleged injury was sustained by one of several acts. In this case the alleged damage done might have been the result of building <em>on, into </em>and <em>agaiitst </em>the wall and cutting holes in the same for joists, and not alone from any one cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">As the amount involved in this appeal is very small, we regret the necessity of disturbing, the verdict, but as there was error-in granting the plaintiff\u2019s fifth prayer, which may have materially affected the result, we must reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and new trial awarded with costs to the appellant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
