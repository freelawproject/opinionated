Art. 77, sec. 11, authorizes the State Board of Education to enact by-laws for the administration of the public schools. One of their by-laws empowers a County Examiner to extend a teacher\u2019s certificate for five years from the original date, and provides that a certificate of the first grade may be renewed without an examination. Plaintiff held a certificate dated July 1, 1886. The County Examiner first extended this certificate to July 1, 1889, then to July 1, 1892, and afterwards to June 1, 1897. Plaintiff was appointed teacher of a school by the District Trustees in 1886 and continued to serve as teacher and as principal. In February, 1895, the County Board of School Commissioners passed an order annulling all teachers\u2019 certificates, with certain exceptions, after June, 1895, and requiring a re-examination. Plaintiff refused to take the examination, but was re-appointed principal of the school in August, 1895, by the District Trustees. This appointment was rejected by the School Board. Code, Art. 77, sec. 27, authorizes the District Trustees to employ teachers, holding certificates, subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>confirmation by the School Board.

Terms of Certificate.\u2014No certificate shall continue in force longer than six months from the date of issue, unless the Examiner is satisfied from personal observation of the teacher\u2019s fitness to govern a school and impart instruction. When the Examiner is satisfied on these points he may extend the certificate for five years from the original date. Certificates of the first grade, and second grade certificates of the first class, may be renewed without examination.

Kyd Douglas, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-9\">An examination of Mr. Wagaman\u2019s certificate will show that it was granted to him July, 1886, and by different endorsements (one by Mr. Witmer, as an individual and not as an Examiner) was extended to June 1, 1897. The certificate first issued in July, 1886, was extended after six months, to July, 1889 (3 years), then in June, 1889, to July, 1892 (3 years), then on some unnamed date, was extended to June, 1895 (5 years). When this extension (for 5 years) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>was made does not appear; why for five years, this time, <em>or </em>by what authority does not appear. We did not have the benefit of Mr. Witmer\u2019s evidence on this point; he is not the Examiner of the present board, but the plaintiff, who alone was allowed to offer evidence, might have shown by him when the last extension was endorsed on the certificate and why for five years. But see Code, Art. 77, sec. 63, where the Examiner is empowered to issue the first certificate for five years and no provision made for a renewal. The renewal of certain certificates is provided for in the rules of the State Board of Education, Art. 6, sec. 3. That extends the power of the Examiner, and if legal, must be strictly construed, and does not apply to this certificate. The law nowhere says the Examiner may <em>renew </em>a certificate of three years by <em>extending </em>it to five. But it does appear <em>on the face of the certificate itself </em>that the power of annulling it was reserved to the board. It would seem to be demanded by public policy for the good of the public schools that the board should have this reserved power, and it is so certified on the certificate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-5\">But suppose Mr. Wagaman held a valid or unannulled certificate, how does that justify him in refusing to submit to the examination of all teachers ordered by the Board of School Commissioners ? The power and duty of the Examiner to hold regular examinations of teachers at such times as the board may direct, is expressly announced in Code, Art. 77, sec. 65.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-6\">The same right and duty are conferred upon the Examiner by the rules and regulations of the State Board of Education. Art, 4, secs. 4 and 5. Why did Mr. Wagaman, because he held a teacher\u2019s certificate, think that he was under no obligation <em>to </em>stand an examination ? The law requires all teachers to have a certificate before they can teach. Code, Art. 77, sec. 48, and it made no exception in favor of the appellee. Every teacher would escape by this excuse, and the provision of the law become a nullity. The rule requiring examination of teachers is a necessary one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>for the improvement of the public schools, and the fact that Mr. Wagaman refused it is the be'st evidence that he ought to have been required to submit to it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-5\">The Code, Art. 77, sec. 27, provides that the District School Trustees shall employ a teacher or teachers, subject to confirmation by the County School Commissioners, from among those who hold certificates. This applies to all teachers, and no distinction is made between principals and .assistants. But the appellee contended, and the Court below so held, that the assistant te\u00e1chers are to be confirmed by the School Commissioners upon appointment by the District Trustees, but that a principal teacher can be appointed by the trustees alone' without confirmation ; and for this contention he relies upon inferences to be drawn from paragraphs in the Rules and Regulations of the State Board of Education., We cannot assent to this. The Code, Art. 77, sec. 11, says : \u201c The State Board of Edu-</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-6\">cation shall enact laws for the administration of the public school system not at variance with this article.\u201d The article referred to provides that all teachers shall be confirmed, and makes no distinction between a principal and an assistant teacher; and if the regulations of the State Board provide otherwise, such a provision would be at variance with the Code, and not effective. But do the rules and regulations of the State Board authorize the construction of the appellee ? We think not. In Art. 2, sec. 6, among the general duties of the County School Commissioners are \u201c to confirm or reject the principals appointed by the School Trustees ; to appoint the principals of county high schools and all assistant teachers,\u201d &amp;c. In Art. 3, sec. 3, it is said of the District School Trustees : \u201c They shall appoint a principal teacher from among the persons holding a legal certificate, <em>subject to confirmation by the County School Board.\u201d </em>In Art..5, sec. 13, of the same rules and regulations, it is further said: \u201c All contracts with teachers shall be in writing, signed by the District School Trustees and the teachers; shall be submitted to the County School <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Commissioners for confirmation, and <em>shall not be valid unless </em>confirmedA form of such contract is then prescribed, in which it is stated that the teacher \u201c shall be and is hereby appointed to teach at said school, subject to <em>the confirmation </em>and <em>the requirements </em>of the Board of County School Commissioners,\u201d &amp;c. The foregoing extracts, we submit, make the law on the subject of appointment of school teachers very plain, and we cannot see any authority for the position taken by the appellee and the Court below, that the District Trustees had the right to appoint Mr. Wagaman a teacher, not only without this confirmation of the School Board, but in spite of the rejection of his appointment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-5\">This is not the case where a teacher on duty is dismissed and requires thirty days\u2019 notice. It was the beginning of a new year; a new employment. Mr. Wagaman had been newly appointed by the trustees, his name reported with all the other teachers and it rejected. He could not go to teaching without appointment anew, and confirmation, just as much as if he never taught before. At any rate, being notified in August that he would not be permitted to teach, by the School Board, for the coming year, he had more than thirty days\u2019 notice of his dismissal for cause.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b181-6\"><em>Charles D. </em>Wagaman, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-7\">The defendant offered to show that the School Board on February 15, 1895, had passed an order that all certificates except certain ones named in the order, should stand annulled after June 1, 1895 ; that an examination of all teachers holding certificates included in the above order should be held; and that Mr. Pearson had a personal interview with plaintiff, in which he notified plaintiff of these orders of the School Board. The refusal of the Court to allow this evidence to go to the jury forms the ground for the first bill of exceptions. The refusal of the Court to allow the order of the School Commissioners requiring all teachers to take the examination in June, 1895, is the basis of the second bill of exceptions. The third bill of exceptions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>is withdrawn. And the fourth bill of exceptions is based upon the granting of the plaintiff\u2019s prayers and the rejection of the defendant\u2019s. We will consider the exceptions together. Article 77, sec. 11, of the Code of Public General Laws, provides that the State Board of Education shall enact by-laws for the administration of the public school system not at variance with this article and shall have power to suspend or remove any teacher who may be found inefficient or incompetent for the discharge of the duties assigned him, or guilty of such moral delinquency as unfits him for the office he holds; they shall explain the true intent and meaning of the law, &amp;c. The appellee possessed all the qualifications of a teacher required by the Code or the School Law. He held a certificate issued by the proper <em>authority\u2014Code Public General Laws, </em>Art. 77, sec. 48\u2014and this certificate is still in force unless annulled by the order of the School Commissioners of February 15, 1895.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-5\">But a teacher\u2019s certificate cannot be annulled except by the manner and for the one cause prescribed by the statute\u2014 <em>Code Public General Laws, </em>Art. 77, sec. 51, and there is no pretension that this was done. This general order annulling all certificates was therefore <em>ultra vires </em>and properly excluded from the jury. If this view is correct the appellee possessed all the qualifications required of a teacher, and it was not necessary for him to take the examination and evidence that he did not was properly excluded from the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-6\">That he was appointed principal by District Trustees and confirmed by the School Commissioners in 1888 and has never received notice of dismissal from the District Trustees is not denied; but it is asserted that his appointment was rejected in 1895 when the names of teachers were sent by the trustees to the School Commissioners. Principal teachers are appointed by the Board. of District School Trustees and not by the <em>Commissioners\u2014Code Public General Laws, </em>Art. 77, secs. 27 and 49 ; <em>Public School Law, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>pp. 43 and 17\u2014and when once appointed and confirmed by the commissioners, they continue in office until removed by the trustees after thirty days\u2019 notice in writing. <em>Code Pub. Gen Laws, </em>Art. 77, sec. 49; <em>Ihtblic School Law, </em>p. 17, and <em>State Board decision thereunder; Ibid, </em>p. 41.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-5\">The appellee cannot be bound by the fact that the trustees, without his knowledge, sent his name to the commissioners in 1895. He made no new application for appointment. That was unnecessary, for he held over under the original appointment.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b183-6\">Briscoe, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AA-\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">John E. Wagaman brought suit against the Board of School Commissioners of Washington County to recover for services rendered as principal teacher of one of the public schools of that county. He recovered a judgment of $152.40, with interest from the 29th of February, 1896, and from this judgment an appeal has been taken. There were four bills of exceptions taken at the trial below, three of these relate to the admissibility of evidence and the fourth to the ruling of the Court upon the prayers. The facts of the case are that Wagaman held a certificate dated July 1st, 1886, to teach in the public schools of Washington County, and for the first two years thereafter taught as assistant teacher of Sharpsburg School No. 1, District No. 1. Subsequently he was appointed principal of the school by the District Trustees, was confirmed by the Board of School Commissioners, and acted as such from the date of his appointment. He held a first grade, first-class teacher\u2019s certificate in the following words :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\">State of Maryland, County of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-9\">No. 228.

The plaintiff had notice of this order, but refused to take the examination, stating \u201cthat his certificate did not expire until 1897, and that he did not feel like taking it.\u201d He was afterwards, in August, 1895, appointed principal of Sharpsburg School, but was rejected by the School Board. Notwithstanding this rejection he was re-appointed by the District Trustees, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>entered upon his duties as such principal with full knowledge of his rejection by the board. His salary was refused by the School Board at the end of the school term, and this suit is brought for its recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">In the view we take of this case, it does not become necessary for us to consider all the questions presented on the appeal. Now it is quite clear that the teachers are employed by the District School Trustees, subject to confirmation by the County School Commissioners, and shall be appointed from among the persons holding a legal certificate. Code, Art. 77, sec. 27. The contract of employment prescribed by the rules and regulations of the State Board of Education requires, \u201cthat the teacher\u201d is hereby appointed to teach, subject to the confirmation and the <em>requirements </em>of the Board of County School Commissioners. And it is provided by the 48th sec. of Art. 77 of the Code, that \u201c No person shall be employed as a teacher, unless such person shall hold a certificate of qualification issued by the Examiner of the county in which he or she proposes to teach, or from the principal of the State Normal School, a diploma as graduate of said school, or certificate from the State Board of Education.\u201d And by the 63rd section of the same Article, it is further provided that such a certificate shall, however, not continue in force for more than six months, unless the person receiving the same shall satisfy the Examiner of his fitness for governing a school and his ability to impart instruction in the various branches taught in the public schools; but when the Examiner shall satisfy himself upon those points he shall be empowered to issue a certificate, which shall continue in force for five years, unless revoked for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">It appears, however, that the certificate held by the plaintiff was granted to him July, 1886. It was extended after six months, for three years, to July, 1889; then in July, 1889, for three years, to July, 1893, and then on some date not mentioned on the certificate, for five years, to June, 1897. But is urged that by Art. 6, sec. 3, of the by-laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>of the State Board of Education certificates of the first grade, &amp;c., may be renewed by the Examiner without an examination.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b186-9\">(Decided June 18th, 1896).</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">But assuming, without deciding that the adoption of this rule was a valid and legal exercise of power by the State Board under sec. 11, Art. 77 of the Code, yet we find nothing in this rule in conflict with the view we take of this case. Here the certificate was first extended by the Examiner for three years, then again for three years, and further for the period of five years. This was manifestly never contemplated by Art. 6, sec. 3 of the rules of the State Board. The renewal referred to by this rule clearly means the renewal of a certificate which had been validly continued by the Examiner under sec. 63, Art. 77 of the Code. A certificate of the first grade under this rule may be renewed after the expiration of five years by the issue of a new certificate in compliance with Art. 77 of the Code, but this is not that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The appellee then, not holding a valid certificate to teach, should have submitted to the examination directed by the School Board, of which he had full notice, and failing to comply with requirements of this order, he was not qualified to teach the school under his former appointment. There can be no question that his appointment of August, 1895, was invalid, because it failed of confirmation by the School Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">It follows, then, that, there was error in granting the' plaintiff\u2019s prayers, b\u00e9cause they practically instructed the jury that upon the facts of the case the plaintiff was entitled to recover, and in rejecting the defendant\u2019s prayers which instructed the jury that there was no legally sufficient evidence which would entitle the plaintiff to recover. For these reasons we shall reverse the judgment, and as there can be no recovery by the plaintiff we shall not award a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">\n<em>Reversed tvithout awarding a new trial, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
