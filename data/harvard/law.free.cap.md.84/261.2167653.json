Brown, </em>for the appellees, submitted the case on their brief.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-6\">The children named in the third item desire by virtue of mutual transfers and releases and by releases to the trustees having charge of the fund, and by the order of the Court to relieve the fund of any possible hold thereon under the provisions of the will and enjoy the same at once in proportionate parts, with absolute power of disposition thereof in fee. They have made application to the lower Court to that effect and the application has been refused and this appeal has consequently been taken. The ground of the decision of the lower Court is, that <em>other than the children named are embraced within the provisions of the devise in the limitations over, </em>that the rights of issue of children who may predecease other children are involved. In other words, as long as any of the children survive and as long as it is possible for any of the children to die be-, fore any of the other children and leaving issue, and other children to die without issue, there is doubt as to the ultimate devolution of the property or funds under the will. Besides, as all the estate is clothed with the character of a defeasible fee, ultimately the whole devise may be defeated and there may arise a case of intestacy and those who may at the time sustain the relation of heirs at law to the testator when the contingency happens may be entitled to take the whole estate, the final provision being \u201c <em>until the death </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number><em>of any and all children as may die without issue living at the death.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-5\">The following intents seem to be apparent in this third item or clause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-6\">First.\u2014The intention to give to each and every child named a fee in a proportional part of the property in case they, each and all, die leaving issue living at their respective deaths. Of course this could only be determined by the death of each and all with issue surviving.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-7\">Second.\u2014In case of the death of any one or more of the children with issue living at the time of the death, he or she should be possessed of and entitled to the fee in the proportional part then held by him or her whether consisting of only the original share or said share enlarged by accretions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-8\">Third.\u2014In case of the death of any one of the children without issue living to give his or her share, consisting of the original portion or as enlarged by accretions to the children still surviving and to the issue of any child or children who may have deceased with issue living, the accretions or accumulations in the hands of the survivors being clothed with the character of defeasibility attaching to the original shares until the last child shall have died with or without issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-9\">Fourth.\u2014In case of the death of all except one without issue living and then his or her death with issue living, that the one so last dying should be possessed of, and entitled to, a fee in the whole property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-10\">Fifth.\u2014In case of the death of one or more with issue living and then the death of one or more or all of the others without issue living to give to the issue of the predeceased children the proportional parts with their several accretions, if any, as one or more or all may die without issue as aforesaid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-11\">Sixth.\u2014We hold that in the case of the death of one and then another and finally the remaining child, all without issue living, fhe testator will have died intestate as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>whole estate, his evident intent and purpose being that as long as the eight children or any one of them, or any issue of them live, they should enjoy the estate. In the case of the death of all without issue, the estate given would be defeated, the line of succession as provided in the will being exhausted, and in this event the heirs at law of the testator would take.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b290-5\">Page, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ac3g\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">William J. Anderson died in 188 i, leaving a widow and nine children. After his death his property was sold under a decree of the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County, and the proceeds thereof are now in the hands of the appellees trustees. The petitioners, who claim to be legally entitled to the fund, allege in their petition that they have jointly and .severally agreed that each shall be paid the proportion to which they may now be entitled, and to surrender and release all their several or joint rights of survivorship to the said fund, and to deliver to the trustees such releases as may be requisite to discharge them from further liability. Whether they are so entitled depends upon the construction to be be placed upon the provisions of the will of the deceased. By the first and second clauses of his will the testator declares his desire that William J. Anderson, his son, to whom he had made advancements equal to his full share of the estate, shall not further participate in his property, and that any other of his children to whom he should thereafter advance an equivalent (in his opinion) of his or her full share, shall be considered as if he or she had never been mentioned in the devises therein-after contained. .By the third section he gives his real estate (except the Millington property) to his wife for life or widowhood, and provided for the \u201c moderate and proper support and maintenance on said property for such of his children as may not receive advancement, so long as they shall remain unmarried and obedient,\u201d &amp;c., and at the death or marriage of the widow he devises the property to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>eight children (not including William), \u201c to them <em>and their heirs and assigns </em>forever, and in case of the death of any one of them without issue living at the time of his or her death, I do give and devise his or her share to the survivor or survivors, and this principle of survivorship I do direct to apply not only to the original, but to all accretions by survivorship until the death of any and all of such children as may die without issue at the time of his or her death.\u201d By the fourth clause he desires his wife shall take her thirds only, if she marry again; and that, subject thereto, the devises \u201cover or in remainder shall go into immediate effect.\u201d By the fifth, he directs the Millington property to be sold, and of the proceeds, one-third to his wife, and the residue to the children named in the third clause of his will, to whom he shall not have made advancements. By the sixth he disposes of his personalty, to his wife for life or widowhood, \u201cto keep together\u201d for managing, etc., the real estate, and at her death or marriage to be divided among the children mentioned in the third clause who have received no advancement. \u201c In case of the death of any such child or children before the death of their mother without issue, the part he would take to go to the survivors. In case of the death of any one leaving issue, the issue to take the parent\u2019s place in the division.\u201d And by the seventh and last clause, in case his wife shall marry, she is to receive her thirds in his personal estate, and the bequests to the children to take immediate effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The appellees contend that under a proper construction of this will the petitioners cannot effectively release the trustees, and are not entitled to have distribution of the fund, because the testator intended that the defeasibility attaching to the several shares should continue till the last child died without issue, and therefore to effectuate that intention, in case of the death of one or more with issue living, and then the death of one or more or all of the others without issue, the issue of the predeceased children would take a proportional part of the share or accretions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>thereof of the ones so dying without issue; and also, in case all the children mentioned in the third item of the will died without issue, the line of succession as provided by the will would be exhausted, the fee-simple be defeated, and a contingency not contemplated by the testator would arise, and the property would in that event pass to such heirs at law of the testator as would answer the description when the contingency happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Now, the determination of this question thus presented is purely a matter of what the testator himself intended. If a general intent can be gathered from a fair consideration of the whole will, when taken in connection with the relations of the testator to the objects of his bounty, such intent must prevail, unless some positive rule of law intervene to prevent. Here the devise is to the eight children in fee, as tenants in common, and in the event of the death of any one of them without issue living at the time of his death, then his share to the survivor or survivors. If the word \u201csurvivor\u201d is to be taken in its ordinary meaning, it is obvious that no one can take but one who answers the description of the parties named as devisees, viz., the survivor or survivors of the eight children named in the third clause of the will. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Withers, </em>23 Md. 41; <em>Moale </em>v. <em>Moale, </em>16 Jur. 1010.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Now, to meet this difficulty and to cariy out the intention which it is insisted is to be found in the will, the appellees argue, the word \u201c survivor\u201d should be regarded in this case as synonymous with \u201cother.\u201d It is undoubtedly true that in order to carry out the intention of the testato this has sometimes been done. \u201c But,\u201d says Redfield in his <em>Treatise on Wills, </em>vol. 2, p. 272 (3d ed.), \u201cit seems to be now established by numerous decisions that the same rule of construction will be applied to the word \u2018 survivors \u2019 as to any other. It will be received in its natural and literal import unless there is something in the context or attending circumstances tending to a different conclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\u201cTo construe it as equivalent to \u2018 other,\u2019 \u201d said the Lord <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Chancellor Lyndhurst in <em>Crowder </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>3 Russ. 217, \u201c is a construction which the Court may sometimes be compelled to adopt in order to accomplish the intention which appears on the whole will.\u201d 2 <em>Jarman, </em>648 (ed. 1861).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">All the cases to which we have been referred or examined in which \u201c survivor\u201d has been construed as the equivalent of \u201cother\u201d appear to have been so decided because there was something in the will to make it clear that the testator intended the issue of predeceased children to take, or that some other clearly expressed intention would otherwise be rendered inoperative. We refer to some of the cases: <em>Wilmot v. Wilmot, </em>8 Vesey, 10; Ranelagh <em>v. Ranelagh, </em>2 My. &amp; K. 441; <em>Leeming </em>v. <em>Sharratt, </em>2 Hare, 14; <em>Aiton </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>7 Sim. 204; <em>Marriott </em>v. <em>Abell, </em>L. R. 7 Eq. 478; <em>Badger </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>L. R. 8 Eq. 78; <em>Benn </em>v. <em>Benn, </em>29 Ch. Div. 844; <em>Pomfret </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>19 Ch. Div. 191; <em>Re Usticke, </em>35 Beav. 338; <em>Nevell </em>v. <em>Bodam, 28 </em>Beav. 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">In <em>Twist v. Herbert, </em>28 L. J. R. 490, we have from the Lord Chancellor the following remark. Whether it can be taken as a rule of construction or not, it commends itself as sound and pertinent to this case. \u201c It is,\u201d said he, \u201cnot a safe mode of construction to take a single reason which contributed to a conclusion in a particular case and elevate it into a canon of construction, which is to rule all other cases to which that reason alone would apply.\u201d The words survivor or survivors \u201c are to be taken in their natural or primary sense, except when there is some reason which justly leads to another conclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">' In this case the scheme of the will is fully apparent and is maintained consistently to the end of the instrument. After excluding those of his children, who had received or should receive advancements, and giving an estate for life or widowhood to his widow in all his property, real and personal (except the Millington lot), he devises his whole estate, by several clauses, to his eight children, whom he 'names, in fee, with a conditional limitation, viz., that if any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>one die without issue living at his death his share to go to the survivor or survivors, and the concluding part of the third clause then declares \u201cthat the accumulations and accretions shall be affected by the same principle of survivorship.\u201d Now, we can find in this devise no intention on the part of the testator to do more than divide his property among those of his children who had received no advancements. If one died leaving issue, such issue are to take the parent\u2019s share ; if without issue, then the share is to go to the surviving children. In the sixth clause, in disposing of his personalty, his language is unmistakable : \u201cIn case of the death of any such child or children before the death of their mother, without issue, the part he would take to go to the survivors. In case of the death of any one leaving issue, the issue to take the parent\u2019s place in the division.\u201d It is obvious the parent would take only such share as he would be entitled to at the period of his death ; and if this be so, nothing could come to the issue of predeceased children except that which the parent possessed or was entitled to at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">We do not think there is anything in the language relating to the accretions, which affects this construction. The testator had already stated how he desired the <em>corpus </em>of his estate to go, and now he declares that he desires the same rule of transmission shall apply to the accretions. There is no gift over in any part of the will, in the event of the death of all the children, without issue. He had given the whole estate to them, in fee, as tenants in common, with cross-remainders between them; so that the survivor or survivors should take the shares of those who died without issue living at the time of their death.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">We do not think the argument is sound, that the estate of the last survivor would be defeated upon his death, without leaving issue. The Master of the Rolls dealt very effectively with a contention of this kind in <em>Maden </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>45 L. J. Ch. 572. There the devise was to trustees, in trust for four nieces for their respective lives, as tenants in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>common; on the death of any of them, to the children of the person so dying; and on the death of any without issue, then to the \u201c survivor or survivors.\u201d \u201c Does anyone,\u201d says he, \u201c doubt that a gift to the survivor of ten people, of a sum of money or an estate with no previous gift at all, vests the sum of money or estate absolutely in the last liver. It is quite true, that the last liver does not survive himself, but he survives all the rest, and in that sense is a survivor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Much stress was laid by the appellees upon the cases of <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>5 T. R. 427, and <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Osbourne, </em>6 H. L. Ca. 375. These properly belong to a particular class of cases, in which <em>Waite </em>v. <em>Littlewood, </em>L. R. 8 Ch. App. 70; <em>Wake </em>v. <em>Varah, </em>2 Chan. Div. 355, and many others cited in chapter 47 of 2 <em>Jarman on Wills, </em>may be included. As a resume of them all, that learned author says : \u201cIt may, therefore, apparently be taken as settled, with regard to the cass of cases now und er consideration, that in order to read the expression, <em>\u2018 </em>survivors,\u2019 as meaning \u2018 others,\u2019 there must be a gift over, or some other indication of manifest intention to oust the ordinary interpretation.\u201d In the case of <em>Wake </em>v. <em>Varah (supra), </em>the devise was to trustees, to pay the income equally among his three children, during their respective lives; at the death of each, his share to go to his issue ; and if any child died without issue, then to the survivor or survivors, during their respective lives ; and if all died without issue, then for the representatives of the survivor. It was held there was a fair inference, that there should be equality \u201c between the <em>stirpes </em>; \u201d but this conclusion, it was expressly stated, did not follow from the use of the words \u201c survivor or survivors,\u201d but the next provision supplied the necessary clue, viz., the gift over. But even the ultimate gift over is not always sufficient ground for altering the construction of the words, when no other reason can be found forso altering. <em>Twist v. Herbert (supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">In this class of cases, much importance is laid on the peculiar devise, viz.: that the first taker receives only a life estate, with remainder to survivors\u2014and on failure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>issue, an ultimate gift over. In such cases cross-remainders between the stirpes, would be created in order to effectuate the intention of the testator to provide as much for the issue as for the children. In <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>the Court said that the meaning of the word \u201c surviving,\u201d standing in this context is, that on the death of one child without issue, that portion shall go to the \u201c surviving line of heirs.\u201d <em>Re Corbett\u2019s </em>Trusts, Johnson\u2019s Ch. Rep. 597. But in the case at bar these features are wanting. The children here take estates in fee, in common, defeasible on the death of any one without leaving issue; and there is no gift over, on an entire failure of issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">In this State, however, a doctrine broader.even than that recognized in these cases, seems to have been laid down in the case of <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Withers, </em>23 Md. 18. There the testator devised his real and personal estate to his wife and five children\u2014to each, one-sixth part for life\u2014and in case either died without children or descendants alive at his or her decease, the part of the one so dying to be divided among the remaining children for their lives; in case of death with children, then to the children per <em>stirpes </em>and not <em>per </em>capita; and in case of the death of all the children without issue, over to another, in fee. One of the children died in 1852, leaving children, and in i860 another died, without children ; and the question was, whether under the will, the issue of the child who died in 1852 were entitled to a share of the estate of the child who died in i860. Here then were many of the conditions upon which the English Courts have construed the devise to create cross-remainders between the <em>stirpes, </em>as well as between'the children. But this Court held, that the issue of the child dying in 1852 could not take as devisees under the will, nor by descent from their parent; not by descent, because the parent had only a life estate; not under the will, because the remainder was granted by the terms of the will to his \u201c remaining children.\u201d And no one could take by purchase, as devisee under the will, unless he answered to the \u201c description of the parties as devisees.\u201d</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b297-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>(Decided November 19th, 1896.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Under the will in this case, we are of opinion the petitioners mentioned in the third item took an estate in fee, as tenants in common, defeasible as to each, on his or her death without issue, in which event the share of the person so dying passed to the survivor, so that the last survivor took his estate, including that which survived to him, in fee absolutely. For these reasons we must reverse the decree of the lower Court and remand the cause for further proceedings, in conformity with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\n<em>Decree reversed and canse remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
