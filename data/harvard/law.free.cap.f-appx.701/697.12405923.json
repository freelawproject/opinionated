McKay, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">In 2009, Rashad Akim Lee was charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). The United States notified Mr. Lee that it intended to seek an enhanced penalty under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), which imposes a fifteen-year mandatory minimum prison sentence for those defendants who unlawfully possess a firearm following three or more convictions for serious drug offenses or violent felonies. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). The United States identified three convictions as predicate ACCA offenses: one conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute under Florida Statute \u00a7 893.13, and two convictions for resisting, obstructing, or opposing an officer with violence under Florida .Statute \u00a7 843.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">After Mr. Lee pled guilty, the U.S. Probation Office prepared a presentence report, which listed the same convictions as ACCA predicates. Mr. Lee objected. He argued that his convictions for resisting an officer with violence did not qualify as violent felonies under the ACCA. The district court overruled the objection and sentenced Mr. Lee to the ACCA\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment. We affirmed the district court\u2019s ruling, holding that a conviction for resisting an officer qualified as a violent felony under the residual clause of the ACCA. <em>United States v. Lee, </em>458 Fed.Appx. 741, 746 (10th Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">Three years later, the Supreme Court struck the ACCA\u2019s residual clause as unconstitutionally vague, <em>Johnson v. United States (Johnson II), </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015). Based on this decision, which applies retroactively on collateral review, <em>Welch v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 136 S.Ct. 1257, 194 L.Ed.2d 387 (2016), Mr. Lee filed pro se a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate his sentence. The district court denied the motion, ruling that Mr. Lee\u2019s convictions under \u00a7 843.01 still qualified as violent crimes, this time under the ACCA\u2019s elements clause. It did, however, grant a certificate of appealability, and Mr. Lee filed this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-16\">We review de novo whether a prior conviction qualifies as an ACCA violent felony. <em>United States v. Ridens, </em>792 F.3d 1270, 1272 (10th Cir. 2015). \u201cTo determine if a prior conviction qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA, we apply the categorical approach, focusing on the elements of the crime of conviction, not the underlying facts.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>844 F.3d 1260, 1263 (10th Cir. 2017). For \u00a7 843.01 to qualify as an ACCA violent felony under the categorical approach, it necessarily must have as an element the \u201cuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i). The Supreme Court has described this as a \u201cdemanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>requirement.\u201d <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 24, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Physical force under the ACCA \u201cmeans <em>violent </em>force \u2014 that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States (Johnson I), </em>559 U.S. 133, 140, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010). It refers to \u201cstrong physical force,\u201d \u201ca substantial degree of force,\u201d or \u201cpowerful force.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>844 F.3d at 1265 (quoting <em>Johnson I, </em>559 U.S. at 140, 130 S.Ct. 1265). It suggests \u201cviolent, active crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Leocal v. Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 11, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004) (emphasis omitted)). It does not include the \u201cslightest offensive touching\u201d that might sustain a conviction for common-law battery. <em>Johnson I, </em>559 U.S. at 139, 130 S.Ct. 1265.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Under the categorical approach, the court assumes that the state conviction \u201crested upon nothing more than the least of the acts criminalized.\u201d <em>Moncrieffe v. Holder, </em>569 U.S. 184, 133 S.Ct. 1678, 1684, 185 L.Ed.2d 727 (2013) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). To determine \u201cthe minimum conduct criminalized by the state statute,\u201d <em>id., </em>we look to how Florida courts have interpreted \u00a7 843.01. Decisions of the Florida Supreme Court are binding; decisions of Florida\u2019s intermediate appellate court \u201cconstitute the next best indicia of what state law is.\u201d <em>United States v. Gardner, </em>823 F.3d 793, 803 (4th Cir. 2016); <em>Harris, </em>844 F.3d at 1264.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">There appears to be only one Florida Supreme Court ease on point, and it\u2019s an old one. In <em>Johnson v. State, </em>58 Fla. 68, 50 So. 529 (1909), the Florida Supreme Court reviewed a conviction for \u201cknowingly and willfully resisting, obstructing or opposing the execution of legal process, by offering or doing violence to the person of the officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 529. (The current version of \u00a7 843.01 makes it a third-degree felony to \u201cknowingly and willfully resist[ ], obstruct ], or oppose[ ] any officer ... in the lawful execution of any legal duty, by offering or doing violence to the person of such officer.\u201d) The court held that gripping an officer by the hand and preventing him from opening the door of a room was sufficient force to sustain a conviction. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-9\">The allegation that the defendant gripped the hand of the officer, and forcibly prevented him from opening the door for the purpose of making the arrest ..., necessarily involves ... an act of violence to the person of the officer while engaged in the execution of legal process. The force alleged is unlawful, and as such is synonymous with violence ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">Since then, the Florida District Court of Appeal has held that the State established a \u201cprima facie case\u201d for resisting an officer with violence where the defendant \u201cheld onto [a] doorknob,\u201d refusing to let go, and \u201cbegan wiggling and struggling, in an effort to free himself.\u201d <em>State v. Green, </em>400 So.2d 1322, 1323-24 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1981) (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Wright v. State, </em>681 So.2d 852, 853-54 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1996) (holding that defendant\u2019s struggling, kicking, and flailing iimbs was sufficient to support a \u00a7 843.01 conviction); <em>Miller v. State, </em>636 So.2d 144, 151 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1994) (affirming case where defendant \u201cscuffled\u201d with police officers after he had been arrested, handcuffed, and placed in the back seat of the officers\u2019 patrol car); <em>Kaiser v. State, </em>328 So.2d 570, 571 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1976) (where defendant was convicted after a \u201cscuffle\u201d with a police officer). More recently, the Florida District Court of Appeal acknowledged that it was \u201cundisputed that an act of violence occurred\u201d where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>defendant, fleeing from police officers, \u201cput his truck in drive and sped off,\u201d and in doing so clipped an officer\u2019s hand with the 'truck\u2019s rearview mirror. <em>Yarusso v. </em>State, 942 So.2d 939, 941 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">The United States maintains that <em>Green </em>should not skew our understanding of the \u201cminimum conduct criminalized\u201d by \u00a7 843.01, arguing that the decision \u201cmust be viewed in its appropriate appellate context \u2014 i.e., after the trial court\u2019s order of dismissal, in which the <em>Green </em>court had' to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state and draw inferences against the defendant.\u201d (Appellee\u2019s Br. at 13.) It is true the court said that the \u201cambiguity\u201d of \u201cwiggling and struggling\u201d \u201cprevents a determination by the trial court that Green\u2019s resistance was or was not, as a matter of law, with violence.\u201d' <em>Green, </em>400 So.2d at 1323. But the opinion did not end there.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The court continued: \u201cConstrued in the light most favorable to the state the facts\u201d: \u2014 i.e. \u201cwiggling and struggling\u201d \u2014 \u201cestablish a prima facie case of resisting arrest with violence.\u201d In this context, establishing a prima facie case means that \u201ca reasonable jury could find the defendant guilty of the charged crime under the most favorable construction of the evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Benjamin, </em>187 So.3d 352, 354 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2016) (emphasis omitted); <em>accord Prima Facie Case, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(10th ed. 2014) (defining \u201cpri-ma facie case\u201d.as \u201c[a] party\u2019s production of enough evidence to allow the fact-trier to infer the fact at issue and rule in the party\u2019s favor.\u201d). Thus, a \u201cfavorable construction\u201d by a \u201creasonable jury\u201d of evidence that a defendant held onto a doorknob and \u201cwiggled and struggled\u201d during an arrest is enough to sustain a conviction under \u00a7 843.01. Even construing the facts in favor of the State, there are only so many reasonable inferences \u201cwiggling and struggling\u201d can be read to support. A reasonable jury could not, for example, construe \u201cwiggling and struggling\u201d to mean that there was a brawl.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">The next question is whether conduct like wiggling and struggling, <em>Green, </em>400 So.2d at 1323, or clipping an officer\u2019s hand with a rearview mirror while speeding off in a truck, <em>Yarusso, </em>942 So.2d at 941, constitutes the \u201cuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\u201d \u2014 that is, \u201cviolent force\u201d \u2014 \u201cagainst the person of another.\u201d We recently considered whether a comparable federal criminal statute that makes it unlawful to \u201cforcibly assault[], resist[], oppose[], impede[], intimidate[ ], or interfere[ ] with\u201d a federal employee or officer while he or she is performing official duties qualifies as a predicate ACCA offense. <em>United States v. Ama, </em>No. 16-4039, 684 Fed.Appx. 736, 740-42, 2017 WL 1325247, at *4 (10th Cir. Apr. 11, 2017) (reviewing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111(a)). We began by noting that \u201can offense may be <em>forcible </em>even in the absence of physical force,\u201d i.e., violent force. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Romero-Hernandez, </em>505 F.3d 1082, 1089 (10th Cir. 2007)) (emphasis added). That is, \u201c[e]ven minor contact, such as \u2018laying one\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>finger on another person without lawful justification\u2019 is forcible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Romero-Hernandez, </em>505 F.3d at 1088) (brackets omitted). Next, we looked to what conduct had \u201cbeen deemed sufficient to sustain a conviction for a \u00a7 111(a) felony: spitting and throwing liquid substances on a federal employee; chasing after and bumping into a federal employee so long as some amount of force is used; and jolting a federal employee\u2019s arm, again, so long as some amount of force is used.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and quotation marks omitted). Based on this, we concluded that \u201cmere forcible contact suffices to sustain a conviction for a \u00a7 111(a) felony,\u201d and that, accordingly, \u201ca felony conviction under \u00a7 111(a) is not a violent felony under the ACCA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>684 Fed.Appx. at 742, 2017 WL 1325247 at *5.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The Ninth Circuit came to a similar conclusion about Arizona\u2019s resisting-arrest offense, which is analogous to \u00a7 843.01. <em>United States v. Flores-Cordero, </em>723 F.3d 1085, 1088 (9th Cir. 2013). The Arizona statute defines resisting arrest in relevant part as \u201c[u]sing or threatening to use physical force against the peace officer or another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1087. The Ninth Circuit relied on an Arizona Court of Appeals case where \u201cthe criminal prosecution was prompted by the defendant\u2019s struggle to keep from being handcuffed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>State v. Lee, </em>217 Ariz. 514, 176 P.3d 712, 713 (Ct. App. 2008)). There, the defendant had \u201cjerked her arm away\u201d from one arresting officer, \u201ccausing [the officer] to lose his balance,\u201d and the arresting officers and defendant \u201cfell to the ground.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>176 P.3d at 713. While the defendant \u201cwas on the ground she struggled to keep the officers from placing her arms behind her back before they finally handcuffed her. Once handcuffed, [the defendant] kicked her legs, trying to prevent the officers from gaining control of her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Ninth Circuit found that this conduct \u201cwhich could be characterized as a \u2018minor scuffle,\u2019 did not necessarily involve force capable of inflicting pain or causing injury as contemplated by the Supreme Court\u2019s definition of violence in <em>[Johnson </em>I].\u201d <em>Flores-Cordero, </em>723 F.3d at 1088. Accordingly, it held, the statute \u201ccannot be considered categorically a crime of violence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Furthermore, there does not seem to be an appreciable difference, for the purpose of the ACCA, between wiggling and struggling during an arrest and struggling and grabbing during a robbery, which we have recognized does not arise to the requisite level of force. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Nicholas, </em>No. 16-3043, 686 Fed.Appx. 570, 574-76, 2017 WL 1429788, at *4 (10th Cir. Apr. 24, 2017) (discussing with approval <em>United States v. Bell, </em>840 F.3d 963, 964-67 (8th Cir. 2016), where the Eighth Circuit held that bumping a victim and yanking her purse after a \u201cslight struggle\u201d was conduct \u201cfalling short of violent force\u201d); <em>cf. United States v. Thomas, </em>849 F.3d 906, 909 (10th Cir. 2017) (distinguishing between a push and \u201can aggressive\u201d push for a robbery conviction under the Hobbs Act, which requires \u201cviolent force\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">This is a close call. Often, the application of the ACCA\u2019s mandatory minimum of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment turns on parsing near-synonyms in decades-old opinions, opinions whose authors did not contemplate that such a loss of liberty would depend on whether the offense conduct was characterized as a bump or a jolt or a shove, or something more. Having compared the minimum culpable conduct criminalized by \u00a7 843.01 to similar forcible conduct deemed not to involve <em>violent </em>force, we conclude that a conviction under \u00a7 843.01 does not qualify as an ACCA predicate. Conduct like \u201cwiggling and straggling,\u201d \u201cscuffling\u201d during an arrest, and clipping an officer\u2019s hand while fleeing does not involve \u201ca substantial degree of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>force\u201d \u2014 that is, violent force \u2014 \u201cagainst the person of another,\u201d but is instead more akin to struggling to keep from being handcuffed, <em>Flores-Cordero, </em>723 F.3d at 1088, pushing the shoulder of a store clerk during a robbery and causing the clerk to fall onto overstock shelves, <em>Gardner, </em>823 F.3d at 804, chasing after and bumping into an individual with some degree of force, <em>Ama, </em>684 Fed.Appx. at 740-42, 2017 WL 1325247 at *4, or snatching a purse from a victim\u2019s arm, <em>Nicholas, </em>686 Fed.Appx. at 574-76, 2017 WL 1429788 at *4. Therefore, consistent with those opinions, we hold that a conviction under \u00a7 843.01 does not qualify as an ACCA predicate, and we REVERSE and REMAND for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b720-9\"> Neither party has requested oral argument, After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel agrees that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. See Fed, R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G); The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b722-6\">. For this reason, we disagree with the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision to discount <em>Green </em>in holding that a conviction under \u00a7 843.01 is an ACCA predicate. <em>United States v. Romo-Villalobos, </em>674 F.3d 1246, 1249 (11th Cir. 2012). The Eleventh Circuit gave short shrift to <em>Green </em>for the same reason as the United States does here, i.e., the procedural posture. The court emphasized instead other Florida ' cases where defendants had engaged in more substantial, and more violent, conduct. <em>See Romo-Villalobos, </em>674 F.3d at 1249 (citing cases). But, our job is not to'find what land of conduct is most routinely prosecuted, and evaluate <em>that. </em>Under the categorical approach, we consider only the \u201cminimum conduct criminalized,\u201d not the typical conduct punished. <em>See Moncrieffe, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1685.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
