Tymkovich, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">Esteban Magallon-Maldonado<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion more than one year after his conviction became final. He acknowledges that the statutory limitations period had run but asserts he is entitled to equitable tolling. The district court disagreed and dismissed his motion as untimely. Mr. Magallon-Maldonado now seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) from this court. Because reasonable jurists would not find the district court\u2019s procedural ruling debatable, we deny his request. <em>See, e.g., Coppage v. McKune, </em>534 F.3d 1279, 1281 (10th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">Mr. Magallon-Maldonado does not dispute that he failed to meet the statutory deadline. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(1) (requiring motions to be filed within one year of \u201cthe date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final\u201d). Instead, he asserts equitable tolling. But like the district court before us, we find no basis to apply that doctrine. Equitable tolling is appropriate only if the prisoner shows \u201c(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way.\u201d <em>Holland v. Florida, </em>560 U.S. 631, 649, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010). For example, we once granted equitable tolling when prison officials effected \u201ca complete confiscation of [the inmate\u2019s] legal materials just before his filing deadline\u201d despite his \u201cmultiple requests\u201d for their return. <em>United States v. Gabaldon, </em>522 F.3d 1121, 1125-27 (10th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-12\">After reviewing the record, we find no extraordinary circumstance here. Mr. Ma-gallon-Maldonado claims that delayed and incorrect advice from his prison counselor and case manager prevented him from obtaining the necessary documents to prepare his motion. In particular, he says no one advised him to contact the clerk of the district court for documents until his new case manager did so after the limitations period had already run. We think these allegations, show no more than the \u201cnormal difficulties in obtaining records and evidence,\u201d which do not meet the \u201chigh standard of extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Reed v. Timme, </em>389 Fed.Appx. 850, 853 (10th Cir. 2010); <em>see also United States v. Wilson, </em>631 Fed.Appx. 623, 625 (10th Cir. 2015), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 2532, 195 L.Ed.2d 858 (2016). And we do not see how unhelpful advice from a case manager can constitute an extraordinary circumstance when even negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>by an inmate\u2019s habeas <em>counsel </em>does not, <em>see Fleming v. Evans, </em>481 F.3d 1249, 1255 (10th Cir. 2007). Finally, the fact that Mr. Magallon-Maldonado could have asked the clerk of the district court to send the documents he needed (as indeed he did successfully after the limitations period had expired) fatally undermines his claim of an extraordinary circumstance standing in his way.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">For these reasons, we DENY the request for a COA and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b750-10\"> After examining the brief and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b750-16\">.
