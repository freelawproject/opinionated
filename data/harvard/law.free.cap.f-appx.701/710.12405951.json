McHugh, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">George Anthony Autobee, through counsel, seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate his sentence. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a), we deny Mr. Autobee\u2019s request for a COA and dismiss this appeal in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b733-14\">Mr, Autobee pled guilty and was convicted of two counts of using a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). The predicate crime of violence was armed bank robbery, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), (d). In 2006, Mr. Autobee was sentenced to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 1 and 240 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 2, for a total prison term of 300 months. Mr. Autobee did not file a direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-15\">On June 20, 2016, Mr. Autobee filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion requesting that the district court vacate his sentence based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015). In <em>Johnson, </em>which issued on June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court held that the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) is unconstitutionally vague. <em>Id. </em>at 2557.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ACCA\u2019s residual clause defines a \u201cviolent felony\u201d as a felony that \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (2) (B) (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-18\">Relying on <em>Johnson, </em>Mr. Autobee argued in his motion that armed bank robbery is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3). Section 924(c)(3) defines \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as a felony that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-19\">(A) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-20\">(B) by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>son or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AU6g\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(c)(3). Mr. Autobee claimed that armed bank robbery does not constitute a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A), also known as the elements clause, and that he was therefore necessarily convicted under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), also known as the risk of force clause. Mr. Autobee further maintained that the risk of force clause is unconstitutionally vague because of its similarity to the ACCA\u2019s residual clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">In response, the government contended that Mr, Autobee\u2019s motion is untimely because it was filed more than one year after the judgment of conviction became final. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(1). And, even though Mr. Autobee filed his motion within one year of <em>Johnson, </em>the government claimed that <em>Johnson </em>did not establish the right Mr. Autobee now asserts, i.e., that \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) is unconstitutionally vague. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(3). The government further argued that, even if Mr. Au-tobee\u2019s motion is timely, \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) is not unconstitutionally vague after <em>Johnson. </em>And even if it is, the government asserted that armed bank robbery is still a crime of violence under the elements clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">The district court agreed with the government and denied Mr. Autobee\u2019s motion. The court first ruled that Mr. Autobee\u2019s motion is untimely because he filed it more than one year after the judgment of conviction became final and <em>Johnson </em>did not establish the right Mr. Autobee now asserts. But the court also ruled that even if his motion were deemed timely and the risk of force clause assumed to be invalid, Mr. Autobee could not prevail because armed bank robbery is a crime of violence under the elements clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">Mr. Autobee now seeks a COA so he can appeal the district court\u2019s ruling. Below, we first provide the legal standard governing the issuance of a COA. We then analyze the timeliness of Mr. Autobee\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">A. <em>Certif\u00edcate of Appealability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-11\">A prisoner challenging a district court\u2019s denial of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion must first obtain a COA as a jurisdictional prerequisite to proceed with an appeal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B); <em>see Clark v. Oklahoma, </em>468 F.3d 711, 713 (10th Cir. 2006) (\u201cA COA is a jurisdictional pre-requisite to our review.\u201d). We will issue a COA \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Where a district court denies a petition on procedural grounds \u2014 such as untimeliness \u2014 without reaching the merits of the underlying constitutional claims, a prisoner must satisfy a two-part standard to obtain a COA. He must show \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right <em>and </em>that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (emphasis added). The prisoner must overcome both hurdles, as \u201c[e]ach component ... is part of a threshold inquiry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 485, 120 S.Ct. 1595.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-12\">Instead of addressing the threshold requirements in order, we may \u201cresolve the issue whose answer is more apparent from the. record and arguments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because we ordinarily \u201cwill not pass upon a constitutional question ... if there is also present some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of,\u201d we generally resolve procedural issues first. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWhere a plain procedural bar is present and the district court is correct to invoke it to dispose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>the case, a reasonable jurist could not conclude either that the district court erred in dismissing the petition or that the petitioner should be allowed to proceed further.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595. But if we find that reasonable jurists could debate the resolution of the procedural issues, we must then consider whether the prisoner\u2019s motion states valid constitutional claims. In doing so, we \u201csimply take a quick look at the face of the [petition] to determine whether the petitioner has facially alleged the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Paredes v. Atherton, </em>224 F.3d 1160, 1161 (10th Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). We are limited to \u201can overview of the claims in the habeas petition and a general assessment of their merits,\u201d rather than \u201cfull consideration of the factual or legal bases adduced in support of the claims.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>see also Buck v. Davis, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 137 S.Ct. 759, 773, 197 L.Ed.2d 1 (2017) (\u201cWhen a court of appeals sidesteps the COA process by first deciding the merits of an appeal, and then justifying its denial of a COA based on its adjudication of the actual merits, it is in essence deciding an appeal without jurisdiction.\u201d (quoting <em>Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 336-37, 123 S.Ct. 1029)).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Here, after carefully considering the district court\u2019s order and the record on appeal, we conclude that Mr. Autobee is not entitled to a COA to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion because reasonable jurists could not debate whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling. Accordingly, we deny Mr. Autobee\u2019s request for a COA and dismiss his appeal for the reasons set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">B. <em>Timeliness of Mr. Autobee\u2019s Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">Mr. Autobee would ordinarily have one year to file his \u00a7 2255 motion from \u201cthe date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(1). That deadline has come and gone, as Mr. Autobee filed his motion almost ten years after his conviction became final. Mr. Au-tobee therefore relies on \u00a7 2255(f)(3), under which the one-year period runs from \u201cthe date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.\u201d Mr. Autobee filed his motion less than one year after the Court decided <em>Johnson, </em>so the issue is whether reasonable jurists could debate the district court\u2019s conclusion that <em>Johnson </em>did not establish the right Mr. Autobee now asserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">Recall that the Court in <em>Johnson </em>invalidated the ACCA\u2019s residual clause for being unconstitutionally vague. The residual clause defines a \u201cviolent felony\u201d as a felony that \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). This provision is similar, but not identical, to the risk of force clause in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), which defines a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as a felony \u201cthat by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-12\">Mr. Autobee argues that <em>Johnson </em>supplies the right asserted because there is no meaningful distinction between the ACCA\u2019s residual clause and the risk of force clause in \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B). In support, he cites <em>Golicov v. Lynch, </em>837 F.3d 1065 (10th Cir. 2016). In <em>Golicov, </em>we held that the risk of force clause in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b) is unconstitutionally vague under the principles announced in <em>Johnson. Id. </em>at 1072. The risk of force clause in \u00a7 16(b) is identical to the risk of force clause in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>\u00a7 924(c)(3)(B). Thus, it is reasonable to argue that we would similarly extend the reasoning of <em>Johnson </em>to invalidate the risk of force clause in \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">But in determining the timeliness of Mr. Autobee\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, the question is not whether a court of appeals has recognized the right at issue, but instead whether the Supreme Court itself has done so. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(3) (measuring the one-year filing deadline from \u201cthe date on which the right asserted was initially recognized <em>by the Supreme Court, </em>if that right has been newly recognized <em>by the Supreme Court </em>...\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>E.J.R.E. v. United States, </em>453 F.3d 1094, 1098 (8th Cir. 2006) (stating that \u201ca decision taken from a federal court of appeals does not provide an independent basis to trigger the one-year statute of limitations provided under [\u00a7 2255(f)(3)]\u201d). Accordingly, our extension of <em>Johnson </em>to \u00a7 16(b) is not determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Rather, the question is whether Mr. Au-tobee asserts the same right announced in <em>Johnson </em>with a different application, or instead a new right that the Supreme Court has yet to recognize. A right is \u201cnew\u201d if it is \u201cnot <em>dictated </em>by precedent.\u201d <em>Chaidez v. United States, </em>568 U.S. 342, 133 S.Ct. 1103, 1107, 185 L.Ed.2d 149 (2013). And a right is \u201cdictated\u201d by precedent only if it is \u201capparent to all reasonable jurists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, Mr. Autobee\u2019s motion is time-barred unless <em>Johnson </em>dictates, or compels, the invalidation of the risk of force clause in \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Even if we were to conclude that the reasoning of <em>Johnson </em>should be extended to invalidate \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) \u2014 which is not itself obvious even after holding that \u00a7 16(b) is unconstitutional \u2014 it is far from \u201capparent to all reasonable jurists\u201d that \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) is unconstitutional under <em>Johnson, </em>as evidenced by the federal courts of appeals that have rejected vagueness challenges to \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) predicated on <em>Johnson. See United States v. Prickett, </em>839 F.3d 697, 699-700 (8th Cir. 2016); <em>United States v. Hill, </em>832 F.3d 135, 145-50 (2d Cir. 2016); <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>814 F.3d 340, 375-79 (6th Cir. 2016). As a result, <em>Johnson </em>does not dictate the right Mr. Autobee asserts, as he seeks an altogether new right the Supreme Court has yet to recognize. Because \u00a7 2255(f)(3) contemplates a new right recognized by the Supreme Court, rather than by a lower court, he may not avail himself of that provision. And no reasonable jurist could debate the district court\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Autobee\u2019s motion is untimely because he filed it more than one year after the date his conviction became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b736-12\">For the reasons stated above, we conclude that reasonable jurists could not debate that the district court correctly denied Mr. Autobee\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion as untimely. We thus deny Mr. Autobee\u2019s request for a COA and dismiss this appeal in its entirety.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b733-12\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32.1 and 10th Circuit Rule 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b733-21\">.
