Tymkovich, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b744-22\">James Meridyth, a convicted drug trafficker, has twice moved to reduce his prison sentence based on retroactive amendments to his Sentencing Guideline range. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>The district court partially granted both of Meridyth\u2019s motions. The first time, the district court reduced his sentence by one-sixth. The district court cited Meridyth\u2019s extensive criminal history and disciplinary infractions in prison as reasons for not reducing his sentence further. Meridyth appealed and we affirmed the sentence-reduction order.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">After a second request for a sentence reduction, the district court again reduced Meridyth\u2019s sentence by one-sixth, citing the explanation it provided the first time. Meridyth contests the explanation the district court supplied, arguing he has avoided prison disciplinary infractions since his first sentence reduction. In his view, that means he should not have received the same proportional reduction he did the first time, when that reduction expressly accounted for his infractions. He thus argues, in effect, that the district court was legally required to credit his improved conduct in prison by granting him a proportionally more generous reduction than the first reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">We disagree, and AFFIRM the district court\u2019s sentence-reduction order. Nothing indicates the district court abused its discretion when it reduced Meridyth\u2019s sentence by one-sixth. No legal authority requires the district court to grant a proportionally more generous reduction when a prisoner\u2019s disciplinary record improves. Moreover, the district court adequately explained the basis for its sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">A jury convicted Meridyth of three counts of violating federal drug trafficking laws. The district court imposed a 360-month prison sentence, the Sentencing Guidelines minimum. We subsequently affirmed his conviction. <em>See United States v. Meridyth, </em>364 F.3d 1181 (10th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">In 2014, after the Sentencing Commission amended the Guidelines to reduce the relevant offense levels, Meridyth sought a sentence reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3682(c)(2). Although the amendments lowered Meridyth\u2019s guidelines range to 235 \u2014 293 months, the district court ultimately reduced Meridyth\u2019s sentence from 360 months to 300 months \u2014 a one-sixth reduction. The court explained its decision in a detailed memorandum opinion, citing Meridyth\u2019s extensive criminal history and disciplinary infractions in prison since commencing his imprisonment in 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">Meridyth then appealed the sentence-reduction order, arguing the district court abused its discretion by sentencing him above his amended guidelines range. We disagreed, finding no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s reasoning or the sentence imposed. <em>United States v. Meridyth, </em>573 Fed.Appx. 791 (10th Cir. 2014) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">After his first appeal, the Sentencing Commission amended the Guidelines to further reduce the relevant offense levels. The new amendments lowered the guidelines range to 188-235 months. And Meri-dyth sought another sentence reduction. The district court granted his motion, but only reduced Meridyth\u2019s sentence from 300 months to 250 months \u2014 the same one-sixth reduction the court had previously granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">Once again, the court wrote a memorandum opinion explaining its decision. The court re-examined the history outlined above, and then concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-13\">While recognizing that the Bureau of Prisoners has not reported any further misconduct by Defendant [in the preceding four years], the [c]ourt again finds that a full reduction in Defendant\u2019s sentence is not appropriate. For the reasons stated fully in its Memorandum Opinion of December 10, 2013, the [c]ourt finds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>that a partial reduction of Defendant\u2019s sentence is appropriate and by a contemporaneously entered Order, his sentence will be reduced to 250 months imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">R., Vol. 1 at 193. And once again, Meridyth appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Meridyth contends a one-sixth sentence reduction cannot be an appropriate response to both of his sentence-reduction motions, because his circumstances changed between the two. At the time of his first sentence reduction, argues Meri-dyth, he had engaged in recent misconduct in prison, and the government opposed any reduction at all. But at the time of his second motion, there was no recent misconduct, and the government did- not oppose his motion. Moreover, Meridyth submitted a letter to the district court accompanying his second motion, in which he wrote that he had matured in prison, overcome his struggles with mental-health issues, and was earnestly attempting to rehabilitate himself (for example, by pursuing his GED).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">A district court may reduce a sentence \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The statute leaves the decision to reduce a sentence in the discretion of the district court: \u201cThe court <em>may </em>reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The relevant policy statement also provides that \u201cthe court <em>may </em>reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u201d if a reduction is consistent with the policy statement. USSG \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l) (emphasis added). The accompanying application notes provide that the court \u201cshall consider\u201d the factors in \u00a7 3553 as well as the nature and seriousness of any threat to public safety. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(B). In addition, the court <em>\u201cmay </em>consider\" the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Chavez-Meza, </em>854 F.3d 655, 657 (10th Cir. 2017). \u201cWe \u2018do not disturb decisions entrusted by statute or other rule of law to the discretion of a district court unless we have a definite and firm conviction that the lower court made a clear error of judgment or exceeded the bounds of permissible choice in the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chavez-Meza, </em>854 F.3d at 659 (quoting <em>United States v. Ruiz-Terrazas, </em>477 F.3d 1196, 1201 (10th Cir. 2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">The sole issue before us is whether the district court abused its discretion by granting a one-sixth reduction in response to Meridyth\u2019s second \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, even though Meridyth had improved his prison conduct and purportedly taken steps toward rehabilitation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> [Aplt. Br. at 2.]</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>We see nothing in the district court\u2019s approach that amounts to a \u201cclear error of judgment\u201d or that \u201cexceeded the bounds of permissible choice.\u201d No legal authority <em>requires </em>the court to assign a certain weight to a defendant\u2019s conduct in prison. Indeed, the Sentencing Guidelines expressly do <em>not </em>require district courts to consider post-sentencing conduct. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. l(B)(iii) (\u201cThe court <em>may </em>consider post-sentencing conduct of the defendant. ...\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>but cf., e.g., id. </em>cmt. n. l(B)(i) (\u201c[T]he court <em>shall </em>consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)....\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Apart from cases discussing this court\u2019s jurisdiction and the appropriate standard of review, Meridyth\u2019s briefs only cite two cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">First, Meridyth cites <em>Pepper v. United States, </em>562 U.S. 476, 481, 131 S.Ct. 1229, 179 L.Ed.2d 196 (2011). But <em>Pepper </em>is not on point. <em>Pepper </em>held that \u201cwhen a defendant\u2019s sentence has been set aside on appeal, a district court at resentencing may consider evidence of the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing rehabilitation and that such evidence may ... support a downward variance\u201d from the guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 481, 131 S.Ct. 1229. As a threshold matter, as a case about resentencing, <em>Pepper </em>has no bearing on \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence-reduction motions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But even if it were on point, it would not get Meridyth very far: no one debates the proposition that a district court <em>may </em>consider the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct in sentence-reduction proceedings. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. l(B)(iii) (\u201cThe court may consider post-sentencing conduct of the defendant....\u201d). And that is the proposition for which <em>Pepper </em>stands.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">Second, Meridyth cites a Seventh Circuit case, <em>United States v. Miller, </em>832 F.3d 703 (7th Cir. 2016). Although <em>Miller </em>is a sentence-reduction case, it is no more helpful here, because the facts are easily distinguishable. <em>Miller </em>involved an attorney who completely failed to submit evidence of the defendant\u2019s positive achievements in prison to the district court. <em>Id. </em>at 704. The Seventh Circuit objected to the district court\u2019s characterization of three-year-old disciplinary infractions as ones that had \u201coccurred relatively recently\u201d and were \u201cserious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And the Seventh Circuit noted that the district court had failed to discuss whether the defendant would be \u201clikely to <em>remain </em>a significant danger to the community when he is released.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In light of these three shortcomings, the Seventh Circuit remanded. <em>Id. </em>at 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">Here, by contrast, Meridyth does not allege that the district court did not have all the relevant evidence in front of him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>Nor did the district court mischaracterize the chronology of the disciplinary infractions; as we explain below, the district court was aware of Meridyth\u2019s improved behavior. <em>See </em>R., Vol. 1 at 193 (\u201c[R]ecognz-ing that the Bureau of Prisons has not reported any further misconduct by Defendant since March 2012 <em>..see also </em>R., Vol. 1 at 137 (noting the dates of each disciplinary infraction and noting that Meridyth \u201chas been discipline free since March 1, 2012\u201d), And the district court extensively considered whether Meridyth would be a significant danger to the community when he is released. <em>See </em>R., Vol. 1 at 135-36 (explaining that Meridyth \u201cbasically engaged in a pattern of criminal conduct for his entire adult life\u201d and rejecting Meridyth\u2019s assertion that \u201cthis past conduct is less relevant because of its age\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">In any event, the record makes clear that the district court was aware that Mer-idyth had stayed out of trouble in prison since his first sentence reduction. Far from failing to consider Meridyth\u2019s recent prison record, the district court expressly acknowledged it. <em>See </em>R., Vol. 1 at 193 (\u201c[Rjecognizing that the Bureau of Prisons has not reported any further misconduct by Defendant [in the preceding four years].... \u201d). And although Meridyth contends that the district court \u201cdid not know of [Meridyth\u2019s improvement in his mental health issues and his educational efforts] when it last acted,\u201d the record reveals Meridyth presented similar arguments in his first sentence-reduction proceedings. <em>See </em>R., Vol. 1, at 10-12 (arguing that \u201cMeridyth has made concerted efforts to better himself during his period of incarceration,\u201d including earning several certificates, and emphasizing his \u201crecent and ongoing self-improvement efforts\u201d). Meridyth moreover concedes that only three of the fifteen programs and classes in which he participated occurred after the first sentence reduction. <em>See </em>Aplt. Br. at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The district court\u2019s first sentence reduction opinion goes into considerable detail regarding its decision. It discusses the underlying offense. R., Vol. 1 at 130-31. It lists the factors a court may consider\u2014 including post-sentencing conduct \u2014 as well as the \u00a7 3553(a) factors the court is required to consider. R., Vol. 1 at 132-36. Recounting Meridyth\u2019s extensive criminal history, the court describes him as a danger to the community. R., Vol. 1 at 135-36; <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(B) (providing that the court \u201cshall consider\u201d the nature and seriousness of any threat to public safety.). After listing Meridyth\u2019s prison disciplinary infractions, the court notes that \u201cMeridyth\u2019s pre- and post-sentencing behavior ... is of major concern to the [c]ourt and heavily influences its determination of any reduction in his sentence.\u201d R., Vol. 1 at 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">In context, it is evident that the post-sentencing infractions were not the most important factor in the court\u2019s first sentence-reduction decision. The court noted that the Bureau of Prisons described Meri-dyth\u2019s behavior as \u201crelatively decent,\u201d that he had been incident-free for a year and a half, and that he had \u201cgood rapport with staff and inmates.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court-also noted that Meridyth was \u201cworking closely with psychology services regarding his medication and self-improvement programming,\u201d and that he had gained more than five years of work experience. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">The one-sixth reduction, explained the court, reflected several considerations: (1) the defendant\u2019s \u201ccriminal history and characteristics,\u201d (2) \u201chis behavior in prison,\u201d (3) \u201cthe need ... to promote respect for the law,\u201d (4) the need to \u201cprovide adequate deterrence,\u201d and (5) the need to \u201cprotect the public from further crimes of the [defendant.\u201d R., Vol. 1 at 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>In sum, the district court did not abuse its discretion by referring back to its original explanation. The defendant\u2019s criminal history and characteristics remained unchanged. The need to promote respect for the law, provide adequate deterrence, and to protect the public remained unchanged. Meridyth\u2019s record of prison infractions remained basically unchanged, except that some additional time had passed since his last infraction. But the same incidents were on his record as before; and just as before, his recent record reflected an effort at rehabilitation. Given that the circumstances were largely the same as before, we cannot say the district court should have had to discard its thorough explanation from just a couple years prior only to recapitulate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">And it is worth emphasizing in closing that Meridyth benefited considerably from the district court\u2019s decision. Sentence reduction is an \u201cact of lenity.\u201d <em>Dillon, </em>560 U.S. at 828, 130 S.Ct. 2683. More than four years were taken off his sentence. The district court has not penalized Meridyth\u2014 Meridyth simply wishes the act of lenity had gone further.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">The decision of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b744-24\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R, App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32,1,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-8\">. We grant Meridyth\u2019s April 21, 2017 sealed motion to supplement the record on appeal only to the extent it involves materials that were presented to the district court. \u201cFederal Rule of Appellate Procedure 10(e) authorizes the modification of the record only to the extent it is necessary to 'truly disclose[ ] what occurred in the district court,\u2019 This court will not consider material outside the record before the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Kennedy, </em>225 F.3d 1187, 1191 (10th Cir. 2000) (citation omitted) (quoting Fed. R. App. P. 10(e)).
