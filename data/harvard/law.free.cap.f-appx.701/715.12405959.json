Moritz, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b737-23\">Proceeding pro se,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> federal prisoner Willie Davis appeals the dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas petition. Because the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the merits of the petition, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-24\">In his petition, Davis alleged that prison officers violated his procedural due process rights when they failed to follow prison policy in impounding his personal property. According to Davis, the officers impounded his property to retaliate against him for filing grievances against the respondent, rather than for an appropriate disciplinary reason. As relief, Davis requested a show-cause order, an evidentiary hearing, and an order directing his conditional release.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-25\">The district court sua sponte dismissed Davis\u2019 habeas petition for two reasons. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>First,' the district court noted that Davis improperly asserted his due process claim under \u00a7 2241. Second, the district court stated that even if it construed the claim as \u201cchallenging conditions of confinement,\u201d Davis\u2019 claim \u201clack[ed] merit.\u201d R. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">We review the district court\u2019s disposition of a habeas petition de novo. <em>See Palma-Salazar v. Davis, </em>677 F.3d 1031, 1035 (10th Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Davis argues that he properly brought his claim under \u00a7 2241 in light of <em>Johnson v. Avery, </em>393 U.S. 483, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L.Ed.2d 718 (1969), and <em>Wilwording v. Swenson, </em>404 U.S. 249, 92 S.Ct. 407, 30 L.Ed.2d 418 (1971) (per curiam), <em>superseded by statute, </em>Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, 110 Stat. 1321-71 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e), <em>as recognized in Woodford v. Ngo, </em>548 U.S. 81, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">We disagree. The \u201cpurpose of a \u00a7 2241 habeas proceeding is to allow a person in custody to attack the legality of that custody.\u201d <em>Palma-Salazar, </em>677 F.3d at 1035. Prisoners challenging the fact or duration of their confinement and seeking immediate release or a shortened period of confinement \u201cmust do so through an application for habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But a prisoner \u201cwho challenges the conditions of his confinement must do so through a civil rights action.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Davis\u2019 due process claim doesn\u2019t 'challenge the fact or duration of his confinement; rather, it challenges the conditions of his confinement. Accordingly, the district court correctly dismissed Davis\u2019 \u00a7 2241 habeas petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And neither <em>Johnson </em>nor' <em>Wilwording </em>suggests otherwise. In <em>Johnson, </em>a state prisoner brought a federal habeas action after he was transferred to the maximum security building for violating a prison regulation that barred inmates from assisting other inmates with legal matters, including habeas writs. 393 U.S. at 484, 89 S.Ct. 747. The Supreme Court held that the prison regulation itself conflicted with the federal right of habeas corpus. <em>Id. </em>at 489-490. <em>Johnson </em>is inapposite because Davis doesn\u2019t allege any interference with his right to federal habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\"><em>Wilwording </em>is likewise inapplicable. There, the Court noted in dicta that the state prisoners\u2019 claims challenging their \u201cliving conditions and disciplinary measures\u201d were \u201ccognizable in federal habeas corpus.\u201d 404 U.S. at 249, 251, 92 S.Ct. 407. But the Court never identified the precise challenged living conditions and disciplinary measures at issue. And it ultimately (1) construed the dismissed habeas claims as arising under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and (2) remanded for further proceedings under that statute. 404 U.S. at 251, 92 S.Ct. 407. Thus, <em>Wilwording </em>doesn\u2019t support Davis\u2019 assertion that he properly brought his conditions-of-confinement claim under \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">In short, we agree with the district court that Davis\u2019 claim doesn\u2019t \u201cchallenge the execution of his sentence\u201d and, therefore, must be \u201cfiled in a civil rights complaint,\u201d not in a \u00a7 2241 habeas petition. R. 36; <em>see Palma-Salazar, </em>677 F.3d at 1038 (noting that claim properly construed as a challenge to conditions of confinement must be brought under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971)). Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-16\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>As a final matter, we grant Davis motion to proceed in forma pauperis.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b737-16\"> After examining the brief and appellate record, this panel unanimously determines that oral argument wouldn\u2019t materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P, 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment isn\u2019t binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estop-pel. But it may be cited for its persuasive value. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 32.1; 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b737-29\">.
