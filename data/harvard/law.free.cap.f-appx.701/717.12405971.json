Moritz, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b740-12\">George Christian, an Oklahoma prisoner proceeding pro se,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habe-as application. He also seeks leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis (IFP). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a). We deny his COA application, deny his request for IFP status, and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b740-18\">An Oklahoma jury convicted Christian of first-degree manslaughter, pointing a firearm at another, and possessing a firearm after former conviction of a felony. On the jury\u2019s recommendation, the trial court imposed concurrent prison sentences of 36, 25, and 20 years. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (OCCA) affirmed Christian\u2019s convictions and sentences on direct appeal. The OCCA also affirmed the state district court\u2019s denial of Christian\u2019s subsequent application for post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-19\">Christian then filed the underlying \u00a7 2254 habeas application, alleging eight grounds for relief: (1) the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on voluntary intoxication; (2) the trial court imposed an excessive sentence; (3) his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present a self-defense strategy; (4) the trial court erred in denying his request for new trial counsel; (5) the trial court erred \u201cin denying [his] motion for [a] (Stand Your Ground) defense,\u201d R. 24; (6) cumulative error deprived him of a fair trial; (7) irrelevant jury instructions and the prosecutor\u2019s misleading argument erroneously informed the jury that he lacked a legal self-defense theory; and (8) he was legally authorized to use deadly force and therefore was immune from prosecution. Additionally, in what appears to be a ninth ground for relief, Christian alleges that his appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance during his direct appeal by failing to raise the issues he identified in Grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Three through Eight of his habeas application.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">In a thorough report and recommendation, the magistrate judge considered the merits of each asserted ground for relief. Before doing so, the magistrate judge noted that Christian exhausted Grounds One and Two through his direct appeal and Grounds Three through Eight \u2014 including the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim asserted in conjunction with each of those grounds \u2014 through his application for state post-conviction relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ultimately, the magistrate judge recommended denying Christian\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing and denying his habeas application.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation over Christian\u2019s objections and denied his habeas application. The court subsequently denied Christian\u2019s request for a COA and his motion to proceed on appeal IFP.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Christian now asks us to grant a COA. To obtain a COA, Christian must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Because the district court considered the merits of each of Christian\u2019s claims, Christian must make this showing by \u201cdemonstrating] that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of [his] constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). But it isn\u2019t clear whether Christian seeks review of the district court\u2019s assessment of all, or only some, of his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">In one section of his combined brief and COA application, Christian suggests that the district .court denied his habeas application on procedural grounds. He then cites three cases from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit involving the denial of habeas relief on procedural grounds and asserts that because \u201call eight of [his] claims clearly and expressly allege on their face a violation of [his] federal constitutional rights,\u201d Aplt. Br. 17, \u201ca COA must issue on all eight of the claims contained in the petition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-12\">But in two other sections of his combined brief and COA application, Christian seems to identify only two issues for which he seeks a COA. Specifically, he contends that reasonable jurists could debate (1) the district court\u2019s assessment of his ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claim, and (2) its refusal to grant an evidentiary hearing on one aspect of that claim. And at one point, Christian appears to further narrow his COA request to only the latter issue, \u201cnamely[,] that the district court erred by failing to grant [him] an Eviden-tiary [h]earing on his sub-claims that related to the constitutionally ineffective assistance of appellate counsel to trial counsel\u2019s deficient investigation.\u201d Aplt. Br. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-13\">Thus, broadly construed, Christian appears to identify both a broad and a narrow COA request. We address both here.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">First, to the extent Christian broadly requests a COA on all of his claims, we deny that request because it rests on his misunderstanding that the district court denied his habeas application on procedural grounds. Christian relies on a trio of cases from the Ninth <em>Circui</em>t\u2014Lam<em>bright v. Stewart, </em>220 F.3d 1022 (9th Cir. 2000), <em>Petrocelli v. Angelone, </em>248 F.3d 877 (9th Cir. 2001), and <em>Valerio v. Crawford, </em>306 F.3d 742 (9th Cir. 2002) (en banc) \u2014 to argue that we should grant a COA on each of his claims. He asserts he has made the requisite showing for a COA because a \u201cquick look\u201d at his petition reveals that \u201call eight of [his] claims clearly and expressly allege on their face a violation of [his] federal constitutional rights.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 17; <em>see, e.g., Petrocelli, </em>248 F.3d at 885 (noting that when district court dismisses habeas petition on procedural grounds, court of appeals, in deciding whether to grant COA, \u201cwill simply take a \u2018quick look\u2019 at the face of the complaint to determine whether the petitioner has \u2018facially allege[d] the denial of a constitutional right\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Lambright, </em>220 F.3d at 1026)). We apply this same analysis. But\u2014 like the Ninth Circuit \u2014 we do so only when the district court dismisses a habeas application on procedural grounds. <em>See Gibson v. Klinger, </em>232 F.3d 799, 802-03 (10th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Here, the district court didn\u2019t deny ha-beas relief on procedural grounds; it addressed and rejected each of Christian\u2019s claims on the merits. Contrary to Christian\u2019s argument, this means that he must do more than \u201cfacially allege[ ]\u201d a constitutional violation to obtain a COA on each claim. Aplt. Br. 17. Rather, he must show that reasonable jurists could debate the correctness of the district court\u2019s assessment of each of his constitutional claims. <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595. Because Christian fails to demonstrate, or even argue, that he satisfies this standard for issuance of a COA on each claim, we deny his broad request for a COA on Grounds One through Eight.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">Next, Christian asserts that reasonable jurists would debate the correctness of the district court\u2019s ruling with respect to two issues: (1) the district court\u2019s assessment of his ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claim and (2) its refusal to grant an evidentiary hearing on one aspect of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">In his habeas petition, Christian alleged that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to argue on direct appeal that (1) his <em>trial </em>counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present his self-defense theory; (2) the trial court erred in denying his request for substitute trial counsel; (3) the trial court erred in denying his motion for a jury instruction on the stand-your-ground defense; (4) cumulative error deprived him of a fair trial; (5) irrelevant jury instructions and the prosecutor\u2019s misleading arguments erroneously conveyed to the jury that he wasn\u2019t legally entitled to act in self-defense; and (6) his \u201cabsolute right to use lethal- force\u201d made him \u201cimmune from [p]rosecution,\u201d Aplt. Br. 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">As the district court noted, the OCCA adjudicated Christian\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claim on the merits. In doing so, the OCCA applied <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), and determined that Christian failed to demonstrate either (1) that appellate counsel\u2019s performance was deficient or (2) that \u201cthe result of his ... appeal would have been different but for appellate counsel\u2019s alleged failure to raise [his asserted claims] on direct appeal.\u201d R. 513; <em>see Strickland, </em>466 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (stating that two-prong test for ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim requires prisoner to demonstrate deficient performance and prejudice); see <em>also Cargle v. Mullin, </em>317 F.3d 1196, 1202 (10th Cir. 2003) (\u201cThe proper standard for assessing a claim of ineffectiveness of appellate counsel is that set forth in <em>Strickland </em>.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Thus, the district court\u2019s task was to determine whether the OCGA\u2019s adjudication of his ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claim \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of\u2019 <em>Strickland, </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), or \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Christian asserts that reasonable jurists could debate the district court\u2019s determination that the OCCA\u2019s adjudication of his ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claim was neither contrary to, nor involved an unreasonable application of, <em>Strickland. </em>But he fails to support this assertion with any argument. He doesn\u2019t discuss <em>Strickland, </em>the OCCA\u2019s application of it, or the district court\u2019s assessment of his Sixth Amendment claim. Instead, he simply asserts appellate counsel was ineffective and lists his \u201csub-claims,\u201d i.e., Grounds Three through Eight from his habeas petition. Despite the more forgiving standards that apply to pro se litigants, his briefing on this point is deficient and we could deem the argument waived. <em>See Garrett v. Selby Connor Maddux &amp; Janer, </em>425 F.3d 836, 841 (10th Cir. 2005) (finding pro se plaintiff waived appellate review through inadequate briefing).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">But even if we exercise our discretion to overlook his deficient briefing, <em>see United States v. Montgomery, </em>550 F.3d 1229, 1231 n.1 (10th Cir. 2008), we find no basis on which to grant a COA. We\u2019ve reviewed the state record, the OCCA\u2019s decision, and the district court\u2019s decision. Based on that review, we conclude that reasonable jurists wouldn\u2019t debate the district court\u2019s assessment of Christian\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-eounsel claim. Thus, we deny his request for a COA on that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">Finally, Christian asserts that reasonable jurists could debate the correctness of the district court\u2019s denial of his request for an evidentiary hearing. Specifically, he argues that the district court should have held an evidentiary hearing because he \u201chas alleged facts which[,] if true, establish a basis for relief on (his] claim that his appellate counsel was ineffective in failing to raise the omitted issue that trial counsel failed to conduct a reasonable pre-trial investigation on direct appeal.\u201d Aplt. Br. 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">But as we\u2019ve discussed, the OCCA adjudicated Christian\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claim on the merits. Thus, before the district court could consider granting an evidentiary hearing on that claim, or any particular aspect of that claim, it had to decide whether Christian could \u201covercome the limitation of \u00a7 2254(d)(1) on the record that was before that state court.\u201d <em>Cullen v. Pinholster, </em>563 U.S. 170, 185, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011). Because we agree with the district court\u2019s, conclusion that Christian failed to overcome that limitation, we further conclude that the district court didn\u2019t err in denying his request for an evidentia-ry hearing. <em>See id. </em>at 184, 131 S.Ct. 1388 (holding \u201cthat evidence later introduced in federal court is irrelevant to \u00a7 2254(d)(1) review\u201d). Thus, to the extent Christian requests a COA on this issue, we deny his request.</p>\n<p id=\"pA0D\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">Because Christian hasn\u2019t made the requisite showing to obtain a COA, we deny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>his COA application and dismiss this matter. As a final matter, we deny as moot his motion for IFP status.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b740-13\"> This order isn\u2019t binding precedent,, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judi-cata, and collateral estoppel. But it may be cited for its persuasive value. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P.32.1; 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b740-20\">.

As the magistrate judge noted, the state courts concluded that \"portions of Grounds Three through Eight were procedurally barred,\u201d R. 777. Specifically, the OCCA didn't reach the merits of Christian's claims that the trial court violated his constitutional rights by (1) refusing to appoint new trial counsel (Ground Four), and (2) refusing to instruct the jury on a stand-your-ground defense (Ground Five). Nonetheless, the magistrate judge determined that it would be appropriate to bypass the procedural bar, review those claims de novo, and reject those claims on the merits, <em>See Smith v. Duckworth, </em>824 F.3d 1233, 1242 (10th Cir. 2016) (explaining that habeas court \"retains discretion to bypass the procedural bar and reject the claim on the merits\u201d when court can easily dispose of claim on substantive grounds).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
