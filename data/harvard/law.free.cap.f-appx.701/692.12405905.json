Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm the dismissal. Because Defendant\u2019s sentence was entered in accordance with a Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement to a specific term of imprisonment not calculated under the Sentencing Guidelines, it was not \u201cbased on\u201d the guidelines and \u00a7 3582(c)(2) cannot be applied to lower Mr. Antwine\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of jurisdiction under \u00a7 3582(c). <em>See United States v. Jordan, </em>853 F.3d 1334, 1338 (10th Cir. 2017). \u201cFederal courts generally lack the authority to modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). But \u00a7 3582(c)(2) provides an exception to this general rule, permitting a district court to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence when two conditions are met: first, that the sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission\u201d; and second, that the reduction would be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1338. Defendant\u2019s motion under \u00a7 3582 fails to satisfy the first condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Defendant was sentenced under a Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C) agreement. To determine whether the sentence was based on a guideline sentencing range, we follow Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurrence in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. 522, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011); <em>see United States v. Graham, </em>704 F.3d 1275, 1278 (10th Cir. 2013) (\u201cJustice Sotomayor\u2019s concurrence is the narrowest grounds of decision [in <em>Freeman </em>] and represents the Court\u2019s holding.\u201d). Under that concurrence, \u201ca term of imprisonment imposed under a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement is \u2018based on\u2019 the Guidelines if the agreement either \u2018calls for the defendant to be sentenced within a particular Guidelines sentencing range,\u2019 or \u2018provides for a specific term of imprisonment and makes clear that the basis for the specified term is a Guidelines sentence range applicable to the offense to which the defendant pleaded guilty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jordan, </em>853 F.3d at 1339 (quoting <em>Freeman, </em>564 U.S. at 538-39, 131 S.Ct. 2685 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in judgment)) (brackets and ellipses omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">Defendant\u2019s plea agreement set his sentence at 240 months\u2019 imprisonment. It does not purport to rely on any guideline calculation. Indeed, it preceded the calculation of his guidelines sentencing range by the probation office, which determined that his range was 292-365 months, well above the agreed sentence. The agreement\u2019s only references to the sentencing guidelines are the government\u2019s disclaimer that it \u201cwill not seek any departure from the applicable sentencing guidelines,\u201d R. at 27, and the government\u2019s agreement to recommend a three-point reduction in the offense level for Defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility. (Both government promises were mooted by the district court\u2019s acceptance of the plea agreement.) The agreement neither \u201ccall[s] for the defendant to be sentenced within a particular Guidelines sentencing range\u201d nor does it \u201cmake[ ] clear that the basis for the specified term is a Guidelines sentencing range applicable to the offense to which the defendant pleaded guilty.\u201d <em>Freeman, </em>564 U.S. at 538-39, 131 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>2685; <em>see United States v. Price, </em>627 Fed.Appx. 738, 741 (10th Cir. 2015) (unpublished) (\u201cBecause [the defendant\u2019s] agreement proposes a specific sentence of 240 months, it does not call for the district court to sentence Defendant within a particular Guidelines sentencing range\u201d and is thus not \u201cbased on\u201d the sentencing guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Because Mr. Antwine\u2019s sentence was not \u201cbased on\u201d the sentencing guidelines for \u00a7 3582 purposes, the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of jurisdiction was the proper course. <em>See United States v. Trujeque, </em>100 F.3d 869, 871 (10th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">We AFFIRM the dismissal order of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b714-18\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32,1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
