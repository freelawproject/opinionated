Lucero Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b756-14\">Abdullahi Jara, proceeding pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his employment-discrimination action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b756-18\">Jara is an African-American Muslim of the Oromo ethnicity from Ethiopia. He worked for Standard Parking (\u201cStandard\u201d) as a cashier and was a member of Teamsters Local Union No. 455 (the \u201cUnion\u201d). He alleged that Standard underpaid him, did not allow him to work overtime, disciplined him, and terminated his employment due to his race, ethnicity, national origin, and religion. He further alleged that Standard retaliated against him for complaining of discrimination. He filed several grievances with the Union that were not resolved in his favor, which he also alleged was due to his'race, ethnicity, national origin, and religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-19\">In 2012, Jara complained to Standard\u2019s human resources department that he was not being paid what company policy required. But Standard did not increase his pay and instead warned him to stop complaining to human resources. He believed he was entitled to work overtime, and in March and June 2013, requested overtime work. His supervisor at the time, who is also Ethiopian, denied his requests and gave the overtime shifts to other employees. Although Jara filed grievances with Standard\u2019s human resources department and the Union, neither pursued his grievances.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-20\">Jara was disciplined for sleeping on the job, not being at his work station, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>refusing an order. He again filed grievances with the Union, but the Union did not pursue them. Jara complained that the Union representative should be replaced for not doing his job. The Union did not replace him, and Jara believed the representative refused to process his grievances in retaliation for complaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">On May 18, 2014, another of Jara\u2019s supervisors, who is from Ghana, told Jara to close out his work station. Jara believed doing so would violate company policy and therefore took $200 from the work station while he assisted a customer. The money fell from his pocket into the customer\u2019s car. Although the customer returned the money, Standard terminated Jara\u2019s employment on May 27, 2014, for failing to follow the supervisor\u2019s orders. Jara filed a grievance with the Union, which the Union withdrew on October 2, 2014. He later filed charges of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) against both Standard and the Union. The EEOC did not process the discrimination charges because they were untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">On September 16, 2016, Jara sued Standard and the Union alleging they discriminated and retaliated against him on the basis of race, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 and Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2 &amp; 2000e-3(a). After reviewing de novo the recommendation of a magistrate judge, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1), the district court adopted the recommendation and dismissed the action for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6). Nixon v. City &amp; Cty. of Denver, 784 F.3d 1364, 1368 (10th Cir. 2015). \u201cWe accept all the well-pleaded allegations of the complaint as true and construe them in the light most favorable to [Jara].\u201d Id. (quotation and ellipses omitted). We will affirm the dismissal if the complaint does not \u201ccontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-11\">We liberally construe Jara\u2019s pro se filings. See Garrett v. Selby Connor Maddux &amp; Janer, 425 F.3d 836, 840 (10th Cir. 2005). We do not, however, \u201ctake on the responsibility of serving as the litigant\u2019s attorney in constructing arguments and searching the record.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b757-13\">Standard and the Union contend that Jara failed to satisfy a condition precedent to bringing a Title VII claim \u2014 filing a timely charge with the EEOC. See Gad v. Kan. State Univ., 787 F.3d 1032, 1041 (10th Cir. 2015). \u201cTitle VII requires a plaintiff to file a charge of discrimination within 300 days of the alleged discriminatory act.\u201d Tademy v. Union Pac. Corp., 614 F.3d 1132, 1150 (10th Cir. 2008). The plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating timeliness. Gad, 787 F.3d at 1041.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-14\">Jara has conceded that he failed to file a timely discrimination charge with the EEOC. He argues that the deadline should have been equitably tolled because he was unaware of it.- This is insufficient to warrant equitable tolling because Jara does not claim he was \u201cdeceived, lulled into inaction, actively misled, or has in some extraordinary way been prevented from asserting his ... rights.\u201d Montes v. Vail Clinic, Inc., 497 F.3d 1160, 1168 n.13 (10th Cir. 2007) (quotation omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>ly, we affirm the dismissal of Jara\u2019s Title VII claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Section 1981 prohibits discrimination and retaliation based on race. See Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2517, 2529, 186 L.Ed.2d 503 (2013). To establish a prima facie case of \u00a7 1981 discrimination, Jara was required to demonstrate: (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) Standard and the Union \u201chad the intent to discriminate on the basis of race\u201d; and (3) the alleged \u201cdiscrimination interfered with a protected activity as defined in \u00a7 1981.\u201d Hampton v. Dillard Dep\u2019t Stores, Inc., 247 F.3d 1091, 1101-02 (10th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">Jara has adequately alleged that he is a member of a protected class. He has not, however, pointed to any factual allegations in the second amended complaint that Standard\u2019s disciplinary actions and termination of his employment were based on race or that the Union\u2019s treatment of his grievances was based on race. He alleged only that he believed all adverse actions were race-based, but provided no additional evidence, \u201csuch as actions or remarks made by decisionmakers, preferential treatment given- to employees outside the protected class, or more generally, ... the timing or sequence of events leading to [his] termination,\u201d Barlow v. C.R. England, Inc., 703 F.3d 497, 505 (10th Cir. 2012) (discussing ways a plaintiff can establish he was terminated \u201cunder circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-13\">To establish a prima facie case of \u00a7 1981 retaliation, Jara was required to show: (1) he engaged in protected opposition to discrimination; (2) a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse; and (3) there is a causal connection between the opposition and the adverse action. Twigg v. Hawker Beechcraft Corp., 659 F.3d 987, 998 (10th Cir. 2011). Jara\u2019s retaliation claim fails on the first element. He has alleged no facts to support a claim that his complaints and grievances were in opposition to discrimination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-14\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b758-15\">Considering Jara\u2019s pro se status, the district court evaluated his second amended complaint to determine whether it stated a claim that did not require a showing of discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or religion. The court identified a possible hybrid \u00a7 301/duty-of-fair-repre-sentation claim. Jara has not objected to this characterization.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-16\">A hybrid \u00a7 301/duty-of-fair-representa-tion claim arises when a union \u201cacts in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>such a discriminatory, dishonest, arbitrary, or perfunctory fashion as to breach its duty of fair representation, [that] an employee may bring suit against both the employer and the union, notwithstanding the outcome or finality of the grievance or arbitration proceeding.\u201d Webb v. ABF Freight Sys., Inc., 155 F.3d 1230, 1238 (10th Cir. 1998) (quotation and alterations omitted). Such a claim is a hybrid aetion under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, \u201cbecause it combines two conceptually independent causes of action.\u201d Webb, 155 F.3d at 1238. To prevail on a hybrid cause of action, the discharged employee must establish the following three elements: \u201c(1) Some conduct by the worker\u2019s union that breached the duty of fair representation; (2) A causal connection showing that the union\u2019s breach affected the integrity of the arbitration process, and; (3) A violation of the collective bargaining agreement by the company.\u201d Id. at 1239.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The second amended complaint alleged that the Union withdrew various grievances Jara 'filed, but alleged no facts to suggest that the Union acted in \u201csuch a discriminatory, dishonest, arbitrary, or perfunctory fashion as to breach its duty of fair representation.\u201d Id. at 1238. Similarly, the second amended complaint asserted only that Standard violated various provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, but provided no facts to support these allegations. These general, eon-clusory allegations are insufficient to state a claim. See Mocek v. City of Albuquerque, 813 F.3d 912, 921 (10th Cir. 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Jara contends that the adverse rulings by the magistrate judge and the district judge demonstrated bias and collusion. But Jara\u2019s complaints are limited to adverse rulings, and \u201c[a]dverse rulings alone do not demonstrate judicial bias.\u201d Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751, 762 (10th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">Next, Jara argues that the district court should have granted his request for appointment of counsel. \u2018We review the denial of appointment of counsel in a civil case for an abuse of discretion.\u201d Rucks v. Boergermann, 57 F.3d 978, 979 (10th Cir. 1995). The district court did not abuse its discretion because Jara has not demonstrated that the denial of counsel \u201cresulted] in fundamental unfairness.\u201d Steffey v. Orman, 461 F.3d 1218, 1223 (10th Cir. 2006) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">Jara also asserts error as follows: (1) the district court dismissed the case before discovery was completed and the defendants were required to testify; (2) counsel for Standard and the Union failed to confer with him before filing the motions to dismiss, in violation of a local court rule; and (3) the defendants never filed an answer to his second amended complaint. Jara has not explained how discovery or conferring with counsel would have cured the deficiencies in his second amended complaint. And Rule 12(b) provides that \u201ca motion asserting [the defense of failure to state a claim] must be made before pleading if a responsive pleading is allowed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">Jara states, without supporting argument or explanation, that his constitutional rights under the Second, Fourth, Fifth, Tenth, Eleventh, and Fourteenth Amendments were violated. He did not raise these claims in his second amended complaint, nor did he raise a \u201cnegligent written contract issue,\u201d and thus we do not address them. See Rosewood Servs., Inc., 413 F.3d at 1167. He also invokes the Seventh Amendment, claiming he was entitled to a jury trial, but this right was foreclosed by dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6). Finally, to the extent Jara challenges the order taxing costs against him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>he has offered no basis on which to reverse the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-17\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b760-18\">We AFFIRM the judgment of the district court. Jara\u2019s second motion for appointment of counsel on appeal is DENIED. We GRANT his motion to proceed in forma pauperis.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b756-15\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b757-9\">. On appeal, Jara suggests for the first time that the EEOC misled him. He has not indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>cated where he raised this claim to the district court, and our review of the second amended complaint did not reveal such a claim. Therefore, we do not consider it. See Rosewood Servs., Inc. v. Sunflower Diversified Servs., Inc., 413 F.3d 1163, 1167 (10th Cir. 2005) (holding that arguments not raised in the district court are waived on appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b758-11\">. For the first time on appeal, Jara contends that four other employees who are not members of a protected class were treated more favorably and that he was subjected to a hostile work environment. Jara has not identified where he raised these arguments, see 10th Cir. R. 28.2(C)(2) (\"For each issue raised on appeal, all briefs must cite the precise reference in the record where the issue was raised and ruled on.\u201d), and we do not see where they were raised. Jara alleged only that other employees were treated \"fairly,\u201d but did not allege that any favorable or unfavorable treatment was related to race. Furthermore, his second amended complaint included the phrase \u201chostile environment\u201d but provided no facts to support such a claim. Accordingly, we will not consider these arguments. See Rosewood Servs., Inc., 413 F.3d at 1167.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
