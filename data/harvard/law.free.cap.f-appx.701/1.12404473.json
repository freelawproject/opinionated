See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C. Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p> <p id=\"b24-9\" pgmap=\"24\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the order of the district court denying the appellant\u2019s motion for sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) be affirmed. See United States v. Duvall, 209 F.Supp.3d 125 (D.D.C. 2016).</p> <p id=\"b24-10\" pgmap=\"24\">Dillon v. United States, 560 U.S. 817, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010), requires a two-step process to determine whether a sentence should be reduced under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). First, the court should determine whether the prisoner is eligible for a sentence reduction. Second, the court should \u201cconsider whether the authorized reduction is warranted ... according to the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d 560 U.S. at 826-27, 130 S.Ct. 2683. A failure by the prisoner to satisfy either portion of this two-part test precludes a sentence reduction. We shall assume Duvall is eligible for a reduction and focus upon his arguments that the district judge abused his discretion in applying the statutory factors.</p> <p id=\"b24-11\" pgmap=\"24\">Duvall first contends the judge abused his discretion by relying upon \u201cuncharged conduct as to which he made no finding of reliability.\u201d As the government points out, under this circuit\u2019s precedent \u201ca sentencing court may rely on undisputed facts in a presentence report,\u201d and Duvall did not dispute this uncharged conduct, or indeed any part of the PSR. United States v. Pinnick, 47 F.3d 434, 437 (D.C. Cir. 1995). Relatedly, Duvall claims the district court held him responsible for a stolen gun he claims was under the control of someone else, but we see no abuse of discretion in concluding Duvall was responsible for a stolen gun found in his own apartment.</p> <p id=\"b24-13\" pgmap=\"24\">Duvall also complains the district court ignored the prosecutor\u2019s statement that Duvall had \u201cnot a trace of violence in his past.\u201d The district court did not ignore this point, however; instead, the court balanced it against Duvall\u2019s cousin once having accused him of assaulting her and applying for a battery warrant against him. Duvall also implies the district court ignored his having \u201cma[d]e a good record in prison,\u201d but the judge did acknowledge Duvall\u2019s prison record \u2014 and concluded it was outweighed by the severity of Duvall\u2019s crime of conviction and his criminal history.</p> <p id=\"b24-14\" pgmap=\"24\">Duvall\u2019s other complaints are directed against the court\u2019s evaluation of his prior convictions. He points out that those convictions did not involve \u201cexceptionally large amounts of drugs,\u201d resulted in relatively short sentences, and were too old to be counted under the Guidelines. True, but there is no abuse of discretion in deeming those facts less important than Duvall\u2019s repeated unlawful behavior and that the crime for which he was sentenced involved participation in a drug conspiracy \u2014 a crime far more serious than any he had previously committed.</p> <p id=\"b24-15\" pgmap=\"24(50) 25(115)\">Finally, Duvall contends that even if all the conduct mentioned above merits a longer sentence than he would have received if this were his first offense, the reduction he seeks would still leave him with a longer sentence than what a first offense would normally merit. But that is not relevant; this case is a paradigmatic example of a district judge exercising precisely the sort of discretion both the Guidelines and our precedent grant him. He acknowledged both the damning and the redeeming in Duvall\u2019s record and concluded that, on balance, Duvall\u2019s record did not warrant a reduction of his sentence. To avoid abusing his discretion, a district judge must \u201cconsider[ ] the parties\u2019 arguments and ha[ve] a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d United States v. Lafayette, 585 F.3d 435, 440 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (quoting Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)). The district judge did just that here.</p> <p id=\"b25-5\" pgmap=\"25\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. See Fed. R. App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. Rule 41.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
