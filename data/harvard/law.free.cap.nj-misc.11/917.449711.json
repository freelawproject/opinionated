Disorderly Persons act, section 6. That the conviction was before a Police Court of the city of Newark; that they procured a summary review of the conviction by Judge Hartshorne, of the Court of Common Pleas, by virtue of some such statute as section 39 of the Disorderly act <em>(Comp. Stat., p. </em>1937), or the act of 1895, relating to Police Courts. <em>Comp. Stat., p. </em>3995, <em>pi. </em>14. The precise act is unimportant. We gather further that Judge Hartshorne sustained the conviction, and we are asked to review his action on <em>certiorari, </em>as of course this court has the right to do. <em>Newark </em>v. <em>Kazinski, </em>86 <em>N. J. L. </em>59; 90 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>1016. To that end we have examined the affidavit and briefs submitted (there was no oral argument) and conclude that prosecutors have not shown a case reasonably calling for the interposition of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\"><em>Allocatur </em>is therefore denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
