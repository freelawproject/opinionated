At the trial the defendant sought to show that the plaintiff, in consideration of the payment of a certain sum of money, had signed an agreement not to sue the Public Service Company, claiming that it was entitled to show this payment in mitigation of damages against the present appellant. Cases throughout the country and in the federal courts are cited to show that while a covenant not to sue is not a release of one tort feasor absolving other tort feasors, any payment made under such an agreement is admissible in mitigation of the plaintiff\u2019s claim against other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">The difficulty is that in the case of <em>Fast </em>v. <em>Pecan, </em>11 <em>N. J. Mis. R. 258; </em>165 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>281, this court decided exactly to the contrary and held that subtsantially the same question here presented was properly overruled. That ruling is by a co-ordinate branch of this court and cannot be disregarded here.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-12\">The judgment is affirmed, with cost.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
