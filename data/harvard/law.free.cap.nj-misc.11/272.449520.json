EDELL, RELATOR, v. ROBERT J. McDERMOTT, AS JUDGE OF THE FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF PATERSON, RESPONDENT.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b284-4\">Argued January 17, 1933</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ae2\">Decided February 6, 1933.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b284-8\">Before Justices Parker, Lloyd and Heher.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b284-9\">For the relator, <em>Randal B.

In fact, this is the only status that he appears to have in the matter, for a status as a citizen and taxpayer does not seem to be suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-14\">The explanation made by respondent for his refusal to appoint relator is that he considers relator not to \u201cpossess the business capacity necessary to discharge the duties of the particular position involved.\u201d <em>Pamph. L. </em>1929, <em>p. </em>784. It is true that the relator passed the civil service test, and that chapter 122 of <em>Pamph. L. </em>1932 (at <em>p. </em>206) provides that this is to be regarded as evidence that he possesses the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>business capacity and is qualified; but we have in this case the testimony of respondent that he was well acquainted with relator both personally and officially, and for reasons stated in some detail by him, but which need not be restated here, considered him unfit. In this aspect the case is similar to <em>Davison </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>94 <em>N. J. L. </em>338. We think he was justified in that conclusion; but even if we were in doubt on that point, a writ should not go, as it is fundamental that to justify a writ of <em>mandamus </em>the legal right must be clear. <em>Browne </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>98 <em>Id. </em>1, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">The rule to show cause will bo discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
