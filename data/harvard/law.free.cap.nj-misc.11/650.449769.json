The present rule was made in the December following. The affidavit upon which the rule was granted recites his hearing on March 16th and his conviction on the 22d, says he expected and intended to have a jury trial, and refused to plead on that ground; that the evidence adduced was not sufficient to warrant his conviction; that he was not guilty; that he believes the testimony of the complaining witness was the result of collusion between her and her father; that he believes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>recorder committed legal error by acting on an illgal complaint and warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">These facts do not call for allowance of the writ at this late date, nor do they call for serious discussion of reasons why it should not be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The rule is, therefore, discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
