Perhaps that was correct; in any event it is not before us for review. But it is clear to us that there is here no case for a certiorari, but rather one of an employer discharging an employe engaged by the year, while that year was running. The relation was contractual, and for breach of that contract an action for damages is the proper remedy. <em>Cramer </em>v. <em>Water </em>Commissioners, 57 <em>N. J. L. </em>478; 31 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>384; <em>Hardy </em>v. Orange, 61 <em>N. J. L. </em>620; 42 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>581.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-13\">The writ will be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
