Sometime later the jury came into the court room and announced it had reached a verdict. The foreman announced the verdict as \u201cguilty with leniency.\u201d Counsel for defendants demanded that the jury be polled. Nine jurors answered \u201cguilty with leniency;\u201d two \u201cguilty with extreme leniency;\u201d and one \u201cnot guilty.\u201d Thereupon the clerk telephoned the judge and was told to send the jury back to reach a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-15\">Later the jury returned and announced a verdict of guilty with leniency. Upon a poll, ten so answered and two mentioned extreme leniency.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>The contention is that the clerk usurped, or the judge delegated to him, a judicial function, and that the action was in contravention of the rule in <em>Sockolowski </em>v. <em>Olkowski, </em>102 <em>N. J. L. </em>50; 130 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>514; <em>Folkner </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>100 <em>N. J. L. </em>189; 126 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>633, and other cases cited. However, in those cases the jury did return a verdict, that is, some finding upon which they unanimously agreed, and the clerk refused to accept it because, in his view, it did not meet the issues submitted by the proofs and the charge of the court. In the instant case we have no such thing. After the jury was polled it was evident that they had agreed on nothing. It was then the duty of the clerk to send them back, and his action in doing so was ministerial and not judicial. He could do nothing else. The fact that he communicated with the judge and received instructions from him makes no difference one way or the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
