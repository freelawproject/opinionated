The proofs examined indicate that the issues of negligence and contributory negligence were properly for the jury. The accident occurred on a foggy, stormy night. The defendant could hardly see above the headlights and struck the minor plaintiff, who was crossing the highway making the best observation he could for his own safety. He heard no sound or warning and saw no lights. The case was properly submitted to the jury. <em>Brotman </em>v. <em>Doan, </em>105 <em>N. J. L. </em>132; 143 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>328.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">The court charged the following request: \u201cAutomobiles although not generally held to be dangerous instrumentalities <em>per se </em>have dangerous characteristics and when not properly and carefully handled by competent persons become, under certain conditions, highly dangerous instruments and a public nuisance.\u201d As a legal proposition this is so. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Brauer, </em>97 <em>N. J. L. </em>482; 117 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>694; <em>Sheridan </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number><em>Arrow Laundry Co., </em>106 <em>N. J. L. </em>608; 146 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>191. Perhaps this proposition of law did not apply to the facts as developed in this case, but as we view the entire charge the jury could not have been misled by the statement complained of. <em>Lenz v. Public Service Railway Co., </em>98 <em>N. J. L. </em>849; 121 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>741.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
