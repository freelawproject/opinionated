Prom the case and briefs we gather that prosecutor wishes this court to set aside an order in the District Court opening a judgment, and on the ground that the application to open the judgment and allow a new trial was made more than thirty-days after rendition of the judgment. <em>Comp. Stat., p. </em>1959, \u00a7 17. See <em>Schubert </em>v. <em>District Court, </em>10 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>414; 159 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>615; <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Lubin, 4 N. J. Mis. R. </em>518; 133 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>405. The answer is that the application was within the statutory exception, as based on newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">Assuming there is a record before us, there is no proof on the issue of fact that we should consider. The affidavits for and against allowance of the writ have spent their force. <em>Linzmayer </em>v. <em>Baird, </em>5 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>362; 136 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>510. This is elementary. Moreover, the evidence taken at the first trial is not presented. <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Lubin, supra. </em>In short, there is nothing before us to support the prosecutor\u2019s claim. The writ is dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
