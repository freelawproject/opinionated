FREDERICK PICHARD, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b182-7\">Submitted October Term, 1932</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AVN\">Decided March 4, 1933.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b182-10\">Before Justices Teenoiiard, Case and Brogan.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b182-11\">For the plaintiff-respondent, <em>Benjamin Baron.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b182-12\">For the defendant-appellant, <em>Jacob Siegal (Louis Ruben-stein, </em>of counsel).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b182-13\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b182-14\">This ease presents an appeal from the Bayonne District Court. It is a case involving personal injuries to the plaintiff while he was a passenger on the bus of the defendant-appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-15\">At the end of the whole case, which was tried without a jury, the court indicated that the finding would be in favor of the defendant, remarking, \u201cI do not see any liability in this case. How do you think you have established any negligence on the part of the defendant? * *</p>\n<p id=\"b182-16\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s version of how this accident happened is highly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>improbable while it is entirely possible and probable that the plaintiff sustained the injuries which he complains of in the manner testified to by the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel, immediately said, \u201cI would like to have permission to take a nonsuit,\u201d which the court granted. Counsel for the defendant objected and his objection was overruled and judgment for nonsuit was entered to which an exception was taken and that is the sole ground of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">We think that the court below was correct in allowing the plaintiff to submit to a voluntary nonsuit and that the case is well within the decisions and provisions of the statute governing matters of this kind. Section 160 of the Practice act takes away the right of plaintiff to submit to a voluntary nonsuit only \u201cafter the jury has gone from the bar to consider their verdict.\u201d This section applies to District Courts. <em>Greenfield </em>v. <em>Cary, </em>70 <em>N. J. L. </em>613; 57 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>269.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">In the instant case, however, the court sat as a jury and it had not pronounced its judgment and at this stage of the trial a voluntary nonsuit was still a matter of right. The remarks of the judge were not dispositive of the case. It was still open to argument. The prospective verdict was still quite clearly under consideration only. <em>Ciesmelewski </em>v. <em>Domalewski, </em>90 <em>N. J. L. </em>34; 100 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>179; <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Erie Railroad Co., </em>90 <em>N. J. L. 350; </em>101 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>415.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The judgment of the District Court is therefore affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
