When the case was called for trial December 1st the defendant insisted upon a jury, but that insistence was denied by the judge \u201con the ground that the time fixed for trial was not the day on which the case was tried, but the original time set for trial\u201d and he proceeded to try the case without a jury, and thereupon the counsel for defendant withdrew entirely and offered no defense. A judgment was rendered for the plaintiffs for $300 and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">We believe that under section 149 of the District Court act <em>(Comp. Stat., p. </em>1999), as construed by our cases the judge should have allowed a jury. That section (so far as pertinent to the circumstances of this case) provides for a jury when \u201ca demand for trial by jury shall be made, and notice thereof given to the clerk of the court at least two days, exclusive of Sundays and legal holidays, before the time fixed for trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">In <em>Consolidated Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Blanda, </em>89 <em>N. J. L. </em>104; 97 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>769; <em>affirmed, </em>90 <em>N. J. L. </em>135, it was said that \u201cthe phrase \u201c\u2019day fixed for trial\u2019 means the return day of the summons if trial be then had, or any later day to which the trial may be adjourned and on which day it is <em>actually </em>held.\u201d See, also, <em>Stuppiello </em>v. <em>Waldron, </em>6 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>152; 140 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>436.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The judgment will be reversed and a new trial awarded, costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
