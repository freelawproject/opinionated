The plaintiff was solicited to become a charter member and signed a subscription contract. That subscription contract called for payment of \u201can entrance fee of one hundred and fifty dollars.\u201d That he paid, and the contract was accepted by the club. The subscription contract also provided that the \u201cyearly dues will be one hundred dollars.\u201d The contract also provided that \u201cthis membership is limited,\u201d and \u201cpayment of all dues on this membership is suspended until formal opening of the clubhouse.\u201d As we have pointed out that subscription contract was accepted, the $150 was paid and then before the clubhouse was completed and before the club proceeded to function, the plaintiff received a letter from the club as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">\u201cOwing to the prevailing conditions the trustees of the City Athletic Club have ordered to temporarily reduce the entrance fee for general membership from $150 to $50 and the dues from $100 to $50 and have made this order retroactive to all past transactions. You have paid $150 for a general membership and we are this day crediting your account with $100 which pays two years\u2019 dues in advance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">The theory of the plaintiff\u2019s suit was that this was a breach of the contract to the plaintiff\u2019s damage $150. The judge so found, and we think rightly.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">The judgment below will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
