BOROUGH OF COLLINGSWOOD, RESPONDENT.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b683-7\">Submitted January term, 1933</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ayi\">Decided July 25, 1933.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b683-10\">Before Justices Parker, Lloyd and Heher.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b683-11\">Por the prosecutor, <em>Albert 8.

The ordinance prohibits the erection of any fence above four feet in height <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>without the permission of the board of commissioners and requires the removal of existing fences not conforming to the provisions of the ordinance, if so directed by the board of commissioners. Under this a fence previously erected by the prosecutor was directed to be removed or altered to conform to the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Proofs were taken in pursuance of the rule and apparently from these it would appear that the ordinance as to the prosecutor\u2019s property was illegal under such cases as <em>Passaic </em>v. <em>Paterson Bill Posting Co., </em>72 <em>N. J. L. </em>285; 62 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>267, but without so deciding at this stage of the proceedings, it is sufficient to say that the writ will be allowed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
