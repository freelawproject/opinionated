That testimony, as well as the testimony taken in the present trial, fails to show that Bamsauer had permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">On the contrary we think it shows that he had not. After a certain contracting job had been finished Bamsauer was told by his employer Minahan Brothers, the owners of the truck, to take it to his home and keep it in the yard until another job was ready. He took it out at the time of the accident for his own purpose of removing rubbish from his yard. Bamsauer at the original trial testified specifically that he did not have permission to use the truck; that the yard was a \u201cbig yard\u201d and had no garage thereon. At the present trial he testified that he was directed to keep the truck on the premises; that there was some rubbish in the yard and in order to take care of the truck, he used the truck in carrying off some of the rubbish, and it was on this trip that the accident happened. We think that such evidence did not show permission to use the truck on that occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The plaintiff argues that the defendant is estopped from denying the protection of its policy to the driver of the automobile of its assured because of the alleged general appearance of its attorneys for the owner and <em>driver.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">We think the record fails to support that contention. The plaintiff relies upon the case of <em>Horn </em>v. <em>Commonwealth Casualty Co., </em>105 <em>N. J. L. </em>616; 147 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>483. But there the facts were quite different. There the insurance company defended the suit growing out of the accident over a period of years. Here in the trial of the original actions the counsel for the insurance company denied that they represented Bamsauer. They so stated to the court and refused to undertake Bamsauer\u2019s defense. This was made very clear to the .trial judge and the court expressly recognized that Bamsauer was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">The judgment below will be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
