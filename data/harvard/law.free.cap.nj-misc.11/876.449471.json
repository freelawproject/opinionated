And it was therefore incumbent upon the operators of both cars to use extraordinary care in the operation of their cars, and where they were on the highway after they were stopped, so that they would not endanger the lives and property of other persons.55</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">An exception to that instruction was duly taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">We think that this latter instruction was erroneous and prejudicial. The defendants were bound to exercise reasonable care towards other travelers \u2014 in other words, they must use that degree of care which an ordinarily prudent person would use under the same circumstances. <em>Spawn </em>v. Goldberg, 94 <em>N. J. L. </em>335; 110 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>565. Keasonable care means, not extraordinary care, but such as an ordinarily prudent person would exercise under the conditions existing at the time he is called upon to act. <em>Pesin </em>v. <em>Jugovich, </em>85 N. <em>J. L. </em>256; 88 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>1101. The instruction that the defendants owed a duty of extraordinary care tended to mislead, and must have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>been injurious in the result. <em>VanBlarcom </em>v. <em>Central Railroad </em>Co., 73 <em>N. J. L. </em>540; 64 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>111.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">The judgment will be reversed to the end that a new trial may be had. Costs to abide the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
