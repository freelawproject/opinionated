But we think that the evidence amply supported the allegation of negligence and the judgment which was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The only other point is that the judge erred in admitting the testimony of Dr. Vallapiano, who had treated the plaintiff for nine days at the Monmouth Memorial Hospital, after a thorough examination. The question was: \u201cCould the</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">plaintiff have fooled you as to the condition of either his knee or his back?\u201d The answer was: \u201cThe plaintiff could not have fooled me with reference to either his knee or his back.\u201d To this no exception seems to have been taken, and moreover the question and answer seem to have been stricken out by the trial judge. But if we are wrong in our interpretation of the record, and if there was any technical error here, it was certainly harmless in view of the ample, and, as we see it, uncontradicted testimony respecting the plaintiff\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">The judgment will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
