The cases were tried together before the judge, sitting without a jury, and resulted in verdicts for the two named plaintiffs. Defendant appeals, and the appeals are considered together.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-15\">Appellant\u2019s first point is that \u201cthe testimony before the District Court left only one conclusion, viz., that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>plaintiff-appellee, Harold Haugaard, was guilty of contributory negligence.\u201d There was testimony from which it could be found that Haugaard, in driving his automobile along Beardsley avenue approaching the intersection with Sixteenth street, made an observation to his left at a distance of ten feet from the intersection and made a second observation to his left before entering upon the intersection and saw no car approaching; that he proceeded and had traveled three-quarters of the way across the intersection when his attention was drawn to defendant\u2019s car, coming from Haugaard\u2019s left, by the screeching of the brakes thereof; that Haugaard thereupon braked his car to a standstill and while stationary was struck by the defendant\u2019s car, and that the latter car dragged the Haugaard car for a distance and, proceeding onward, mounted the sidewalk and hit a telegraph pole on Sixteenth street about seven feet from Beardsley avenue. We are unable to say that these facts demonstrate contributory negligence on the part of Haugaard as a matter of law. The question was factual and was decided, as it might lawfully be, against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Appellant\u2019s second and remaining point is that \u201cthe negligence of the plaintiff, Harold Haugaard, should have been' imputed to the plaintiff Edgar Malin and so barred the suit brought by Edgar \"Malin by his next friend, Erieda Malin, and Erieda Malin individually.\u201d On the Malin case also the question of contributory negligence by Haugaard was factual and Malin cannot be charged with contributory negligence by Haugaard inasmuch as Haugaard was found not to be guilty thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The judgment below will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
