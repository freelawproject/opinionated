It was an automobile accident case.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-12\">Among the reasons assigned for the quashing of the writ of attachment and setting aside or vacating all proceedings thereunder, was the following: \u201cReason <em>2. </em>It does not set</p>\n<p id=\"b828-13\">forth sufficient evidential facts as to non-residence and inability to serve with a summons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b828-14\">The affidavit upon which the writ of attachment was awarded relating to non-residence and inability to serve the summons, is as follows (paragraph 7 of complaint) : \u201cSaid Edward Weiner and Prank Weiner are not, to deponents knowledge and belief residents at this time in the State of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>New Jersey and summons cannot be served upon them in this state.\u201d The point is well taken. The affidavit is fatally defective. It is barren of \u201cevidential facts\u201d showing that the defendants are not only non-residents of this state, but, also that a summons cannot be served on them. <em>Hisor </em>v. <em>Vandiver, </em>83 <em>N. J. L. </em>433; 85 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>181; <em>Jaudel </em>v. <em>Schoelzke, </em>95 <em>N. J. L. </em>171 (at <em>p. </em>177); 112 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>328; <em>Goeringer </em>v. <em>Young, </em>4 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>859; 134 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>756; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>5 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>1028; 139 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>419; <em>Henry v. Freeman, </em>7 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>263; 145 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>107.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">The aforesaid determination makes it unnecessary to treat the other reasons assigned. Accordingly the writ of attachment will be quashed and the proceedings had thereunder set aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
