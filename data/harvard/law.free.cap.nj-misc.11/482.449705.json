DANIEL ZAWISH, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b494-6\">Submitted January 27, 1933</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A12\">Decided June 21, 1933.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b494-9\">Before Justices Bodies and Donges.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b494-10\">Eor the defendant-appellant, <em>Holmwood &lt;&amp; Creighton (William E. Holmwood).</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b494-11\">Eor the plaintiff-appellee, <em>Kessler \u25a0&amp; Kessler (Samuel I.

On their return, the defendant\u2019s ear, in which the three young men were riding, was wrecked and the plaintiff\u2019s intestate killed. The plaintiff\u2019s proofs indicated that the defendant once said he had lost consciousness and control of the wheel. Of course, as a witness, he testified he was struck by another motorist and had never made the admission testified to. The issue of negligence was obviously for the jury. The circumstance that plaintiff\u2019s intestate was riding with the defendant, when the defendant\u2019s car overturned might result in a presumption of negligent operation. <em>Mackenzie </em>v. <em>Oakley, </em>94 <em>N. J. L. </em>66.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">The trial court properly charged that the burden of proof never shifted and that the plaintiff must establish his case by the fair preponderance of evidence. Obviously there was no prejudicial error in charging the doctrine of. <em>res ipsa loquitur. </em>The charge, as a whole, was a well balanced exposition of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The judgment will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
