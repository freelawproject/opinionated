See <em>Schubert </em>v. <em>District Court of Bergen </em>County, 10 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>414; 159 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>615. The answer to this apparent illegality is that the application for new trial was delayed beyond the thirty days by fraudulent misrepresentation by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, whereby defendant\u2019s attorney was misled. <em>Geithner </em>v. <em>Paechiana, </em>8 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>384; 150 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>240. This is contradicted; but the matter is before us on <em>ex parte </em>affidavits and the facts may as well be fully developed before a commissioner. A writ will be allowed, with leave to both sides to take depositions and submit any documentary evidence that is relied on.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
