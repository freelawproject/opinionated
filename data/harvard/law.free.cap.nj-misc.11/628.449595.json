He was convicted, after trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">It appears, that the defendant Scully was engaged in promoting a dance for Newark Post No. 101, of the American Legion, and that he had some persons employed in the sale of tickets for the dance.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-13\">It was charged that defendant and others did knowingly, unlawfully, willfully and designedly represent to John Pfeiffer, and others named, that they were Captain Erank O\u2019Neill, attached to the Newark police department, and thereby obtained various sums of money for tickets for the dance.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-14\">The testimony of the persons produced by the state was that someone called them on the telephone and introduced himself by various names. In several instances the name of \u201cCaptain O\u2019Neill\u201d was used; in others the name of \u201cCaptain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>Mitchell\u201d and \u201cSergeant Reilly\u201d was used. In one instance, it was testified that the person calling said he was \u201cCaptain O\u2019Neill, captain of the seventh precinct.\u201d Who the persons who made the several calls were did not appear, nor did it appear that, except in the one instance, the caller made any representation as to the identity of the \u201cCaptain O\u2019Neill\u201d calling. In the one instance, the testimony of the witness upon that point is not satisfactory or persuasive of such identification. The thing being sold was tickets for the legion dance. There was no charge that defendant or anyone else attempted to procure any money for any other purpose, or upon representation of any other benefit or return. In each instance, tickets for the dance were delivered with a letter from the legion post. Nor was it charged that they defrauded Captain O\u2019Neill, of the seventh precinct, of anything or endeavored to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">Defendant denied that he either authorized the use of the name of Captain O\u2019Neill, of the police department, or had knowledge of its use by any person associated with him in promoting the dance for Post 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Prom the testimony it appears that the tickets were purchased by each of the persons produced at the trial because they believed the project a worthy one.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">We conclude that there was no testimony from which it appeared that the person who used the name of \u201cCaptain O\u2019Neill of the police department\u201d was associated with plaintiff in error or that he had any knowledge of such conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">The trial judge charged the jury that to convict it must appear that the persons soliciting sale of the tickets \u201crepresented themselves either impliedly or expressly as Police Captain O\u2019Neill,\u201d and, secondly, \u201cwhether or not the defendant authorized those means.\u201d Without passing upon the legal correctness of the court\u2019s charge in this and other respects, it is enough to say that a careful reading of the testimony leaves no doubt that these things were not established by the proofs, and that the proofs do not support the verdict under the law as charged by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">The judgment under review is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
