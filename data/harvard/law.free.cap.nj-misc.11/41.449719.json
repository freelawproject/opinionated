IJpon the trial plaintiff introduced evidence that defendant had represented the automobile to be delivered to bo a new car of the above model and not a second-hand one; that the automobile which the defendant tendered for delivery was a second-hand automobile, and that upon plaintiff\u2019s objection the defendant agreed to rescind the contract and to return the deposit money, which was not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-15\">We think the court did not err (as defendant contends) in permitting plaintiff to answer the question as to whether he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>was to get a new or second-hand' car. The agreement contained nothing as to the cpndition of the automobile to be delivered, and it was therefore in this respect ambiguous. The language was applicable to a new or a used car. <em>Dordoni </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>83 <em>N. J. L. </em>355; 85 <em>Atl.
