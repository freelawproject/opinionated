It is not disputed that this amount was paid by the plaintiff but the defendant says this sum was applied by it to unpaid insurance premiums covering the plaintiff\u2019s property. On the other hand, the husband of the plaintiff swears that he paid the insurance premiums, amounting to $140, to the president of the building and loan association which, of course, presents a fact issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-14\">The state of the case, agreed upon by counsel for the respective parties, comes before us in a very unsatisfactory condition. The parties, for instance, are unable to agree as to whether or not a certain question was asked (which may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>been important in this controversy) and the notes of the trial judge do not disclose whether or not the question was asked. It does appear, however, that the defendant moved for a non-suit, which was denied, and that the court let the case go to the jury as to whether or not the president of the defendant building and loan association acted as the plaintiff\u2019s agent o-r the defendant\u2019s agent in applying plaintiff\u2019s moneys- to the payment of insurance premium. The court\u2019s ruling on these questions was in no- way excepted to and these questions therefore are not available to the appellant for the purposes of an appeal. <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Shryer, </em>106 <em>N. J. L. </em>433; 150 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>321.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">The appeal is therefore dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
