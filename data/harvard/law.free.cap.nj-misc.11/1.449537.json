In <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Orange, </em>91 <em>N. J. L. </em>555, it was declared that section 4 of the act takes from the board of commissioners jurisdiction to try charges against a police officer and vests such jurisdiction in the commissioner of the department of public safety; that the statute was imperative and self-executing. This decision has been followed on repeated occasions. <em>Hand </em>v. <em>Wildwood, </em>8 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>498; 150 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>828; <em>Mee </em>v. <em>Montclair, </em>9 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>46; 157 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>447. Rules of the commissioners to the contrary were, therefore, unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"AVu\">It is next urged that evidence received tending to establish the guilt of the officer was improperly received. This evidence consisted of the dying declaration of a girl to the effect that the prosecutor was responsible for her pregnant condition. This evidence was clearly inadmissible. 22 <em>Corp. Jur. </em>258, but this does not justify setting aside the order of dismissal inasmuch as other evidence heard by the director was amply sufficient, as we think, to establish the guilt of the prosecutor. <em>Crane </em>v. <em>Jersey City, </em>90 <em>N. J. L. </em>109; 103 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>678, where it was said that \u201cthe admission of illegal testimony in cases tried by a special tribunal * <em>* </em>* would not have the effect to invalidate the findings of that tribunal so, long as it appears that there is competent testimony in the case to support such findings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ah\">The application is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
