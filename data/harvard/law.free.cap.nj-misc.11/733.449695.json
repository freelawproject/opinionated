THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE CITY OF UNION CITY AND THE BOARD OF HEALTH OF THE CITY OF UNION CITY, RESPONDENTS.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b745-7\">Submitted May 12, 1933</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ApmZ\">Decided August 29, 1933.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b746-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Before Justices Oase, Bodine and Donges.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b746-5\">For the relator, <em>Nicholas McLaughlin, Jr.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b746-6\">For the respondents, <em>James C.

Section 9, ordinance of July 30th, 1928. Without such permit no license can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">Live poultry markets are not favorably' regarded by the health officer of Union City because of the stench and vermin incident thereto. Uo licenses, save renewals, have been granted since the adoption some years ago of commission government.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">There is nothing in the record to indicate that the license and permit were in effect granted. In fact, everything of record indicates that the authorities continuously refused like applications. A short time before another application for the property was denied. We are not confronted with the situation existing in <em>Garber </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Paterson, 4 N. J. Mis. R. </em>83; 131 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>638, but rather the situation in <em>Doben </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Paterson, </em>3 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>38; 127 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>38, where the writ was denied because the board of health was vested with a discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-12\">It seems that the board of commissioners may very well refuse to issue new permits for what they believe to be an unnecessary and an unsanitary business. Because there are some poultry markets which have been conducted for a long time, is no reason for the allowance of others, even though the effect of the action may be that fewer persons may engage in the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-13\">As before indicated, the granting of the permit and license <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>rests in the sound discretion of the health officer and the board of commissioners and there is nothing in the record to indicate that they have abused that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">The rule will be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
