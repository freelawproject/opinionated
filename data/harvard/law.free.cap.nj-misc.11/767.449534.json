The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>prosecutor is a member of the Hackensack Improvement Commission, the governing body of the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The item under attack is \u201creserve against uncollected taxes $200,400.\u201d The first ground is that this item violates that section of the Budget act which provides that the amount to be raised shall be stated, the appropriations itemized and the several items set forth accurately according to the respective and particular objects, departments or sub-departments for which the respective amounts are to be expended. Reliance is had upon <em>Mackey </em>v. Belvidere, 101 <em>N. J. L. </em>250; 128 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>859, where the appropriation held invalid was \u201cpreservation of life and property $12,150.\u201d In that.case Mr. Justice Trenchard held that the item in the budget gave the taxpayers no information as to how the money was to be spent and that there was nothing in the return to the writ which clarified it. In the instant case there seems little doubt of the purpose of the item.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Hnless the merits of the application are clear, the court ought not exercise the prerogative writ of <em>certiorari </em>to throw confusion into the financial affairs of the city. <em>Hourigan </em>v. <em>North </em>Bergen, 11 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>194; 165 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>74. We conclude the rights of the prosecutor are not clear in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">The rule to show cause is discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
