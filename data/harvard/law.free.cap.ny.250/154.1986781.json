The trial court committed error in excluding and interfering with cross-examination by defendant\u2019s attorney; in making disparaging and contemptuous remarks about defendant\u2019s case and attorney; in threatening defendant\u2019s attorney with punishment, and in assisting the People\u2019s case and appearing as opposed to the defense and as an advocate of conviction. <em>(Sarconi </em>v. <em>122 W. 26th St. Corp.) </em>241 N. Y. 340.) It was reversible error for the court to participate in the prosecution and make statements which were prejudicial to defendant\u2019s case and attorney. <em>(People </em>v.

It was so presented and paid. For these reasons, a majority of the members of the court entertain the view that the crime of uttering the forged check was partly committed in New York county. Other members think that the indictment having charged an uttering in New York county, necessarily charged possession in New York with intent to utter; consequently, that within the terms of the indictment the crime of uttering was committed in New York. (Penal Law, sec. 883.) All agree that defendant was properly indicted and tried in New York county. That the trial judge, upon various occasions throughout the trial, commented upon the conduct of the case by the defendant\u2019s counsel, in language which was intemperate and entirely unbecoming in a judicial officer, cannot be doubted. We believe that he would concur in that belief if he were to read his remarks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>over now that the heat of the trial has ended. We have carefully examined the record and have found no word uttered by defendant\u2019s counsel, and no act performed by him, which merited rebuke. Were the case a doubtful one we should have no hesitation in reversing the judgment for these or like remarks if made in such circumstances as to constitute error of law. However, we have found that the case made against the defendant was so well fortified by the evidence that no reasonable doubt of guilt could have been entertained by the jury. A verdict of acquittal would have involved a clear case of a miscarriage of justice. We feel constrained, therefore, to affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">The judgment of conviction should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Cardozo, Ch. J., Pound, Crane, Andrews, Lehman, Kellogg and O\u2019Brien, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
