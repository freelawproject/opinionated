If certain items in the proofs of loss presented by the insured to the insurer and upon which the loss was adjusted were largely overvalued, <em>prima facie </em>the plaintiff suffered injury. If in fact the adjusted loss did not exceed the fire loss because of undervaluation of other items, the burden was on the defendant to show that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>The judgment of the Appellate Division should be modified by striking out the direction for a dismissal of the complaint and by granting a new trial and as so modified affirmed, with costs in this court and in the Appellate Division to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Cardozo, Ch.
