We reverse in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">\u00b62 The issues on appeal are restated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">\u00b63 1. Whether \u00a7 39-2-703, MCA, expressly provides for a cause of action regarding mismanagement?</p>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">\u00b64 2. Whether Haux\u2019s claim is barred by the statute of limitations?</p>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b481-15\">\u00b65 Haux was employed by MRL as a railroad engineer and trainman. In November of 1999, MRL held an employee picnic outside the MRL depot in Helena. Haux assisted setting up for this picnic and also helped with cooking and serving food. Haux left the picnic in the morning and when he returned that night to report for work, he notice uncooked hamburger left over from the picnic in boxes on the picnic table. On his way out of the locker room, Haux noticed that some hamburger had been removed. Haux proceeded to place some of the hamburger in his truck and some in his tool box in the back of his truck \u201c[t]o secure the hamburger from theft[.]\u201d When Haux returned from his train rim early the next morning, the police arrested him for taking the hamburger. He was subsequently fired from his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-16\">\u00b66 Haux filed a complaint in which he alleged that his firing was negligent and malicious (in violation of \u00a7 39-2-703, MCA) and part of a general business practice designed to fire employees without cause. He also alleged MRL\u2019s conduct violated Montana Constitution Article II, Section 3 (inalienable right to pursue life\u2019s basic necessities). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Alleging that MRL\u2019s actions were malicious, fraudulent and intentional, he claimed punitive damages pursuant to \u00a7 27-1-221, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">\u00b67 MRL moved for judgment on the pleadings. The District Court cited <em>Dillon v. Great Northern Ry. Co. </em>(1909), 38 Mont. 485, 100 P. 960, as precedent and determined \u201cthat the statute did not create a new cause of action, but merely extended a right of a prior, existing cause of action to include damages for injuries caused by fellow-servants.\u201d The court determined our treatment of \u00a7 39-2-703, MCA, in <em>Winslow v. Montana Rail Link, </em>2000 MT 292, 302 Mont. 289, 16 P.3d 992, \u201cdid not consider whether the statute provided an independent cause of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">\u00b68 The court concluded that \u00a7 39-2-703, MCA, does not provide an independent cause of action and granted MRL\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court also granted MRL judgment on the pleadings regarding violation of the Montana Constitution because the court determined \u201c[u]nless specifically provided otherwise, the constitution protects citizens against state action, not against actions by a private citizen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">\u00b69 Because it ruled in favor of MRL on other grounds, the court did not rule on MRL\u2019s allegation that the statute of limitations barred Haux\u2019s claim. Haux appeals. We reverse in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">\u00b610 Issue 1: The single legal issue presented by Haux is whether \u00a7 39-2-703, MCA, expressly provides for a cause of action regarding mismanagement?</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">\u00b611 MRL goes to great lengths to persuade this Court that neither the history of \u00a7 39-2-703, MCA, nor this Court\u2019s previous interpretation of similar text support a conclusion that the statute creates a cause of action. Section 39-2-703, MCA, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-10\">(1) Every person or corporation operating a railway or railroad in this state is hable for all damages sustained by any employee of such person or corporation in consequence of the neglect of any other employee thereof or by the <em>mismanagement </em>of any other employee thereof and in consequence of the willful wrongs, whether of commission or omission, of any other employee thereof when such neglect, <em>mismanagement, </em>or wrongs are in any manner connected with the use and operation of any railway or railroad on or about which he is employed. No contract which restricts such liability is legal or binding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>(2) In case of the death of any such employee in consequence of any injury or damage so sustained, <em>the right of action provided by subsection (1) </em>shall survive and may be prosecuted and maintained by his heirs or personal representatives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-4\">(3) Every railway corporation doing business in this state, including electric railway corporations, is liable for damages sustained by an employee thereof within this state, subject to the provisions of 27-1-702, when such damages are caused by the negligence of any train dispatcher, telegraph operator, superintendent, master mechanic, yardmaster, conductor, engineer, motorman, or any other employee who has superintendence of any stationary or hand signal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">(4) No contract of insurance, relief, benefit, or indemnity in case of injury or death or any other contract entered into, either before or after the injury, between the person injured and any of the employers named in subsection (3) is a bar or defense to <em>any cause of action brought under the provisions of this section, </em>except as otherwise provided in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Section 39-2-703, MCA (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">\u00b612 As we have continuously stated, \u201c[t]he rules of statutory construction require the language of a statute to be construed according to its plain meaning.\u201d <em>Ravalli County v. Erickson, </em>2004 MT 35, \u00b6 11, 320 Mont. 31, \u00b6 11, 85 P.3d 772, \u00b6 11. If the language is clear, unambiguous, direct and certain, the statute speaks for itself, no further interpretation is required, and there is nothing left for the court to construe. <em>Ravalli County, \u00b6 </em>12.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">\u00b613 A plain reading of the language of \u00a7 39-2-703, MCA, clearly indicates this section does more than merely eliminate the fellow-servant defense to common-law causes of action as determined by the District Court. It provides for a cause of action for mismanagement. The statute, \u00a7 39-2-703(2), MCA, states that \u201c[i]n case of the death of any such employee in consequence of any injury or damage so sustained, <em>the right of action provided by subsection (1) </em>shall survive and may be prosecuted and maintained by his heirs or personal representatives[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) Likewise, \u00a7 39-2-703(4), MCA, states \u201c[n]o contract of insurance ... between the person injured and any of the employers named in subsection (3) is a bar or defense to <em>any cause of action brought under the provisions of this section ...\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">\u00b614 Although MRL argues, quoting <em>Dillon, </em>38 Mont, at 504,100 P. at 966, that the \u201clegislature <em>did not intend to create any new right of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number><em>action, </em>but merely recognized a right of action <em>existing at common law, </em>and sought to make that right available, notwithstanding the negligence of a fellow-servant[,]\u201d the language of the statutory section clearly provides for a right of action for mismanagement. Section 39-2-703(1), MCA. Nothing in the language of the section supports a conclusion that the statute was designed solely to eliminate the fellow-servant defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">\u00b615  As can be seen from the statutory language of \u00a7 39-2-703, MCA, the railroad is liable for all damages sustained by any railroad employee by the mismanagement of any other railroad employee when such mismanagement is connected with the use and operation of the railroad. Section 39-2-703(1), MCA. We need not entertain any other arguments regarding what the statute <em>could </em>mean when the language clearly states what the statute <em>does </em>mean. The language is clear, unambiguous, direct and certain; no further interpretation is required. <em>Ravalli County, \u00b6\u00b6 </em>11-12. The plain meaning of the language in \u00a7 39-2-703(1), MCA, requires that a railroad be held hable for mismanagement. <em>Ravalli County, </em>\u00b6 11; \u00a7 39-2-703(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\u00b616 The plain language in the current code section controls and we will not look beyond this plain language. <em>Ravalli County, \u00b6\u00b6 </em>11-12. We reiterate that courts should not insert language into a statute that the legislature has omitted. Section 1-2-101, MCA; <em>Winslow, </em>\u00b6 18. We stated in <em>Winslow </em>that nothing in the plain language of \u00a7 39-2-703, MCA, limits that statute to personal injuries caused by co-workers. <em>Winslow, </em>\u00b6 19. The broad language of the statute declares that railways are \u201cliable for all damages sustained by any employee\u201d as a consequence of the \u201cmismanagement of any other employee\u201d when such mismanagement is \u201cconnected with the use and operation of\u2019 the railway. Section 39-2-703(1), MCA; <em>Winslow, </em>\u00b6 19. The plain language of the statute, with terms neither omitted or inserted, states that MRL, as a railroad, is liable for employee damages sustained as a consequence of the mismanagement of any other employee when the mismanagement is connected with the use and operation of the railway. Section 39-2-703(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\u00b617 Although we have addressed the clear meaning of \u00a7 39-2-703, MCA, we will nonetheless address the case precedent MRL raises to clear up any confusion regarding the applicability of this statutory section. MRL claims that this Court, in <em>Winslow, </em>\u201cdid not \u2018squarely address\u2019 the question of whether \u00a7 39-2-703, creates a statutory cause of action or is merely a fellow-servant statute ....\u201d However, the text of <em>Winslow </em>squarely states that \u201c[t]he District Court [in Winslow] erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>in concluding that \u00a7 39-2-703, MCA, applies only to personal injury claims, <em>to the exclusion of mismanagement in the handling of an employee </em>termination.\u201d Winslow, \u00b6 20 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">\u00b618 MRL claims that <em>Winslow </em>\u201cnever considered or decided the precise question of law raised by MRL below and before this Court today - whether \u00a7 39-2-703, MCA, provides plaintiffs with a statutory cause of action or merely eliminates the fellow-servant defense.\u201d MRL further contends that the <em>Winslow </em>Court did not address \u201cthe holdings of <em>Dillon, Beeler, Johnson, </em>and <em>Melzner, </em>and certainly never expressly held that those early 20th century cases misinterpreted the original legislative intent.\u201d MRL claims that only those cases \u201chave \u2018squarely passed upon\u2019 the question at issue today, and only those opinions can be considered <em>stare decisis </em>on this issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">\u00b619 Curiously, although MRL was also the respondent in <em>Winslow, </em>in arguing <em>Winslow </em>it did not cite to or argue the significance of <em>Dillon, Beeler, and Johnson </em>- the cases it so strenuously argues now. Contrary to MRL\u2019s protestations, the <em>Winslow </em>decision squarely decided that \u00a7 39-2-703, MCA, provided a cause of action for railroad mismanagement. <em>Winslow, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-20. The cases MRL cites are early 20th century cases which do not interpret the statute\u2019s mismanagement language. MRL asserts that in <em>Dillon, </em>38 Mont. 485,100 P. <em>960; Beeler v. Butte &amp; London C. D. Co. </em>(1910), 41 Mont. 465, 110 P. 528; <em>Johnson v. Butte &amp; Superior Copper Co. </em>(1910), 41 Mont. 158, 108 P. 1057; and <em>Melzner v. Raven Copper Co. </em>(1913), 47 Mont. 351, 132 P. 552, we determined that \u00a7 39-2-703, MCA, was a fellow-servant statute that merely recognized a right of action existing at common law and sought to make that right available, notwithstanding the negligence of a fellow-servant. However, these cases are all distinguishable. Despite MRL\u2019s characterization, <em>Winslow\u2019s </em>interpretation of the language in the current \u00a7 39-2-703, MCA, is directly on point. From a plain reading of the language <em>o\u00ed Winslow </em>as well as the language of \u00a7 39-2-703, MCA, the railroad may be held liable for mismanagement.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">\u00b620 <em>Dillon </em>is distinguishable because it did not involve the mismanagement language of the statute; it focused on whether the statute was a \u201csurvival statute.\u201d In <em>Dillon, </em>we stated that a cause of action for wrongful death cannot be pursued by the employee decedent\u2019s heirs if the employee died instantaneously; it is necessary that the cause of action arise in favor of a decedent prior to his or her death for the action to survive the death. <em>Dillon, </em>38 Mont. at 503, 100 P. at 966.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">\u00b621 In <em>Johnson, </em>we determined a cause of action survived and could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>be prosecuted by the decedent\u2019s heirs when a miner was injured on the job and subsequently died from his injuries. The legislative intent of the statute of 1905, applicable in <em>Johnson, </em>was to be gathered \u201conly from the language employed and the evils which it was sought to cure.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>41 Mont. at 173, 108 P. at 1061. The statute at issue in <em>Johnson </em>was enacted with the purpose of eliminating the fellow-servant defense and of holding the mining company \u201cliable for the negligent acts of its shift-boss, whether the acts were done in the discharge of delegable or nondelegable duties, so long as they were done in the due course of his employment, whatever that might be.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>41 Mont. at 173-74, 108 P. at 1061-62. Although this 1905 statute included liability for mismanagement, the mismanagement portion of the statute was not at issue in <em>Johnson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">\u00b622 In <em>Beeler, </em>this Court affirmed a judgment (pursued under the 1905 statute) in favor of the heirs of a decedent mining-employee for damages suffered by the employee as the result of the negligence of a fellow-servant when the employee was crushed by the action of an engineer operating the movement of a mining cage. <em>Beeler, </em>41 Mont. at 473-78, 110 P. at 530-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">\u00b623 In <em>Melzner, </em>we discussed the liability of a mining company and the effect of contributory negligence on statutory claims. We determined that the pleader must bring himself or herself within the relevant statute and if an \u201cemployee was guilty of contributory negligence, that is a defensive fact to be asserted and shown by the defending employer, unless it appear from plaintiffs own pleading or proof.\u201d <em>Melzner, </em>47 Mont. at 358, 132 P. at 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">\u00b624 It must be noted that <em>Dillon, Beeler, Johnson </em>and <em>Melzner </em>were all negligence suits involving personal injury or death. The Court, in addressing the \u201cneglect\u201d language of \u00a7 39-2-703, MCA, acknowledged that claims for negligence were not the creation of the statute but were recognized at common law. None of these cases, however, dealt with the \u201cmismanagement\u201d language of the statute. Mismanagement is not a recognized cause of action at common law and thus does not fit within the rationale of <em>Dillon, Beeler, Johnson, </em>and <em>Melzner. </em>Unlike common law claims for negligence, mismanagement is a cause of action newly created by \u00a7 39-2-703, MCA. Since mismanagement was not at issue in <em>Dillon, Beeler, Johnson, </em>and <em>Melzner, </em>those decisions are distinguishable from our decision in <em>Winslow.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">\u00b625  <em>Winslow </em>clarified that a railroad may, through the application of \u00a7 39-2-703, MCA, be held liable for mismanagement in the handling of an employee termination. <em>Winslow, </em>\u00b6 20. This conclusion was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>reached without omitting or inserting any language into \u00a7 39-2-703(1), MCA. Section 1-2-101, MCA. The clear and unambiguous language of this section unmistakably allows a railroad to be held liable for all damages sustained by any railroad employee caused by the mismanagement of any other railroad employee when such mismanagement is connected with the use and operation of the railroad. Section 39-2-703(1), MCA; <em>Ravalli County, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11, 12. We reverse issue one and hold that \u00a7 39-2-703(1), MCA, provides a cause of action for mismanagement.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">\u00b626 Parenthetically, we note that Haux cites the inalienable right to protect and \u201cdefend life\u2019s basic necessities\u201d of Article II, Section 3, of the Montana Constitution as being an \u201cextremely strong public policy to recognize that the railroad mismanagement statute at \u00a7[39-2-]703 does create a cause of action.\u201d Since we hold that \u00a7 39-2-703, MCA, based upon its own terms, does create a cause of action for mismanagement, we need not address the constitutional argument.</p>\n<p id=\"Azn\">\u00b627 Issue 2: Whether Haux\u2019s claim is barred by the statute of limitations?</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">\u00b628 The District Court did not rule on MRL\u2019s statute of limitations argument because it decided that Haux could not pursue a mismanagement cause of action under \u00a7 39-2-703, MCA. However, we have previously stated that this Court \u201cwill affirm a district court\u2019s ruling if the court reached the correct result for the wrong reason.\u201d <em>Ritchie v. Town of Ennis, </em>2004 MT 43, \u00b6 8, 320 Mont. 94, \u00b6 8, 86 P.3d 11, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">\u00b629 On appeal, MRL argues that assuming that Haux has a statutory claim for mismanagement, the claim is barred by the two-year statute of limitations of \u00a7 27-2-211(l)(c), MCA. Section 27-2-211, MCA, provides that \u201c(1) [w]ithin 2 years is the period prescribed for the commencement of an action upon: ... (c) a liability created by statute other than: (i) a penalty or forfeiture; or (ii) a statutory debt created by the payment of public assistance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">\u00b630 Haux\u2019s claim is not in the nature of a \u201cpenalty or forfeiture\u201d or a \u201cstatutory debt created by the payment of public assistance.\u201d Therefore, the pertinent question is whether Haux\u2019s claim stems from a \u201cliability created by statute\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 27-2-211(l)(c), MCA. To determine the answer to this question, the appropriate inquiry is \u201cwhether liability would exist absent the statute in question.\u201d <em>Royal Ins. Co. v. Roadarmel, </em>2000 MT 259, \u00b6 17, 301 Mont. 508, \u00b6 17, 11 P.3d 105, \u00b6 17. A liability created by statute establishes a new rule of private right unknown to the common law and is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>obligation which the law creates in the absence of an agreement. <em>Royal Ins. Co., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">\u00b631 In <em>Beeler </em>we determined that the claim in question was not dependent upon a right created by statute (such as \u00a7 39-2-703, MCA) but was based upon a cause of action recognized at common law; that is, actionable negligence. Thus we applied the three-year statute of limitations applicable to negligence claims rather than the two-year statute of limitations for statutory claims. <em>Beeler, </em>41 Mont. at 472-73, 110 P. at 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\u00b632 Relying on <em>Beeler, </em>Haux argues that three years is the appropriate statute of limitations for a claim under \u00a7 39-2-703, MCA. He quotes our opinion in <em>Royal Ins. </em>Co., \u00b6 19, in which we stated that \u201c[w]here there is a substantial question as to which of two or more statutes of limitation should apply, the general rule is that the doubt should be resolved in favor of the statute containing the longest limitations....\u201d <em>Royal Ins. Co., </em>\u00b6 19 (citation omitted). He asserts that \u201cwhere doubt exists as to the nature of the action, courts lean toward application of the longer period of limitations\u201d (quoting <em>Ritland v. Rowe </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 453, 457, 861 P.2d 175, 178). He claims that a dispute exists as to the nature of the action in the present case with MRL characterizing it as a common law claim while Haux contends \u201cit is at the minimum a mix between common and statutory law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\u00b633 Despite Haux\u2019s characterization of his mismanagement claim as a \u201cmix\u201d of common law and statutory law, the claim for mismanagement is, as we have held above, purely a statutory claim. Accordingly, there is not a substantial question as to which of two statutes of limitations should apply. <em>Royal Ins. Co., </em>\u00b6 19. The applicable statute of limitations for a cause of action arising from statute is two years. Section 27-2-2 ll(l)(c), MCA. Here, Haux was terminated on December 27,1999, and did not file his complaint until October 10, 2002, which is beyond the two-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"Anp\">\u00b634  In conclusion, although the District Court erroneously concluded that \u00a7 39-2-703, MCA, does not provide a cause of action for mismanagement, in dismissing the suit, it reached the right result for the wrong reason. <em>See Ritchie, </em>\u00b6 8. The correct reason being that Haux\u2019s statutory claim for mismanagement is barred by the two-year statute of limitations. Section 27-2-211(l)(c), MCA. Therefore, we affirm the District Court decision but base our decision on separate grounds. <em>See Ritchie, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<judges id=\"b488-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, REGNIER, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>JUSTICE WARNER,</author>\n<p id=\"ACv\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">\u00b635 I agree with the Court\u2019s decision that Mr. Haux\u2019s claim is barred by the statute of limitations. I am forced by respect for the rule of <em>stare decisis </em>to concur in the Court\u2019s opinion concerning issue one. As is made clear by the Court, the question of whether an employee may recover damages for a wrongful termination because of a railroad\u2019s mismanagement was decided in the affirmative in <em>Winslow. </em>The result of <em>Winslow </em>was that the long discarded shield of an employer, the fellow servant rule, was transformed by the Court into a sword for an employee: the new, previously unheard of, statutory tort of railroad mismanagement. <em>Winslow </em>was handed down on November 27, 2000. Since then both the Fifty-seventh and Fifty-eighth Legislatures have convened and adjourned making no changes to \u00a7 39-2-703, MCA. I presume the Legislature was aware of the Court\u2019s interpretation of the statute, and if it disagreed would have amended it accordingly. <em>Swanson v. Hartford Ins. Co., </em>2002 MT 81, \u00b6 22, 309 Mont. 269, \u00b6 22, 46 P.3d 584, \u00b6 22; <em>Gaustad v. City of Columbus </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 379, 382, 877 P.2d 470, 472; <em>In re Wilson\u2019s Estate </em>(1936), 102 Mont. 178, 194, 56 P.2d 733, 737. Thus, I concur in the Court\u2019s opinion in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
