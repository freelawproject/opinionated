We affirm. \u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in denying Redlich\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">BACKGROUND, STANDARD OF REVIEW AND DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AAl\">\u00b63 Redlich\u2019s appeal stems from the same facts as <em>State v. Smith, </em>2004 MT 234, 322 Mont. 466, 97 P.3d 567. We need not recite the facts and standard of review here; instead we refer the reader to our opinion in <em>Smith. </em>The only relevant difference is that upon entering the apartment, the officers found Redlich in a bedroom rather than in the bathroom, where they found Smith. Redlich was charged with Unlawful Transactions with Children and Underage Possession of Alcohol. Like Smith, Redlich filed a motion to suppress evidence obtained during the warrantless search of the apartment. Redlich appeals the denial of said motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\u00b64  Based on the same rationale as we set forth in <em>\u00b6\u00b6 </em>8-11 of <em>Smith, </em>we affirm the District Court. The District Court did not err by denying Redlich\u2019s motion to suppress. Redlich did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy from the police in the common areas of the apartment, and thus did not having standing to challenge the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\u00b65 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b501-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER, LEAPHART, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
