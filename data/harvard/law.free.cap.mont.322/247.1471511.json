We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">\u00b62 The issues raised on appeal are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to sever the sexual assault charges from the sexual abuse of children charges?</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in granting the State\u2019s motion to amend the information?</p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b272-13\">\u00b65 Yecovenko and his then-girlfriend, D.S., began living together in August 1999 in Idaho. D.S. has two daughters, W.S. and V.S., who lived with her and Yecovenko. In December 1999 the four of them moved to Glasgow, Montana, initially living with Yecovenko\u2019s parents. In mid-January 2000 they moved into a separate residence in Glasgow. All four lived at this new residence until June 8, 2000, when Yecovenko moved back to his parents\u2019 home. At the time that they moved to Glasgow, W.S. was ten years old and V.S. was eleven years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-14\">\u00b66 Yecovenko worked one day a week at the stockyards, earning roughly fifteen to twenty-five dollars a day. This was his only income at the time. D.S. received Social Security benefits and veteran\u2019s benefits approximating $2300 per month. Being short of funds, D.S. arranged to have a friend purchase a computer for her with the understanding that she would pay him back, which she did. D.S. secured internet access for her new computer as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>\u00b67 Both D.S. and Yecovenko used the computer, keeping their files in separate folders labeled with their first names. Beginning around February 2000, Yecovenko began downloading pornographic images of all kinds, including those involving children. He stored these files on the hard drive in his folder. When D.S. discovered the images on the computer, she instructed Yecovenko to remove them. He then began storing most of the pornography on zip disks, though some files remained on the computer\u2019s hard drive. Yecovenko continued downloading pornographic images until he moved out of the house in June 2000, by which time he was spending extended hours online every day.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">\u00b68 During this time, Yecovenko also spent time with his friend, Harold Lindell. Lindell and Yecovenko discussed accessing internet pornography via Lindell\u2019s computer. Lindell maintained that his illiteracy prevented him from downloading the images himself. Yecovenko downloaded adult pornography with Lindell\u2019s permission, but Lindell forbade any child pornography. Despite this, Yecovenko downloaded child pornography both to Lindell\u2019s hard drive and to disks.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\u00b69 On June 8 or 9, 2000, W.S. told her mother that Yecovenko had made inappropriate comments to her. W.S. testified that about a week prior to moving out, Yecovenko had asked to see her \u201cprivate parts\u201d and had touched her inappropriately over her clothes. On June 30, 2000, V.S. told D.S. that Yecovenko had touched her. V.S. testified that Yecovenko had bribed her with money or privileges to permit him to touch her inappropriately directly on her skin, which he did on several occasions. D.S. subsequently took her daughters to make a report to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\u00b610 The investigation that followed uncovered ninety to one hundred images of child pornography on zip disks seized from Yecovenko\u2019s closet at his parents\u2019 residence. Duplicates of fifty-eight of these images were also found on Lindell\u2019s computer along with another six pornographic images of children.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">\u00b611 The District Court granted leave for the State to file an information on November 6, 2000. The defendant was charged with two counts of sexual assault for his conduct with W.S. and V.S. and two counts of sexual abuse of children, these latter charges relating to the images of child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">\u00b612 Prior to trial the defendant moved to sever the sexual assault charges from the sexual abuse of children charges. In support of his motion, the defendant stated (1) that the only similarities between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>two sets of charges were the place and some overlap in time, (2) that the elements of the two sets of offenses were \u201ctotally different,\u201d and (3) that he would be \u201cextremely prejudiced\u201d with respect to one set of offenses by the evidence offered to prove the other set. The defendant\u2019s attorney submitted an affidavit in support of the motion to sever which stated that the evidence \u201cis of such a nature that it would incur and create great prejudice towards the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\u00b613 During trial, the jury viewed ten of the images that were common to each collection of illicit pornography. These images were offered as proof of the sexual abuse of children charges only.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u00b614 On October 10,2001, nineteen days prior to trial, the State moved to amend the information to expand the date range for each of the four counts. For the sexual assault counts, the State sought to change the date ranges from \u201cMay and/or June 2000,\u201d to \u201cMarch 2000 through June 2000.\u201d For the sexual abuse of children counts, the State sought to change the date ranges from \u201cJune and/or July 2000,\u201d to \u201cMarch 2000 through July 2000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\u00b615 On October 24, 2001, five days prior to trial, the District Court partially granted the State\u2019s motion. One count of sexual assault was left unchanged, but the other three counts were amended as requested. \u00b616 The jury convicted Yecovenko on all four counts. He now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">\u00b617 We review denial of a motion to sever counts into separate trials for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Freshment, </em>2002 MT 61, \u00b6 25, 309 Mont. 154, \u00b6 25, 43 P.3d 968, \u00b6 25. We review a district court\u2019s decision to permit an amendment to a criminal complaint or information for abuse of discretion. <em>Red Lodge v. Kennedy, </em>2002 MT 89, \u00b6 10, 309 Mont. 330, \u00b6 10, 46 P.3d 602, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">\n<em>\u00b618 Did the District Court err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to sever the sexual assault charges from the sexual abuse of children charges?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">\u00b619  A criminal defendant seeking to sever counts into separate trials has the burden of proving that severing the counts is necessary to prevent unfair prejudice. <em>Freshment, </em>\u00b6 26. Proving that some prejudice will result from a joint trial or that separate trials would provide a better chance of acquittal is not sufficient. \u201cRather, a defendant has the burden to demonstrate prejudice that will prevent a fair trial.\u201d <em>Freshment, </em>\u00b6 26. Where the charges are few and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>evidence is simple and distinct, a jury is less likely to be confused and prejudice is more difficult to demonstrate. <em>Freshment, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-4\">In considering whether prejudice will prevent a fair trial, there are three types of prejudice a defendant may prove that must be considered by a trial court. First, the accumulation of evidence may be such that a jury would find the defendant a bad person and wish to convict the defendant of something. Second, a jury might use evidence of guilt on one count to convict on another count, even though that evidence would be inadmissable at a separate trial on the latter count. Third, the defendant may suffer prejudice by wanting to testify on one count and not another. Abuse of discretion by a district court only occurs where the court fails to properly weigh these three types of prejudice against the judicial economy resulting from a joint trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-5\"><em>Freshment, </em>\u00b6 27 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">\u00b620 Yecovenko argues on appeal that the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to sever was error because he was subject to the first two types of prejudice. Specifically, he contends that the evidence accumulated such that the jury considered him a bad man and that evidence of the counts dealing with child pornography would have been inadmissible in a separate trial on the sexual assault counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">\u00b621 However, Yecovenko raises arguments on appeal which he failed to raise in the District Court. At trial, Yecovenko failed to assert the type of prejudice he would incur if the charges were not severed. Instead, his motion to sever and his attorney\u2019s supporting affidavit simply asserted that prejudice would result. The District Court noted this in its order denying the motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-8\">Defendant has not made any allegations that by trying these charges together to a jury he would be considered as a bad man on the basis of the accumulative evidence. He\u2019s further not made any charges or allegations that the jury would use proof of guilt on one count to convict him of a second or other count, even though that proof would be inadmissible on the second or other count.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">A plain assertion that the defendant would be \u201cextremely prejudiced\u201d or that the evidence is such that it would create \u201cgreat prejudice towards the defendant\u201d is distinguishable from a claim which identifies a specific prejudice which our law has recognized. Such bald assertions fail to fulfill the requirement for pretrial motions that a \u201cmotion must state with particularity the grounds for the motion and the order or relief sought.\u201d Section 46-13-101(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>\u00b622  To be clear, the defendant must first allege specific prejudice and then demonstrate how that prejudice will prevent a fair trial. In the District Court, Yecovenko failed to allege the nature or type of prejudice which would occur absent a severance of the counts, and thus, failed to satisfy this threshold requirement. Although he attempts to demonstrate prejudice on appeal, this Court will not consider new issues or changes in legal theory on appeal. <em>State v. Peterson, </em>2002 MT 65, \u00b6 24, 309 Mont. 199, \u00b6 24, 44 P.3d 499, \u00b6 24; <em>Unified Industries, Inc. v. Easley, </em>1998 MT 145, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 255, \u00b6 15, 961 P.2d 100, \u00b6 15; <em>see also Akhtar v. Van de Wetering </em>(1982), 197 Mont. 205, 209, 642 P.2d 149, 152. \u201cWe will not put a trial court in error on an issue raised by a party on appeal where it was not given the opportunity to address the issue.\u201d <em>State v. Root, </em>1999 MT 203, \u00b6 17, 296 Mont. 1, \u00b6 17, 987 P.2d 1140, \u00b6 17. Therefore, we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of the motion to sever and do not reach the merits of Yecovenko\u2019s prejudice argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">\u00b623 <em>Did the District Court err in granting the State\u2019s motion to amend the information?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\u00b624 Section 46-11-205, MCA, provides for an amendment to a criminal information as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">Amending information as to substance or form. (1) The court may allow an information to be amended in matters of substance at any time, but not less than 5 days before trial, provided that a motion is filed in a timely manner, states the nature of the proposed amendment, and is accompanied by an affidavit stating facts that show the existence of probable cause to support the charge as amended. A copy of the proposed amended information must be included with the motion to amend the information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">(2) If the court grants leave to amend the information, the defendant must be arraigned on the amended information without unreasonable delay and must be given a reasonable period of time to prepare for trial on the amended information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">(3) The court may permit an information to be amended as to form at any time before a verdict or finding is issued if no additional or different offense is charged and if the substantial rights of the defendant are not prejudiced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">\u00b625 \u201cAn amendment is one of form when the same crime is charged, the elements of the crime and the proof required remain the same and the defendant is informed of the charges against him.\u201d <em>Red Lodge, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>\u00b626 Yecovenko argues that the District Court erred when it permitted the State to amend the information eleven months after the court first granted leave to file an information because the amendment was untimely. In doing so, Yecovenko is implicitly suggesting that the changes to the information were of substance rather than of form.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">\u00b627  We disagree. The amendment to the information merely changed the date ranges of three of the four counts, and then only by a few months. The same crimes were charged, the elements and proof required did not change, and the defendant was informed of the charges against him. Moreover, the defendant was not prejudiced in any way by the change. Therefore, the amendment was one of form, not substance, and the District Court did not abuse its discretion in allowing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\u00b628  Yecovenko failed to preserve for appeal the issue of prejudice resulting from a joint trial of the sexual assault charges and the sexual abuse of children charges. The District Court did not abuse its discretion by permitting an amendment of form to the information.</p>\n<p id=\"A1R\">\u00b629 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b277-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
