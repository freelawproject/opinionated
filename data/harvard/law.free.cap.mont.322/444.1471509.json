Peterson of the misdemeanor offenses of careless driving and driving under the influence of alcohol. After a number of interim procedural steps, the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, affirmed an earlier order upholding the Municipal Court\u2019s denial of certain pretrial motions. Peterson appeals and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in affirming the Municipal Court\u2019s determination that an officer had particularized suspicion to stop Peterson when no recording of the hearing on Peterson\u2019s motion was available for review?</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in affirming the Municipal Court\u2019s denial of Peterson\u2019s motion to dismiss for unnecessary delay in his initial appearance?</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err in affirming the Municipal Court\u2019s denial of Peterson\u2019s motion to dismiss for violation of his constitutional right to a speedy trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">\u00b66 4. Did the District Court err in affirming the Municipal Court\u2019s denial of Peterson\u2019s discovery request to review an officer\u2019s personnel records?</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b469-14\">\u00b67 On August 30, 2001, Billings Police Officer Shawn Finnegan issued Peterson a notice to appear October 2, 2001, in the Billings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Municipal Court on charges of careless driving and driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). Peterson appeared and pled not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">\u00b68 Peterson moved to dismiss, alleging Finnegan lacked particularized suspicion to stop his vehicle. He also moved to suppress his breath test results, alleging improper administration of his breath alcohol tests. After a hearing, the Municipal Court orally denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">\u00b69 Peterson also moved for an order requiring the City to respond to discovery requests, one of which asked for \u201c[t]he personnel records of the officers involved in defendant\u2019s arrest and in the operation of any tests given him.\u201d After a hearing, the Municipal Court denied the request for personnel records and granted Peterson\u2019s other discovery requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">\u00b610 The Municipal Court originally scheduled trial for December 5, 2001. The City moved for continuances on November 27, December 11 and February 22. Peterson did not object to the first continuance, which was due to the prosecutor\u2019s illness. The Municipal Court granted the second and third motions, which were based on Finnegan\u2019s unavailability, over Peterson\u2019s objections. Peterson then moved to dismiss, asserting unnecessary delay in his initial appearance and violation of his constitutional right to a speedy trial. The Municipal Court denied the motion. On April 1, 2002, a jury convicted Peterson of both charged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">\u00b611 Peterson appealed to the District Court, requesting preparation of a trial transcript and all recorded pretrial hearings. The Municipal Court transmitted the record, including a form identifying the tape of the pretrial hearing on Peterson\u2019s particularized suspicion motion as #945. The tape was not transmitted, as Peterson\u2019s briefs to the District Court acknowledged.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">\u00b612 The District Court affirmed in part, determining the Municipal Court correctly denied Peterson\u2019s pretrial motions, but reversed on other issues and remanded for retrial. On remand, Peterson pled guilty, reserving the right to appeal those portions of the District Court\u2019s earlier order affirming the Municipal Court. The District Court granted Peterson\u2019s request to reaffirm its earlier order for purposes of appeal to this Court. Peterson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">\u00b613 The existence of particularized suspicion to justify an investigatory stop is a question of fact determined under the totality of the circumstances. <em>State v. Eixenberger, </em>2004 MT 127, \u00b6 16, 321 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Mont. 298, \u00b6 16, 90 P.3d 453, \u00b6 16 (citation omitted). A court\u2019s finding of particularized suspicion is reviewed under the clearly erroneous test. <em>See State v. Nelson, </em>2004 MT 13, \u00b6 5, 319 Mont. 250, \u00b6 5, 84 P.3d 25, \u00b6 5 (citation omitted). Whether an initial appearance violated \u00a7 46-7-101(1), MCA, is a question of statutory construction, which we review for correctness. <em>See City of Missoula v. Lesko, </em>2003 MT 177, \u00b6 7, 316 Mont. 401, \u00b6 7, 73 P.3d 166, \u00b6 7 (citation omitted). Whether a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial was violated is a question of constitutional law, which we also review for correctness. <em>See State v. Ray, </em>2003 MT 171, \u00b6 12, 316 Mont. 354, \u00b6 12, 71 P.3d 1247, \u00b6 12 (citations omitted). Orders granting or denying discovery are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. DuBray, </em>2003 MT 255, \u00b6 103, 317 Mont. 377, \u00b6 103, 77 P.3d 247, \u00b6 103 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">\u00b614 1. Did the District Court err in affirming the Municipal Court\u2019s determination that Finnegan had particularized suspicion to stop Peterson when no recording of the hearing on Peterson\u2019s motion was available for review?</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">\u00b615 In reviewing the Municipal Court\u2019s finding of particularized suspicion, the District Court noted the recording of the pretrial hearing was unavailable and stated it \u201creviewed the record before it....\u201d The District Court relied on Finnegan\u2019s experience in DUI investigations, his observations of Peterson crossing a dividing line and making an improper turn, his identification of Peterson and Peterson\u2019s comment that he was possibly swerving.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">\u00b616 Peterson contends the District Court could not affirm the Municipal Court in the absence of the pretrial hearing tape. He first relies on <em>FIRS Holding Co., Inc. v. Lemley </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 490, 901 P.2d 571. There, a judge amended a retired judge\u2019s findings of fact after a bench trial without reviewing a transcript. On appeal, we held the amending judge committed reversible error. <em>FIRS Holding, </em>272 Mont. at 492, 901 P.2d at 573. In <em>FIRS Holding, </em>the amending judge essentially made new findings of fact. Here, the District Court merely reviewed the Municipal Court\u2019s oral decision. <em>FIRS Holding </em>is of no assistance to Peterson.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">\u00b617 Peterson next argues the District Court had \u201cnothing to review.\u201d In its order, the District Court listed several facts that did not appear in the documents of record. The record reflects the District Court did not have the tape of the particularized suspicion hearing, but did have one or more recordings of Peterson\u2019s proceedings. On these facts, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>accept the District Court\u2019s repeated statements that it reviewed the record before it and that the record reflected the evidence on which the District Court relied. The propriety of doing so is further buttressed in this case by Peterson\u2019s total failure to argue, or even hint, that the pretrial hearing tape would have shown error in any part of the District Court\u2019s order on review.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">\u00b618 Peterson next asserts the District Court violated \u201cstatutory mandates\u201d by affirming based on an incomplete record. He points to \u00a7\u00a7 3-6-101(1), -110(1), and -302, MCA, which provide that a municipal court must \u201cbe a court of record,\u201d an appeal to a district court is \u201cconfined to review of the record and questions of law,\u201d and a municipal court clerk is responsible for keeping records. Nothing in the statutes precludes a district court from affirming on an incomplete record, provided the record is sufficient for review. The District Court having determined it had a sufficient record, we conclude Peterson has not established a violation of the statutory mandates on which he relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">\u00b619 Peterson next argues he cannot be held responsible for the municipal court clerk\u2019s failure to transmit a complete record. An appellant bears the burden of establishing error on appeal, however, and a trial court\u2019s decision is presumed correct. <em>See State v. Aakre, </em>2002 MT 101, \u00b6 43, 309 Mont. 403, \u00b6 43, 46 P.3d 648, \u00b6 43 (citation omitted). Peterson does not assert, let alone establish, error in the Municipal Court\u2019s finding of particularized suspicion. Nor, as just discussed, does he contend that a complete record would have established error by the District Court in reviewing that finding. Therefore, we conclude Peterson has not met his burden on appeal. \u00b620 In this regard, however, the Court is increasingly alarmed about the number of cases currently on appeal to this Court which involve incomplete, unavailable and disorderly municipal cotut records. It is apparent that some municipal courts do not properly docket case documents or preserve recordings. When clerks of municipal courts fail to meet their statutory obligation to maintain and provide an appropriate record on appeal, the consequences to the parties, district courts, this Court and other litigants can be significant. In the present case, the District Court had a sufficient record for review purposes, but the amount of time and resources squandered by counsel and courts as a result of the clerk\u2019s failure to provide the entire record on appeal can never be recovered. Moreover, it is not unlikely that crucial evidence will be lost in some future case if municipal court clerks do not satisfy their statutory obligations. The people of Montana would not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>amused to learn that misdemeanor criminal convictions may be in jeopardy because of sloppy record-keeping by their municipal employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">\u00b621 Finally, we note the City\u2019s reference to Rule 9(e), U.M.C.R.App., which allows an appellant to prepare a statement of the evidence or proceedings \u201cwithin 3 days from the hearing or trial or such time extended as the municipal court may for good cause shown permit\u201d if a record is unavailable, as well as its argument that Peterson failed to follow this procedure. In this regard, we observe that Rule 9(f), U.M.C.R.App., allows parties to submit an agreed statement of the record in lieu of the record on appeal. Peterson correctly responds that the City\u2019s legal theory regarding Rule 9(e), U.M.C.R.App., is presented for the first time on appeal. Consequently, and in accordance with our longstanding rule that we do not address theories or issues raised for the first time on appeal, we do not address the City\u2019s argument. <em>See, e.g., State v. May, </em>2004 MT 45, \u00b6 15, 320 Mont. 116, \u00b6 15, 86 P.3d 42, \u00b6 15 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">\u00b622  We hold the District Court did not err in affirming the Municipal Court\u2019s finding of particularized suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">\u00b623 2. Did the District Court err in affirming the Municipal Court\u2019s denial of Peterson\u2019s motion to dismiss for unnecessary delay in his initial appearance?</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">\u00b624 The Municipal Court denied Peterson\u2019s motion to dismiss for unnecessary delay in his initial appearance. The District Court affirmed on appeal, agreeing that a 33-day delay would not be normal procedure for an incarcerated defendant but was acceptable for a defendant who received a notice to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">\u00b625 Peterson asserts the delay violated \u00a7 46-7-101(1), MCA, which reads \u201c[a] person arrested, whether with or without a warrant, must be taken without unnecessary delay before the nearest and most accessible judge for an initial appearance.\u201d He contends the statute applies to all arrested persons, whether incarcerated or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">\u00b626 The City responds that Peterson was not arrested and, therefore, the statute does not apply. The District Court\u2019s order states Peterson was arrested. The City did not cross-appeal the issue of whether Peterson was arrested vis-a-vis \u00a7 46-7-101(1), MCA. Therefore, that issue is not properly before us. <em>See State v. Gardner, </em>2003 MT 338, \u00b6 24, 318 Mont. 436, \u00b6 24, 80 P.3d 1262, \u00b6 24. Consequently, for purposes of this case, Peterson was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">\u00b627 Returning to Peterson\u2019s argument, he first relies on <em>County of Riverside v. McLaughlin </em>(1991), 500 U.S. 44, 56, 111 S.Ct. 1661, 1670, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>114 L.Ed.2d 49, 63, in which the United States Supreme Court stated \u201ca jurisdiction that provides judicial determinations of probable cause within 48 hours of arrest will, as a general matter, comply with the promptness requirement\u201d of a prior case. <em>McLaughlin </em>has no application here. That case involved Fourth Amendment considerations relating to \u201cprompt\u201d probable cause determinations for persons arrested and detained. <em>McLaughlin, </em>500 U.S. at 55-56, 111 S.Ct. at 1669-70, 114 L.Ed.2d at 62. The present case involves neither a probable cause determination nor a detained person.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">\u00b628 Next, Peterson acknowledges our statement in <em>State v. Dieziger </em>(1982), 200 Mont. 267, 270, 650 P.2d 800, 802 (citation omitted), that the purposes of \u00a7 46-7-101, MCA, are to enable a defendant to assist in preparing the defense and to protect a defendant from being held incommunicado for a protracted time. He also correctly observes that the Montana Legislature amended \u00a7 46-7-101, MCA, after <em>Dieziger. See </em>1991 Mont. Laws, Ch. 800, Sec. 87. Peterson argues <em>Dieziger </em>is irrelevant to the present case because of the amendment, the lack of arrest and timing of the charge in <em>Dieziger, </em>and the failure of the defendant in <em>Dieziger </em>to file a suppression motion or put on a defense. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">\u00b629 Section 46-7-101, MCA, as addressed in <em>Dieziger, </em>provided in pertinent part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">[a]ny person making an arrest without a warrant shall take the arrested person without unnecessary delay before the nearest or most accessible judge in the same county, and a complaint stating the charges against the arrested person shall be filed forthwith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsD\"><em>Dieziger, </em>200 Mont. at 269-70, 650 P.2d at 802. The statutory language \u201cwithout unnecessary delay,\u201d upon which Dieziger\u2019s determination of the statute\u2019s purposes was based, remains unchanged in \u00a7 46-7-101, MCA, as amended. Nothing in the 1991 amendments to \u00a7 46-7-101, MCA, impacts on the statute\u2019s purposes as stated in <em>Dieziger. </em>Moreover, factual distinctions between <em>Dieziger </em>and the present case do not relate to the statute\u2019s purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">\u00b630  Here, Peterson was not incarcerated and does not assert impairment of his defense due to the 33-day delay in his initial appearance. Under these facts and given the purposes of \u00a7 46-7-101(1), MCA, we discern no error in the District Court\u2019s agreement with the Municipal Court that the delay in Peterson\u2019s initial appearance was acceptable under the statute. Having concluded the 33-day delay of Peterson\u2019s initial appearance did not violate the statutory requirement, we need not consider Peterson\u2019s arguments regarding the appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>remedy for a violation of \u00a7 46-7-101(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">\u00b631  We hold the District Court did not err in affirming the Municipal Court\u2019s denial of Peterson\u2019s motion to dismiss for unnecessary delay in his initial appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">\u00b632 3. Did the District Court err in affirming the Municipal Court\u2019s denial of Peterson\u2019s motion to dismiss for violation of his constitutional right to a speedy trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">\u00b633 On August 30, 2001, Peterson received a notice to appear and Finnegan filed a complaint against him. Peterson\u2019s trial occurred April 1, 2002. He argues his constitutional right to a speedy trial was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">\u00b634 The constitutional right to a speedy trial attaches at arrest or the filing of a complaint. <em>Ray, </em>\u00b6 23 (citations omitted). Four factors pertain to constitutional speedy trial analysis: (1) the length of the delay; (2) the reason for it; (3) the defendant\u2019s assertion of the right; and (4) the prejudice to the defense. <em>Ray, </em>\u00b6 13 (citation omitted). In the present case, the parties agree that the length of the delay mandates constitutional speedy trial analysis and that Peterson timely asserted his right to a speedy trial. It also is undisputed that Peterson carries the burden of establishing prejudice under the fourth factor. <em>See Ray, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14, 16, 24 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">\u00b635 Peterson\u2019s constitutional speedy trial argument focuses on prejudice to the defense. We analyze whether prejudice exists based on the three interests speedy trials are intended to protect: (1) prevention of oppressive pretrial incarceration; (2) minimization of anxiety and concern; and (3) avoidance of impairment of the defense. <em>State v. Longhorn, </em>2002 MT 135, \u00b6 33, 310 Mont. 172, \u00b6 33, 49 P.3d 48, \u00b6 33 (citation omitted). The weightiest interest is avoiding impairment of the defense. <em>Longhorn, </em>\u00b6 39 (citation omitted). Here, Peterson was not incarcerated and does not contend his defense was impaired. He asserts, however, that he \u201cexperienced considerable anxiety\u201d in missing work to attend proceedings that were rescheduled several times.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">\u00b636 Because anxiety and concern are inherent in being charged with an offense, the proper analysis is the degree to which a delay of trial aggravated them. <em>Longhorn, </em>\u00b6 38 (citation omitted). Based on his assertion that he \u201cexperienced considerable anxiety,\u201d Peterson contends that \u201cvirtually no defendant, knowing that he would have to take that much time off work and be prepared for so many fruitless hearings and trial dates, would ever be likely to contest a misdemeanor charge.\u201d He advances no authority under which these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>asserted facts would constitute sufficient prejudice to warrant reversal, however. Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., requires an appellant to support arguments with citations to the record and to relevant authorities; an appellant cannot meet the burden of establishing error absent such citations. <em>See State v. Bailey, </em>2004 MT 87, \u00b6 26, 320 Mont. 501, \u00b6 26, 87 P.3d 1032, \u00b6 26 (citation omitted). We conclude Peterson\u2019s missed work, repeated court appearances, and related anxiety-standing alone-are insufficient to constitute the prejudice necessary to establish a violation of his constitutional right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">\u00b637  We hold the District Court did not err in affirming the Municipal Court\u2019s denial of Peterson\u2019s motion to dismiss for violation of his constitutional right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">\u00b638 4. Did the District Court err in affirming the Municipal Court\u2019s denial of Peterson\u2019s request to review Finnegan\u2019s personnel records?</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">\u00b639 Peterson moved for discovery of 16 items, including the personnel files of officers involved in his case-namely, Finnegan\u2019s file. In support of his motion, Peterson relied on \u00a7 46-15-322(1), MCA, United States Supreme Court cases cited for due process principles, <em>United States v. Henthorn </em>(9th Cir. 1991), 931 F.2d 29, and right to know statutes. The Municipal Court granted all of Peterson\u2019s discovery requests except the request for Finnegan\u2019s personnel file, reasoning the request was not sufficiently supported to warrant an <em>in camera </em>investigation of the file for exculpatory evidence. The District Court affirmed, and Peterson asserts error.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">\u00b640 Pursuant to \u00a7 46-15-322(1), MCA, a prosecutor must make certain material and information available to a defendant upon request. Peterson does not identify what language in \u00a7 46-15-322(1), MCA, supports his request for Finnegan\u2019s file.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">\u00b641 In <em>State v. Romero </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 58, 74, 926 P.2d 717, 727, this Court applied \u00a7 46-15-322(5), MCA, to a defendant\u2019s request for an officer\u2019s personnel file. Section 46-15-322(5), MCA, provides in pertinent part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-9\">[ujpon motion showing that the defendant has substantial need in the preparation of the case for additional material or information not otherwise provided for ... the court, in its discretion, may order any person to make it available to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">In <em>Romero, </em>a defendant requested an officer\u2019s personnel file, and the State denied his request. The defendant did not seek to compel production, but filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to preclude the officer from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>testifying. <em>Romero, </em>279 Mont. at 73, 926 P.2d at 726. The district court denied the motion, advising that \u00a7 46-15-322(5), MCA, required the defendant to secure a court order compelling discovery of the personnel file. We affirmed, agreeing that the defendant had failed to file a discovery motion. <em>Romero, </em>279 Mont. at 74, 926 P.2d at 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">\u00b642 Here, the District Court relied on <em>Romero </em>and applied \u00a7 46-15-322(5), MCA, to Peterson\u2019s request for Finnegan\u2019s file. The District Court concluded Peterson had not demonstrated \u201csubstantial need\u201d for the file because the basis for his request was \u201ccross-examination purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">\u00b643 On appeal, Peterson does not contest the applicability of \u00a7 46-15-322(5), MCA, to his request for Finnegan\u2019s file. Indeed, he correctly asserts he satisfied <em>Romero\u2019s </em>requirement that a defendant must file a motion for discovery of a personnel file. He contends, however, that he could not specify how he would use the information in Finnegan\u2019s file until he obtained it. This argument ignores the plain language of \u00a7 46-15-322(5), MCA, which requires a motion demonstrating substantial need.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">\u00b644 Peterson further argues he should have had an opportunity to inquire about whether Finnegan\u2019s file contained any blemishes, because the Municipal and District Courts relied on Finnegan\u2019s training, experience and awards in their determinations that Finnegan was an experienced officer who developed particularized suspicion based on his observations. Peterson did not offer and could not have offered this justification in his original motion, as required by \u00a7 46-15-322(5), MCA, because he filed his discovery motion more than two months before the hearing in the Municipal Court on the particularized suspicion issue. We conclude Peterson did not establish \u201csubstantial need\u201d for Finnegan\u2019s personnel file, as required by \u00a7 46-15-322(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">\u00b645 Alternatively, Peterson asserts a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process is violated when the prosecution fails to produce relevant documents that could be used to cross-examine key government witnesses. He cites <em>Davis v. Alaska </em>(1974), 415 U.S. 308, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347, and <em>Kyles v. Whitley </em>(1995), 514 U.S. 419, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490, in support of this assertion, but neither discusses nor applies those cases to the present case. It is not this Court\u2019s obligation to develop parties\u2019 arguments for them. <em>State v. Flowers, </em>2004 MT 37, \u00b6 44, 320 Mont. 49, \u00b6 44, 86 P.3d 3, \u00b6 44 (citation omitted). Thus, we address <em>Davis </em>and <em>Kyles </em>only briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">\u00b646 In <em>Davis, </em>the United States Supreme Court held a defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>right to cross-examination under the Confrontation Clause was violated when a trial court issued a protective order precluding defense counsel from using a juvenile\u2019s record to impeach him regarding his potential bias or motive in identifying the defendant as the perpetrator of a crime. <em>Davis, </em>415 U.S. at 317-18, 94 S.Ct. at 1111, 39 L.Ed.2d at 354-55. The Supreme Court further determined the constitutional error required automatic reversal. <em>Davis, </em>415 U.S. at 318, 94 S.Ct. at 1111, 39 L.Ed.2d at 355. Thus, <em>Davis </em>did not address a due process violation stemming from a prosecution\u2019s failure to provide information. Nor does Peterson assert a violation of the Confrontation Clause. Therefore, his reliance on <em>Davis </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">\u00b647 <em>Kyles </em>addressed a habeas corpus petitioner\u2019s argument that the prosecution violated his right to due process by failing to provide information to the defense before his capital murder trial. The undisclosed information included, among other things, six inconsistent eyewitness descriptions of the murderer; license numbers taken from vehicles at the crime scene; an informant\u2019s inconsistent statements; and evidence linking the informant to other crimes at the same location and to a similar, unrelated murder. <em>Kyles, </em>514 U.S. at 428-29, 115 S.Ct. at 1563, 131 L.Ed.2d at 502. Applying a line of cases stemming from Brady <em>v. Maryland </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, the Supreme Court held a due process violation occurred because the cumulative effect of the undisclosed evidence amounted to a reasonable probability that the result of the defendant\u2019s trial would have been different if the evidence had been disclosed. <em>Kyles, </em>514 U.S. at 432-54, 115 S.Ct. at 1565-75, 131 L.Ed.2d at 505-18.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao5\">\u00b648 Peterson does not assert a <em>Brady </em>violation occurred in this case. Again, this Court is not obligated to formulate arguments on a party\u2019s behalf. <em>Flowers, </em>\u00b6 44. Peterson\u2019s passing reference to <em>Kyles </em>is insufficient to raise <em>a Brady </em>claim or a constitutional challenge to \u00a7 46-15-322(5), MCA. Therefore, we decline to address <em>Kyles </em>further.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">\u00b649 Peterson next advances <em>Henthorn </em>as authority specifically addressing discovery of law enforcement officers\u2019 personnel files. As with <em>Davis </em>and <em>Kyles, </em>he does not set forth any argument regarding the application of <em>Henthorn </em>to the present case, but merely quotes from it. In <em>Henthorn, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the government must inspect a testifying officer\u2019s personnel file upon a defendant\u2019s request for the file\u2019s production, must turn over any material information from the file to the defense, and must submit information to the trial court for an <em>in camera </em>review if the materiality of the information is uncertain. <em>Henthorn, </em>931 F.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>30-31. Under <em>Henthorn, </em>the defendant is not required to \u201cmake an initial showing of materiality\u201d in order to trigger the government\u2019s obligation to inspect the file. <em>Henthorn, </em>931 F.2d at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">\u00b650 As noted above, Peterson does not set forth any argument regarding Henthorn\u2019s application and, specifically, the relationship of <em>Henthorn </em>and \u00a7 46-15-322(5), MCA. Moreover, Peterson does not attempt in his reply brief to refute the City\u2019s contention that <em>Henthorn </em>is inapposite because it did not concern \u00a7 46-15-322(5), MCA, <em>Romero </em>superceded it, and analysis under Montana law may differ due to the Montana Constitution\u2019s right to privacy. We decline to formulate arguments on Peterson\u2019s behalf. <em>See Flowers, </em>\u00b6 44. In light of Peterson\u2019s failure to present an argument, we decline to address <em>Henthorn </em>further.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">\u00b651 Finally, Peterson relies on <em>Great Falls Tribune v. Sheriff </em>(1989), 238 Mont. 103, 775 P.2d 1267, in asserting his entitlement to Finnegan\u2019s personnel file under the constitutional right to know. In the Municipal Court, however, he based his discovery request on \u00a7\u00a7 2-6-102 and -104, MCA, rather than the right to know set forth in Article II, Section 9, of the Montana Constitution and discussed in <em>Great Falls Tribune. </em>Section 2-6-102, MCA, entitles citizens to inspect and copy public writings, with exceptions for constitutionally protected materials and certain statutorily protected materials. Section 2-6-104, MCA, provides that public records and other matters in the office of any public officer are open to public inspection during office hours, except as provided by law. In this regard, Peterson presents no argument regarding the application of \u00a7\u00a7 2-6-102 and -104, MCA. Peterson\u2019s assertion of a violation of the constitutional right to know constitutes a change of legal theory from his earlier reliance on right to know statutes. As stated above, we do not address changes in legal theory on appeal. <em>May, </em>\u00b6 15. Therefore, we decline to address Peterson\u2019s <em>Great Falls Tribune </em>argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\u00b652 We hold the District Court did not err in affirming the Municipal Court\u2019s denial of Peterson\u2019s discovery request to review Finnegan\u2019s file.</p>\n<p id=\"AIH\">\u00b653 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b479-7\">JUSTICES REGNIER, NELSON, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
