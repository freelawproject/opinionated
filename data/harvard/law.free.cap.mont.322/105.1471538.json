Evert (Evert) appeals the sentence the District Court imposed upon resentencing. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">\u00b62 The issues on appeal are restated into the following single issue: Did the District Court have jurisdiction to resentence Evert?</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">\u00b63 Evert pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to the offense of sexual assault, a felony. In September of 1997, Evert was sentenced to 65 years at the Montana State Prison with 15 years suspended. He was also ordered ineligible for parole until he completed all phases of the prison\u2019s sex offender treatment program.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">\u00b64 In June of 1998, Evert filed a pro se petition for postconviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>relief which alleged numerous claims related to his guilty plea and sentencing. The Flathead County Attorney\u2019s Office (the County) responded to his petition. When the court did not hold a hearing regarding his petition, Evert filed a petition for writ of supervisory of control in April of 1999. This Court then ordered the County and the Attorney General to file a response to the petition for writ of supervisory control. The District Court subsequently ordered that a public defender be appointed to represent Evert.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">\u00b65 Although the record indicates a public defender then began to act on Evert\u2019s behalf, the record also indicates that communication between the public defender\u2019s office and Evert was lacking. Evert filed a pro se motion to supplement his petition for postconviction relief in September of 1999. After court continuances and appointment of a different public defender to assist Evert, the parties notified the court that they had reached an agreement on Evert\u2019s petition for postconviction relief. Evert\u2019s counsel then summarized the agreement for the court. In sum, in exchange for receiving a new sentence by the District Court, Evert withdrew his postconviction petition, waived his right to appeal the amended sentence, and waived his right to file any further postconviction petitions based on the new sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u00b66 Evert\u2019s counsel stated that Evert understood that because he originally pleaded guilty, he could be sentenced to life in prison, or not less than two years or more than 100 years in prison, and fined up to $50,000. Deputy County Attorney Ed Corrigan then stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">that by statute and by numerous rulings by the Supreme Court, that a district court judgment, once it has been passed, is basically set in stone. However, it\u2019s always been my practice-and also been the practice of this Court-that if a Defendant who has previously been sentenced appears before either myself or you and shows good cause as to why his sentence should be amended, generally mitigated, we don\u2019t object to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">We don\u2019t hold firm to the technicalities of the statute or the Supreme Court rulings. The thought being if a person has made some progress in his life and is doing better, and is no longer the threat that he was perhaps four or five years ago, that some consideration should be given for those efforts that he\u2019s made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">\u00b67 The progress that Evert made in prison was then discussed. Evert also testified on his own behalf. At the conclusion of the proceedings, the court, upon motion, and based upon the representations and testimony of Evert, dismissed the petition for postconviction relief. The matter was then continued to be reset upon a motion, not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>postconviction relief petition, but, as the comb stated, \u201cwhatever you\u2019re going to call it, for a hearing on the request for modification of the sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">\u00b68 In November of 2002, Evert and his counsel appeared for a hearing on Evert\u2019s request that his sentence be modified. The order setting this hearing was entitled \u201cOrder Requesting Final Determination of Post-Conviction Relief for the Defendant Raymond Earl Evert\u201d even though, as previously established, Evert\u2019s claims for postconviction relief had been dismissed. Prior to the hearing, Evert filed letters, progress reports, and information regarding his progress while incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\u00b69 At the conclusion of the hearing, the court ordered that Evert be incarcerated in the Montana State Prison for 60 years with 20 years suspended. He was to receive good time credit for the time served prior to sentencing and the time served since. In an Amended Judgment and Sentence, filed January 24,2003, the court stated it considered Evert\u2019s testimony at the hearing, the evidence presented, the nature of his offense and his criminal history, his 1997 Pre-Sentence Investigation and Sex Offender Treatment Evaluation, the apparent progress in treatment he made while at the prison, and the recommendations of counsel before it entered its sentence. In addition to the previously-mentioned sentence, the court also ordered Evert \u201cbe given credit for 228 days served in the Flathead County Detention Center pending final disposition in this matter.\u201d Evert was also to be given credit for the time he served as a prison inmate from September 4, 1997, through November 15,2002. He remained ineligible for parole until he completed the prison\u2019s sex offender treatment program with the exception that \u201c[i]f, upon completion of Phase II of that program, his treatment providers believe he can safely complete sex offender treatment and Aftercare in a community setting, this restriction [on his parole eligibility] will no longer apply.\u201d Evert\u2019s counsel was subsequently allowed to withdraw from Evert\u2019s case. Evert then attempted to proceed pro se on his petition for postconviction relief but later requested and received the assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\u00b610 On appeal, Evert claims that he \u201cwaived numerous potential claims in postconviction for the opportunity to be re-sentenced.\u201d He contends that in the new sentencing proceeding, the comb \u201cmistakenly told him that he would be eligible for parole after he served one-quarter of his sentence less good time.\u201d Evert claims that because the court incorrectly advised him regarding this eligibility, he \u201cdid not fully understand the consequences of waiving his postconviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>claims.\u201d Thus, he claims the standard of review that applies should be that for evaluating the voluntary nature of guilty pleas. He requests that because a waiver of legal rights cannot be based on a fundamental mistake, this Court should modify the sentence and judgment to grant his immediate parole eligibility to reflect Evert\u2019s understanding that good time would be applied to parole eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">\u00b611 The State claims that the authorities Evert cites do not apply in the present case because they concern \u201cinformation about sentencing given the defendants before they entered guilty pleas.\u201d The State contends that \u201c[t]he record is devoid of any suggestion that Evert would receive good time against his parole eligibility until after he had waived his postconviction petition and presented his evidence and arguments.\u201d The State claims that the record does not support the argument that Evert relied on a specific parole eligibility date before he entered his guilty plea. Instead, the State points out that Evert acknowledged several times that he could receive the maximum allowable sentence. The State also maintains that the standard of review that should be applied in this case is whether Evert\u2019s sentence (upon resentencing) was legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\u00b612 Did the District Court have jurisdiction to resentence Evert?</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">\u00b613 The issue of jurisdiction has not been raised by the parties in this case. However, it is essential a court have subject matter jurisdiction before acting. Lack of subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived. <em>Sage v. Gamble </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 459, 463, 929 P.2d 822, 824. Lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any stage of a judicial proceeding by a party or <em>sua sponte </em>by the court. <em>Sage, </em>279 Mont, at 463, 929 P.2d at 824. Therefore, we address the issue of subject matter jurisdiction <em>sua sponte. Sage, </em>279 Mont, at 463, 929 P.2d at 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">\u00b614  Jurisdiction is defined by law. <em>Vannatta v. Boulds, </em>2003 MT 343, \u00b6 16, 318 Mont. 472, \u00b6 16, 81 P.3d 480, \u00b6 16. Jurisdiction cannot be conferred by consent of the parties or the court. <em>Vannatta, </em>\u00b6 16. Once a valid sentence is imposed, the district court lacks jurisdiction to modify that sentence absent specific statutory authority. <em>Gilbert v. State, </em>2002 MT 258, \u00b6 17, 312 Mont. 189, \u00b6 17, 59 P.3d 24, \u00b6 17. Additionally, a court cannot reserve the right to change a sentence at a later time. <em>Gilbert, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">\u00b615 At the time Evert filed his petition for postconviction relief, \u00a7 46-18-117, MCA (1997), provided that a court may modify or \u201ccorrect an erroneous sentence or disposition at any time and may correct a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>sentence imposed in an illegal manner within 120 days after the sentence is imposed or after remand from an appellate court.\u201d Once a petition for postconviction relief is filed and a hearing held, a court may find in favor of the petitioner and then \u201center an appropriate order with respect to the judgment or sentence in the former proceedings and any supplementary orders as to reassignment, retrial, custody, bail, or discharge that may be necessary and proper.\u201d Section 46-21-201(6), MCA. The court may also alternatively find for the prosecution, and the petition then must be dismissed. Section 46-21-201(6), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">\u00b616 A plain reading of \u00a7 46-18-117, MCA (1997), clearly provides that a court only has jurisdiction to modify an <em>erroneous </em>or <em>illegal </em>sentence. Neither Evert nor the State alleges that Evert\u2019s original sentence was illegal or erroneous. His original sentence was for 65 years in prison with 15 years suspended. This is within the parameters provided by \u00a7 45-5-502, MCA, pursuant to which Evert was sentenced. The record reflects that rather than proceeding with a postconviction hearing on Evert\u2019s claims, Evert and the County chose to enter a stipulated agreement which would allow him to be resentenced on the original charge. The court honored this agreement and subsequently conducted the resentencing in November of 2002, approximately five years after Evert was originally sentenced in September of 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\u00b617  Jurisdiction is defined by law. <em>Vannatta, </em>\u00b6 16. Neither the State nor Evert has cited any statutory authority which authorized the District Court to exercise continuing jurisdiction to review and modify Evert\u2019s original sentence. The court entered a final judgment and, absent a showing of error or illegality of the sentence, the court lacked jurisdiction to modify this sentence. Section 46-18-117, MCA (1997). Although both the County and Evert agreed to the resentencing, jurisdiction cannot be conferred by consent. <em>Vannatta, </em>\u00b6 16. Accordingly, the judgment entered pursuant to the resentencing is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\u00b618  Once Evert filed his petition for postconviction relief, the court had jurisdiction to conduct a hearing and either decide the matter in favor of Evert (entering an appropriate order or judgment with respect to the previous proceedings) or in favor of the County (thus dismissing Evert\u2019s claims). Section 46-21-201(6), MCA. The court did neither. Instead, the court resentenced Evert approximately five years after his original sentence was pronounced. No authority has been provided nor can this Court find any which would permit this resentencing. The District Court\u2019s resentencing of Evert is reversed. Evert\u2019s original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>sentence is reinstated and the postconviction claims that he waived in exchange for resentencing are also reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">\u00b619 The laws of the State of Montana are written to ensure that justice is served and the well-being of society and individuals is safeguarded. Contrary to the County Attorney\u2019s pronouncement to the District Court that \u201cwe don\u2019t hold firm to the technicalities of the statute or the Supreme Court rulings,\u201d adherence to the legislative enactments and the decisions of this Court is not a matter of convenience or prosecutorial preference. No court or officer of the court has the prerogative of circumventing or modifying the procedures established by law. We reverse and remand for consideration of Evert\u2019s petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<judges id=\"b135-5\">JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER, REGNIER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
