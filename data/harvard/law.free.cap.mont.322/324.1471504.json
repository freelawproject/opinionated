In March of 2003, in the Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County, Gail moved to enforce a provision of the final decree as to the payment of her share of Mark\u2019s retirement benefits. Mark moved to dismiss and a flurry of responses and subsequent motions ensued. The District Court implicitly denied the motion to dismiss by granting Gail\u2019s motion to enforce. The District Court eventually denied a motion by Mark to amend. Mark appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court erred in determining that Gail did not have to personally serve Mark with the motion to enforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in not allowing Mark an enlargement of time to respond to the motion to enforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">\u00b65 3. Whether the motion to enforce was time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-13\">\u00b66 4. Whether the District Court erred in ordering Mark to pay Gail for her uncollected payments by setoff or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b349-15\">\u00b67 Gail and Mark terminated their marriage and their property was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>divided by final decree (the decree) in January of 1992. The decree provided that Mark\u2019s future Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) pension benefits, accumulated during the marriage while he worked for the U.S. Forest Service, wotdd be equally shared by Gail and Mark and that Mark would receive a fractional share of Gail\u2019s future benefits from her Montana Teacher\u2019s Retirement pension. The decree also stated that if Mark returned to federal employment and reactivated his CSRS pension, Gail\u2019s share of Mark\u2019s CSRS pension would be determined in accordance with the formula enunciated in <em>Rolfe v. Rolfe </em>(1988), 234 Mont. 294, 766 P.2d 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\u00b68 At the time the decree was issued, neither party had retired. Later, Mark did return to federal employment. Then, in January of 2002, he retired and started drawing his CSRS retirement benefits in March but did not notify Gail that he had retired, nor did he arrange for any portion of his retirement to be paid to her. Gail contacted Mark concerning the payments owed to her and he refused to make those payments claiming that he did not have to begin paying her until November 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">\u00b69 On March 17, 2003, Gail moved to enforce the provision of the decree as to payment of her share of Mark\u2019s retirement benefits. Mark\u2019s gross monthly pension benefit had been $2,722 and, according to the <em>Rolfe </em>methodology, Gail\u2019s monthly share would have been $734 a month. Total arrearage, at that time, was $8,808. Mark was served with the motion to enforce by certified mail sent to his last known address in Hawaii and his attorney of record, Paul Neal Cooley (Cooley), was also served by mail. A barrage of motions, responses, and replies then ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">\u00b610 Mark moved to dismiss the motion to enforce on April 1, 2003, asserting that he should have been personally served because it was unclear whether Cooley was still representing Mark and because the statute of limitations barred the motion to enforce. Three days later, Gail responded to Mark\u2019s personal service argument. On April 14, 2003, Mark filed a motion to enlarge time to respond to the motion to enforce. Subsequently, Gail replied first to Mark\u2019s statute of limitations argument and then to Mark\u2019s motion to enlarge time.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">\u00b611 On May 1, 2003, the District Court granted Gail\u2019s motion to enforce the 1992 judgment as to Mark\u2019s pension benefits. The District Court concluded that Cooley was clearly acting as Mark\u2019s attorney. The District Court further noted that the statute of limitations was not an issue because while \u201csome time ha[d] elapsed since 1992, ... the Decree was intended to extend to the relevant issue-retirement-which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>ha[d] recently occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">\u00b612 Mark then moved to amend or correct error because the District Court had said that aside from Cooley\u2019s representation issue and the statute of limitations issue, \u201c[t]here [was] no other basis advanced to discuss or deny [Mark\u2019s] motion [to dismiss] ....\u201d Mark asserted that this was error because \u201chis preliminary responses ask[ed] for more time to formulate a response and ... the preliminary pleadings and affidavits suggested] that additional grounds for contesting the Order [were] or might be present, after the parties conducted] further discovery.\u201d Gail responded seven days later to the motion to amend and Mark replied. On June 10,2003, the District Court denied Mark\u2019s motion to amend and ordered that judgment was to be implemented pursuant to the order to enforce final decree and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\u00b613 Under that order, Mark was required to pay Gail $734 a month. In addition, as to the accrued payments then totaling $10,276, and any future payments not made, the District Court ordered: \u201cTo the extent any... amount remains unpaid at the time [Mark] becomes entitled to share in the retirement benefits of [Gail], [Gail] is entitled to offset her obligations to [Mark] for the period and to the extent sums remain owing from [Mark].\u201d Mark appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">\u00b614 We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the law are correct. <em>State v. Stone, </em>2004 MT 151, \u00b6 14, 321 Mont. 489, \u00b6 14, 92 P.3d 1178, \u00b6 14. In addition, we review discretionary trial court rulings for an abuse of discretion. Discretionary trial court rulings include such things as trial administration issues, scope of cross-examination, post-trial motions, and similar rulings. <em>State v. Insua, </em>2004 MT 14, \u00b6 13, 319 Mont. 254, \u00b6 13, 84 P.3d 11, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">DISCUSSION ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">\u00b615 <em>Whether the District Court erred in determining that Gail did not have to personally serve Mark with the motion to enforce.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">\u00b616 Mark maintains that personal service should have been required because he did not sign for the motion to enforce when it was sent by certified mail and because eleven years had elapsed between the decree and Gail\u2019s motion to enforce. Mark further contends that service by mail was inappropriate because the attorney client relationship between Mark and Cooley was stale.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>\u00b617 Rule 5(b), M.R.Civ.P., clearly states that service can be perfected by mailing a copy to the attorney of record or to the party at the attorney\u2019s or the party\u2019s last known address, and that \u201c[sjervice by mail is complete upon mailing.\u201d Here, the motion to enforce was sent to Mark\u2019s attorney, Cooley, in Missoula, and to Mark\u2019s last known address in Hawaii, by certified mail. The fact that Mark did not sign for the motion but rather an employee of Zac\u2019s Photo and Copy Center did, who then misplaced the motion, is immaterial. Once Gail placed the motion to enforce in the mail to Mark and Cooley, service was complete. As to Mark\u2019s contention that because the decree was eleven years previous, personal service is required, there are no cases or statutes that modify service requirements based upon the last date of activity in a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\u00b618 Lastly, Mark argues that Cooley ceased to be his attorney because eleven years had passed. Mark cites no statutes or cases which indicate that the passage of time concludes an attorney client relationship and as such requires a party to be personally served. Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P. In addition, Cooley could have informed the District Court that Cooley was no longer representing Mark or could have timely asked the District Court for an enlargement of time so Cooley and Mark could determine whether Cooley would be representing Mark. Instead, Cooley responded to the motion to enforce with a motion to dismiss. We conclude, as did the District Court, that it was clear that Cooley was acting as Mark\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\u00b619  \u201c[A] party interested in resisting the relief sought by a motion has a right to notice and an opportunity to be heard.\u201d Further, \u201c[t]he requirement that timely notice be given of the making of the proposed motion is to afford opposing counsel the opportunity to be present and intelligently to oppose the motion when made.\u201d <em>Luppold v. Lewis </em>(1977), 172 Mont. 280, 294-95, 563 P.2d 538, 546 (citing <em>State v. District Court </em>(1953), 126 Mont. 382, 393, 251 P.2d 840, 846) (citations omitted). Here, the motion to enforce was not only delivered to Mark\u2019s attorney of record, Cooley, but also to Mark by certified mail at his last known address. As such, we conclude that adequate notice was given and we hold that the District Court did not err in determining that personal service was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">\u00b620 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion in not allowing Mark an enlargement of time to respond to the motion to enforce.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">\u00b621  Basing his argument on Rules 6 and 11, M.R.Civ.P., Mark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>maintains that he was <em>entitled </em>to an enlargement of time in order to reply to the motion to enforce. Parties are not entitled to enlargements of time; enlargements of time are within the District Court\u2019s discretion. <em>Insua, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">\u00b622 Under Rule 2(a) of the Uniform District Court Rules, a party has ten days to respond to a motion. The District Court can, within its discretion, enlarge that time if the request \u201cis made before the expiration of the period originally prescribed or as extended by a previous order\u201d or if \u201cupon motion made after the expiration of the specified period permit the act to be done where the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect....\u201d Rule 6(b), M.R.Civ.P. Gail filed the motion to enforce on March 17, 2003, and Mark moved for an enlargement of time on April 14,2003. Mark\u2019s request to enlarge time was not made within the required ten days and there is nothing in the record to indicate that his failure to act was the result of excusable neglect. Cooley argued in the motion to enlarge that more time was needed because Cooley and Mark had not cemented their relationship. The District Court did not find this argument persuasive and neither do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">\u00b623 We see nothing in the record to indicate that the District Court abused its discretion in not granting Mark an enlargement of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">\u00b624 <em>Whether the motion to enforce was time barred.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">\u00b625 Mark contends that Gail\u2019s motion to enforce was stale because Gail did not bring the motion to enforce until eleven years after the decree and because under \u00a7 27-2-201, MCA, actions on judgments and decrees must be brought within ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">\u00b626 While \u00a7 27-2-201, MCA, does require that an action upon a judgment or decree be brought within ten years, we have held in a similar case that the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the payment is due. <em>In re Marriage of Brown </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 184, 867 P.2d 381. In <em>Brown, </em>we held that the ten year statute of limitations commences to run as each child support payment obligation comes due. <em>Brown, </em>263 Mont. at 189, 867 P.2d at 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">\u00b627 The situation here is similar. Gail was not entitled to Mark\u2019s pension benefits until he retired in January 2002, and was able to collect them himself. Mark\u2019s argument would require that, sometime between 1992 and 2002, Gail should have moved to enforce payment of her share of Mark\u2019s pension benefits when Mark had yet to retire and was not receiving any benefits himself. This holding would reach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>the absurd conclusion that Gail should be deprived of the benefits before the benefits were due her.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">\u00b628  Accordingly, we see nothing in error regarding the District Court\u2019s findings and hold that Gail\u2019s requested relief was not time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">ISSUE FOUR</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">\u00b629 <em>Whether the District Court erred in ordering Mark to pay Gail for her uncollected payments by setoff or otherwise.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">\u00b630 The District Court ordered that Mark pay Gail $734 a month. In addition, as to the accrued payments totaling $10,276, and any future payments not made, Gail can offset her obligations to Mark when Mark becomes entitled to share in Gail\u2019s retirement benefits. Mark argues that he is exempt from this legal process under \u00a7 19-2-1004, MCA, because eleven years have passed since the decree was issued and, therefore, the decree should no longer be considered a family law order under \u00a7 19-2-907, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">\u00b631 Section 19-2-1004, MCA, reads, \u201c[e]xcept as provided in 19-2-907 and 19-2-909, the right of a person to any benefit or payment from a retirement system or plan and the money in the system or plan\u2019s pension trust fund is not: (1) subject to execution, garnishment, attachment, or any other process.\u201d Section 19-2-907(1), MCA, one of the qualifiers in the aforementioned statute states: \u201cA participant in a retirement system may have the participant\u2019s rights modified or recognized by a family law order.\u201d A family law order is defined as \u201ca judgment, decree, or order of a court ... concerning ... spousal maintenance, or marital property rights <em>that includes a transfer of all or a portion of a participant\u2019s payment rights in a retirement system to an alternate payee ...\u201d </em>Section 19-2-907(a), MCA (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"AZ7\">\u00b632  In 1991, in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 19-2-1004 and 19-2-907, MCA, Mark\u2019s future CSRS retirement benefits were properly modified by the decree. Mark cites no authority for the premise that a family law order, such as the decree in this case, is no longer a family law order after eleven year\u2019s passage of time. Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P. His premise that Gail should have requested payment for the retirement benefits during the previous ten years when Mark had yet to retire and there were no benefits to be paid, would lead, as indicated earlier, to absurd results. As such, we conclude that the District Court did not err in ordering Mark to pay Gail for her uncollected payments by setoff or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">\u00b633 We, therefore, hold that the District Corut did not abuse its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>discretion in denying Mark\u2019s motion to enlarge. Further, it did not err in not requiring personal service, in determining that the motion to enforce was not time barred, or in ordering Mark to pay Gail for her uncollected payments by setoff or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">\u00b634 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b355-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, REGNIER and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
