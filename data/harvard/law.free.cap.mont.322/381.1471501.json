We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">\u00b62 Did the District Court err when it granted summary judgment in favor of the Department, upholding its denial of Chain\u2019s application for a Montana driver\u2019s license based on his driver\u2019s license being currently suspended or revoked in another state?</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">\u00b63 Chain is a Montana resident who previously resided in Michigan. In Michigan, between 1984 and 1998, Chain was convicted: twice for operating a vehicle under the influence of liquor; twice for having an unlawful bodily alcohol content while driving; five times for driving with a suspended or revoked driver\u2019s license; and five times for refusing to be tested for intoxication. In total, the Michigan driver\u2019s licensing authorities took sixteen separate actions against Chain\u2019s driving privileges, including five suspensions, two revocations, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>nine denial/revocations. The suspensions and revocations were set to run consecutively, and because Chain repeatedly re-offended before his previous suspensions or revocations were completed, his Michigan driving privileges are either suspended or revoked until June 28,2022.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay2\">\u00b64 Chain moved to Montana in 1999 and attempted to apply for a Montana driver\u2019s license. The Department refused to accept his application because his driving privileges were revoked or suspended in Michigan. The Department claimed that, pursuant to \u00a7 61-5-105(2), MCA (1999), it was prohibited from accepting his application and subsequently issuing him a Montana driver\u2019s license during the time in which his license was revoked or suspended in another state. Chain filed a complaint in the District Court, requesting that the Department accept his application and issue him a driver\u2019s license because, pursuant to \u00a7 61-5-208(1), MCA (1999), the Department could not suspend or revoke a driver\u2019s license for more than one year. He also argued that, pursuant to \u00a7 61-5-107(4), MCA (1999), when the Department receives an individual\u2019s driving recoi\u2019d from another state, it becomes part of the individual\u2019s Montana driving record and is given the same force and effect and treated as though it were entered on the Montana record in the first place. Chain and the Department both moved for summary judgment, and the District Court granted the Department\u2019s motion. The District Court denied Chain\u2019s motion on the grounds that it was not within the Department\u2019s discretion to issue Chain a license while his driving privileges were suspended or revoked elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">\u00b65 Chain appealed the District Court\u2019s decision, and we ruled on his appeal in <em>Chain v. Montana Department of Motor Vehicles, </em>2001 MT 224, 306 Mont. 491, 36 P.3d 358. We held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">[T]he District Court did not err in refusing to order DMV to issue a license to Chain. However, we reverse the court\u2019s holding that DMV did not have the discretion to issue a license to Chain. Chain is not to be prohibited from applying for a license under \u00a7 61-5-107, MCA (1999), when read in conjunction with \u00a7 61-5-208, MCA (1999). Once more than one year has expired from the date of the suspension or revocation of his license, Chain may apply for issuance of a driver\u2019s license with DMV, like any other citizen whose license has previously been suspended or revoked. Thereafter, DMV shall have the discretionary power to issue a license, or refuse to do so, after an investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-6\"><em>Chain I, </em>\u00b6 16. In short, we determined that under the applicable statutes, the Department had to <em>accept </em>Chain\u2019s application, but could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>still <em>choose </em>to deny him a Montana driver\u2019s license after conducting its investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">\u00b66 Subsequent to the issuance of our Opinion in <em>Chain </em>I, the Montana Legislature made changes to the language of \u00a7 61-5-105(2), MCA (2001), and \u00a7 61-5-208(2)(a), MCA (2001). After the revised statutes went into effect, Chain once again applied for a Montana driver\u2019s license. Upon reviewing his Michigan driving record, the Department denied his request for a Montana driver\u2019s license, stating that it was prohibited from issuing him a Montana driver\u2019s license because of the language of \u00a7 61-5-105(2), MCA. The Department further stated that Chain would remain ineligible for a Montana driver\u2019s license so long as his license remained suspended or revoked in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u00b67 Chain brought an action against the Department in District Court, and both parties moved for summary judgment. The District Court granted summary judgment to the Department, holding that the Department was \u201cclearly prohibited by law from issuing a driver\u2019s license to Mr. Chain,\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 61-5-105, MCA (2001). From this Order, Chain appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">\u00b68 Our standard of review in appeals from summary judgment rulings is <em>de novo, </em>applying the same evaluation as the district court, based on Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P. The movant must demonstrate that no genuine issues of material fact exist, at which time the burden shifts to the non-moving party to prove that a genuine issue of material fact does exist. Should the court determine that no genuine issues of material fact exist, it then must determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions to ascertain whether the court erred. <em>Chain I, </em>\u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">\u00b69 Did the District Court err when it granted summary judgment in favor of the Department, upholding its denial of Chain\u2019s application for a Montana driver\u2019s license based on his driver\u2019s license being currently suspended or revoked in another state?</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">\u00b610 Chain argues that the 2001 amendments to the applicable statutes do not change the outcome of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Chain I, </em>and that the District Court erred when it concluded that the Department correctly denied Chain\u2019s driver\u2019s license application. Chain argues that, once more than one year has expired from the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>of the revocation of his license, he may apply for a Montana driver\u2019s license, pursuant to \u00a7 61-5-105, MCA (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-3\">\u00b611 The Department responds that, after <em>Chain I, </em>its Records and Driver Control Bureau created a new procedure for handling an application for a Montana driver\u2019s license received from a person whose license is currently suspended or revoked in another state, and that this procedure was correctly applied and followed when Chain applied for a Montana driver\u2019s license on December 21, 2001. The Department points out that its review of that application was thus governed by the 2001 MCA driver licensing statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\u00b612 Both Chain and the Department agree that the 2001 amendment to \u00a7 61-5-105(2), MCA, simply inserted language describing what evidence would suffice to determine whether an applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was suspended or revoked in another state. The Department further points to other driving statutes as evidence that, \u201cthe issuance (or renewal) of a Montana driver\u2019s law [sic] is prohibited whenever a person\u2019s license or driving privilege is currently suspended or revoked in this or any state and the period of revocation has not been completed.\u201d The Department also argues that, under \u00a7 61-5-107(4), MCA (2001), the Department has a statutory obligation to give \u201cthe same force and effect\u201d to an out-of-state driving record as though it was entered on the driver\u2019s record in Montana in the original instance. Thus, the Department argues, it was required to treat Chain\u2019s Michigan driving record as having \u201cthe same force and effect\u201d as if it was a Montana driving record. Thus, the Department concludes, giving the Michigan driving record \u201cthe same force and effect\u201d under \u00a7 61-5-107(4), MCA (2001), the Department was prohibited by law from issuing Chain a driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u00b613 The language of \u00a7 61-5-107(4), MCA (2001) is identical to the 1999 version of that statute. In <em>Chain I, </em>we specifically addressed the language of this subsection, stating, \u201cThus, once Chain\u2019s record was received here, DMV should have analyzed Chain\u2019s driving record in the same fashion as it would analyze that record had it originally been amassed and entered of record in this state.\u201d <em>Chain I, </em>\u00b6 11. Neither the language of this statutory provision nor our interpretation of it has changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\u00b614 Section 61-5-105(2), MCA gained some additional language in 2001 so that it reads,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">The department may not issue a license under this chapter to a person: ... (2) whose license or driving privilege is currently suspended or revoked in this or any state, as evidenced by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>ineligible status report from the national driver register-established under 49 U.S.C. 30302, or from the commercial driver\u2019s license information system, established under 49 U.S.C. 31309L1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">As both parties to this appeal agree, the additional language does not affect the circumstances under which the Department may or may not issue a license, but simply provides further guidance as to what materials the Department should consider in making this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\u00b615 Both parties appear to misapprehend our holding in <em>Chain I. </em>We did not state, as both Chain and the Department appear to believe, that under the 1999 statutes, the Department was obligated to accept Chain\u2019s application and then inevitably issue him a driver\u2019s license. Both parties appear to interpret \u201caccepting an application\u201d and \u201cissuing a license\u201d as synonymous. They are not. In <em>Chain I, </em>we held that, pursuant to \u00a7 61-5-208(1), MCA (1999), Chain could <em>reapply </em>for a driver\u2019s license after one year had passed from the date that his license was suspended or revoked. We did not hold, however, that the Department was then required to issue him a Montana driver\u2019s license. We held that the Department was required to conduct an \u201cinvestigation\u201d and then decide <em>whether or not to issue a license within its discretion. </em>See \u00b6 5 above.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">\u00b616  On Chain\u2019s appeal from the Department\u2019s denial of his 2001 application, the record confirms that the Department did indeed investigate whether to issue Chain a license. The Department requested his driving record from Michigan, examined that record, and engaged in a lengthy correspondence with the Michigan Driver License Appeal Division to ensure that the record was being correctly interpreted by the Montana authorities. The Department concluded that Chain\u2019s Michigan record established that his suspensions and revocations were the result of at least sixteen different actions taken by the Michigan authorities in response to his repeated violations of Michigan driving laws; and determined that Chain\u2019s driving privileges were currently suspended or revoked in Michigan through June 28, 2022. Giving those suspensions and revocations the \u201csame force and effect\u201d as if they were committed in Montana, pursuant to \u00a7 61-5-107(4), MCA, the Department then determined that Chain should not receive a Montana driver\u2019s license. The Department acted well within its discretion in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">\u00b617  Our standard of review in appeals from summary judgment rulings is <em>de novo. Chain I, </em>\u00b6 6. Since the facts underlying this appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>are not in dispute, we need only determine whether the Department is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. Thus, although we reach our decision for different underlying reasons than did the District Court, we conclude that the Department acted within its discretion when, upon investigation, it denied Chain\u2019s driver\u2019s license application. The District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Department is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-3\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">\u00b618 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"A8x\">JUSTICES WARNER, NELSON and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"A2k-\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"AUi\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\u00b619 I concur with the holding of the Court on the grounds set forth in my concurring and dissenting opinion in <em>Chain I. </em>Chain cannot apply for a license because the statutes prohibit issuance of a Montana driving license to one whose driving privileges are suspended in another state, and, further, prohibit Chain from driving in this state while his Michigan license is suspended. I join in affirming the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
