The State appeals. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">\u00b62 At about 2:30 a.m. on June 17, 2002, Jason Caughey was driving home to Great Falls, Montana, at the end of his shift at the Belt Rodeo as a reserve deputy for the Cascade County Sheriffs Office. Caughey observed a white Pontiac cross the center line of the two-lane highway in a no-passing zone. He saw the Pontiac cross the center line a total of three times at speeds of between 65 and 70 miles per hour, each time then weaving back the other way and twice crossing the fog line at the edge of the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">\u00b63 Caughey stopped the Pontiac because of the traffic violation he had witnessed-crossing the center line-and because he suspected the driver might be intoxicated. He subsequently cited the driver, Shawntaigne Loney, for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs (DUI) in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA, and failing to drive on the right side of the roadway in violation of \u00a7 61-8-321, MCA. In a justice court trial, a jury found Loney guilty of both offenses. She appealed to District Court for trial <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">\u00b64 In the District Court, Loney moved to dismiss the charges on grounds that Caughey\u2019s initial stop of her was illegal because there was insufficient objective data from which an experienced officer could infer criminal wrongdoing. After a hearing at which Caughey testified, the District Court granted Loney\u2019s motion to dismiss. The State appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">\u00b65 Did the District Court err in granting Loney\u2019s motion to dismiss based on its determination that Caughey lacked particularized suspicion to justify an investigative stop?</p>\n<p id=\"b330-13\">\u00b66 We review a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case <em>de novo; </em>that is, we review the decision to determine whether it was correct. <em>State v. Beanblossom, </em>2002 MT 351, \u00b6 9, 313 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Mont. 394, \u00b6 9, 61 P.3d 165, \u00b6 9 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">\u00b67 Pursuant to \u00a7 46-5-401, MCA, \u201ca peace officer may stop any person or vehicle that is observed in circumstances that create a particularized suspicion that the person or occupant of the vehicle has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.\u201d Montana courts use a two-part test for determining the existence of particularized suspicion sufficient to justify an investigative stop: (1) objective data from which an experienced officer can make certain inferences; and (2) a resulting suspicion that the occupant of a certain vehicle is or has been engaged in wongdoing. <em>State v. Eixenberger, </em>2004 MT 127, \u00b6 16, 321 Mont. 298, \u00b6 16, 90 P.3d 453, \u00b6 16 (citations omitted). Whether particularized suspicion exists to justify an investigative stop is a question of fact which depends on the totality of the circumstances. <em>Eixenberger, </em>\u00b6 16 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">\u00b68 In granting Loney\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of particularized suspicion, the District Court compared this case to <em>Morris v. State, </em>2001 MT 13, 304 Mont. 114, 18 P.3d 1003. In <em>Morris, </em>a city police officer initiated a traffic stop after a vehicle drifted across the eastbound lanes of traffic on a multi-lane city street and then drifted and touched the eastbound fog line once or twice. The officer subsequently arrested the driver-Morris-for DUI and, when Morris refused to submit to breath tests, his driving privileges were suspended pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA. Morris petitioned the district court to revoke the suspension of his license, and the district court found no particularized suspicion for the traffic stop and granted his petition. On appeal, we affirmed. We noted Morris was not cited for any driving offenses other than DUI and determined the prosecution had failed to establish that he was driving in a manner justifying a traffic stop. <em>Morris, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">\u00b69 <em>Morris </em>is not applicable here. As the District Court observed, Loney was cited not only for DUI, but also \u201cfor failure to drive to the right except when passing, in violation of \u00a7 61-8-321, MCA[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">\u00b610 Loney argues, however, that Caughey did not qualify as an \u201cexperienced officer\u201d for purposes of the first prong of the test for determining the existence of particularized suspicion. <em>See Eixenberger, </em>\u00b6 16. She surmises that, by referring to Caughey as \u201cReserve Deputy Jason Caughey,\u201d the District Court indicated it had considered and relied upon the testimony about Caughey\u2019s lack of experience. She also points out discrepancies between Caughey\u2019s statements in his affidavit of probable cause and his testimony at the hearing concerning how far her vehicle passed over the center line, as well as between his direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>and cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">\u00b611 Loney\u2019s arguments are without merit. The District Court did not determine that Caughey was not credible. Indeed, it related-and relied on-Caughey\u2019s testimony in its order. Moreover, referring to Caughey by his appropriate title of Reserve Deputy is a far cry from making an express determination that he was not an \u201cexperienced officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">\u00b612 The facts of the present case are controlled by our recent decision in <em>Widdicombe v. State ex rel. Lafond, </em>2004 MT 49, 320 Mont. 133, 85 P.3d 1271, notwithstanding that <em>Widdieombe </em>involved a civil petition for reinstatement of a suspended driver\u2019s license. There, the driver claimed a lack of particularized suspicion sufficient to stop him. Highway patrol officers had observed his vehicle crossing the center line of a two-lane highway. <em>Widdicombe, </em>\u00b6 5. The district court refused to reinstate the license, and we affirmed on appeal. \u201cDriving a vehicle across the yellow center line, absent one of the statutory exceptions, constitutes a traffic violation under \u00a7 61-8-321, MCA.\u201d <em>Widdicombe, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">\u00b613 Here, Caughey testified Loney crossed the center line on more than one occasion. His testimony was undisputed in that regard. Nor did Loney argue or present testimony that any of the circumstances set forth in \u00a7 61-8-321, MCA, as exceptions to the requirement that a vehicle be operated on the right half of the roadway exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">\u00b614 Finally, Loney argues the particularized suspicion \u201cstandard\u201d set forth in <em>Hulse v. State, Dept. of Justice, </em>1998 MT 108, \u00b6 39, 289 Mont. 1, \u00b6 39, 961 P.2d 75, \u00b6 39, of \u201cdriving erratically\u201d was not met here. This argument, too, fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">\u00b615 <em>la.Hulse, </em>\u00b6 39, we posited that, where an individual was \u201cdriving erratically\u201d by \u201cdriving all over the road, crossing the center fine and the fog line, weaving in and out of traffic, or braking for green lights,\u201d particularized suspicion would be established for both an initial stop and administration of field sobriety tests. Our discussion did not establish a general standard for particularized suspicion. It merely set forth an example of a situation creating particularized suspicion for both an initial stop and administration of field sobriety tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">\u00b616  Caughey observed Loney crossing the center line of the highway under circumstances which did not fit any of the \u00a7 61-8-321, MCA, exceptions to the statutory prohibition of crossing the center line. Crossing the center line is an objective standard which would have led an experienced officer to infer Loney was committing a traffic violation. Observation of a traffic offense is sufficient to establish a particularized suspicion. <em>See State v. Brander, </em>2004 MT 150, \u00b6 6, 321 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Mont. 484, \u00b6 6, 92 P.3d 1173, \u00b6 6. Under the totality of the circumstances, we conclude the District Court erred in finding Caughey lacked particularized suspicion to justify an investigative stop. Therefore, we hold the District Court erred as a matter of law in granting Loney\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">\u00b617 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b333-5\">JUSTICES REGNIER, LEAPHART, COTTER, NELSON, RICE and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
