Brewer (Brewer) appeals from the order entered by the Sixteenth Judicial District Court, Custer County, denying his petition to reinstate his driver\u2019s license. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in denying Brewer\u2019s petition to reinstate his driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">\u00b63 At approximately 12:30 a.m. on January 12, 2003, Miles City Police Officer Jeremy Tafelmeyer (Tafelmeyer) initiated a traffic stop of Brewer\u2019s vehicle because the vehicle was speeding. Based on observations made during the traffic stop, Tafelmeyer believed Brewer to be driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). Brewer performed field sobriety tests at Tafelmeyer\u2019s request, following which Tafelmeyer arrested Brewer for DUI. Tafelmeyer escorted Brewer to the Miles City Police Department where he requested Brewer to submit to a blood alcohol content test. Brewer refused to submit to the test. Consequently, Brewer\u2019s driver\u2019s license was seized and suspended pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-402(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">\u00b64 Brewer petitioned the District Court to reinstate his driver\u2019s license, asserting that Tafelmeyer did not have reasonable grounds to believe he was operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. The District Court held a hearing on the petition at which Tafelmeyer was the sole witness. The court subsequently entered its order denying Brewer\u2019s petition and Brewer appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">\u00b65 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a petition for reinstatement of a driver\u2019s license to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact were clearly erroneous and its conclusions of law correct. <em>Widdicombe v. State ex rel. Lafond, </em>2004 MT 49, \u00b6 7, 320 Mont. 133, \u00b6 7, 85 P.3d 1271, \u00b6 7. \u201cA suspension of a license is presumed to be correct, and the petitioner bears the burden of proving that the state\u2019s action was improper.\u201d <em>Widdicombe, </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">\u00b66 Did the District Court err in denying Brewer\u2019s motion to reinstate his driver\u2019s license?</p>\n<p id=\"b250-14\">\u00b67 A person driving, or in actual physical control, of a vehicle on ways of Montana open to the public is considered to have given consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>to a blood or breath test. Section 61-8-402(1), MCA. A test of a person\u2019s blood or breath to determine the presence of alcohol or drugs must be administered when a peace officer</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-4\">has reasonable grounds to believe that the person has been driving or has been in actual physical control of a vehicle upon ways of this state open to the public while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of the two and the person has been placed under arrest for a violation of 61-8-401.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Section 61-8-402(2)(a)(i), MCA. If a person is arrested for DUI and refuses to submit to such a test, the arresting officer must seize the person\u2019s driver\u2019s license and the license will be suspended administratively. Section 61-8-402(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">\u00b68 A person whose license is seized and suspended pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-402(4), MCA, may file a petition in the district court challenging the suspension. Section 61-8-403(1), MCA. In such a proceeding, the issues to be addressed by the district court are limited. In the present case, those issues are whether</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\">a peace officer had reasonable grounds to believe that the person had been driving or was in actual physical control of a vehicle upon ways of this state open to the public while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of the two and the person was placed under arrest for violation of 61-8-401</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">the person refused to submit to one or more tests designated by the officer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">Sections 61-8-403(4)(a)(i) and -403(4)(a)(iv), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">\u00b69 When interpreting only subsections (i) and (iv) of \u00a7 61-8-403(4)(a), MCA, the district court ruling on a petition to reinstate a driver\u2019s license determines: (1) whether the arresting officer had reasonable grounds to believe the petitioner had been driving or was in actual physical control of a vehicle upon a way of the state open to the public while under the influence of drugs or alcohol; (2) whether the petitioner was lawfully under arrest; and (3) whether the petitioner refused to submit to a blood or breath test. <em>Widdicombe, </em>\u00b6 8. Brewer challenged only the \"reasonable grounds\u201d question in his petition to reinstate his driver\u2019s license. We have held that the \u201creasonable grounds\u201d requirement is the equivalent of a \u201cparticularized suspicion\u201d to make an investigative stop as provided in \u00a7 46-5-401, MCA. <em>Anderson v. State Dept. of Justice </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 259, 263, 912 P.2d 212, 214. Furthermore, whether a particularized suspicion exists generally is a question of fact determined by examining the totality of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>the circumstances. <em>Anderson, </em>275 Mont. at 263, 912 P.2d at 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">\u00b610 At the hearing on Brewer\u2019s petition, Tafelmeyer testified that he initiated a traffic stop of Brewer\u2019s vehicle because the vehicle was speeding. Tafelmeyer approached the vehicle and asked Brewer to produce his driver\u2019s license. Brewer searched for the license, but discovered he did not have it with him. He also could not produce current proof of insurance and, when asked for his vehicle registration papers, he produced the registration for a different vehicle. Tafelmeyer then asked him for his date of birth, address, telephone number and social security number. Brewer provided the information without difficulty. During this exchange, Tafelmeyer detected the odor of alcoholic beverage on Brewer\u2019s breath. Tafelmeyer asked Brewer whether he had been drinking and Brewer responded that he had consumed \u201ca couple.\u201d Brewer\u2019s attitude throughout the entire exchange was argumentative and uncooperative. Tafelmeyer testified that he then requested that Brewer exit the vehicle and perform various field sobriety tests. Based on the field sobriety tests and his earlier observations, Tafelmeyer arrested Brewer for DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">\u00b611 Following the hearing on Brewer\u2019s petition, the District Court found that Tafelmeyer\u2019s testimony established he had reasonable cause to believe Brewer was driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol prior to requesting the performance of field sobriety tests. Based on this finding, the court concluded Brewer was not entitled to reinstatement of his driver\u2019s license and denied the petition. Brewer contends that the District Court\u2019s finding that reasonable cause existed is clearly erroneous and its conclusion that he was not entitled to reinstatement of his driver\u2019s license, based on that erroneous finding, is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\u00b612 Brewer concedes Tafelmeyer had a particularized suspicion justifying the initial traffic stop based on the speeding violation. He argues, however, that the totality of the circumstances occurring after the stop does not support a finding of reasonable cause to believe he was DUI because the only indication that he might have been intoxicated was that Tafelmeyer detected an odor of alcoholic beverage in his breath. Brewer contends that this case is analogous to <em>Bramble v. State, Dept. of Justice, MVD, </em>1999 MT 132, 294 Mont. 501, 982 P.2d 464, where we concluded that particularized suspicion did not exist for either the administration of the field sobriety tests or the request for a breath test. He ruges us to reach the same conclusion here, but <em>Bramble </em>is readily distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">\u00b613 There, the arresting officer stopped Bramble\u2019s vehicle for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>speeding. Prior to the stop, the officer had received an anonymous citizen\u2019s report that Bramble may have been DUI. <em>Bramble, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6-7. The officer approached the vehicle and asked Bramble whether he had been drinking; Bramble replied that he had not. The officer did not observe any signs of intoxication in Bramble such as bloodshot or glassy eyes, odor of alcohol, slurred speech, lack of coordination or inability to understand instructions. Notwithstanding the absence of such indicators, the officer requested Bramble to perform field sobriety tests. <em>Bramble, </em>\u00b6 8. Based on the field sobriety tests, the officer arrested Bramble for DUI. Bramble refused to take a preliminary breath test at the scene of the arrest and again refused to take a breath test at the police station. <em>Bramble, </em>\u00b6 13. As a result, Bramble\u2019s driver\u2019s license was seized and suspended. <em>Bramble, </em>\u00b6 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">\u00b614 Bramble petitioned the district court to reinstate his driver\u2019s license and the court denied the petition. Bramble appealed to this Court. <em>Bramble, </em>\u00b6 1. We concluded that the arresting officer did not have a particularized suspicion that Bramble was DUI because, other than his speeding and the anonymous citizen\u2019s report, no aspects of his driving, behavior or physical symptoms indicated he was under the influence of alcohol. <em>Bramble, </em>\u00b6 24. Consequently, we held that the district court erred in denying his motion to reinstate his driver\u2019s license. <em>Bramble, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 29-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\u00b615 In the present case, Tafelmeyer detected the odor of alcoholic beverage on Brewer\u2019s breath, Brewer stated he had been drinking, he could not produce the proper vehicle documentation and his attitude during the traffic stop was argumentative and uncooperative. Unlike the officer in <em>Bramble, </em>and contrary to Brewer\u2019s assertion that the only evidence of intoxication was the odor of alcoholic beverage, Tafelmeyer observed several indications that Brewer may have been under the influence of alcohol. As a result, <em>Bramble </em>is not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\u00b616 Brewer also cites several cases from other jurisdictions in support of his argument that the odor of alcoholic beverage, in and of itself, is insufficient to establish reasonable cause to believe a driver is DUI. As discussed above, Tafelmeyer observed several indications of Brewer being under the influence of alcohol in addition to the odor of alcoholic beverage. Consequently, the premise underlying Brewer\u2019s argument fails and the cited cases are inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">\u00b617  We conclude Brewer has failed to establish that the District Court\u2019s finding that Tafelmeyer had reasonable grounds to believe, prior to requesting Brewer to perform field sobriety tests, that Brewer was driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>clearly erroneous. As a result, we further conclude that the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Brewer was not entitled to reinstatement of his driver\u2019s license, based on that finding, is correct. We hold, therefore, that the District Court did not err in denying Brewer\u2019s petition to reinstate his driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">\u00b618 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b254-5\">JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
