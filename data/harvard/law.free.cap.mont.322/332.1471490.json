Did the District Court, the BOLA, and the hearing officer err in not resolving the inconsistent positions taken by Fallon County in disciplining Wiman?</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">\u00b64 2. Did Wiman adequately preserve her argument regarding exclusion of evidence for her present appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">\u00b65 3. Did the hearing officer correctly determine that the evidence was irrelevant?</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">\u00b66 4. Should Fallon County\u2019s September 10, 2003 response brief be stricken as being untimely?</p>\n<p id=\"b357-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b357-14\">\u00b67 Wiman was employed by Fallon County as a dispatcher. On December 25, 2002, she allowed an unauthorized person into the jail cell of a convicted felon. This person was to provide the felon with a haircut, so this person carried with her several items, including scissors. Fallon County classifies scissors as a weapon, a fact of which Wiman admitted she was aware.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-15\">\u00b68 Wiman did not have permission to allow any person who was not classified as \u201cauthorized,\u201d into the jail. In allowing this person to enter the jail cell, Wiman violated Fallon County\u2019s security policy. This policy stated that the dispatchers were not to allow any person into the jail unless that person was on the authorized list. Fallon County believed that adherence to this security policy would provide for \u201cnot only the security of the dispatch operation, but [also] for the protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>of those who make it work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u00b69 After investigation of the incident, Wiman was suspended without pay for 60 days for deliberately violating Fallon County\u2019s security policy. Wiman sought unemployment insurance benefits during this time, hut she was denied them. On March 31, 2003, the Unemployment Insurance Division for the State of Montana found that Wiman was ineligible for such benefits because her actions constituted misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u00b610 On May 1, 2003, a claims adjudicator then revised the Unemployment Insurance Division\u2019s earlier decision, stating that due to the delay in investigating the December 25, 2002 haircut incident, the incident did not qualify as misconduct. Fallon County then appealed the May 1, 2003 decision, and a contested case proceeding was held via telephone conference before a hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u00b611 On June 6, 2003, the hearing officer reversed the claims adjudicator\u2019s redetermination and reinstated the Unemployment Insurance Division\u2019s initial decision not to provide Wiman with unemployment insurance benefits. Wiman appealed the hearing officer\u2019s decision to the BOLA. On July 10,2003, the BOLA upheld the hearing officer\u2019s decision. Wiman again appealed, this time to the Sixteenth Judicial District Court. On September 27,2003, the District Court upheld the BOLA\u2019s decision, finding that it was supported by evidence, as required under \u00a7 39-51-2410(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">\u00b612 Wiman now appeals the District Court\u2019s decision. Additional facts will be discussed as they become applicable in the following analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">\u00b613 We review a Board of Labor Appeals decision to determine if the findings of fact are supported by evidence. Section 39-51-2410(5), MCA. \u201cSupported by evidence\u201d is defined as \u201csomething more than a scintilla of evidence but may be less than a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Potter v. Dept. of Labor and Industry </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 476, 479, 853 P.2d 1207, 1209 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">\u00b614 I. Did the District Court, the BOLA, and the hearing officer err in not resolving the inconsistent positions taken by Fallon County in disciplining Wiman?</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">\u00b615 Wiman argues that because Fallon County stated that her suspension arose solely from the December 25,2002 haircut incident, but later referenced another incident where she had provided items to inmates, such an \u201cinconsistent position\u201d for disciplining her is \u201csuspect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>on its face\u201d and was \u201cnot even acknowledged, let alone resolved as part of the administrative proceedings before ... [the BOLA].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\u00b616 Fallon County notes that Wiman \u201cadmitted bringing an unauthorized person into the Fallon County Jail.\u201d As such, Fallon County argues that there was no need for the hearing officer or the BOLA to \u201clook any further into the incident,\u201d as Wiman\u2019s admission resolved the issue. Any other asserted conduct would have had no effect on the hearing officer\u2019s or the BOLA\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\u00b617 The BOLA argues that \u201cthe record establishes Wiman violated a known and reasonable employer policy,\u201d given that she: (1) \u201cdoes not dispute that Fallon County has a reasonable policy of not allowing unauthorized persons in the jail facility without... prior consent;\u201d and (2) \u201cdoes not dispute knowing that a violation of this policy could result in termination.\u201d In addition, the BOLA argues that \u201c[s]ince the employer [Fallon County] met its burden of showing [that] Wiman had been discharged for misconduct, [the] BOLA correctly concluded Wiman was disqualified from receiving UI [unemployment insurance] benefits.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\u00b618 Under \u00a7 39-51-2303(1), MCA, \u201c[a]n individual must be disqualified for [unemployment insurance] benefits after being discharged: (1) for misconduct connected with the individual\u2019s work....\u201d Misconduct includes a \u201cwillful or wanton disregard of the rights, title, and interests of a fellow employee or the employer;\u201d or \u201cdeliberate violations or disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has the right to expect of an employee.\u201d Rule 24.11.460(a)-(b), ARM. Under the Administrative Rules of Montana, the following act \u201csignifies] a willful and wanton disregard of the rights, title, and interests of the employer or a fellow employee,\u201d such as \u201cinsubordination showing a deliberate, willful or purposeful refusal to follow the reasonable directions or instructions of the employer.\u201d Rule 24.11.461(a), ARM.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">\u00b619 Here, Fallon County had instituted a security policy, whereby the dispatchers at the jail had a list of those persons who were authorized to enter the dispatch center. This policy was instituted not only for the \u201csecurity of the dispatch operation, but for the protection of those who make it work.\u201d Fallon County officials considered any violation of the security policy to be a \u201cserious misconduct violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">\u00b620 Wiman testified that: (1) she was aware of the security policy; (2) she had signed the security policy; (3) she knew that neither barbers nor beauticians were classified as admitted personnel; (4) she arranged the haircut for the inmate; (5) she knew that scissors were classified as weapons; and (6) she did not supervise the haircut completely.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">\u00b621  Review of the record shows that Fallon County did not take an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>\u201cinconsistent position\u201d with regard to Wiman\u2019s discipline. Rather, the documents in question both reference the December 25, 2002 haircut incident. It was this incident that instigated the suspension, given the fact that Wiman admittedly disregarded the security policy, and had twice before done so. Therefore, we hold that the District Court\u2019s, the BOLA\u2019s, and the hearing officer\u2019s decision was supported by evidence, taking into account both Fallon Comity\u2019s and Wiman\u2019s position concerning unemployment insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">\u00b622 2. Did Wiman adequately preserve her argument regarding exclusion of evidence for her present appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u00b623 Wiman argues that the healing officer could not weigh evidence concerning other employee\u2019s actions in allowing people to bring items into the jail, because the hearing officer \u201csummarily denied its admissibility in the first instance.\u201d As such, Wiman argues that \u201cthe hearing examiner and the Board of Labor Appeals erred as a matter of law in preventing and excluding certain evidence which was relevant to the issue of misconduct and whether or not Appellant [Wiman] was subjected to disparate treatment at the hands of her employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\u00b624 Fallon County argues that Wiman never presented to the BOLA the evidentiary issues she now raises here. As such, Fallon County argues that Wiman\u2019s arguments are waived from consideration by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">\u00b625 The BOLA argues that evidence targeting \u201c(1) the mental state of the inmate, (2) an incident involving another employee\u2019s misconduct, and (3) statements Wiman provided regarding her employer\u2019s investigation\u201d were properly excluded given the broad discretion afforded to BOLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">\u00b626 Review of the record shows that Wiman did, in fact, raise the evidentiary argument that she advances here. Indeed, Fallon County objected to her attempts to admit into evidence incidents of other employees bringing items to other inmates. These objections were sustained by the hearing officer. While it remains true that the BOLA never addressed Wiman\u2019s evidentiary arguments in its decision, the record clearly shows that Wiman adequately preserved her right to appeal those arguments here. Hence, we address her arguments in Issue 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">\u00b627 3. Did the hearing officer correctly determine that the evidence was irrelevant?</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">\u00b628 Wiman argues that the hearing officer and the BOLA, in effect, \u201cdeprived\u201d her the \u201cright to present evidence which goes to the very heart of misconduct as defined in 24.11.460, ARM....\u201d Wiman points out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>that she \u201cattempted to introduce evidence indicating that the investigation was not complete and that her transcribed statement had portions omitted,\u201d but that the hearing officer \u201crefused to allow any evidence relating to same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\">\u00b629 Fallon County argues that \u201cit was not necessary for either the hearings officer or the BOLA to consider evidence not directly related\u201d to Wiman\u2019s admitted conduct. Hence, \u201c[o]ther parties\u2019 conduct\u201d and \u201c[e]vidence regarding disparate treatment\u201d were not relevant to Wiman\u2019s application for benefits. In addition, Fallon County argues that \u201cWiman has not shown that she was prejudiced,\u201d as \u201c[s]he was allowed to present all evidence on the issue of whether her actions amounted to misconduct,\u201d during the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">\u00b630 The BOLA argues that Wiman\u2019s objection to the testimony that was not admitted in the District Court regarding the inmate\u2019s mental state \u201cwould not change Wiman\u2019s violation.\u201d Assuming the inmate\u2019s mental state was relevant and was admitted, the BOLA argues that \u201cadmission of such evidence would essentially work against Wiman,\u201d as \u201cWiman would be in a position of arguing she chose to allow an unauthorized person (with a pair of scissors) into an inmate\u2019s jail cell-knowing the inmate was unstable and depressed.\u201d In addition, the BOLA argues that Wiman\u2019s contention regarding admission of statements targeting Fallon County\u2019s investigation \u201cmust fail,\u201d because \u201cWiman did not provide these statements to the parties or the hearings officer prior to the hearing, and further, she was able to testify during the administrative proceeding and could fiilly explain the events that led to her discharge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\u00b631 The testimony pertinent to our analysis includes the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6N\">SAVAGE [Wiman\u2019s attorney]: Ok. Did you review the investigative report which was sent to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">WIMAN: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">SAVAGE: Did that include a transcribed statement which you gave the investigator?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-8\">WIMAN: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-9\">SAVAGE: Were they complete?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-10\">WIMAN: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-11\">SAVAGE: What portions of your statement that you gave to the investigator were omitted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-12\">BATTERMAN [Fallon County Attorney]: Objection. Irrelevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT-\">SAVAGE: I\u2019d like to just respond to that. They have, they have in defense of themselves indicated that they needed this extra time to conduct a full investigation. That was part of the reason for the delay. I certainly seem to think that we can question the validity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>of the investigation and question whether it was a full investigation and a complete investigation as they\u2019ve represented to the department of labor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-4\">HARPER: Mr. Savage I\u2019m gonna, I\u2019m going to sustain the objection. You\u2019re addressing a report that I have not seen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">SAVAGE: Ok. In document number 44 there is a partial transcript of the interview of Georgia Williams [an inmate] wherein she indicates she was on anti-depressants when she first came in and they stopped filling her prescription. Do you know why [asking Wiman] Fallon County stopped filling her prescription?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">BATTERMAN: Objection. Irrelevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">HARPER [hearing officer]: This is all (inaudible), Mr., excuse me, sustained, Mr. Savage. Hello?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-8\">SAVAGE: Yea. I\u2019m just, I\u2019m just going through my questions here. Did you, did you ever complain to anybody from Fallon County about the conditions of the jail or the conditions of Georgia Williams?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-9\">WIMAN: Yes. I discussed it on June 1st, November 1st, and November 29th of 2002 with William Duffield. He was a commissioner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-10\">SAVAGE: What was the substance of the conversation that you had with Mr. Duffield?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-11\">WIMAN: He said he would look into it. He never got back to me. SAVAGE: You also indicate in document number 34 that you let other employees know of your concern for Georgia Williams\u2019 mental status?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-12\">WIMAN: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-13\">SAVAGE: Can you tell me who they were and when you did that and what their response was, just generally?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-14\">WIMAN: I made aware all the dispatchers and the law enforcement personnel that stopped in dispatch and they all acted like it wasn\u2019t their problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-15\">SAVAGE: Ok. In document number 45 there\u2019s a reference to a birthday cake incident involving Barb [another employee]. Do you see that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-16\">WIMAN: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-17\">SAVAGE: Who\u2019s Barb?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-18\">WIMAN: Barb Calder. She\u2019s a dispatcher, detention officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Apo\">SAVAGE: What was that all about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-19\">BATTERMAN: Objection. Irrelevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>SAVAGE: I don\u2019t think it is. It\u2019s part of the record and it\u2019s, it\u2019s part of how Kay Wiman was treated in relationship to other people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-4\">HARPER: Mr. Savage, I\u2019m going to sustain the objection because I don\u2019t believe anybody has ever accused Miss Wiman of providing a birthday cake to the inmate in question, have they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">SAVAGE: No. It\u2019s, it\u2019s a similar incident, where, you know, she\u2019s accused as part of the disciplinary proceeding here without pay, that she [Wiman] supplied food stuffs on another occasion to Georgia Williams.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">HARPER: No one has said that she [Wiman] provided a birthday cake that I\u2019m aware of. So please go forward.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">\u00b632 Relevant evidence is evidence having \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Rule 401, M.R.Evid. Generally, all relevant evidence is admissible. Rule 402, M.R.Evid. However, a court may exclude relevant evidence when the probative value of that evidence is \u201csubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d Rule 403, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">\u00b633  Here, Wiman admitted that she allowed an unauthorized person into the jail cell of an inmate. Hence, the fact of consequence before the hearing officer was the denial of unemployment insurance benefits to Wiman during the time she was suspended for allowing an unauthorized person into the jail cell of an inmate. Testimony regarding (1) an inmate\u2019s mental state, (2) whether Wiman or another employee provided items to inmates previously, and (3) whether Wiman\u2019s breach of Fallon County\u2019s security policy was adequately investigated do not tend to make the existence of this fact of consequence more probable or less probable. Therefore, we hold that the hearing officer did not err in determining that the above-quoted testimony was irrevelant.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">\u00b634 4. Should Fallon County\u2019s September 10, 2003 response brief be stricken as being untimely?</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">\u00b635 Wiman argues that \u201cFallon County\u2019s response of September 10, 2003 was in effect <em>\u2018a </em>second bite at the apple\u2019 which violated the District Court\u2019s own memorandum and scheduling order of August 11, 2003, allowing ... Fallon County to have one response to the Petition for Judicial Review....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">\u00b636 Fallon County argues that, according to the District Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Scheduling Order, it had \u201cten (10) business days following Petitioner\u2019s [Wiman] filing within which to file its response brief.\u201d Wiman filed her Brief in Support of Petition on August 27, 2003, after which Fallon County filed its response brief on September 10, 2003-nine business days later. As such, Fallon County argues that filing of its response brief was timely, \u201cas ordered by the district cotut.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">\u00b637 The BOLA notes that \u201c[a] district court has broad discretion to determine whether evidence is relevant and admissible....\u201d Given this discretion, the BOLA argues that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in considering Fallon County\u2019s response brief because it does not contain any new evidence, and rather contains \u201cmerely\u201d an additional argument. Further, the BOLA argues that Wiman \u201chas failed to establish that she has been harmed in anyway\u201d by admission of the brief at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">\u00b638 Here, the District Court\u2019s Scheduling Order, issued on August 11, 2003, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">2. Petitioner shall file her brief in support of Petition, together with specific citation to the pertinent parts of the record, within 10 days following the filing and certification of the administrative record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-7\">3. Respondent Fallon County shall have 10 business days following the Petitioner\u2019s filing within which to file its responsive brief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-8\">4. Finally, the Petitioner shall have five 5 business days following Fallon County\u2019s filing within which to file its Reply Brief. Whereupon the matter will be deemed submitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">\u00b639 The record reflects that Wiman filed her Brief in Support of Petition on August 27, 2003. Fallon County filed its response brief on September 10,2003, nine business days after Wiman\u2019s brief was filed. Hence, Fallon County acted in accordance with the District Court\u2019s Scheduling Order. We see no reason why-given Fallon County\u2019s obvious adherence to the District Court\u2019s Scheduling Order-Fallon County\u2019s response brief should be stricken as untimely, and we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">\u00b640 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b364-11\">JUSTICES WARNER, RICE, COTTER and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
