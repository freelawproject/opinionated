Smith (Smith) appeals from the order entered by the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, denying his motion to dismiss. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-16\">\u00b62 The following issue is presented on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b231-17\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in denying Smith\u2019s motion to dismiss Count I of the second amended Information on grounds that: (a) the prosecutor erroneously charged him with the offense of assault with a weapon, pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-213, MCA, rather than the offense of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>privacy in communications through intimidation over the telephone, pursuant to \u00a7 45-8-213, MCA; and (b) the affidavit supporting the charge of assault with a weapon pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-213, MCA, failed to state the required elements to establish the offense of assault with a weapon?</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">\u00b64 On July 12, 2001, the Yellowstone County Attorney filed an Information charging Smith with two counts of felony assault with a weapon, pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-213, MCA. Count I charged Smith with causing Tami Smith (Tami), his wife, reasonable apprehension to believe Smith would inflict serious bodily injury on Mac Hernandez (Hernandez), Tami\u2019s boyfriend. Count II charged Smith with causing Hernandez reasonable apprehension to believe Smith would inflict serious bodily injury on Hernandez.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\u00b65 The affidavit in support of the Information alleged that on or about July 9,2001, Smith and Tami were estranged husband and wife, and that Tami had begun a relationship with Mac Hernandez, a security officer for Saint Vincent\u2019s Hospital. During a telephone conversation, Smith told Tami he was going to kill Hernandez with a gun. He then made a metallic clicking noise over the telephone. Smith asked, \u201cDo you know what this is?\u201d He told her it was the sound of a gun cocking and that he was going to go kill Hernandez. Smith then hung up. Tami immediately notified Hernandez to warn him. Shortly thereafter, Smith called Hernandez twice on Hernandez\u2019s cell phone while Hernandez was at work. In the first call, Smith said he was on his way to kill Hernandez. In the second call, Smith told Hernandez he was in the hospital where Hernandez worked looking for him to kill him. When Hernandez asked Smith to identify his location, he responded, \u201cNo, I think we will make this interesting.\u201d Hernandez put on a bulletproof vest and immediately contacted the police who later arrested Smith in front of his home. At the time of arrest, police recovered three firearms from Smith\u2019s living room. Later, one of Smith\u2019s friends gave police two bullets upon one of which Smith had allegedly written the name \u201cMac\u201d and upon the other a \u201c?\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">\u00b66 The affidavit in support of the Information stated that Smith used the cocking of the gun, or that sound, with Tami, but not with Hernandez, and further indicated that \u201cMac Hernandez believed that the defendant was on his way to the hospital to shoot him that evening,\u201d and that \u201cTami Smith believed that the defendant would carry out his threat to go to the hospital and shoot Mr. Hernandez.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>\u00b67 On September 25, 2001, Smith filed a motion to dismiss the Information and memorandum in support which asserted: (1) the Information failed to set forth a prima facie allegation of assault with a weapon in violation of \u00a7 45-5-213, MCA; (2) since assault with a weapon could not be committed over the telephone, the proper violation with which Smith should have been charged was violation of privacy in communications through intimidation over the telephone, in violation of \u00a7 45-8-213(l)(a), MCA; and (3) the alleged victim was required by \u00a7 45-5-213, MCA, to \u201csee\u201d the weapon or \u201creasonably believe that there is a weapon being utilized by the perpetrator to cause \u2018reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury,\u2019 \u201d which, Smith asserts, Hernandez, as the intended victim, did not do. In response, the State argued that the victim of an assault with a weapon need not actually \u201csee\u201d the weapon for sufficient evidence to exist of reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury with a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">\u00b68 On October 24, 2001, the State filed a second amended affidavit which set forth the same facts, but more precisely delineated the alleged victims involved. The State also requested leave to file a second amended Information. On the same day, after hearing oral argument, the District Court denied Smith\u2019s motion to dismiss on the following grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">What we have here is purposely or knowingly caused reasonable apprehension. The apprehension has to do with apprehension of serious bodily injury, in another. I think that means in someone other than the defendant, and it has to include use of a weapon.... [T]his statute is primarily to-it\u2019s designed to punish, to criminalize, the use or threatened use of a weapon, and that\u2019s what occurred here. Bottom line is, he threatened to kill and he threatened to kill with a gun. And I think that\u2019s the main intent of this statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">\u00b69 On November 1, 2001, the State filed a second amended Information, and Smith pled not guilty to both counts of assault with a weapon, subject to the reservation of his objections previously made. \u00b610 On April 5, 2002, Smith entered into a plea agreement that required him to plead guilty to Count I of the amended Information which alleged that Smith caused reasonable apprehension in Tami that Smith would kill Hernandez with a weapon. In exchange for Smith\u2019s plea of guilty to Count I, the State agreed: (1) to dismiss with prejudice Count II of the second amended Information which alleged that Smith caused reasonable apprehension in Hernandez that Smith would kill Hernandez with a weapon; and (2) to recommend a deferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>sentence of two years, providing that Smith follow specified probation conditions. Smith reserved the right to appeal to this Court on issues related to the appropriateness of the charges brought in the second amended Information.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">\u00b611 On June 11, 2002, the District Court entered an order deferring imposition of sentence for a period of two years and placed Smith on probation. Smith appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">\u00b612 A district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss criminal charges is a matter of law which we review <em>de novo, </em>determining only whether the court correctly interpreted the law. <em>State ex rel. Booth v. Montana Twenty-First Judicial Dist., </em>1998 MT 344, \u00b6 10, 292 Mont. 371, \u00b6 10, 972 P.2d 325, \u00b6 10 (citing <em>State v. Bowles </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 490, 492, 947 P.2d 52, 53).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">\u00b613 <em>Did the District Court err in denying Smith\u2019s motion to dismiss the Information on grounds that the prosecutor erroneously charged him with the offense of assault with a weapon rather than the offense of privacy in communications through intimidation over the telephone?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">\u00b614 Smith recounts the facts alleged in the affidavit in support of the second amended Information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-10\">[T]he ex-wife was talking on the telephone with the defendant when he became angry and stated he was going to kill the boyfriend.... [T]he defendant made a metallic clicking sound over the telephone and then asked, \u201cDo you know what this is?\u201d He continued to tell her it was the sound of a gun cocking and that he was going to kill Mr. Hernandez. The [sic] then hung up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">\u00b615 Smith asserts that, based upon these facts, the District Court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the Information on grounds the prosecutor erroneously charged him with what Smith terms the \u201cgeneralized\u201d offense of assault with a weapon, pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-213, MCA, rather than the \u201cspecific\u201d violation of privacy in communications through intimidation over the telephone, pursuant to \u00a7 45-8-213(l)(a), MCA. Smith argues that the essence of the difference between these two statutes is that the privacy in communications statute is a \u201cspecific,\u201d or \u201cparticularized,\u201d version of the \u201cgeneral\u201d assault with a weapon statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">\u00b616 Section 45-5-213, MCA, assault with a weapon, states:</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>45-5-213. Assault with a weapon. (1) A person commits the offense of assault with a weapon if the person purposely or knowingly causes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-4\">(a) bodily injury to another with a weapon; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-5\">(b) reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury in another by use of a weapon or what reasonably appears to be a weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">(2) ... [A] person convicted of assault with a weapon shall be imprisoned in the state prison for a term not to exceed 20 years or be fined not more than $50,000, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Section 45-8-213, MCA, privacy in communications, states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\">45-8-213. Privacy in communications. (1) ... [A] person commits the offense of violating privacy in communications if the person knowingly or purposely:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-9\">(a) with the purpose to terrify, intimidate, threaten, harass, annoy, or offend, communicates with a person by electronic communication and uses obscene, lewd, or profane language, suggests a lewd or lascivious act, or threatens to inflict injury or physical harm to the person or property of the person. The use of obscene, lewd, or profane language or the making of a threat or lewd or lascivious suggestions is prima facie evidence of an intent to terrify, intimidate, threaten, harass, annoy, or offend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-10\">(3) (a) A person convicted of the offense of violating privacy in communications shall be fined not to exceed $500 or imprisoned in the county jail for a term not to exceed 6 months, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">\u00b617 Smith cites <em>State v. Feight, </em>2001 MT 205, 306 Mont. 312, 33 P.3d 623, in support of his contention that the \u201cspecific controls over the general.\u201d In <em>Feight, </em>where a \u201cgeneral-specific\u201d relationship existed among several statutes, the specific statutes controlled over the general. In <em>Feight, </em>this Court affirmed a district court\u2019s dismissal of an appeal from justice court of a denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw a guilty plea. <em>Feight, </em>\u00b6 24. The defendant argued that under \u00a7 46-20-104, MCA, the \u201cgeneralized\u201d scope-of-appeal statute, he should have been entitled to appeal any final judgment or order, except as otherwise provided by law. We concluded in that case, however, that \u00a7 46-20-104, MCA, was inapposite because \u00a7\u00a7 3-5-303, 46-17-203, 46-17-311, and 46-12-204, MCA, were the \u201cspecific\u201d code sections which provided for and defined the parameters of the jurisdiction of a district court to entertain appeals from justice court in the first instance. <em>Feight, </em>\u00b6 20. This Court stated the well-settled rule of statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>construction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-4\">[I]t is a well-settled rule of statutory construction that the specific prevails over the general. A particular statutory intent controls over a general one which is inconsistent with it. Section 1-2-102, MCA. Further, when two statutes deal with a subject, one in general and comprehensive terms, and the other in minute and more definite terms, the more definite statute will prevail to the extent of any opposition between them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-5\"><em>Feight, </em>\u00b6 21. Thus, the specific rather than the general criminal statutes were applicable in <em>Feight.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\u00b618 Smith asserts that the same \u201cgeneral-specific\u201d relationship at issue among the statutes under review in <em>Feight </em>exists between the two statutes under review here. However, the two statutes in this case distinctly punish different criminal conduct, one requiring use of a weapon, and one not. We conclude that nothing in the plain language of these two statutes indicates that either was meant to be a \u201cgeneralized\u201d or \u201cparticularized\u201d version of the other. Thus, Smith\u2019s argument that the prosecutor was obligated to charge him with a violation of privacy in communications as a \u201cspecific\u201d offense rather than a violation of assault with a weapon as the \u201cgeneral\u201d offense is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\u00b619  Further, a county attorney has broad discretion in determining when to prosecute a case and what crime will be charged. In Montana, \u201c[i]t is not only incumbent upon the county attorney to determine when or when not to prosecute a case, but when the facts of a case support a possible charge of more than one crime, the crime to be charged is a matter of prosecutorial discretion.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Fletcher v. District Court </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 410, 415, 859 P.2d 992, 995 (citing <em>State v. Booke </em>(1978), 178 Mont. 225, 230, 583 P.2d 405, 408). We therefore conclude that the prosecutor acted within his broad, discretionary powers in charging Smith with assault with a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">\u00b620 <em>Did the District Court err in denying Smith\u2019s motion to dismiss the Information on grounds that the affidavit supporting the charge of assault with a weapon failed to state the required elements to establish the offense of assault with a weapon?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">\u00b621 Smith further asserts that the District Court erred in denying Smith\u2019s motion to dismiss the Information on grounds that the affidavit supporting the charge of assault with a weapon pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-213, MCA, failed to state the required elements to establish the offense of assault with a weapon. Smith argues that the assault with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>a weapon statute requires the victim (1) to \u201csee\u201d the weapon, or (2) to reasonably believe that there is a weapon being utilized by the perpetrator in order to cause the requisite \u201creasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury.\u201d Smith argues that since his telephone threat did neither, it did not meet the statute\u2019s \u201cuse of a weapon\u201d language.</p>\n<p id=\"AKE\">\u00b622 First, we address Smith\u2019s contention that a victim must \u201csee\u201d the weapon as an element of assault with a weapon. This Court has not decided any cases interpreting \u00a7 45-5-213, MCA, since it was enacted as part of the general revision to the assault statutes in 1999, but the language of \u00a7 45-5-213, MCA (1999), is nearly identical to \u00a7 45-5-202, MCA (1997), the prior \u201cfelony assault\u201d offense,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which we have interpreted. As the State correctly notes, the 1999 revisions in the statute did not affect our holdings in <em>State v. Misner </em>(1988), 234 Mont. 215, 763 P.2d 23, and <em>State v. Hagberg </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 33, 920 P.2d 86, wherein we concluded that it was not necessary for the victim of an assault with a weapon to actually \u201csee\u201d the weapon for there to be sufficient evidence of reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury with a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">\u00b623 In <em>Misner, </em>the defendant and a welfare eligibility technician had confrontations over the defendant\u2019s welfare claims on several occasions. <em>Misner, </em>234 Mont. at 217, 763 P.2d at 24. After one such meeting, the welfare office secretary observed the defendant take a rifle from his truck and begin yelling and shaking the gun in the direction of the welfare office. <em>Misner, </em>234 Mont, at 218, 763 P.2d at 24. The secretary who observed this act immediately screamed, \u201cOh, my God, he\u2019s got a gun.\u201d <em>Misner, </em>234 Mont. at 218, 763 P.2d at 24. The welfare technician, to whom the defendant\u2019s actions were directed, but who was physically located in a back office and did not \u201csee\u201d the weapon, unequivocally testified to his apprehension of serious bodily injury. <em>Misner, </em>234 Mont. at 219, 763 P.2d at 25. This Court upheld the defendant\u2019s conviction of felony assault (now assault with a weapon) on grounds that it was not necessary for the technician to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>personally observed the gun in order for him to have experienced reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury as required by the statute. <em>Misner, </em>234 Mont, at 219, 763 P.2d at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b624 Similarly, in <em>Hagberg, </em>during a traffic stop of a vehicle, a police officer observed an apparently drunken male passenger leaning over with his arms between his legs as if hiding something at the same time he saw an empty holster on the seat between the driver and passenger. <em>Hagberg, </em>277 Mont. at 37, 920 P.2d at 88. The officer unequivocally testified to his apprehension of serious bodily injury. <em>Hagberg, </em>277 Mont. at 40, 920 P.2d at 90. He stated that he smelled alcohol, the defendant sounded belligerent and had a glazed look on his face, there was an empty holster on the seat of the car, and the defendant looked as though he were holding a gun out of the officer\u2019s sight. <em>Hagberg, </em>277 Mont. at 37, 920 P.2d at 88. As in <em>Misner, </em>this Court upheld the defendant\u2019s conviction of felony assault (now assault with a weapon) on grounds that it was not necessary for the officer to have personally observed the gun in order for him to have experienced reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury as required by the statute. <em>Hagberg, </em>277 Mont. at 41, 920 P.2d at 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b625 Thus, our case law permits two different applications of the language in \u00a7 45-5-213(l)(b), MCA, which makes it a crime to cause \u201creasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury in another by use of a weapon or what reasonably appears to be a weapon.\u201d Under one application, a crime is committed if a person <em>uses a weapon or what reasonably appears to be a weapon </em>to cause reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury in the victim. Under the second application, a crime is also committed if a person simply <em>causes reasonable apprehension that the victim, will sustain serious bodily injury from a weapon, </em>if it reasonably appears to the victim that a weapon is involved, whether actually seen or not. Cases which have approved the first application include <em>State v. Roullier, </em>1999 MT 37, 293 Mont. 304, 977 P.2d 970; <em>State v. Matt </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 136, 814 P.2d 52; and <em>State v. Crabb </em>(1988), 232 Mont. 170, 756 P.2d 1120. Our holdings in <em>Misner </em>and <em>Hagberg, </em>however, generally stand for the proposition that the statute is also satisfied under the second application, specifically, merely by the existence of circumstances which lead the victim to reasonably apprehend that he or she will be injured by a weapon. <em>See Misner, </em>234 Mont. at 219, 763 P.2d at 26; <em>Hagberg, </em>277 Mont. at 41, 920 P.2d at 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u00b626  Given the existence of the second application of subpart (l)(b) of \u00a7 45-5-213, MCA, extant under current Montana criminal law, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>necessary to clarify our holding in <em>State v. Brown </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 453, 781 P.2d 281. On appeal, the defendant in <em>Brown </em>asserted that the evidence at trial was insufficient to sustain a conviction for felony assault, and at most could sustain a conviction for domestic abuse. We stated in <em>Brown </em>that the distinction between felony assault (now assault with a weapon) and domestic abuse was that felony assault required use of a weapon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-4\">Thus, in cases where bodily injury is inflicted to a family or household member, the distinction between felony assault and domestic abuse is that felony assault requires use of a weapon. In cases involving reasonable apprehension of bodily injury in a family or household member, felony assault, in comparison to domestic abuse, requires two additional elements: use of a weapon and that the bodily injury apprehended is of a serious nature. Sections 45-5-206, 45-5-202, MCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-5\"><em>Brown, </em>239 Mont. at 456, 781 P.2d at 283-84. In light of <em>Misner </em>and <em>Hagberg, </em>it is not technically correct that \u201cuse of a weapon\u201d (or, presumably, what appears to the victim to be a weapon) is a requisite element of the offense. The crime of assault with a weapon may be established: (1) if a person uses a weapon, or what reasonably appears to be a weapon, to cause reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury in the victim, or (2) if a person causes reasonable apprehension that the victim will sustain serious bodily injury from a weapon, if it reasonably appears to the victim that a weapon is involved, whether actually seen or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\u00b627 We next address Smith\u2019s contention that the affidavit supporting the second amended Information failed to state the required elements to establish the offense of assault with a weapon. It is important at the outset to clarify the exact counts of assault with a weapon with which Smith was charged in the second amended Information, and which count was retained pursuant to the April 5, 2002, plea agreement. Count I in the second amended Information stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">[T]he Defendant, SCOTT STEPHEN SMITH ... did knowingly or purposely cause reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury in another by use of a weapon, to wit; Defendant told Tami Smith he was going to shoot and kill Mac Hernandez under circumstances that caused her reasonable apprehension to believe he would inflict serious bodily injury on Mac Hernandez ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvR\">Count II in the second amended Information stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-8\">[T]he Defendant, SCOTT STEPHEN SMITH ... did knowingly or purposely cause reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>in another by use of a weapon, to wit; Defendant told Mac Hernandez he was going to shoot and kill Mac Hernandez under circumstances that caused him reasonable apprehension to believe he would inflict serious bodily injury on him ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Thus, Count I alleged that Smith caused <em>Tami </em>reasonable apprehension that Smith would kill Hernandez, whereas Count II alleged that Smith caused <em>Hernandez </em>reasonable apprehension that Smith would kill Hernandez. Pursuant to the plea agreement, Smith pled guilty to Count I in exchange, <em>inter alia, </em>for dismissal of Count II. Smith reserved his right to appeal the appropriateness of the charges brought under Count I of the second amended Information which charged him with assault with a weapon under circumstances where, in a telephone call to his ex-wife, he threatened to shoot Mac Hernandez, her boyfriend. The essential question, therefore, is: did Count I of the second amended Information, which was retained by the plea agreement, state the necessary elements to charge Smith with the offense of assault with a weapon pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-213, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u00b628 The statute provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">45-5-213. Assault with a weapon. (1) A person commits the offense of assault with a weapon if the person purposely or knowingly causes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">(a) bodily injury to <em>another </em>with a weapon; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-8\">(b) reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury in <em>another </em>by use of a weapon or what reasonably appears to be a weapon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">Section 45-5-213, MCA (emphasis added). Smith argues that the word \u201canother\u201d means <em>the intended victim, </em>and that the \u201creasonable apprehension\u201d in subpart (l)(b) references the apprehension which is experienced <em>by the intended victim of the serious bodily injury. </em>Smith argues that the phrase \u201cin another\u201d in subpart (l)(b) does not mean <em>a third party victim </em>who only suffers apprehension of the harm to the intended victim of the serious bodily injury. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">\u00b629 Although we note that \u00a7 45-2-101(3), MCA, defines \u201canother\u201d as \u201ca person or persons other than the offender,\u201d and that the District Court concluded that \u201canother\u201d meant \u201csomeone other than the defendant,\u201d a fair reading of the phrase \u201cin another\u201d within the context of the entire statute, and particularly within the phrase \u201creasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury in another,\u201d means <em>the intended victim of the serious bodily injury, </em>not a third party who was merely fearful that the intended victim would be harmed. We conclude that subpart (l)(b) does not expand the crime of assault with a weapon to an entire new group of third parties who were fearful about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>defendant inflicting serious bodily injury upon an intended victim. Subpart (l)(b) cannot reasonably be interpreted to define a crime involving two differently postured victims, one who was the object of the serious bodily injury, and another who only sustained apprehension of the harm to the first victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u00b630  Therefore, to convict Smith of the offense of assault with a weapon, the Information needed to allege that Smith purposely or knowingly caused reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury <em>in Hernandez, the intended victim of serious bodily injury, </em>by use of a weapon, or what reasonably appeared to be a weapon; or, by causing reasonable apprehension <em>in Hernandez, the intended victim of serious bodily injury, </em>that Hernandez would be injured by a weapon. Thus, although the charge alleged in Count II of the second amended Information was proper under the statute, that charge was dropped pursuant to the plea agreement. Only Count I of the second amended Information was retained, which alleged reasonable apprehension <em>in Tami, </em>who was <em>not </em>the intended victim of serious bodily injury, but a <em>third party victim </em>who was fearful of the harm to the intended victim, Hernandez. Thus, Count I retained by the plea agreement failed to state the necessary elements for the offense of assault with a weapon as required under \u00a7 45-5-213, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u00b631 We therefore conclude that the District Court erred in denying Smith\u2019s motion to dismiss Count I of the Information.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\u00b632 Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b241-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER, LEAPHART and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b237-5\"> 45-5-202 [1997].

The point is, the State relied on the language used by the Legislature and if the Legislature wants to limit the scope of the statute, it is free to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u00b636 By interpreting \u00a7 45-5-213(l)(b), MCA, to refer only to the intended victim of the serious bodily injury, the majority is arbitrarily inserting language into the statute that the Legislature saw fit to omit. Thus, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
