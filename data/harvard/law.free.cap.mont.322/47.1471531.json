We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence by concluding that defendant was not unlawfully detained subsequent to an investigatory traffic stop and, further, that defendant had consented to a warrantless search.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">\u00b63 On November 18, 2002, Lincoln County Deputy Sheriff Shane Hight, supervised by Deputy Richard Larsen, pulled over Merrill for making an improper lane change. The two officers approached Merrill\u2019s car, Hight on the driver\u2019s side and Larsen on the passenger side. Hight asked Merrill for her driver\u2019s license, registration, and proof of insurance. Receiving these papers, Hight returned to the patrol car and called the dispatcher, from whom he learned the identity of the owner of the vehicle, who was not Merrill. Hight recognized the vehicle owner as someone suspected of involvement with dangerous drugs. Returning to Merrill, Hight gave her a verbal warning about the lane change and told her she was free to go. Merrill then asked if she was going to get a ticket, and Hight confirmed that he was just going to give her a warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">\u00b64 Stepping away from the vehicle, Hight watched Merrill for a few seconds and noticed that Merrill was acting unusually nervous. As Larsen turned and headed back to the patrol car, Hight, suspicious because of the report about the car owner, asked Merrill if he could talk to her for a minute. She answered that he could. Hight then asked her if he could search the car. Again, Merrill replied affirmatively. After Merrill stepped out of the car and closed the door, Hight asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>if he could search her person, including her pockets. She said, \u201cOkay.\u201d Hight requested that Merrill empty her pockets on the trunk of her car, and as she did so, he noticed a piece of cellophane that he suspected contained illegal drugs. During his testimony, Deputy Larsen conveyed what happened next:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-4\">A. He [Hight] said \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d And she [Merrill] said, \u201cThat\u2019s just garbage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-5\">Q. And then was there further conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">A. Shane [Hight] picked that up, and started to unwrap it, and said, \u201cChina, is this your meth?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-7\">Q. And what did she say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-8\">A. She said, \u2018Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">The cellophane contained a substance that field tested positive for methamphetamine. Hight then placed Merrill under arrest, and Merrill was subsequently charged with possession of dangerous drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"AP\">\u00b65 Merrill filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained in the search, which was denied by the District Court. Thereafter, the parties entered a plea agreement wherein Merrill pled guilty to the charge and reserved her right to appeal the denial of her motion to suppress. Pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement, the District Court deferred imposition of sentence. Merrill appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">\u00b66 The standard of review of a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion to suppress is whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether those findings were correctly applied as a matter of law. <em>State v. Henderson, </em>1998 MT 233, \u00b6 9, 291 Mont. 77, \u00b6 9, 966 P.2d 137, \u00b6 9. A court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial evidence, the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or our review of the record convinces us that a mistake has been committed. <em>Henderson, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence by concluding that the defendant was not unlawfully detained subsequent to an investigatory traffic stop, and, further, that defendant had consented to a warrantless search?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-14\">\u00b68 Merrill contends that Hight\u2019s questioning of her which followed his verbal warning about the traffic violation constituted an unlawful seizure of her person. She maintains that no reasonable person would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>have felt free to leave with a patrol car\u2019s lights flashing behind her and an armed officer on either side of her car. She suggests that she was effectively surrounded. Based upon her assertion that she was not free to leave, Merrill contends that the search of her car and her person were not voluntary. Merrill argues that Hight\u2019s actions violated both the federal and state constitutions as well as governing state statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"Aif\">\u00b69 The State rejoins that Merrill was free to decline to answer the officer\u2019s questions, and farther, was free to deny his requests to search her and her effects because a reasonable person would have felt free to leave under these circumstances. The State notes that, despite Merrill\u2019s contention to the contrary, there is no evidence that the officers were \u201csurrounding\u201d the car or otherwise impeding her departure from the scene of the traffic stop. Merrill was still putting away her documents, Larsen was returning to the patrol car, and Hight had stepped back from the vehicle when he requested permission to speak to her. Therefore, the State argues, at that point the seizure of the vehicle occasioned by the traffic violation had ended, and the interaction which followed was voluntary and permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"AD\">\u00b610 In <em>United States v. Mendenhall </em>(1980), 446 U.S. 544, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 64 L.Ed.2d 497, the United States Supreme Court concluded that a person is seized within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment \u201conly if, in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u201d <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. at 554, 100 S.Ct. at 1877, 64 L.Ed.2d at 509.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>State v. Roberts, </em>1999 MT 59, 293 Mont. 476, 977 P.2d 974, we applied the <em>Mendenhall </em>test in determining whether the defendant had been \u201cseized\u201d for purposes of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Roberts, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">\u00b611 Montana\u2019s constitutional search and seizure provision, Article II, Section 11, of the Montana Constitution, states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-5\">Searches and seizures. The people shall be secure in their persons, papers, homes and effects from unreasonable searches and seizures. No warrant to search any place, or seize any person or thing shall issue without describing the place to be searched or the person or thing to be seized, or without probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation reduced to writing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>In <em>State v. Clayton, </em>2002 MT 67, 309 Mont. 215, 45 P.3d 30, we reaffirmed the Fourth Amendment test applied in <em>Roberts </em>and further applied the test to such challenges brought under Article II, Section 11, of the Montana Constitution, stating that \u201cthe test for whether a seizure occurs is a purely objective one.\u201d <em>Clayton, </em>\u00b6 22. We noted that \u201c[t]his test is necessarily imprecise and will vary depending on the setting in which the conduct occurs.\u201d <em>Clayton, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">\u00b612 In <em>Roberts, </em>a police officer pulled into a one-lane driveway, blocking the car of a driver suspected of driving under the influence. Though the suspect was not attempting to leave, this Court held that the officer\u2019s actions and show of authority would not have allowed a reasonable person to feel free to do so. Likewise, in <em>State v. Carlson, </em>2000 MT 320, 302 Mont. 508, 15 P.3d 893, the officers prevented the occupants of a van who were suspected of illegal drug activity from leaving the scene, this time at gunpoint, making for a more compelling case of seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">\u00b613 In contrast, in <em>Clayton </em>we determined that officers who stopped their patrol car close to the left rear of a vehicle and shone a spotlight into it did not seize the driver. In <em>State v. Wagner, </em>2003 MT 120, 315 Mont. 498, 68 P.3d 840, we determined that an officer who requested that a drunk man in a store accompany him outside did not present such a show of authority that a reasonable person would not have felt free to leave. <em>Wagner, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\u00b614 The current case is comparable to <em>Clayton </em>and <em>Wagner </em>in that neither of the officers impeded Merrill\u2019s exit from the scene after telling her she was free to go. <em>Roberts </em>and <em>Carlson </em>are distinguishable for the opposite reason. In those cases officers either physically or by show of force blocked the suspects from leaving the scene. Here, Deputy Hight and Deputy Larsen took no such measures, and, according to uncontroverted testimony, Hight repeatedly sought Merrill\u2019s permission for his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">\u00b615  We conclude, therefore, that the officers\u2019 actions would not have made a reasonable person feel as though he could not leave. Hight had stepped away from the vehicle after specifically telling Merrill that he was just giving her a warning for the traffic violation and that she was free to go. Larsen, assuming the stop was concluding, had already turned and was heading back to the patrol car. Merrill was putting away her documents when Hight re-initiated conversation. There is nothing from the evidence which would indicate that Hight\u2019s manner suggested he was ordering Merrill to stay. He asked permission from her three times: to talk to her, to search her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>car, and to search her person. Under these circumstances, Merrill\u2019s acquiescence to Hight\u2019s requests is not indicative of a person seized, but of a consenting individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">\u00b616 Merrill also argues that Hight exceeded his authority under \u00a7 46-5-403, MCA, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">Duration of stop. A stop authorized by 46-5-401 or 46-6-411 may not last longer than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Section 46-5-401(1), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-7\">Investigative stop and frisk. (1) In order to obtain or verify an account of the person\u2019s presence or conduct or to determine whether to arrest the person, a peace officer may stop any person or vehicle that is observed in circumstances that create a particularized suspicion that the person or occupant of the vehicle has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense. If the stop is for a violation under Title 61, unless emergency circumstances exist or the officer has reasonable cause to fear for the officer\u2019s own safety or for the public\u2019s safety, the officer shall as promptly as possible inform the person of the reason for the stop.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Although Merrill concedes that the initial investigatory stop made by the officers pursuant to \u00a7 46-5-401, MCA, was appropriate, she argues that once Hight stepped away from the vehicle, the original purpose of the stop was completed and Hight had no right to remain next to her car, and thus, the officers\u2019 actions thereafter violated the duration provisions of \u00a7 46-5-403, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">\u00b6 17 Merrill correctly states that Hight had completed his investigation of the improper lane change. At that point, the investigatory stop had concluded. What followed, however, was neither a subsequent investigatory stop nor an extension of the first one. Rather, the subsequent encounter was a voluntary exchange, and no precept of law prevents an officer from engaging a citizen in such voluntary conversations. <em>See </em>Mendenhall, 446 U.S. at 553, 100 S.Ct. at 1876, 64 L.Ed.2d at 508 (citations omitted); <em>Roberts, </em>\u00b6 14 n.5 (\u201c[A] purely voluntary encounter between a law enforcement officer and a citizen intrudes upon no constitutionally protected interest and, thus, is accorded no protection under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">\u00b618 Finally, Merrill argues that the District Court failed to analyze her seizure claim in relation to probable cause and that it failed to examine the searches in relation to a judicially recognized exception to the warrant requirement. It is unclear whether Merrill intends to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>challenge only the constitutionality of the \u201cseizure\u201d of her person or if she means separately to include a challenge to the searches of her car and her pockets as well. However, because she fails to develop any theme, supported by authority, tending to prove the illegality of the searches, we construe her argument as challenging the \u201cseizure\u201d of her person only. <em>See In re Estate of Spencer, </em>2002 MT 304, \u00b6 20, 313 Mont. 40, \u00b6 20, 59 P.3d 1160, \u00b6 20 (\u201cThe Court will not consider unsupported issues or arguments.\u201d); Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P. (requiring that an appellant\u2019s argument contain citations to the authorities relied upon).</p>\n<p id=\"A2\">\u00b619  We further conclude that the District Court conducted a proper analysis of Merrill\u2019s seizure claim. Probable cause and warrant exceptions are analyzed to determine the propriety of a challenged search or seizure. <em>See State v. Van Dort, </em>2003 MT 104, \u00b6 18, 315 Mont. 303, \u00b6 18, 68 P.3d 728, \u00b6 18; <em>State v. Hardaway, </em>2001 MT 252, \u00b6 36, 307 Mont. 139, \u00b6 36, 36 P.3d 900, \u00b6 36. Merrill\u2019s claim involves a threshold issue of whether she was seized at all, the determination of which is properly made under the test we have articulated herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">\u00b620  Upon the conclusion of the investigatory stop, a reasonable person in Merrill\u2019s circumstances would have felt free to leave. Therefore, Merrill was not unconstitutionally seized, and the subsequent searches were voluntary. The District Court\u2019s findings of fact were not clearly erroneous, and those findings were correctly applied as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">\u00b621 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b77-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b74-6\"> The United States Supreme Court later revised <em>Mendenhall </em>by holding that, with respect to a show of authority, a seizure does not occur when the subject fails to yield. <em>California v.
