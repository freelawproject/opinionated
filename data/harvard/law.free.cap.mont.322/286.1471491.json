We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">\u00b62 We address the following restated issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">\u00b63 1. Does the District Court\u2019s order meet the requirements of \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA, for terminating parental rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">\u00b64 2. In light of H.K\u2019s mental disability, does the failure to afford H.K. additional time to complete her treatment plan and change the condition or conduct rendering her unable to parent violate the Americans with Disabilities Act?</p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">\u00b65 In December of 2001, H.K. and her infant son J.B.K. moved from Georgia to live with her aunt in Montana. H.K. was pregnant with J.T.K. at that time. H.K\u2019s aunt contacted social worker Georgia Cady from the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services (Department) to inquire about public assistance for H.K.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-14\">\u00b66 Cady later received a referral regarding H.K. and, after a home visit by Cady, the Department petitioned for emergency protective services and temporary investigative authority regarding J.B.K. in January of 2002. The District Court granted the petition and appointed an attorney and a guardian ad litem for H.K. and a guardian ad litem for J.B.K. After J.T.K. was born, the Department removed him from H.K. and amended its petition to apply to him as well as to J.B.K. The District Court granted the amended petition in March and appointed a guardian ad litem for both children. After J.T.K\u2019s removal, H.K\u2019s aunt moved from the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-15\">\u00b67 In May of 2002, the Department petitioned the District Court to adjudicate J.B.K. and J.T.K. as youths in need of care and to award the Department temporary legal custody for six months. After a hearing in July, the District Court granted the Department\u2019s petition in August of 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>\u00b68 The Department also filed a treatment plan for H.K., which the District Court approved in July of 2002 after receiving no objection from H.K\u2019s attorney. The treatment plan spanned the period from July 15, 2002 to December 15, 2002. It listed a number of tasks, including successful completion of parenting courses.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">\u00b69 In January of2003, approximately one month after the treatment plan expired, the Department petitioned to terminate H.K\u2019s parental rights, as well as the parental rights of J.B.K\u2019s father and J.T.K\u2019s putative father. The District Court held a hearing on April 4, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"A9I\">\u00b610 The Department presented testimony from-and H.K. or her guardian ad litem cross-examined-six witnesses. Dr. Ned Tranel, a clinical psychologist, testified about H.K\u2019s mental disability and opined that her inability to meet a \u201cminimum standard of parenting\u201d would not change. Mumell Fargo, an employee of the Family Support Network who monitored H.K\u2019s weekly supervised visits with her children for over a year, testified she had observed no consistent long-term improvement in H.K\u2019s ability to perceive and respond to the children\u2019s needs without prompting. Dena Burt, program director for the Family Tree Center, testified that H.K had difficulty transferring lessons from parenting classes to different contexts, despite receiving one-on-one instruction based on a class designed for parents with special needs before repeating an infant nurturing class. Toni Jackson, a property manager for H.K\u2019s apartment building and a former Human Resource Development Council intensive housing case manager, testified that H.K\u2019s apartment was filthy when she visited it. Social worker Cady and Child Protective Services supervisor Roxanne Roller testified that H.K. had not successfully completed her treatment plan, despite receiving all services available from the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u00b611 H.K. testified on her own behalf that she was aware of her disability and its effects on her child care abilities. She asserted she had been trying her hardest to comply with the treatment plan and \u201cworking as best as [she] could,\u201d but she \u201cwould put more effort into it so [she] could get it done\u201d if she had more time. She also felt she could be successful. When asked if she could take care of the children, H.K. replied that she \u201cwould try to be the best parent for them,\u201d but acknowledged the difference between trying to parent and being able to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\u00b612 After the hearing, the District Court entered its findings of fact, conclusions of law and order, terminating the parental rights of H.K, J.B.K\u2019s father, and J.T.K\u2019s putative father. H.K appeals. Additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>facts necessary to our resolution of the issues are included below.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\u00b613 In reviewing a district court\u2019s termination of parental rights, we determine whether the statutorily required findings of fact are clearly erroneous, whether the conclusions of law are correct and whether the court abused its discretion in ordering termination. <em>In re J.V., </em>2003 MT 68, \u00b6 7, 314 Mont. 487, \u00b6 7, 67 P.3d 242, \u00b6 7 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">\u00b614 1. Did the District Court\u2019s order meet the requirements of \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA, for terminating parental rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">\u00b615 The District Court terminated H.K\u2019s parental rights pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA, after finding the children had been adjudicated as youths in need of care, H.K. had not successfully completed her treatment plan, and the condition or conduct rendering her unable to parent was unlikely to change within a reasonable time. H.K. asserts error.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">\u00b616 H.K. first argues the District Court\u2019s order violates \u00a7 41-3-609(4)(b), MCA, which provides that \u201c[a] treatment plan is not required under this part upon a finding by the court following hearing if... two medical doctors or clinical psychologists submit testimony that the parent cannot assume the role of parent.\u201d H.K. contends that, because the Department did not present the testimony of two medical doctors or clinical psychologists, it \u201ccannot argue that H.K. is unable to assume the role of parent.\u201d Section 41-3-609(4)(b), MCA, has no application here, however. It addresses a circumstance in which no treatment plan is required. As set forth above, the District Court terminated H.K.\u2019s parental rights under a different portion of \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">\u00b617 H.K. also argues that the District Court\u2019s finding that her conduct or condition was unlikely to change within a reasonable time does not satisfy \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA, because she \u201cwas not given enough time to successfully complete the treatment plan....\u201d Section 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA, does not provide that a parent must be given as much time as it takes for successful completion of a plan. Further, \u00a7 41-3-609(2)(a), MCA, requires a court to consider, among other things, a parent\u2019s mental deficiency in determining whether the parent\u2019s conduct or condition is likely to change within a reasonable time. When construing a statute, we ascertain and declare its terms or substance and do not insert what has been omitted or omit what has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>inserted. Section 1-2-101, MCA; <em>In re Adoption of Snyder, </em>2000 MT 61, \u00b6 16, 299 Mont. 40, \u00b6 16, 996 P.2d 875, \u00b6 16. The District Court properly considered \u00a7 41-3-609(2)(a), MCA, here.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">\u00b618  Moreover, the determination that H.K.\u2019s conduct or condition was unlikely to change within a reasonable time is a finding of fact pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f)(ii), MCA. As stated above, we review a finding to determine whether it is clearly erroneous. A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence or if, upon reviewing the record, this Court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>In re J.C., </em>2003 MT 369, \u00b6 7, 319 Mont. 112, \u00b6 7, 82 P.3d 900, \u00b6 7 (citation omitted). Here, H.K. does not argue the District Court\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous. Furthermore, our review of the record reveals ample testimony from several witnesses that H.K\u2019s conduct had not improved in the year since the Department became involved and her condition was unlikely to change. We conclude the District Court\u2019s finding that H.K.\u2019s conduct or condition was unlikely to change within a reasonable time is supported by substantial credible evidence and is not otherwise clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"ADG\">\u00b619 Finally, H.K. contends the District Court erred in determining her conduct or condition was not likely to change within a \u201creasonable time,\u201d as set forth in \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f)(ii), MCA, because the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires an extension of the \u201creasonable time\u201d to account for her disability. We observe that H.K. cites to no authority pursuant to which the ADA has been engrafted onto or into \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f)(ii), MCA, as required by Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P. We do not address arguments unsupported by authorities. <em>See, e.g., In re A.R., </em>2004 MT 22, \u00b6 10, 319 Mont. 340, \u00b6 10, 83 P.3d 1287, \u00b6 10. Therefore, we decline to address H.K\u2019s argument here. In any event, H.K\u2019s primary contention in this case relates to the ADA, and we address it below.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u00b620  We hold that H.K has failed to establish that the District Court\u2019s order does not meet the requirements of \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u00b621 2. Does the failure to afford H.K additional time to complete her treatment plan and change the condition or conduct rendering her unable to parent violate the ADA?</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\u00b622 H.K argues that, because she is developmentally disabled, the ADA entitles her to more time to successfully complete her treatment plan and to change the conduct or condition currently rendering her unfit to parent. She asserts the Department failed to provide a reasonable modification for her disability and discriminated against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>her by failing to afford her additional time to complete her treatment plan. The District Court did not address H.K\u2019s ADA-related arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">\u00b623 The pertinent portion of the ADA provides that \u201cno qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132. Pursuant to a regulation promulgated under the ADA, a public entity must make reasonable modifications in its policies, practices, or procedures if necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of a disability, unless the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\u00b624 We have not addressed whether the ADA applies to parental termination proceedings in Montana. <em>See In re AM., </em>2001 MT 60, \u00b6 66, 304 Mont. 379, \u00b6 66, 22 P.3d 185, \u00b6 66. Many courts addressing the issue have held the ADA does not directly apply to termination proceedings, either because the ADA creates a separate right of action or because termination proceedings are not among the public \u201cservices, programs, or activities\u201d described in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132. <em>See, e.g., In re Doe </em>(Haw. 2002), 60 P.3d 285, 291; <em>In re B.S. </em>(Vt. 1997), 693 A.2d 716, 720. A few courts have applied the ADA to a state agency\u2019s provision of services prior to a termination proceeding, but have noted a parent must raise such a claim in a timely manner so that reasonable accommodations may be made. <em>See, e.g., In re Adoption of Gregory </em>(Mass. 2001), 747 N.E.2d 120, 126-27. One court suggested the ADA may be raised as an affirmative defense in a termination proceeding, but held the mother waived the defense by failing to plead it. <em>In re C.M. </em>(Tex. App. 1999), 996 S.W.2d 269, 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\u00b625 Other courts have declined to directly address whether the ADA applies to termination proceedings. For example, the Washington Court of Appeals rejected a claim by developmentally disabled parents that the state agency\u2019s failure to provide specialized parenting classes violated the ADA. That court determined the agency had provided all reasonably available services and the services were modified to accommodate the parents\u2019 specific disabilities. It concluded that the agency\u2019s efforts satisfied state statutory requirements and resulted in \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d of the parents\u2019 disabilities. <em>In re Welfare of A.J.R. </em>(Wash. App. 1995), 896 P.2d 1298, 1302. In addressing a mother\u2019s assertion of an ADA violation based on a failure to offer her services specifically tailored to her cognitive skills, the Maine Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Court merely determined that the record belied the mother\u2019s claim of lack of services tailored to her needs and established the agency had \u201coffered a number of services that took [the mother\u2019s] pace and cognitive skills into account.\u201d <em>In re Angel B. </em>(Me. 1995), 659 A.2d 277, 279. Like the Washington and Maine courts, we need not directly address whether the ADA applies to termination proceedings in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\u00b626 Noting H.K\u2019s intellectual limitations, the District Court determined clear and convincing evidence demonstrated that H.K\u2019s \u201cconduct and/or condition\u201d was unlikely to change within a reasonable time and that, \u201ceven if given additional time, it is extremely unlikely that [H.K] will be able to successfully complete the original treatment plan and the subsequent treatment plans that would be necessary before she could adequately parent J.T.K and J.B.K\u201d The District Court made extensive findings based on testimony at the hearing. Among other things, it relied on Tranel\u2019s opinion that H.K could not change her level of intellectual functioning, Fargo\u2019s concern about H.K\u2019s failure to demonstrate a consistent long-term improvement in recognizing her children\u2019s needs without prompting, and H.K\u2019s inability to identify a specific thing she would do given more time, other than try to obtain her GED.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u00b627 On appeal, H.K emphasizes Roller\u2019s testimony that, when the treatment plan was designed, she foresaw H.K may have needed more time to complete it. Roller also testified, however, that she believed at the time of the hearing that an extension of time would not allow H.K to successfully complete the treatment plan or adequately care for her children. The court\u2019s findings regarding Tranel\u2019s and Fargo\u2019s testimony are consistent with this belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\u00b628 H.K. does not dispute that the Department offered her every available service, and the record reflects that the Department attempted to accommodate H.K\u2019s disability by allowing her to repeat the infant nurturing class and providing her individual classes based on a special needs program. Moreover, as discussed above, the District Court determined clear and convincing evidence established that H.K likely could not successfully complete treatment plans or become capable of parenting, even if given additional time. We conclude the Department took H.K\u2019s disability into account in administering her treatment plan and in providing services which took into account her special needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">\u00b629 We note several witnesses testified that H.K loves her children very much and is willing to parent them. Unfortunately, love and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>willingness are sometimes not sufficient to establish fitness to parent. <em>See, e.g., In re S.C., </em>2003 MT 93, \u00b6 24, 315 Mont. 188, \u00b6 24, 68 P.3d 685, \u00b6 24; <em>In re Custody and Parental Rights of P.M., </em>1998 MT 264, \u00b6 24, 291 Mont. 297, \u00b6 24, 967 P.2d 792, \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">\u00b630  We hold the District Court took H.K.\u2019s disability into account in determining her conduct and condition were unlikely to change within a reasonable time and did not abuse its discretion in terminating her parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u00b631 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b317-6\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, COTTER and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
