We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-13\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal: Did the District Court err in concluding there is no genuine issue of material fact that BMC\u2019s and Blake\u2019s acts related to Mark\u2019s injury were not intentional and malicious as defined by applicable law?</p>\n<p id=\"b217-14\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b217-15\">\u00b63 BMC is the parent company of Intermountain Truss and Poulsens. Intermountain Truss manufactures trusses and is based in Helena. Poulsens is a hardware store and lumber yard in Great Falls. Intermountain Truss uses special equipment to transport large shipments of trusses to its customers. However, previous to the incident at issue here, Intermountain Truss would semi-regularly deliver trusses to Poulsens for resale in order to accommodate relatively smaller purchases.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-16\">\u00b64 In August 2000, Mark and Blake were employees of Poulsens. Blake was an assistant foreman and was Mark\u2019s immediate supervisor at the time. On or about August 7, a customer purchased roof trusses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>from Poulsens that were to be delivered to a construction site. Blake began using a forklift to load the 40' roof trusses onto a truck for delivery. The truss load weighed approximately one ton. Because the bed of the truck was only 22' long, he placed beams under the trusses to extend the length of the truck bed to support the trusses. This procedure was one of two methods routinely used at Poulsens to load and deliver trusses. After the trusses were loaded onto the truck, it became apparent the beams were not placed in a way that would effectively support the trusses. At about this time, Mark began assisting Blake. Blake used one tine of the forklift to lift the end of the truss load hanging off the back of the truck. Mark then reached under the load and attempted to adjust a beam. The movement of the beam caused the trusses to shift and fall off the forklift and onto Mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\u00b65 Mark suffered severe injuries. As an employee covered by worker\u2019s compensation, Mark received payment for medical expenses, disability, and occupational retraining since he is no longer able to perform heavy labor. Poulsens\u2019 management conducted an investigation into the incident. The investigation determined the trusses fell off the forklift in part because Blake positioned the trusses toward the tip of a single fork tine instead of up against the mast of the forklift. As a result of this accident, Intermountain Truss no longer delivers trusses to Poulsens but instead delivers both large and small orders directly to customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\u00b66 Mark brought suit against BMC and Blake asserting that the circumstances of his injury fall under the intentional act exception to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act as provided for by \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA (1999). Specifically, Mark argued that by requiring employees to load the long trusses on short trucks that are not designed to haul trusses, BMC and Blake intentionally caused his injury. Donna brought a loss of consortium suit based on Mark\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\u00b67 BMC and Blake moved for summary judgment asserting their actions did not meet the intentional act requirements of \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA (1999), as articulated in <em>Sherner v. Conoco, Inc., </em>2000 MT 50, 298 Mont. 401, 995 P.2d 990. The District Court agreed and granted the motion. Mark and Donna appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err in concluding there is no genuine issue of material fact that BMC\u2019s and Blake\u2019s acts related to Mark\u2019s injury were not intentional and malicious as defined by applicable law?</p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>\u00b69 We review an appeal from a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Dobrocke v. City of Columbia Falls, </em>2000 MT 179, \u00b6 19, 300 Mont. 348, \u00b6 19, 8 P.3d 71, \u00b6 19. Summary judgment is proper if there are no genuine issues of material fact when the facts are viewed in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Dobrocke, </em>\u00b6 20. We note here that for purposes of the summary judgment motion regarding BMC\u2019s and Blake\u2019s actions, any contributory negligence on Mark\u2019s part is irrelevant. Further, as agreed by the parties, Donna\u2019s claim is derivative of and dependant on Mark\u2019s claim. <em>Maney v. Louisiana Pac. Corp., </em>2000 MT 366, \u00b6 20, 303 Mont. 398, \u00b6 20, 15 P.3d 962, \u00b6 20 (Act\u2019s exclusivity provision bars any third party action against an employer for compensation claimed \u201cas a result of\u2019 or \u201cconcerning\u201d an employee\u2019s injury or death). Finally, the 2001 legislative amendments to \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA, do not apply to this case. Rather, the facts of this case are governed by \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA (1999), the previous version which we interpreted in <em>Sherner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">\u00b610 Mark asserts the District Court erred because there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether BMC and Blake acted intentionally and maliciously by requiring workers to routinely load trusses in known, unsafe conditions without providing adequate equipment, safety training or supervision. Mark argues the only reason trusses were delivered to Poulsens was to save costs on using Intermountain Truss\u2019 expensive delivery equipment and that this focus on costs rather than safety shows that BMC and its subsidiaries intentionally and maliciously disregarded safety issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\u00b611 Specifically, Mark asserts BMC and Blake violated OSHA standards which demonstrate their acts were intentional and malicious. He argues that OSHA requires forklift training specific to the type of load to be carried and that Poulsens failed to provide this training. He also argues that OSHA standards require that protection be provided from falling objects and that this is impossible given that 40' loads were routinely being placed on 22' trucks. Mark also asserts Blake violated OSHA by in effect asking him to get under a loaded forklift, creating an unstable, off-center load on the forklift, and failing to engage the load as far as possible on the forklift.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\u00b612 BMC and Blake assert the District Court properly determined there was no genuine issue of material fact that their actions did not meet the <em>Sherner </em>standard. They further assert there were no OSHA violations and that placing 40' trusses on 22' foot trucks is within length regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">\u00b613  We agree with the District Court. The Workers\u2019 Compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Act prohibits an employee from bringing suit against an employer or fellow employee for injuries sustained during the course of employment. The Act gives employers and fellow employees immunity from suit in exchange for assuring that employees are given compensation for work related injuries. <em>Sherner, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">\u00b614 There was an exception to this immunity as codified at \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA (1999), for an \u201cintentional and malicious act or omission\u201d committed by an employer or fellow employee that injures an employee. In <em>Sherner, </em>we held that the definition of malice codified at \u00a7 27-1-221(2), MCA, applies to \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA (1999). Therefore, in order to meet the intentional act exception and proceed with a tort claim against an employer, an employee must demonstrate that the employer or fellow employee had knowledge of facts or intentionally disregarded facts that create a high probability of injury to the plaintiff and: (a) deliberately proceeded to act in a conscious or intentional disregard of the high probability of injury to the plaintiff, or (b) deliberately proceeded to act with indifference to the high probability of injury to the plaintiff. <em>Sherner, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\u00b615 In <em>Sherner, </em>two separate problems occurred at a gas refinery both of which required repair. In order to prevent toxic gases from flowing into the areas to be repaired and thereby injuring the repair workers, parts of the refinery had to be shut down. Although a shutdown was initiated, it did not successfully prevent toxic gas from being present in the work area. This failure was known to the employees in charge of managing the safety of the repair work. Despite this fact, an employee was still sent in to conduct repair work. He suffered injuries from the gas. We reversed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment concluding there was a genuine issue of material fact. The employee was required to perform a task even though an injury was essentially certain to occur. Thus, there was a genuine issue of material fact whether the employer knew of and intentionally disregarded a high probability of injury to the employee. This is the threshold inquiry required by the definition of actual malice at \u00a7 27-1-221(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\u00b616 In contrast, in <em>Blain v. Stillwater Mining Co., </em>2004 MT 141, 321 Mont. 403, 92 P.3d 4, a mine employee was killed by an underground train hauling ore. The fellow employee driving the train testified that he only moved the train forward because the later deceased employee signaled with his headlamp that it was proper to move the train. The employee driving the train then continued to move it when he discovered the train was blocking an intersecting track even though he could no longer see the employee that had originally signaled him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Because there was no requirement to stop the train if his partner was not in sight and because it was not highly probable that an injury would occur just because the employee was not within sight, we affirmed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment holding that there was no material fact shown that the fellow employee acted with malice. The conclusion in <em>Blain </em>was that there can be no genuine issue of material fact regarding a malicious act or omission when the employer or a fellow employee does not actually know there exists a high probability that another employee will be injured. <em>Blain, </em>\u00b6 6. \u00b617 The facts of the case here are more analogous to <em>Blain. </em>Regarding Blake, the subsequent investigation conducted by Poulsens found Blake\u2019s acts were likely negligent because he failed to properly use the forklift to lift the trusses when he did not place the trusses against the mast of the forklift. However, despite this carelessness, there is no evidence Blake actually knew the trusses would fall on Mark when Mark moved the beam, nor was Blake aware the trusses would probably fall. Likewise, there is no evidence Blake intentionally disregarded a high probability of injury to Mark. That is, he could perhaps foresee that it was possible the trusses would fall, but there is no indication he knew they would probably fall. Therefore, Blake\u2019s actions do not meet the threshold under \u00a7 27-1-221(2), MCA, because he was not aware of facts that would create a high probability of injury to Mark. In addition, in his deposition, Mark himself specifically testified that he did not believe Blake intentionally tried to hurt him and that they mutually decided the beams needed to be repositioned. Again, while Blake may have been aware that picking up the trusses with a tine of the forklift would create a potentially dangerous situation, there is simply no issue of fact regarding whether Blake deliberately proceeded to act with disregard or indifference to a high probability that Mark would be injured. He did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">\u00b618 Regarding BMC, Intermountain Truss and Poulsens saving money by cutting corners, this does not show malice as defined in <em>Sherner. </em>In addition, the fact that trusses are no longer delivered to Poulsens also does not show malice. Mark\u2019s argument focuses on the trusses in that he argues the routine loading of trusses on inadequate equipment with inadequate training, as demonstrated by potential OSHA violations, created a dangerous situation which Poulsens intentionally disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">\u00b619  However, there is no evidence that by allowing the routine loading of long trusses on short trucks BMC knew its employees would be injured. The malice standard requires more than a showing that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>job in question involves a known risk of injury or a dangerous situation. The standard requires that the employer actually knew of, or intentionally disregarded, a probability of injury that is higher than that caused by gross negligence. Here, there is simply no evidence the companies knew their employees would actually be injured by a routine which was usually performed without incident. In addition, there is no evidence BMC intentionally disregarded a high probability of injury. Poulsens did conduct regular safety courses. These courses included instruction and certification on how to use a forklift and Mark admitted that he took one of those courses. The courses focused on loads to be carried, load stability, load manipulation, load stacking and handling off-center loads. As the District Court stated, BMC was aware of the danger of lifting any type of load with a forklift and it took steps to educate its employees on how to safely deal with these types of situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">\u00b620  Mark argues Poulsens was required by OSHA regulations to specifically instruct on loading trusses. BMC argues there is no specific requirement and that there is no way it can address every type of material that may be loaded with a forklift. This disagreement does not create a genuine issue of material fact. Again, even assuming BMC was negligent in its safety instruction, Mark\u2019s allegation does not create an issue of fact that BMC actually knew there was a high probability its employees would be injured when loading trusses onto a truck with a forklift. Therefore, the District Court properly determined BMC, Poulsens, Intermountain Truss, and Blake did not maliciously act, or maliciously fail to act, in such a way as to injure Mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\u00b621 The District Court correctly determined Mark\u2019s accident does not meet the requirements of the <em>Sherner </em>exception.
