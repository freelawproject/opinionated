We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">\u00b62 We restate the issue as follows: Should this Court invoke the common law doctrine of plain error and conclude that the prosecutor violated Godfrey\u2019s Constitutional right to due process by commenting during trial on his pre-trial silence?</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b279-13\">\u00b63 In the summer of 1999, S.M. and her five children returned to Montana after living out of state for a few years. S.M.\u2019s two oldest children are K.M. and her twin sister, who were about nine years old at the time. The twins are the biological daughters of Godfrey\u2019s twin brother. Godfrey expressed a desire to become involved in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>children\u2019s lives, and began spending his Saturdays with them. Although S.M.\u2019s other children are not blood relatives of Godfrey, he took them with the twins on a variety of outings, including swimming, hiking, and shopping. The children occasionally spent the night at Godfrey\u2019s residence-a converted school bus located about one hundred yards from his grandmother\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u00b64 On October 1, 1999, S.M. was hospitalized for the birth of her sixth child. She had arranged ahead of time for Godfrey and her friend Lucy Salazar to take care of her other children during her hospital stay. Godfrey picked the children up after work on Friday, October 1, and took them to Pizza Hut for dinner. Afterward, he returned with the children to S.M.\u2019s residence and stayed there until someone else arrived to care for them. The following morning, he picked up S.M.\u2019s children and Salazar\u2019s son, and they spent the day \u201chiking, swimming and hanging out at the bus.\u201d On October 3, he drove the children to meet Salazar, in whose care the children were to remain until S.M. was released from the hospital. Godfrey and Salazar conversed briefly before Godfrey left.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u00b65 Salazar testified that she met Godfrey through her friendship with S.M. and that Godfrey had occasionally included her son in the outings with S.M.\u2019s children. Salazar testified that she helped the children get ready for bed on October 3 and K.M. told her that Godfrey had \u201cput his hand in her night pants\u201d the previous night. K.M.\u2019s \u201cnight pants\u201d are pull-up training pants that she wears to bed because she has a medical condition which causes frequent bed-wetting accidents. Salazar said K.M. told her that Godfrey had held her tightly across her stomach and pulled her toward him, that K.M. told Godfrey, \u201cit hurt,\u201d and that Godfrey replied, \u201cit\u2019s supposed to hurt.\u201d When S.M. came home from the hospital on October 4, Salazar informed her of the conversation she had had with KM.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\u00b66 K.M. had not said anything to S.M. about the incident with Godfrey. S.M. asked KM.\u2019s school teacher Elizabeth Jameson for advice before broaching the subject with K.M. Jameson conducts weekly class meetings with her students on a variety of topics. At least once per year, she discusses the difference between \u201cgood touches\u201d and \u201cbad touches.\u201d Jameson decided to use that as the topic of her meeting on October 7. At trial, Jameson testified that KM. approached her after the October 7 class meeting and stated that she had been touched in a bad way by Godfrey, and that he had pulled down her pants while she was lying on his couch. Jameson encouraged KM. to discuss the incident with S.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>\u00b67 S.M. testified that as soon as K.M. returned from school on October 7, K.M. told her that Godfrey had pulled down her \u201cnight pants\u201d while she was sleeping on the couch, and that \u201che was snuggling very tightly and closely from behind her.\u201d K.M. also told S.M. that she felt Godfrey\u2019s \u201cprivate part\u201d in her \u201cbottom cheeks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">\u00b68 On October 8, S.M. called the police and stated that she believed Godfrey had molested K.M. Detective David Potter, who is specially trained to interview child victims in sex abuse cases, conducted an hour-long videotaped interview with K.M. During the interview, K.M. told him that she was afraid she was going to have a baby because of what Godfrey did to her, and explained, \u201cHe was doing it to me.\u201d She also told Potter there had been a similar incident with Godfrey earlier in the summer when he had put his \u201cprivate\u201d between her \u201cbottom cheeks.\u201d She stated that she had never seen his \u201cprivate,\u201d but felt it.</p>\n<p id=\"Anh\">\u00b69 The following day, Potter went to Godfrey\u2019s bus with a search warrant. Potter handcuffed Godfrey and told him that K.M. had been sexually assaulted. Potter collected a blanket, Godfrey\u2019s cut-off shorts, and some other items and left. He did not question Godfrey, nor did he arrest him or read him his rights. Godfrey did not speak with anyone else connected with the case until his arrest on October 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u00b6 10 No law enforcement officer ever gave Godfrey a Miranda warning. However, Godfrey signed an Acknowledgment of Rights form on November 2,1999. The Acknowledgment required Godfrey to place his initials next to each item in a list which enunciated various rights, including one which read, \u201cDuring these criminal proceedings and trial I understand I have the right to ... remain silent. The State may not force me to testify and incriminate myself.\u201d Godfrey went over this document with his attorney. When Godfrey made his initial appearance in court on November 17, 1999, the District Court questioned him about the Acknowledgment to ensure that he had indeed signed it and that he understood its contents. The Acknowledgment was subsequently filed in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\u00b611 When K.M. testified at Godfrey\u2019s trial, she recalled that she fell asleep on Godfrey\u2019s couch while watching television on October 2. Her sisters were sleeping on a bed in the back of the bus. K.M. woke up in the middle of the night and Godfrey was, \u201changing onto my waist and scooting me close to his private.\u201d She stated Godfrey pulled her pants down and she felt his \u201cprivate\u201d against her bottom, and that it felt \u201clike it was sticking to my bottom.\u201d K.M. did not remember telling Salazar that Godfrey was hurting her or that he replied, \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to hurt,\u201d and she did not remember telling Potter, \u201cHe was doing it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>me.\u201d She did remember telling Potter \u201csomeone told me if you do stuff like that, you\u2019ll have a baby.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\u00b612 K.M. also testified that Godfrey had touched her in a similar manner earlier in the summer after they returned to his bus after swimming. KM.\u2019s sisters had gone next door to Godfrey\u2019s grandmother\u2019s home, but she was cold and got into bed to get warm and Godfrey climbed into bed with her. She stated that he was \u201cscooting close\u201d behind her and that she felt, \u201chis private between my bottom cheeks.\u201d Wanting to get out of the situation, she asked him if she could go to his grandmother\u2019s house, but before he responded, her sisters returned to the bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u00b613 K.M. stated that those were the only two such incidents with Godfrey. She asserted that she had never seen Godfrey\u2019s \u201cprivate part,\u201d that he never asked her to touch it, that he did not tell her that anything that happened between them was a secret, and that he did not warn her against telling anyone about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\u00b614 Godfrey testified in his defense at trial. He recalled that he had taken his nieces on a variety of outings during the summer of 1999, and that they had stayed overnight about six times. He explained that during one swimming excursion in mid-June, they returned to his bus because of a sudden storm. He had the children wait in his car while he went inside and changed into dry clothes. After he changed, he told the children they could come in, and he lay down on his bed. K.M. said she was cold and asked if she could get into bed. KM. was wearing a t-shirt over her bathing suit and Godfrey was wearing cut-off shorts. He stated that he hugged her to him to warm her up, but he did not remove any of their clothing or touch her below the waist, and that they remained in bed a half-hour to forty-five minutes. During this time, the other kids were running in and out of the bus and some of them went over to his grandmother\u2019s residence. He denied having any sexual contact with KM. at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">\u00b615 Godfrey further testified that he continued to babysit the children on a regular basis. In September, S.M. asked Godfrey to watch the children for part of the time that she would be in the hospital to deliver her sixth child. On October 2, Godfrey brought S.M.\u2019s five children and Salazar\u2019s son to spend the day with him and stay overnight on his bus.</p>\n<p id=\"AgUh\">\u00b616 After the children went to bed, Godfrey put more wood in the fireplace, sat down on the couch where KM. was sleeping, and smoked a cigarette. He stated that he rested his arm on KM.\u2019s hip and that her hip seemed wet. He knew she had bed-wetting accidents, and he decided to hang her bottoms up to dry because she did not have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>change of clothes with her. He stated that he pulled her pants by the ankle and was tugging them off when she woke up and complained that she was hot. He stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-4\">[M]y immediate reaction was to console her.... I leaned over on my elbow and I gave her a hug and I said, I know, and I said I was sorry and I said I loved her anyway, and then I asked her if she had an accident. Because I was trying to explain what I was doing by hanging up her pants to dry. She said that she did not have an accident, which made me wonder why her pants were wet to the touch.... I felt between her legs and it ... felt like she had an accident.... I felt for a wet spot underneath that blanket that was on the couch.... There was no wet spot and I was just about to tell her that Uncle Tracey made a mistake .:. and that was when she asked if she could sleep on the floor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">He refused because the floor was dirty and told her to go back to sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"AG4\">\u00b617 Godfrey testified that the next day, he dropped the children off with Salazar, and did not hear anything until October 8, when Detective Potter came to the bus with a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\u00b618 Godfrey\u2019s appeal stems from two instances of prosecutorial conduct. First, the prosecutor began his cross-examination of Godfrey as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">Q: Mr. Godfrey ... how old are you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">A: I\u2019ll be 35 December 15.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">Q: Old enough to have explanations for certain events; isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-10\">A: I\u2019m not following you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-11\">Q: Well, you have an explanation for what took place in October in your bus, don\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-12\">A: That\u2019s the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-13\">Q: And you have another explanation for what took place in the summer of \u201899 in the bus, don\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-14\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-15\">Q: Okay. And it\u2019s been nearly seven months since the time of that initial search warrant, hasn\u2019t it been?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-16\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-17\">Q: So, you had seven months to think up an explanation, isn\u2019t that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-18\">A: I didn\u2019t think nothing up. I\u2019m telling the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-19\">Q: And this is the first time that anyone has really heard this explanation; isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-20\">A: No, it\u2019s not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>\u00b619 Godfrey\u2019s counsel did not object to this line of questioning. The second incident occurred at the end of trial, when in his closing argument, and again without objection from Godfrey\u2019s counsel, the prosecutor stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-4\">He knew it was always going to be his word or my word type of thing. He always knew that. He\u2019s not a dummy. You saw him testify. He articulates well. He\u2019s got an explanation. He\u2019s had plenty of time to think about it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\u00b620 The jury trial took place on April 24 and 25,2000. The jury began deliberating on April 25, 2000, and reached its verdict the following day. The jury acquitted Godfrey of one count of sexual assault and one count of attempted sexual intercourse without consent, but convicted him of a second count of sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u00b621 On July 24, 2000, the District Court sentenced Godfrey to thirty years in prison for sexual assault. Because he was on probation for two felony DUI offenses at the time of the incident with K.M., the District Court found him to be a persistent felony offender and imposed an additional ten-year sentence to run consecutively. The suspended portion of Godfrey\u2019s DUI sentence was revoked, and an additional one-year consecutive sentence was imposed, for a total sentence of forty-one years with no time suspended. Godfrey timely appealed this conviction. Godfrey also appeared before the Sentence Review Division, which amended his sentence to a sixty-year prison term with thirty years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">\u00b622 This Court may discretionarily review claimed errors that implicate a criminal defendant\u2019s fundamental Constitutional rights, even if no contemporaneous objection is made and notwithstanding the applicability of \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA, criteria, where failing to review the claimed error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process. <em>State v. Finley </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 126, 137, 915 P.2d 208, 215. We use our inherent power of common law plain error review sparingly, on a case-by-case basis, and only in the class of cases aforementioned. <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 138, 915 P.2d at 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">\u00b623 Godfrey urges this Court to invoke plain error and reverse his conviction. He contends that his Constitutional right to due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>was violated when the prosecutor exploited his exercise of his right to remain silent, by referencing during cross-examination and closing argument the fact that Godfrey offered for the first time at trial an explanation of the incidents with KM. that he had not offered prior to taking the stand. Godfrey claims the prosecutor implied that he remained silent earlier because he was guilty, and that Godfrey lied to the jury when he related his version of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">\u00b624 Because Godfrey\u2019s trial counsel did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s questioning or comments, Godfrey urges this Court to apply the common law doctrine of plain error review. In <em>Finley, </em>this Court held that it would discretionarily consider appeals on this basis in a narrow class of cases. <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 137-38, 915 P.2d at 215. There, we relied upon the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Doyle v. Ohio </em>(1976), 426 U.S. 610, 96 S. Ct. 2240, 49 L. Ed. 2d 91, in which the Court held that using a defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence as evidence of guilt vi olated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We agreed in <em>Finley </em>that a defendant\u2019s right to due process is violated if he chooses to remain silent after receiving <em>a Miranda </em>warning, and his silence is then commented upon by the prosecutor at trial as evidence of guilt. <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 138, 915 P.2d at 216. We noted, however, that Finley had not actually received <em>Miranda </em>warnings and thus had not been induced into remaining silent. <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 141, 915 P.2d at 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">\u00b625 Godfrey argues that, taken as a whole, the case against him was \u201ca close one.\u201d He points out that the State put on only five witnesses-K.M., and four people who buttressed her story by relating how K.M. had described the incidents to them. Because there was no physical evidence, the case was comprised of Godfrey\u2019s word against K.M.\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\u00b626 Godfrey claims that, in such a close case, anything the prosecutor said may have affected the jury\u2019s verdict, and asserts that the timing of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, at the very beginning of cross-examination, gave his remarks greater impact. Godfrey further notes that, although the trial lasted about eight hours, the jury spent close to sixteen hours in deliberations, sent out eleven written requests for trial and testimonial information, and asked the District Court how to know if a jury was deadlocked. In response, the District Court issued seven special instructions to the jury, informed the jury that it would not take any more special requests for materials, and informed Godfrey and the State that it would declare a mistrial if the jury did not return a verdict by 4 p.m. on April 26, 2000. Shortly before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>deadline, the jury returned its verdict, acquitting Godfrey of Count One of sexual assault and Count Two of attempted sexual intercourse without consent, but finding him guilty of the alternative charge of sexual assault on Count Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\u00b627 Godfrey contends that the Acknowledgment of Rights form advised him of his right to remain silent, and therefore, the prosecutor could not thereafter comment on his silence. The State argues that the Acknowledgment of Rights form which Godfrey signed and reviewed with the District Court was not the equivalent of a <em>Miranda </em>warning (as set forth in <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694). Because Godfrey was never subjected to a custodial interrogation and was not read his <em>Miranda </em>rights by a police officer, the State-relying on Finley-asserts it never induced Godfrey to exercise his right to remain silent. Thus, the State argues, it was not improper for the prosecutor to comment upon Godfrey\u2019s silence, since he remained silent of his own choosing and not because of any inducement via an earlier <em>Miranda </em>warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\u00b628 Godfrey and the State each argue that <em>Finley </em>supports their position. Like Godfrey, Finley testified in his own defense, and gave an explanation of events which he had not volunteered prior to taking the stand. <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 131, 915 P.2d at 211. The prosecutor in <em>Finley, </em>like the prosecutor in Godfrey\u2019s case, cast aspersions upon the defendant\u2019s account by questioning his version of events given for the first time at trial. <em>Id. </em>As is also the case for Godfrey, Finley\u2019s counsel did not make a contemporaneous objection to either the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination or to his closing comments. <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 131, 915 P.2d at 212. Ultimately, however, this Court held that, while it did not condone the prosecutor\u2019s comments, Finley\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment or Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution was not violated, because the record did not reflect that he had ever been advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 141, 915 P.2d at 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\u00b629 The State argues that in <em>Finley, </em>we specifically held that if the defendant does not receive a <em>Miranda </em>warning, there can be no <em>Doyle </em>error, as the defendant was not induced into remaining silent only to have that silence used against him at trial. The crux of the State\u2019s position here is that the Acknowledgment of Rights form-which Godfrey received from his attorney and which he then initialed and went over with the District Court during his initial appearance-was not the equivalent of a <em>Miranda </em>warning because Godfrey\u2019s rights were given to him on a printed form rather than read to him by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>police officer at the time of his arrest. The State argues that, because Godfrey signed the form prior to his appearance in the District Court, and because the <em>Miranda </em>warning was not read to him specifically by a police officer, <em>Doyle </em>does not apply. The State maintains that, while a trial judge is required under \u00a7 46-7-102, MCA, to advise a defendant of his Constitutional rights, this written warning\u2019s purpose is to fulfill the \u00a7 46-7-102, MCA, requirements, and does not serve the same purpose as a <em>Miranda </em>warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\u00b630 Godfrey replies that the State\u2019s insistence that <em>Doyle </em>and <em>Finley </em>apply only if a defendant is given a <em>Miranda </em>warning by a police officer is an unreasonably restrictive interpretation. Godfrey notes that the United States Supreme Court has held that it was a violation of due process to impeach a defendant based on his silence \u201cat the time of arrest and after receiving <em>Miranda, </em>warnings,\u201d <em>Doyle, </em>426 U.S. at 619, 96 S. Ct. at 2245, but that the Court did not limit its holding to the time of arrest or only to warnings read to arrestees by police officers. Godfrey also points out that <em>Doyle </em>cites <em>Johnson v. United States </em>(1943), 318 U.S. 189, 63 S. Ct. 549, 87 L. Ed. 704, in which the Supreme Court held that a prosecutor could not use the silence of a defendant who had received a trial court judge\u2019s assurances of the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination as evidence of guilt. Godfrey notes that <em>Doyle\u2019s </em>progeny do not reference \u201claw enforcement\u201d or \u201cpolice officers,\u201d but rather \u201cgovernment\u201d or \u201cgovernmental\u201d assurances. <em>See Portuondo v. Agard </em>(2000), 529 U.S. 61, 74, 120 S. Ct. 1119, 1128, 146 L. Ed. 2d 47 <em>{Doyle </em>is a case where \u201cthe government had induced silence by implicitly assuring the defendant\u201d that it would not be used against him); <em>Jenkins v. Anderson </em>(1980), 447 U.S. 231, 240, 100 S. Ct. 2124, 2130, 65 L. Ed. 2d 86 (no \u201cgovernmental action\u201d induced pre-arrest silence); <em>Anderson v. Charles </em>(1980), 447 U.S. 404, 408, 100 S. Ct. 2180, 2182, 65 L. Ed. 2d 222 (under <em>Doyle, </em>a defendant\u2019s silence after \u201cgovernmental assurances\u201d cannot be used against him).</p>\n<p id=\"ACX\">\u00b631  We conclude that the State\u2019s position that it may comment on a defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence as evidence of guilt, as long as no <em>Miranda </em>warning was specifically read to the defendant by a police officer at the time of the defendant\u2019s arrest, is without merit. We see no reason to distinguish between the situation where a defendant is advised of his right to remain silent by a police officer at the time of arrest, and the situation in which a defendant is advised of his right to remain silent by a court. Whether a defendant is advised of his right to remain silent via the reading of a printed form or having such warning recited to him, and regardless of whether the provider of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>information is a law enforcement officer or a trial judge, the defendant has been induced to exercise his right to remain silent by an agent of the State. Once a <em>Miranda </em>warning of any sort is given, it is error for a prosecutor to comment on a defendant\u2019s post <em>-Miranda </em>silence or his failure to offer a <em>post-Miranda </em>explanation of the alleged crime. Thus, we reject the State\u2019s contention that no <em>Doyle </em>error could possibly exist under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\u00b632 However, since Godfrey did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s questions and comments at trial, we must decide whether we will review this claimed error under our common law plain error doctrine. Godfrey urges \u00fas to analyze the issue under the procedure set forth in <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, 306 Mont. 215, 32 P.3d 735. The first step in this analysis is to determine whether the alleged error is properly characterized as \u201cstructural\u201d error or \u201ctrial\u201d error. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 37. Godfrey concedes that the claimed errors would be \u201ctrial\u201d error. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 40. The next step is to determine whether the error was harmless under the circumstances. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 41. Once error is established, the burden shifts to the State to prove that there is no reasonable possibility that the error contributed to the verdict. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 47. <em>Van Kirk </em>states in pertinent part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">As a threshold matter, once a convicted person raises and establishes that the evidence in question was erroneously admitted and has alleged prejudice under the \u2018reasonable possibility\u2019 test, it then becomes incumbent on the State to demonstrate that the error at issue was not prejudicial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-6\"><em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">\u00b633 Godfrey pointed out in his briefs and dining oral argument that the State has always insisted that no <em>Doyle </em>error occurred. He maintains that because the State has never conceded that there might have been error behind the conduct of the prosecutor, it cannot meet the <em>Van Kirk </em>requirement of demonstrating that the error at issue was not prejudicial. In other words, we cannot conduct a harmless error analysis because the State has failed to carry its burden under <em>Van Kirk. </em>While Godfrey makes a valid point, the fact remains that we must first invoke and apply the plain error doctrine before we can reach the question of whether the alleged error is harmless under a <em>Van Kirk </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">\u00b634 We turn then to the question of whether this case calls for application of the plain error doctrine. First, Godfrey directs our attention to <em>State v. Furlong </em>(1984), 213 Mont. 251, 690 P.2d 986, and argues that it is factually similar and controls in his case. Godfrey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>notes the following exchange during the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of Furlong:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-4\">Q. Is this the first time you have told this story to anyone, Mr. Furlong?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-5\">A. Except what I have discussed with my lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-6\">Q. You didn\u2019t think to tell the Police, the investigator, the County Attorney this before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-7\">A. Nobody ever came to me and asked me what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-8\">Q. You are charged with a felony crime. Do you understand that? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-9\">Q. You never thought about just mentioning that to somebody, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-10\">A. Mentioning what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-11\">Q. That you have no idea how the property got in your car, never crossed your mind to mention that to anybody?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-12\">A. What do you mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-13\">Q. When you were arrested by Sergeant Krakalia, you didn\u2019t just happen to mention, T don\u2019t know how that property got in there. I loaned my car to Johnny and he came back with it\u2019?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-14\">A. I didn\u2019t say anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-15\">Q. But you are going to be arrested on a felony crime and you don\u2019t think to offer an explanation when you are a totally innocent victim?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-16\">At that point, Furlong\u2019s attorney objected to the line of questioning and was ovei\u2019ruled. <em>Furlong, </em>213 Mont. at 256-257, 690 P.2d at 989. On appeal, this Court found that the trial court erred when it overruled Furlong\u2019s objection, and concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination denied Furlong\u2019s Constitutional right to due process. <em>Furlong, </em>213 Mont. at 258, 690 P.2d at 989. Godfrey argues that the only substantive difference between the prosecutorial misconduct in this case and in <em>Furlong, </em>is that Furlong\u2019s attorney objected to the prosecutor\u2019s questions while his attorney did not. The errors, he alleges, are identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-17\">\u00b635 Godfrey claims that his failure to object at trial should not prevent him from seeking relief under the doctrine of plain error, and directs our attention to similarities between his case and <em>State v. Sullivan </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 25, 927 P.2d 1033. The prosecutor in <em>Sullivan </em>mentioned during his opening and closing statements, and during the questioning of witnesses, that Sullivan refused to make a statement at the time of arrest, characterizing Sullivan\u2019s initial silence as providing him with time to make up an explanation. <em>Sullivan, </em>280 Mont. at 29-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>30, 927 P.2d at 1036. Godfrey notes that, like his counsel, Sullivan\u2019s counsel did not object to these remarks, and that in <em>Sullivan, </em>we invoked the common law plain error doctrine, and held that Sullivan\u2019s Constitutional right to due process had been violated. <em>Sullivan, </em>280 Mont. at 33, 927 P.2d at 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\u00b636 We discretionarily review claimed errors that implicate a criminal defendant\u2019s fundamental Constitutional rights, even if no contemporaneous objection is made, where failing to do so may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process. <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 137, 915 P.2d at 215. While we have invoked the common law plain error doctrine in a case similar to Godfrey\u2019s, we conclude that this case does not compel its application.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u00b637 The prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination questions were inadvisable. However, and significantly, they were more a comment on Godfrey\u2019s <em>story </em>than on his <em>silence. </em>See <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 18. Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s comment in closing, while again inadvisable, focuses upon the veracity of Godfrey\u2019s story, and does not at all reference his earlier silence. Unlike in <em>Furlong </em>and <em>Sullivan, </em>the prosecutor here did not comment upon the fact that Godfrey had failed earlier to volunteer his version of events to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\u00b638  A fundamental aspect of \u201cplain error,\u201d is that the alleged error indeed must be \u201cplain.\u201d In a case such as this, it should leave one firmly convinced, as we were in <em>Sullivan, </em>that the prosecutor\u2019s comments created an inference for the jury that by remaining silent after receiving his rights, the defendant must be guilty of the alleged crime. <em>Sullivan, </em>280 Mont. at 36, 927 P.2d at 1040. What occurred here leads to no such firm conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">\u00b639 In <em>Finley, </em>we stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">Whatever name a court chooses to use for the doctrine, courts invoke plain error review to correct error not objected to at trial but that affects the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of judicial proceedings. The particular facts and circumstances of each case drive the applicability of the plain error doctrine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6\"><em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 134, 915 P.2d at 213 (citation omitted). We noted further that we would exercise our discretion in determining when and where to apply such doctrine.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-9\">[G]iven the legislature\u2019s obvious intention to restrict the use of plain error review by its enactment of \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA, we will henceforth use our inherent power of common law plain error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>review sparingly, on a case-by-case basis, and we will invoke that doctrine only in the class of cases aforementioned. In so doing, we reemphasize the necessity for contemporaneous objections to claimed error, and we caution counsel that, except in the class of cases mentioned, the provisions of \u00a7 46-20-701, MCA, will be applied in the absence of contemporaneous objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 138, 915 P.2d at 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u00b640  We conclude that the particular facts ofthis case do not compel the application of the plain error doctrine because there simply was no clear comment on or infringement of Godfrey\u2019s fundamental right to remain silent. Accordingly, and because there was no contemporaneous objection by Godfrey\u2019s counsel to the prosecutor\u2019s questions or comments, we affirm Godfrey\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b291-6\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"At0\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"ADL\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">\u00b641 I concur in the decision of the Court to affirm, but under a different rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">\u00b642 There was no <em>Doyle </em>error here for two reasons. First, as the Court concludes, \u201cthere simply was no clear comment on or infringement of Godfrey\u2019s fundamental right to remain silent.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00b6 40. Without an improper comment on Godfrey\u2019s silence, it is unnecessary to determine whether the State induced the silence under <em>Doyle </em>and <em>Finley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">\u00b643 Secondly, the prosecution\u2019s comments were, in any event, appropriately made in response to Godfrey\u2019s assertion, as part of his innocence defense, that he had cooperated with police from the beginning, a theme offered during defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Officer Potter, during Godfrey\u2019s direct testimony and during defense counsel\u2019s closing argument. We said in <em>Finley, </em>\u201c[the defendant] voluntarily chose to take the stand, and as such, his credibility was subject to impeachment just like any other witness.\u201d <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 141, 915 P.2d at 218. Here, Godfrey took the stand and the credibility of his assertion that he cooperated with police was properly subject to challenge, including his failure to share his trial story with police during the course of his \u201ccooperation\u201d with them.</p>\n<judges id=\"b291-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY and DISTRICT JUDGE MCLEAN, sitting in place of JUSTICE WARNER, join in the concurring opinion of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
