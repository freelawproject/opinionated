We affinn.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">\u00b62 The issues on appeal, as framed by this Court, are:</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court applied the correct standard of proof in this case involving the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court\u2019s determination that M.R.G. is likely to suffer serious physical or emotional damage if placed in L.G.\u2019s care is supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-13\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b85-14\">\u00b65 The Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) commenced child abuse and neglect proceedings involving the young boy, M.R.G., in July 1998, because of neglect and chemical abuse by both of his parents, as well as domestic violence within the home, including an incident which landed M.R.G.\u2019s father, M.B., in prison for felony partner assault. M.R.G. was born in August 1996 to Native American parents and, by virtue of his father\u2019s ancestry, M.R.G. is an enrolled member of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Oregon (the Tribe). The Tribe has been actively involved in this case, stipulating to various protective and custodial orders. The Tribe did not oppose termination of either parent\u2019s rights and agreed to the long-term placement of M.R.G. with his current foster family.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">\u00b66 M.R.G. is a special needs child. He has Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Reactive Attachment Disorder along with learning disabilities. He also has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, possibly attributable to his parent\u2019s chemical abuse and domestic violence. In addition, M.R.G. has a hearing deficit, is significantly speech impaired, and has problems with his vision.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\u00b67 M.R.G. has been in foster care almost continuously since July 1998, with the exception of a three-month period when he lived with his mother, L.G., which ended when L.G. became \u201coverwhelmed\u201d and relapsed into chemical abuse. M.R.G.\u2019s foster father, J.M., is Native American. M.R.G.\u2019s foster parents are raising M.R.G. with an understanding of his Native American heritage and culture.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">\u00b68 On October 16,2000, the State filed for permanent legal custody of M.R.G. and moved to terminate M.B.\u2019s and L.G.\u2019s parental rights. M.B.\u2019s parental rights were terminated at a hearing on April 17,2002. This Court affirmed the termination of M.B.\u2019s parental rights in <em>In re M.R.G., </em>2003 MT 60, 314 Mont. 396, 66 P.3d 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\u00b69 Because L.G. had represented that she would relinquish her parental rights if M.B.\u2019s parental rights were terminated, DPHHS did not seek the simultaneous termination of both parents\u2019 rights. However, after M.B.\u2019s parental rights were terminated, L.G. decided that she no longer wanted to relinquish her parental rights to M.R.G. \u00b610 After several hearings to receive testimony, the District Court heard oral arguments on the matter on July 15, 2003. Thereafter, by order dated July 31, 2003, the District Court terminated L.G.\u2019s parental rights. L.G. appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">\u00b611 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision regarding the termination of parental rights to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>M.R.G., </em>\u00b6 6 (citing <em>In re T.C., </em>2001 MT 264, \u00b6 13, 307 Mont. 244, \u00b6 13, 37 P.3d 70, \u00b6 13). In doing so, we review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous and its conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>M.R.G., </em>\u00b6 6. Furthermore, a district court\u2019s determinations regarding an expert witness\u2019s qualifications and competency are within the discretion of that court and will not be overturned absent a showing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>abuse of that discretion. <em>M.R.G., </em>\u00b6 6 (citing <em>In re K.H., </em>1999 MT 128, \u00b6 11, 294 Mont. 466, \u00b6 11, 981 P.2d 1190, \u00b6 11).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">Issue 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">\u00b612 <em>Whether the District Court applied the correct standard of proof in this case involving the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">\u00b613 ICWA (25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1901, <em>et seq.) </em>was enacted by Congress to protect Native American children, their extended families, and the unique cultural heritage of Native American people. The pertinent provision of ICWA at issue here is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">No termination of parental rights may be ordered in such proceeding in the absence of a determination, <em>supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, </em>including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(f) (emphasis added). Furthermore, it has been stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">[t]he very use of the \u201creasonable doubt\u201d standard of proof in ICWA termination actions, the highest standard of proof known to American jurisprudence, was intended by Congress to stop the all-too-common removal of Indian children from their Indian families, and thus tribal culture \u201cby non-tribal government authorities who have no basis for intelligently evaluating the cultural and social premises underlying Indian home life and childrearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-10\"><em>K.H., </em>\u00b6 20 (quoting <em>Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield </em>(1989), 490 U.S. 30, 34-35, 109 S.Ct. 1597, 1601, 104 L.Ed.2d 29).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">\u00b614 In the case <em>sub judice, </em>L.G. contends that rather than using the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard of proof as required by ICWA, the District Court incorrectly used a standard of what was \u201clikely.\u201d Contrary to L.G.\u2019s assertions, however, in making its determination that L.G. \u201cwould <em>likely </em>cause serious emotional or physical damage to [M.R.G. if he] was returned to her,\u201d the District Court was mirroring the language of 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(f), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-12\">continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is <em>likely </em>to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-13\">\u00b615 Furthermore, as the State, acting on behalf of DPHHS, points out in its brief on appeal, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(f), does not require that a state court specifically cite the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard of proof. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Rather, ICWA requires that a state court\u2019s determination be \u201csupported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">\u00b616 In <em>In re </em>2002 MT 305, \u00b6 16, 313 Mont. 51, \u00b6 16, 59 P.3d 1142, \u00b6 16, also an ICWA case, this Court held that \u201c[although there was no specific finding by the District Court that the burden of proof was met, it is certainly implicit in the court\u2019s statements, and to hold otherwise would be to elevate form over substance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">\u00b617  Accordingly, we hold that while the District Court did not specifically state the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard of proof in its order, it did apply that standard of proof in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">\u00b6 18 <em>Whether the District Court\u2019s determination that M.R. G. is likely to suffer serious physical or emotional damage if placed in L.G.\u2019s care is supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">\u00b619 L.G. maintains that ICWA requires that the State produce testimony from a qualified ICWA expert that a continuation of the parental relationship would likely result in serious emotional or physical damage to M.R.G. L.G. contends that the State failed to present evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that L.G. presented a danger to M.R.G. and that neither ICWA expert testified that M.R.G. would be seriously endangered by L.G.\u2019s conduct if M.R.G. were returned to L.G.\u2019s care. The State, on the other hand, contends that the District Court received substantial testimony from qualified cultural and other experts upon which it could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the prospect of L.G. caring for M.R.G. is likely to subject M.R.G. to serious harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">\u00b620 At the various hearings on this matter, the District Court received testimony both favorable and unfavorable to L.G. from various individuals. As to some of the testimony favorable to L.G., Andree Deligdisch, a clinical social worker employed by the Head Start program, testified that she believed L.G. could successfully parent M.R.G. Richard Parenteau, a counselor at C.M. Russell High School, testified that L.G. was a regular babysitter for his six-year-old daughter and that L.G. had proved very competent in that substitute parenting role. Bonnie Huestis, a licensed chemical dependency counselor, testified that she had counseled L.G. in regard to the recent deaths of L.G.\u2019s mother and brother and that L.G.\u2019s ability to resist relapsing into substance abuse during that ordeal proved L.G.\u2019s new found stability. Likewise, Diane Geisen, a clinical social worker, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>testified that L.G. had become proficient at handling circumstances that could easily be overwhelming to others, and thus was more likely to be able to withstand the added stress of parenting M.R.G. In addition, Lee Houle, a licensed chemical dependency counselor, testified that L.G. had a good chance of not relapsing since at the time of the hearing, L.G. had been sober for more than a year. However, Houle also testified that only 15 to 20 percent of people with problems as severe as L.G.\u2019s actually attain sobriety without further relapses. \u00b621 On the other hand, Susan Fairhurst, the State social worker on the case through April 2000, testified regarding her concerns that, although L.G. did well in maintaining visits with M.R.G., L.G. had difficulty managing M.R.G.\u2019s behavior, consequently L.G. would become extremely frustrated with M.R.G. Fairhurst also testified that in early 2000, DPHHS was unable to initiate an attempt at family reunification because L.G. was associating with a man who was being investigated regarding sexual molestation allegations. L.G. did not honor DPHHS\u2019s request that she keep M.R.G. away from this man who had a history of pedophilia.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">\u00b622 Additionally, one of the goals of L.G.\u2019s treatment plan was that L. G. cooperate fully with DPHHS, however, Fairhurst testified that she was often unable to contact L.G. or to ascertain her whereabouts and that L.G.\u2019s contact with DPHHS was sporadic. Similarly, Kathy No Runner, Fairhurst\u2019s replacement, testified that L.G. did not maintain consistent contact with her and that she had great difficulty tracking down L.G. No Runner did testify that L.G. had completed the parenting classes set out in her treatment plan and that, although L.G. failed to show up for several urinalysis tests, those that L.G. did complete during the previous year and a half were negative for traces of alcohol. However, No Runner also testified that she did not know whether L.G. could be a responsible parent because L.G. never maintained a stable or adequate place to live as required by her treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">\u00b623 Martina Heavy Runner, the State\u2019s ICWA expert, testified that she was concerned about L.G. relapsing back into substance abuse. And, according to Heavy Runner, the bond that foster children develop with their foster families while their parents are trying to recover, should not be overlooked. Heavy Runner testified that, in her opinion, M. R.G.\u2019s physical and emotional condition would be seriously harmed if he were removed from his foster family and placed in L.G.\u2019s primary care because M.R.G. has significantly bonded with his foster family, f 24 Leslie Murphy, a licensed clinical professional counselor, testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>to M.R.G.\u2019s special needs. Murphy, who has treated M.R.G. for several years, also testified to what, in her opinion, would happen if M.R.G. was removed from his foster family:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-4\">[M.R.G.] has done so well and has come so far that I really believe that it would be detrimental. It would be a huge setback for him to go back to his natural biological mother. He feels safe now. He feels secure. He has built up a trust. He has bonded with this family. Like I said, calls them his mom and dad. And I really believe now to pull him out of that environment that took so long ... to get him to a real good place ... would be very detrimental to him. I think he would have a lot of setbacks with that. I think it is important he continues with a relationship with his biological mother, that he is able to visit her and see her and have interaction, certainly know who she is ... but I think to pull him out of an environment he is in right now would be very costly to him in many, many ways.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\u00b625 In addition, Nancy Reppe, a licensed professional counselor, testified that M.R.G. is defiant and that L.G. cannot control him. She further testified that she \u201cwould be apprehensive and concerned\u201d about M.R.G. being returned to the care of L.G. \u201cat this point.\u201d Aline James, a family advocate with the Indian child welfare unit of the Tribe, testified that M.R.G.\u2019s current placement in a Native American foster home is appropriate and that L.G.\u2019s parental rights should be terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\u00b626 Finally, in her closing statement to the District Court, Meghan Lulf, M.R.G.\u2019s attorney, concurred with DPHHS\u2019s request for termination of L.G.\u2019s parental rights. Lulf stated that while L.G. should be applauded for addressing her chemical dependency, she\u2019s \u201ca day late [and] a dollar short.\u201d Lulf further stated that she believed that termination of L.G.\u2019s parental rights were in M.R.G.\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"A3\">\u00b627 The State points out in its brief on appeal that although L.G. testified that she had been sober in the year preceding the hearings, she conceded that her cycle of dependency has included substantial periods of sobriety followed by relapses, including a recent seven-month period of sobriety. L.G. remarried in April 2003, and she attributed much of her recent success to that marriage. However, L.G.\u2019s husband suffered nearly fatal injuries in an automobile accident which took the lives of L.G.\u2019s mother and brother. At the time of the hearing, L.G., who is unemployed, needed to provide twenty-four-hour care to her disabled husband who requires a feeding tube. In addition, L.G. acknowledged that M.R.G. has bonded with his foster family and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>that M.R.G. has stated that he wants to remain with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\u00b628  To forestall termination of parental rights, complete compliance with a treatment plan is required. <em>In re D. </em>V., 2003 MT 160, \u00b6 27, 316 Mont. 282, \u00b6 27, 70 P.3d 1253, \u00b6 27 (citing <em>In re N.A., </em>2002 MT 303, 313 Mont. 27, 59 P.3d 1135). And, treatment must be successful. Section 41-3-609(l)(f)(i), M.C.A. Nevertheless, ICWA requires that \u201c[a]ny party seeking ... termination of parental rights ... shall satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\u00b629 The record in this case clearly indicates that DPHHS did make active efforts to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs to prevent the breakup of this family, but that these efforts proved unsuccessful. Following M.R.G.\u2019s removal from his parents\u2019 home in 1998, DPHHS provided L.G. with a treatment plan, but L.G. either failed to complete, was slow to complete, or failed to successfully complete her treatment goals. L.G. failed early on to take full advantage of inpatient chemical dependency treatment. At one point, DPHHS returned M.R.G. to L.G.\u2019s care while providing intensive in-home family services, but L.G. relapsed and M.R.G. was removed from the home. A second attempt at reunification with in-home services failed because L.G. was associating with a man under investigation for molesting children. By August 2001, three years after M.R.G.\u2019s removal, L.G. was in jail on multiple DUIs. DPHHS facilitated regular visitation between L.G. and M.R.G. for over five years. Notwithstanding, it took L.G. more than four years to complete the recommended parenting classes; she failed to obtain an alcohol-free and violence-free home for sustained periods of time; and she did not maintain regular contact with her social workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">\u00b630 As the State notes in its brief on appeal, L.G. is a good person with serious problems and she needs to be commended for her efforts, but the record does not support her claim that DPHHS is responsible for failing to keep this family together. Furthermore, M.R.G., who is almost eight years old, has been living with his foster family since he was two and a half. In that time, M.R.G. has developed a very strong bond with his foster family. Given L.G.\u2019s history of relapsing into severe alcoholism, M.R.G.\u2019s special needs, and his strong bond with his foster family, M.R.G. could suffer serious emotional damage if he was removed from his foster family and placed in L.G.\u2019s primary care.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>\u00b631  This Court has repeatedly stated that because it does not have \u201ca crystal ball to look into\u201d to determine whether a parent\u2019s conduct is likely to change, that determination must, to some extent, be based on the parent\u2019s past conduct. <em>In re G.S., </em>2002 MT 245, \u00b6 43, 312 Mont. 108, \u00b6 43, 59 P.3d 1063, \u00b6 43 (citing <em>In re E.K., </em>2001 MT 279, \u00b6 47, 307 Mont. 328, \u00b6 47, 37 P.3d 690, \u00b6 47; <em>In re M.A.E., </em>1999 MT 341, \u00b6 37, 297 Mont. 434, \u00b6 37, 991 P.2d 972, \u00b6 37). Here, the District Court received substantial testimony from qualified cultural and other experts upon which it could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the prospect of L.G. providing primary care for M.R.G. is likely to subject M.R.G. to serious harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">\u00b632  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court\u2019s determination that M.R.G. is likely to suffer serious physical or emotional damage if placed in L.G.\u2019s care is supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt and we uphold the District Court\u2019s decision to terminate L.G.\u2019s parental rights to M.R.G.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u00b633 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b92-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, REGNIER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
