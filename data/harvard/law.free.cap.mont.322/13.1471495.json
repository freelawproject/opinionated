Lewis (Lewis) appeals the Order of the Montana First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, affirming the decision of the Montana Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Board (the Board) denying Lewis\u2019 request to purchase service credit in the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">\u00b62 A restatement of the issue in this case is whether the District Court properly affirmed the Board\u2019s interpretation of law regarding the allowable purchase of service under \u00a7 19-3-505, MCA (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">\u00b63 Lewis worked as a Cascade County public defender from October 1977 through March 1980. During that time, neither he nor Cascade County made contributions to the Montana Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (PERS). In 1985, Lewis, then working for the Montana Department of Highways (now Department of Transportation) requested permission to purchase service credit to be applied to his retirement account for his time spent with the Cascade County Public Defender\u2019s Office. In 1998, the Board denied his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">\u00b64 Lewis requested an administrative hearing, and both Lewis and the Board moved for summary judgment. The hearing examiner, in its proposed order, granted summary judgment in favor of Lewis, concluding that Lewis was entitled to purchase service credit because he was an employee<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of Cascade County, and that his service was \u201cnot creditable service\u201d because retirement contributions were not paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">\u00b65 The Board, authorized to make a final decision under A.R.M. 2.43.204(l)(c), rejected the hearing examiner\u2019s proposed order, declared Lewis an independent contractor, determined that his service was \u201ccreditable\u201d service, and entered summary judgment for itself, thereby denying Lewis\u2019 request to purchase service credit. Lewis appealed the Board\u2019s decision on several grounds to the First Judicial District Court. The District Court reversed in part and affirmed in part the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">\u00b66 The court reversed the Board\u2019s determination that Lewis was an independent contractor and reinstated the hearing examiner\u2019s conclusion that Lewis was an employee of Cascade County. That conclusion is not challenged on appeal and, therefore, is the law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">\u00b67 The District Court affirmed the Board\u2019s conclusion that Lewis\u2019 service was \u201ccreditable\u201d service, and thereby denied him the right to purchase service credit. Lewis appeals this conclusion of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">\u00b68 A district court reviews an administrative decision in a contested case to determine whether the findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the agency correctly interpreted the law. We employ the same standards when reviewing a district court order affirming or reversing an administrative decision. <em>Ostergren v. Department of Revenue, </em>2004 MT 30, \u00b6 11, 319 Mont. 405, \u00b6 11, 85 P.3d 738, \u00b6 11 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\u00b69 The Montana Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System provides retirement accounts and benefits for employees of the State of Montana and, on a contracted basis, for political subdivisions of the state. It is undisputed that throughout the time Lewis was a public defender for Cascade County, the County was a participating employer in PERS.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">\u00b610 Section 19-3-505(1), MCA (1979), allows a person, under certain circumstances, to convert \u201cnot creditable\u201d service provided to a public employer to \u201cmembership\u201d or \u201ccreditable\u201d service, thereby enhancing the employee\u2019s retirement account by including contributions to the account for the \u201cnot credited\u201d time worked. Section 19-3-505(1), MCA (1979), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-8\">Subject to the provisions of this section, any person who has service with an employer which is <em>not creditable </em>service may convert all or a portion of such service to <em>membership </em>service by filing written notice thereof with the board. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AM\">Lewis provided such written notice to the Board in April 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">\u00b611 The following definitions are relevant to our analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-10\">\u201cCreditable service\u201d means the aggregate of membership service and prior service. A member employed on a part-time basis shall receive credit for a year of service for each fiscal year during which such member was employed throughout the year and was engaged in his duties the full amount of time he was required by his employment to be so engaged. Section 19-3-104(13), MCA (1979);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-11\">\u201cMembership service\u201d means service with respect to which normal contributions and employer contributions are paid.... Section 19-3-104(22), MCA (1979).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-12\">\u00b612 As noted above, the hearing examiner concluded that Lewis\u2019 service was <em>not creditable </em>service and, therefore under \u00a7 19-3-505(1), MCA (1979), qualified for conversion to membership service. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Board, on the other hand, concluded that Lewis\u2019 service was <em>creditable </em>service and, therefore, did not qualify for conversion to membership service. In determining whether the Board correctly classified Lewis\u2019 employment with Cascade County as creditable service, the District Court reviewed the above definitions. It concluded that \u201cprior service,\u201d as referenced in the definition of \u201ccreditable service\u201d was not at issue in this case. Therefore, in order for Lewis\u2019 service to be creditable service, it would have had to have been \u201cmembership service,\u201d i.e., \u201cservice [for] which normal contributions and employer contributions are paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">\u00b613 Lewis argued that the definition of membership service was clear and unambiguous, the determinative factor being whether contributions were in fact paid or not paid. Because contributions were not paid, his service was not creditable. The Board argued that membership service is that service for which employee and employer contributions <em>are required </em>to be paid, and that, because both Lewis and the County <em>were required </em>to make contributions, Lewis\u2019 service was creditable. The Board maintained that failure to make the required contributions was irrelevant to a determination of whether the service was creditable or not creditable.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">\u00b614 The District Court concluded that the language of the statute could be interpreted either way, and that, to determine the legislative intent of the statute, it was therefore necessary to look beyond the plain meaning of the words used in the law. <em>Ravalli County v. Erickson, </em>2004 MT 35, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, 320 Mont. 31, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, 85 P.3d 772, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12. The court then utilized the statutory construction rule that requires that a statute be construed as a whole in a manner that would avoid an absurd result and give effect to the purpose of the statute. <em>Hiett v. Missoula County Public Schools, </em>2003 MT 213, \u00b6 32, 317 Mont. 95, \u00b6 32, 75 P.3d 341, \u00b6 32. The court reviewed other statutory provisions addressing the purchase of service credits and concluded that the Board\u2019s construction of the statute was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">\u00b615 It has long been the rule in Montana that statutes which on their face are plain and unambiguous, are subject to no additional construction. We recently stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-7\">The rules of statutory construction require the language of a statute to be construed according to its plain meaning. If the language is clear and unambiguous, no further interpretation is required. \u201cThis Court has repeatedly held that the role of courts in applying a statute has always been to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted ... [pursuant to] Section 1-2-101, MCA.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-4\">\u201c[T]he intent of the Legislature is controlling when construing a statute. The intention of the legislature must first be determined from the plain meaning of the words used, and if interpretation of the statute can beso determined, the courts may not <em>go </em>further and apply any other means of interpretation.\u201d If \u201cthe language of the statute is plain, unambiguous, direct and certain, the statute speaks for itself and there is nothing left for the court to construe.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ag7\"><em>Ravalli County, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-12 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\u00b616 The application of this rule to the definition of \u201cmembership services\u201d compels the result urged by Lewis. Section 19-3-104(22), MCA, is clear on its face. It plainly speaks for itself. \u201cMembership service\u201d is defined as service with respect to which contributions \u201care paid.\u201d It is not defined in terms of a service for which contributions \u201cought to be paid\u201d or \u201care required to be paid.\u201d As correctly noted by the hearing examiner, \u201c \u2018are\u2019 is not synonymous with \u2018are required to be,\u2019 and ... cannot be so construed. \u2018Are\u2019 clearly implies something that exists. \u2018Are required to be\u2019 implies a condition that must be met....\u201d The District Court and the Board erroneously inserted language that the legislature had not chosen to insert. Under the facts here and the statute as written, Lewis\u2019 service was not membership service. As a result, it was not creditable service.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">\u00b617  In summary, Lewis was an employee, not an independent contractor, Cascade County was a participating member of PERS, and Lewis\u2019 service was not creditable service. Under \u00a7 19-3-505, MCA (1979), Lewis is entitled to purchase service credits in the PERS.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar\">\u00b618 While we appreciate the Board\u2019s concern that today\u2019s ruling and interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 19-3-104(22) and 19-3-505(1), MCA (1979) may have unintended consequences, we note that the subject definitions underwent substantial changes in 1993, and thus may not remain subject to this interpretation. Moreover, should the legislature conclude that our interpretation or application of the statute is inconsistent with its intention, it is the charge and responsibility of that governmental body to write and revise the laws in a manner that clearly expresses its intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">\u00b619 The Board maintains that should this Court reverse the District Court\u2019s Order, a remand will be necessary to resolve outstanding issues. The Board takes issue with the hearing examiner\u2019s use of the 1979 statute, chosen as the representative statute in effect at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Lewis worked for Cascade County<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, as opposed to use of the 1983 statute, which was in effect at the time Lewis first requested permission to purchase service credit. However, the Board failed to raise this issue when challenging the hearing examiner\u2019s proposed order; therefore, it may not do so before this Court. <em>Hilands Golf Club v. Ashmore, </em>2002 MT 8, \u00b6 21, 308 Mont. 111, \u00b6 21, 39 P.3d 697, \u00b6 21. \u00b620 The Board also claims that the appropriate amount of service credit is unresolved. The Board asserts that to establish the appropriate amount of service to be credited, Lewis must submit \u201cnormal employer reports\u201d reflecting compensation and the specific number of hours worked. However, the hearing examiner concluded, and the Board did not dispute, that Lewis was a part-time employee of Cascade County. Moreover, Cascade County indicated to the Board that neither employment records nor an employment contract existed during Lewis\u2019 time as a Cascade County public defender. Despite the lack of such formal employment records, Cascade County was able to submit to the Board a list of twenty-nine monthly payments to Lewis, designated as \u201cMonthly Service\u201d and paid between November 22,1977, and March 25, 1980. The records also revealed the amount of money he was paid for each of those months. In addition to this payment list, Cascade County submitted affidavits of Howard Strause and Daniel Donovan, who were the Chief and Assistant Public Defenders during the time frame in question. Both Strause and Donovan worked with Lewis and confirmed his part-time employment status and the absence of employment records.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">\u00b621 Section 19-3-104(13), MCA (1979), provided that \"[a] member employed on a part-time basis shall receive credit for a year of service for each fiscal year during which such member was employed throughout the year and was engaged in his duties the full amount of time he was required by his employment to be so engaged.\u201d The statute did not require that the employee provide detailed employment records specifying the number of hours per week that were worked. It merely required that the employee worked the full amount of time he was required to do so. We conclude that the payment record submitted to the Board adequately show that Lewis is entitled to service credit for twenty-nine months.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">\u00b622 We agree with the Board that issues surrounding the cost of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>purchasing service credit for Lewis\u2019 employment with Cascade County have not been resolved. Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, we reverse the District Court\u2019s Order and remand to the Board for an assessment of the service purchase price based upon the Cascade County payment schedule previously submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">\u00b623 Were this issue resolvable without remanding to the Board, we would not subject Lewis to further administrative process. After all, his request has been pending since 1985. However, we are unfortunately left with no other option. Given that almost twenty years has gone by since Lewis first requested permission to purchase service credit, we strongly urge the Board to act expeditiously on this matter and provide a prompt and reasonable assessment to Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"AL\">\u00b624 Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b43-5\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, WARNER and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b38-11\"> There had been a question of whether Lewis was an employee or an independent contractor for Cascade County.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b42-6\"> The relevant statutes in effect in 1977,1978,1979 and 1980 were identical.
