(MasTec) and filed a Complaint in Montana\u2019s Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, against MasTec alleging violations of the Montana Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act (WDEA). The District Court granted MasTec\u2019s Motion to Dismiss on the grounds that Montana lacked subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate Burchett\u2019s claim and that Montana\u2019s WDEA did not apply. Burchett appeals. We reverse and remand to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it concluded that Montana\u2019s Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act did not apply to Burchett\u2019s claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err when it dismissed Burchett\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction?</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">\u00b65 Burchett was employed by C&amp;S Directional Boring from March 2000 to January 2001. C&amp;S Directional Boring is now a subsidiary of MasTec. MasTec is a Florida corporation, and the division of its business relevant to this appeal is operated out of Purcell, Oklahoma. MasTec lays fiber optic cable throughout the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-13\">\u00b66 Burchett was hired by telephone while working temporarily in Massachusetts. The employment contract was never reduced to writing. MasTec hired Burchett to work as a field mechanic, a job which required travel. During the time Burchett was employed by MasTec, he lived and worked in Purcell, Oklahoma, Red Bluff, California, and LaPorte, Indiana. At the time of his hiring, MasTec asked Burchett his state of residence and requested a copy of his driver\u2019s license. Burchett informed MasTec he was a Montana resident and produced a Montana driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-14\">\u00b67 While working in Indiana, Burchett had a dispute with his supervisor and was fired. Burchett filed a Complaint in the Thirteenth Judicial District Court against MasTec alleging violations of Montana\u2019s WDEA, Title 39, Chapter 2, Part 9, Montana Code Annotated. Specifically, Burchett alleges MasTec violated the WDEA by discharging him without cause after fulfilling his probationary period, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>and in retaliation for his refusal to violate public policy and reporting a public policy violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">\u00b68 MasTec filed a Motion to Dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The District Court granted the motion. Burchett appeals from the District Court\u2019s Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Pickens v. Shelton-Thompson, </em>2000 MT 131, \u00b6 7, 300 Mont. 16, \u00b6 7, 3 P.3d 603, \u00b6 7. However, a court\u2019s determination that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction is a conclusion of law which we review to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Pickens, </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">DISCUSSION ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">\u00b610 Did the District Court err when it concluded that Montana\u2019s Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act did not apply to Burchett\u2019s claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">\u00b611 In granting MasTec\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, the District Court concluded that Montana did not have a significant enough relationship with the case for a Montana court to have subject matter jurisdiction over the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">\u00b612 At issue in this case is an employment contract. In determining the choice of law rules for contract disputes, this Court adopted the approach contained in the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws (1971). <em>See Casarotto v. Lombardi </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 369, 373-74, 886 P.2d 931, 934, <em>cert. granted and vacated on other grounds sub nom. Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto </em>(1995), 515 U.S. 1129, 115 S.Ct. 2552, 132 L.Ed.2d 807, <em>and on remand sub nom. Casarotto v. Lombardi </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 3, 901 P.2d 596, <em>and cert. granted on other grounds sub nom. Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto </em>(1996), 516 U.S. 1036, 116 S.Ct. 690, 133 L.Ed.2d 594, <em>and rev\u2019d on other grounds Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto </em>(1996), 517 U.S. 681, 116 S.Ct. 1652, 134 L.Ed.2d 902. Our conflict of laws analysis begins with the general principles set forth in \u00a7 6 of the Restatement (Second), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-11\">Choice-of-law Principles</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-12\">(1) A court, subject to constitutional restrictions, will follow a statutory directive of its own state on choice of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-13\">(2) When there is no such directive, the factors relevant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>choice of the applicable rule of law include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-4\">(a) the needs of the interstate and international systems,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\">(b) the relevant policies of the forum,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">(c) the relevant policies of other interested states and the relative interests of those states in the determination of the particular issue,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-9\">(d) the protection of justified expectations,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-10\">(e) the basic policies underlying the particular field of law,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-11\">(f) certainty, predictability and uniformity of result, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-12\">(g) ease in the determination and application of the law to be applied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-14\">\u00b613 Applying the first paragraph of \u00a7 6, we look to \u00a7 28-3-102, MCA, Montana\u2019s statutory directive for choice of law. Section 28-3-102, MCA, provides that, \u201c[a] contract is to be interpreted according to the law and usage of the place where it is to be performed or, if it does not indicate a place of performance, according to the law and usage of the place where it is made.\u201d Under the unique facts of this case, however, \u00a7 28-3-102, MCA, is not instructive. At the time Burchett and MasTec entered into the employment contract, the parties did not know where it was to be performed; the work Burchett was hired to perform was transitory by nature. Furthermore, in this case it would be inappropriate to apply the law of the place where the contract was made. The contract was formed during a telephone conversation when Burchett was temporarily in Massachusetts and the representative of MasTec who hired him was in Oklahoma. The connections to Massachusetts and Oklahoma are far too tenuous to justify applying the laws of either state here.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-15\">\u00b614 We next turn to \u00a7 187 of the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws (1971), which gives us more specific guidance in this situation. \u201cWhen parties specify their choice of law in a contract, that choice will be effectuated subject to the limitations in section 187(2) ....\u201d <em>M + W Zander v. Scott Co. of California </em>(Or. Ct. App. 2003) 78 P.3d 118, 121. Section 187 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-16\">Law of the State Chosen by the Parties</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-17\">(1) The law of the state chosen by the parties to govern their contractual rights and duties will be applied if the particular issue is one which the parties could have resolved by an explicit provision in their agreement directed to that issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-18\">(2) The law of the state chosen by the parties to govern their contractual rights and duties will be applied, even if the particular issue is one which the parties could not have resolved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>by an explicit provision in their agreement directed to that issue, unless either</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-4\">(a) the chosen state has no substantial relationship to the parties or the transaction and there is no other reasonable basis for the parties\u2019 choice, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">(b) application of the law of the chosen state would be contrary to a fundamental policy of a state which has a materially greater interest than the chosen states in the determination of the particular issue and which, under the rule of \u00a7 188, would be the state of the applicable law in the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">(3) In the absence of a contrary indication of intention, the reference is to the local law of the state of the chosen law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">\u00b615 Burchett argues that with regard to \u00a7 187, the parties chose Montana law to govern their contract. Although the decision to apply Montana law was not stated expressly in the employment contract, the parties agreed that income taxes, unemployment insurance premiums, and wages were to be paid to Montana. This, Burchett asserts, constitutes an expression of the parties to have all of the contract provisions governed by Montana law. A Comment to \u00a7 187 explains that generally, when parties have chosen the state of the applicable law they will generally refer to it expressly in their contract. Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 187, cmt. a (1971). The Comment goes on to state that, \u201ceven when the contract does not refer to any state, the forum may nevertheless be able to conclude from its provisions that the parties did wish to have the law of a particular state applied.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 187, cmt. a (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">\u00b616  We agree with Burchett on this point. By agreeing to pay income taxes, unemployment insurance premiums, and wages to Montana, MasTec manifested its intent to be governed by Montana law. A contract provision may be broad enough to indicate the entire contract be governed by the laws of the state governing the particular provision. In <em>Maxwell Shapiro Woolen Co. v. Amerotron Corp. </em>(Mass. 1959), 158 N.E.2d 875, 878, the Massachusetts Supreme Court held that because a clause in a contract called for arbitration in one state, that state\u2019s laws applied for the entire contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">\u00b617 In <em>Dailey v. Transitron Electronic Corp. </em>(5th Cir. 1973), 475 F.2d 12, the Fifth Circuit addressed a factually similar situation. In that case, the employee resided in California when initially contacted by the employer regarding his employment. The employee was assigned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>to work in Mexico but maintained a residence in Texas. The written employment contract was signed in Mexico. The Fifth Circuit held that the parties manifested their intent to have the employment contract governed by Texas law rather than Mexican law. The court based its holding, in part, on the fact that the employee was paid with checks drawn on a United States bank, United States social security and withholding taxes were deducted from his paycheck, and the employer paid unemployment compensation taxes to Texas on his wages. <em>Dailey, </em>475 F.2d at 13-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">\u00b618  MasTec now argues that it mistakenly paid taxes to Montana and therefore did not show intent to be bound by the laws of Montana. We do not find MasTec\u2019s argument persuasive. In fact, short of stating it expressly in the contract, it is hard to imagine what more MasTec could have done to demonstrate its intent to avail itself to the laws of Montana. We conclude that there is sufficient evidence to find that Burchett and MasTec chose for their contract to be governed by Montana law pursuant to \u00a7 187(1) of the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\u00b619 Even absent our finding that the parties intended Montana law to govern their contract, we would still find Montana law governs this case under \u00a7 188 of the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws (1971). Under \u00a7 188, the local law of the state which has the most significant relationship to the transaction under the principles stated in \u00a7 6 applies to questions of contract interpretation absent an effective choice of law by the parties. <em>Commercial Ins. Co. v. Pacific-Peru Const. Corp. </em>(9Th Cir. 1977), 558 F.2d 948, 952. Section 188 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">Law Governing in Absence of Effective Choice by the Parties</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">(1) The rights and duties of the parties with respect to an issue in contract are determined by the local law of the state which, with respect to that issue, has the most significant relationship to the transaction and the parties under the principles stated in \u00a7 6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">(2) In the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties (see \u00a7 187), the contacts to be taken into account in applying the principles of \u00a7 6 to determine the law applicable to an issue include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">(a) the place of contracting,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-10\">(b) the place of negotiation of the contract,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-11\">(c) the place of performance,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-12\">(d) the location of the subject matter of the contract, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-13\">(e) the domicil, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>These contacts are to be evaluated according to their relative importance with respect to the particular issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-4\">(3) If the place of negotiating the contract and the place of performance are in the same state, the local law of this state will usually be applied, except as otherwise provided in \u00a7\u00a7 189-199 and 203.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u00b620 Section 188 instructs us to evaluate its factors according to their relevance. As we have already discussed, the factors enumerated in subsections (a) and (b) of \u00a7 188(2), the place of contracting and the place of negotiation of the contract, bear little significance in this case. Subsection (c), the place of performance, is also of little importance here, as the parties did not know at the time of contracting where Burchett would be assigned to work and due to the transitory nature of his work. Subsection (d), the location of the subject matter of the contract, is of little importance here for the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\u00b621 The only factor enumerated in \u00a7 188(2) that has significance in this case is found in subsection (e), the domicil, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the parties. MasTec\u2019s place of incorporation and places of business are relatively unimportant here, as they have little to do with the facts surrounding the controversy. Likewise, nationality is not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">\u00b622 What is significant in this case is the domicile and residence of Burchett. Burchett claims Montana residency, a contention MasTec rejects. With regard to residency, Montana law provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-8\">Every person has, in law, a residence. In determining the place of residence, the following rules are to be observed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-9\">(1) It is the place where a person remains when not called elsewhere for labor or other special or temporary pin-pose and to which the person returns in seasons of repose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-10\">(2) There may only be one residence. If a person claims a residence within Montana for any purpose, then that location is the person\u2019s residence for all purposes unless there is a specific statutory exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-11\">(3) A residence cannot be lost until another is gained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-12\">(6) The residence can be changed only by the union of act and intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">Section 1-1-215, MCA. Burchett contends that he rented a house in Montana during his entire term of employment with MasTec and kept his possessions at the house; that he has never declared his residence to be other than Montana; that he votes in Montana and obtains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Montana resident hunting and fishing licenses; and that he has always intended to return to his home here. Burchett further contends that MasTec itself placed importance on his Montana residence by asking him to declare his state residency on his job application. MasTec apparently maintains a photocopy of Burchett\u2019s Montana driver\u2019s license in his personnel file. Burchett concludes that based on his Montana residency, under \u00a7 188 we should apply Montana law to his contract dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">\u00b623 MasTec adamantly disputes Burchett\u2019s status as a Montana resident. It claims that the Montana address Burchett first identified was merely a post office box, and that the street address he later provided was to his parents\u2019 home in Huntley. When he was discharged while working in Indiana, Burchett and his wife lived in a fifth wheel trailer which was parked at an RV park. From 1996 until he was discharged by MasTec in 2001, Burchett traveled with his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\u00b624  Notwithstanding MasTec\u2019s argument, we conclude that under \u00a7 1-1-215, MCA, Burchett is a Montana resident. The fact that he traveled with his employment to other states does not defeat his Montana residency. Burchett presented ample evidence that he intended to return to Montana, and did not establish a domicile in any other state. Taking into consideration Burchett\u2019s Montana domicile, and the inapplicability of the other factors enumerated in \u00a7 188(2) to the particular facts of this case, we conclude that Montana is the proper forum in which to adjudicate this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\u00b625 We now return to the remaining general principles set forth in \u00a7 6. Subsection (2) (a) of \u00a7 6 requires us to consider the need of the interstate and international systems. One of the Comments to \u00a7 6 instructs us that choice of law should facilitate harmonious relations between the states to further the interests of commerce between them. Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 6, cmt. d. As Burchett states, it does not foster commerce or harmonious relations if after collecting income taxes and unemployment insurance premiums, Montana refuses Burchett\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">\u00b626  Subsections (b) and (c) direct us to consider the relevant policies of the forum and the relevant policies of other interested states in the determination of the particular issue. MasTec argues that because Montana\u2019s WDEA does not have an explicit textual extraterritorial provision, Montana law should not apply. MasTec argues further that Indiana has a greater interest in Burchett\u2019s claims. However, the Comments to \u00a7 6 address this very situation. Comment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>e states, \u201c[e]very rule of law ... was designed to achieve one or more purposes .... If the purposes sought to be achieved by local statute or common law rule would be furthered by its application to out-of-state facts, this is a weighty reason why such application should be made.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 6, cmt. e. We conclude it would be appropriate to apply Montana\u2019s WDEA to this case, regardless of the fact that it does not expressly provide for extraterritorial application.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">\u00b627 Subsection (d), the protection of justified expectations, also weighs in favor of applying Montana law. As we have stated numerous times, at the time Burchett was hired, both he and MasTec knew his employment would be transitory. In his application, Burchett informed MasTec he was a Montanan, and MasTec paid incomes taxes, unemployment insurance premiums, and wages to Montana. Burchett is justified in relying on Montana law to hear his claims against MasTec.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\u00b628 Subsection (e) requires us to address the basic policies underlying the particular field of law. The applicable Comment to this subsection states, \u201c[i]n such instances, there is good reason for the court to apply the local law of that state which will best achieve the basic policy, or policies, underlying the particular field of law involved.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 6, cmt. h. Montana and Indiana, the state whose law MasTec argues is applicable, have different laws governing employment contracts. As we have already discussed, the Montana Code Annotated contains the WDEA. Indiana, on the other hand, is an at-will employment state. <em>See Bee Window, Inc. v. Turman </em>(1999), 716 N.E.2d 498, 500. Montana law affords better protection to employers and employees, and thus we conclude that Montana law better achieves the basic policy underlying employment law.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\u00b629 Subsection (f), certainty, predictability and uniformity of result, also weighs in favor of the application of Montana law. The applicable Comment explains that, \u201c[p]redictability and uniformity of result are of particular importance in areas where parties are likely to give advance thought to the legal consequences of their transactions.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 6, cmt. i. As we have already concluded, the parties manifested their intent for the employment contract to be governed by Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\u00b630 Finally, we find that subsection (g), ease in the determination and application of the law to be applied, also weighs in favor of applying Montana law. The Comment on this subsection states that, \u201c[i]deally, choice of law rules should be simple and easy to apply. This policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>should not be overemphasized, since it is obviously of greater importance that choice of law rules lead to desirable results.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 6, cmt. j. Once again, there is evidence that the parties contemplated the application of Montana law at the time they entered into their contract, thus applying Montana law to their conflict is a simple and easy result.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\">\u00b631  In conclusion we hold that under the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws (1971), Montana law should be applied to this case. We reach the same result whether analyzing the situation under \u00a7 187, which applies when the parties demonstrate intent to be governed by the law of a particular state, or under \u00a7 188, which applies when they do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u00b632 Did the District Court err when it dismissed Burchett\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction?</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u00b633  In dismissing Burchett\u2019s complaint, the District Court reasoned that the WDEA does not provide for extraterritorial application and, therefore, the District Court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over Burchett\u2019s claims. However, given our holding on Issue One, it naturally follows that Montana courts have subject matter jurisdiction in a case involving a Montana resident when Montana law applies. We conclude that Burchett\u2019s Complaint should not have been dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">\u00b634 Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b127-8\">JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"ANu\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"Aqd\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">\u00b635 I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s opinion. I cannot agree with the Court\u2019s extraordinary decision to address a secondary issue involving a choice of law and conflict of law issue prior to resolving the threshold issue of whether the District Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Burchett\u2019s wrongful discharge claim. Nor can I agree that the conflict of law analysis provides an appropriate basis for determining subject matter jurisdiction. A trial court cannot perform a conflict of law analysis unless and until it has subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">\u00b636 Simply stated, the Court\u2019s opinion puts the cart before the horse. \u201c[W]here the action is transitory, a right arising under, or a liability imposed by, either the common law or statute of a state may be asserted and enforced in any court <em>having jurisdiction of the subject matter </em>and of the parties ....\u201d 16 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Conflict of Laws </em>\u00a7 9 (1998) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>(emphasis added). The District Court determined, as a threshold matter, that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. I would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">\u00b637 Subject matter jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear and adjudicate the claim brought before it. <em>In re B.F., </em>2004 MT 61, \u00b6 18, 320 Mont. 261, \u00b6 18, 87 P.3d 427, \u00b6 18. In other words, a court is without authority to act absent subject matter jurisdiction. Subject matter jurisdiction may be conferred by statute. <em>See, e.g., In re B.F., </em>\u00b6 19. Here, Burchett\u2019s complaint against MasTec alleged violation of the WDEA. The WDEA provides the exclusive remedy in Montana for wrongftd discharge from employment. Section 39-2-902, MCA. However, the WDEA does not apply to a discharge which \u201cis subject to any other state or federal statute that provides a procedure or remedy for contesting the dispute.\u201d Section 39-2-912(1), MCA. Thus, while a Montana district court generally has subject matter jurisdiction over wrongful discharge claims pursuant to the WDEA, it does not have subject matter jurisdiction over a wrongful discharge claim where other state or federal legislation provides a procedure for resolving the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\u00b638 In its order granting MasTec\u2019s motion to dismiss, the District Court found that Indiana has legislated on the subject of employment and the discharge therefrom. On that basis, the court concluded that \u00a7 39-2-912(1), MCA, precluded extraterritorial application of the WDEA to Burchett\u2019s claim that he was wrongfully discharged in Indiana. In other words, the District Court concluded that it had no power pursuant to the WDEA to hear and adjudicate Burchett\u2019s claim-it had no subject matter jurisdiction. I would conclude that Burchett has not established on appeal that the District Court\u2019s finding that Indiana has legislated on the subject of employment and discharge therefrom is clearly erroneous. Consequently, I would further conclude that the court\u2019s determination-based on that finding-that it had no power pursuant to \u00a7 39-2-912(1), MCA, to hear and adjudicate Burchett\u2019s claim under the WDEA is correct. As a result, I would affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of MasTec\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. I dissent from the Court\u2019s failure to do so.</p>\n<judges id=\"b128-6\">JUSTICE NELSON joins in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
