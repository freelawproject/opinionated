He appeals from the court\u2019s sentencing order requiring him to pay restitution. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao2\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court erred when it ordered Mclntire to pay restitution on two counts of misdemeanor forgery when those charges had been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-12\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred when it ordered Mclntire to pay restitution as a condition of his suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-13\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b521-14\">\u00b65 On January 9, 2003, the Cascade County Attorney filed an Information charging Mclntire with one count of felony burglary, one count of misdemeanor theft, and two counts of misdemeanor forgery. In the affidavit supporting the State\u2019s motion for leave to file the Information, the investigating officer stated that Mclntire\u2019s neighbor died on November 3, 2002, and that Mclntire admitted entering her apartment shortly after her death and removing her computer. The officer also stated that Mclntire admitted forging two of his deceased neighbor\u2019s checks, making them payable to himself in the amounts of $200 and $250. Those checks were cashed on November 14 and 15, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">\u00b66 Mclntire entered into a plea agreement with the Cascade County Attorney on May 7, 2003. In the plea agreement, Mclntire agreed to plead guilty to the charge of burglary and the county attorney agreed to dismiss the misdemeanor theft and forgery charges. The county attorney also agreed to recommend to the court that Mclntire be sentenced to a three-year suspended sentence. The plea agreement specified that the county attorney may recommend restitution to any victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\u00b67 On May 27, 2003, the District Court accepted Mclntire\u2019s <em>Alford </em>plea after receiving the testimony of the investigating officer and finding a sufficient factual basis for the burglary charge. <em>See North Carolina v. Alford </em>(1970), 400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162. The court conducted a sentencing hearing on June 24, 2003, wherein the matter of restitution was discussed at length. Defense counsel argued at the hearing that because the forgery charges were dismissed as part of the plea agreement, Mclntire could not be required to pay restitution for the checks. Defense counsel also argued that there was no \u201cvictim\u201d with respect to the dismissed forgery charges, thus the court lacked specific statutory authority to impose restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">\u00b68 The prosecutor argued, on the other hand, that the restitution order was appropriate because Mclntire removed the checks from the victim\u2019s apartment during the burglary and that forging the checks was part of the same transaction as the burglary. The prosecutor also argued that there was a victim to the forgery-the estate of Mclntire\u2019s neighbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">\u00b69 The District Court determined that the burglary and the forgery of the stolen checks were a continuing transaction, hence the court ordered Mclntire to pay restitution in the amount of $450. Mclntire appeals the District Court\u2019s restitution order.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Issue 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">\u00b610 <em>Whether the District Court erred when it ordered Mclntire to pay restitution on two counts of misdemeanor forgery when those charges had been dismissed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">\u00b611 Mclntire argues on appeal that the court exceeded its statutory authority by requiring him to pay restitution for offenses for which he was not convicted and which he did not admit to committing. Mclntire also argues that because the forgery charges were dismissed, there was no \u201cvictim of the offense\u201d as required by \u00a7 46-18-201(5), MCA (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"AifT\">\u00b612 The State argues that the District Court did have statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>authority to order Mclntire to pay restitution for funds he received as a direct result of the burglary charge to which he pled guilty. The State maintains that the burglary was sufficiently connected to forging the checks to amount to a continuous criminal transaction and that dismissal of the forgery charges as part of the plea agreement did not deprive the District Court of authority to impose a restitution obligation upon Mclntire.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">\u00b613 This Court reviews criminal sentences for legality only, and our inquiry is limited to determining whether the sentence is within the parameters provided by statute. <em>State v. McLeod, </em>2002 MT 348, \u00b6 12, 313 Mont. 358, \u00b6 12, 61 P.3d 126, \u00b6 12. A district court\u2019s authority to impose a sentence is defined and constrained by statute, and the court has no power to impose a sentence in the absence of specific statutory authority. <em>State v. Horton, </em>2001 MT 100, \u00b6 24, 305 Mont. 242, \u00b6 24, 25 P.3d 886, \u00b6 24 (citing <em>State v. Nelson, </em>1998 MT 227, \u00b6 24, 291 Mont. 15, \u00b6 24, 966 P.2d 133, \u00b6 24; <em>State v. Hatfield </em>(1993), 256 Mont. 340, 346, 846 P.2d 1025, 1029).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">\u00b614 Section 46-18-201(5), MCA (2001), provides, in pertinent part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">if the sentencing judge finds that the victim of the offense has sustained a pecuniary loss, the sentencing judge shall require payment of full restitution to the victim as provided in 46-18-241 through 46-18-249.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">The term \u201cvictim\u201d is defined as \u201ca person who suffers loss of property, bodily injury, or death as a result of the commission of an offense\u201d and includes \u201cthe estate of a deceased or incapacitated victim.\u201d Section 46-18-243(2)(a), MCA (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">\u00b615 In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Mclntire does not dispute that his deceased neighbor (and thus her estate) suffered a loss of property as a result of the commission of an offense. Instead, Mclntire maintains that the loss was suffered as a result of the commission of forgery, an offense to which he did not plead guilty, rather than burglary, the offense for which he was sentenced. Mclntire argues that since the forgery charges were dismissed, there was no crime to support the order of restitution. For this proposition, Mclntire relies on this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Horton </em>and <em>State v. Setters, </em>2001 MT 101, 305 Mont. 253, 25 P.3d 893. However, both <em>Horton </em>and <em>Setters </em>are distinguishable from the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">\u00b616 In <em>Horton, </em>this Court held that a defendant who pled guilty to felony DUI as part of a plea agreement in which a separate charge of felony nonsupport was dismissed, could not be ordered to pay child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>support arrearages as restitution since there was no \u201cvictim\u201d of the crime to which he pled guilty and there was no connection between the DUI charge and the child support. <em>Horton, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 27-28. In <em>Setters, </em>decided the same day as <em>Horton, </em>we reversed another restitution order, where the defendant pled guilty to tampering with public records, since the restitution pertained only to an unrelated theft charge which had been dismissed pursuant to a plea agreement. <em>Setters, </em>\u00b6 25. We applied the <em>Horton </em>analysis in <em>Setters </em>and concluded that the district court lacked statutory authority to order restitution in connection with an unrelated and dismissed charge. <em>Setters, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">\u00b617  Nevertheless, both <em>Horton </em>and <em>Setters </em>involved the propriety of restitution orders based upon dismissed charges wholly unrelated to the charges to which the defendants pled guilty. Contrary to Mclntire\u2019s assertions, the dismissed charges in the present case are directly related to the burglary charge to which he pled guilty. The victim of the burglary is the same as the victim of the forgeries and the loss of the victim\u2019s property resulted directly from the burglary and Mclntire\u2019s subsequent acts with the stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">\u00b618  In addition, we acknowledged in <em>Horton </em>and <em>Setters </em>that \u00a7 46-18-202(l)(e), MCA (renumbered in 1999 as \u00a7 46-18-202(l)(f), MCA), permits a sentencing court to impose any reasonable restriction or condition upon a sentence, including any restriction or condition considered necessary for rehabilitation of the defendant or for the protection of the victim or society. However, we noted in both <em>Horton </em>and <em>Setters, </em>that our previous interpretation of that statutory provision required the restriction or condition to have some correlation or connection to the underlying offense for which the defendant is being sentenced. <em>Horton, </em>\u00b6 28; <em>Setters, </em>\u00b6 27 (citing <em>State v. Ommundson, </em>1999 MT 16, \u00b6 11, 293 Mont. 133, \u00b6 11, 974 P.2d 620, \u00b6 11). We held that such a connection did not exist in either <em>Horton </em>or <em>Setters, </em>thus the sentencing courts in those cases were without authority to impose restitution. Here, however, there is a direct connection and correlation between the burglary and the pecuniary loss to the victim. Hence, \u00a7 46-18-202(l)(f), MCA, authorizes the restitution order as reasonably necessary for Mclntire\u2019s rehabilitation and for the protection of society.</p>\n<p id=\"Acq\">\u00b619  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did have the statutory authority to order Mclntire to pay restitution for the checks stolen from the victim during the burglary and the subsequent forgery of those checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">\u00b620 <em>Whether the District Court erred when it ordered Mclntire to pay restitution as a condition of his suspended sentence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\u00b621 Mclntire argues on appeal that the District Court was without statutory authority to order restitution because restitution may only be ordered when a defendant receives a deferred sentence. Relying on a footnote in <em>Horton, </em>Mclntire contends that \u00a7 46-18-201, MCA (2001), restricts restitution orders to cases involving deferred impositions of sentence and that a district court is without statutory authority to impose payment of restitution as a condition of a suspended sentence. <em>See Horton, </em>\u00b6 28 n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">\u00b622 Mclntire\u2019s claim is based upon an apparent codification error arising from the 1999 Montana Legislature\u2019s amendments to \u00a7 46-18-201, MCA, the general sentencing statute. The 1999 amendments reorganized and renumbered the provisions concerning the sentencing judge\u2019s dispositional options. Provisions concerning suspended sentences, which had previously been contained in subsection (1) along with the provisions concerning deferred sentences, were removed from subsection (1) and placed in a separate section. The subsection on restitution, which was renumbered as subsection (5), was not changed to reflect the reorganization of the statute. Thus, because of this error, it appeared that a district court could require restitution only in cases involving deferred imposition of sentence and not in cases involving suspended execution of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">\u00b623 We recently discussed this issue at length in <em>State v. Heath, </em>2004 MT 126, 321 Mont. 280, 90 P.3d 426, wherein we compared the various statutes pertaining to restitution and examined the legislative history of \u00a7 46-18-201, MCA (1999). We concluded in <em>Heath </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">the reference made in subsection (5) of \u00a7 46-18-201, MCA (1999), to \u201cthe penalties imposed pursuant to <em>subsection (1)\u201d </em>was a simple codification error which was not intended to make any change in the substance or effect of the statute. The re-codification of the statute... resulted in a cross reference error which was completely inconsistent with clear legislative intent. We further conclude that it was the Legislature\u2019s full intention that subsection (5) cross-refer, not to subsection (1), but to subsection (4), which contains all of the penalties and conditions which may be imposed for both deferred impositions of sentences and for suspensions of sentences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-9\"><em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 36 (emphasis in original). Based on these conclusions, we stated in <em>Heath </em>that we would \u201cnot permit legislative intent to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>thwarted, and the whole of the judiciary\u2019s sentencing authority to be undermined, by a mere scrivener\u2019s error.\u201d <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">\u00b624  Consequently, we held in <em>Heath </em>that the 1999 amendments to \u00a7 46-18-201, MCA, do not limit a court\u2019s authority to impose restitution to cases in which sentencing has been deferred. Rather, restitution is a sentencing option whenever the sentencing court considers it necessary for rehabilitation or for the protection of the victim or society, and there is an appropriate correlation to the offense committed. <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">\u00b625 Having already found that such a correlation does exist in this case, we hold that the District Court did not err in ordering Mclntire to pay restitution as a condition of his suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">\u00b626 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b526-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, REGNIER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
