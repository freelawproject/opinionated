We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">\u00b62 Did the Pennsylvania court appropriately assume jurisdiction over the custody and parenting issues related to A.B.A.M., and was it proper for the Montana District Court to refuse to relinquish jurisdiction once the Pennsylvania court had assumed jurisdiction over the matter?</p>\n<p id=\"b432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A4_\">\u00b63 A.B.A.M. was born in Missoula, Montana, in February 1999. At the time of her birth, her mother C.M. and her father B.A. were both students at the University of Montana. C.M. and B.A. had lived together for about six months, but separated shortly after A.B.A.M.\u2019s birth. On October 18, 1999, C.M. and B.A. filed a Petition For Parenting Plan in the Fourth Judicial District Court in Missoula. The District Court approved the Parenting Plan on March 31, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">\u00b64 Later that year, C.M. relocated to her grandparents\u2019 residence near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She andB.A. negotiated an Amended Interim Parenting Plan which was approved by the Montana District Court on December 14,2000. Under that Amended Plan, C.M. and B.A. agreed to share joint custody of A.B.A.M. with C.M. as the residential parent. At the time, B.A. was attending college. This Amended Plan was to remain in effect only until his anticipated graduation in June 2003. B.A. graduated sooner than expected, and he and C.M. began to negotiate anew Parenting Plan in December 2002. With the assistance of a mediator, C.M. and B.A. met for a settlement conference in February 2003, and reached an agreement for a new Parenting Plan (the Parenting Plan), which was approved by the Montana District Court on April 18, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">\u00b65 Shortly after the settlement conference, B.A. sent C.M. a letter informing her that he planned to move to Seattle, Washington. B.A. provided C.M. with a temporary address and telephone number. In May 2003, A.B.A.M. received a letter from B.A., sent from Seattle, in which he included a message to C.M. stating that the Seattle address on the envelope was his current mailing address.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">\u00b66 According to the terms of the Parenting Plan, A.B.A.M. would visit B.A. and her paternal grandparents in Montana in August 2003. In July 2003, after a conversation with A.B.A.M. and a medical exam, C.M. came to believe that A.B.A.M. had been abused during a previous overnight visit with B.A. C.M. accordingly filed a Motion to Modify Custody and Emergency Request for Expedited Ex Parte Relief in the Court of Common Pleas of the Seventeenth Judicial District of Pennsylvania, Snyder County Branch. She requested that B.A.\u2019s visitation with A.B.A.M. be suspended pending a psychological evaluation and the implementation of measures to ensure A.B.A.M.\u2019s safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">\u00b67 On August 8, 2003, the Pennsylvania Court issued an Order suspending the upcoming scheduled visitation between A.B.A.M., and B.A. and his parents. The Pennsylvania Court further scheduled a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>hearing for September 4, 2003. On August 17, 2003, B.A. returned to Missoula from Seattle. Two days later, he filed a Motion to declare C.M. in contempt of court, and Motion for a Determination of Jurisdiction, in the Fourth Judicial District Court in Missoula.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">\u00b68 The Pennsylvania Court conducted its hearing on September 4, 2003, as scheduled. B.A. did not appear in person or through counsel. C.M. argued to the Pennsylvania Court that Montana no longer had jurisdiction over the case because B.A. had changed his residency to Washington. She presented evidence that he had written her a letter saying he was moving to Seattle and later wrote a letter to A.B.A.M. from Seattle; that he had a Seattle telephone number, transferred from his Montana National Guard unit to a unit in the Seattle area; transferred the child support enforcement order to Washington; and changed his automobile registration and driver\u2019s license to Washington. She further testified that she had found an advertisement that B.A. placed on the Internet looking for shared housing in Seattle to begin in September 2003, after he returned from a \u201cvacation.\u201d The dates in the advertisement coincided with the dates of A.B.A.M.\u2019s planned visit to Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">\u00b69 The Montana District Court held a hearing on B.A.\u2019s Motion to declare C.M. in Contempt of Court on September 11,2003. B.A., B.A.\u2019s counsel, and counsel for C.M. appeared. B.A. argued that the Montana District Court should retain jurisdiction and requested that it order C.M. to bring A.B.A.M. to Montana for visitation. B.A. testified that he had moved to Washington \u201ctemporarily\u201d following the February 2003 settlement conference, and that while there he made his living delivering pizza. He testified that he licensed and registered his car in Washington, obtained a Washington driver\u2019s license, and that he was living in Seattle as of May 2003 when he wrote a letter to A.B.A.M. He further testified that he had posted an ad on August 7, 2003, in Seattle, which read, in part, \u201cMy cat and I are looking for a room FAST.... I need the room by Sept. 1, but I am leaving on vacation ... and won\u2019t be back until the end of the month.\u201d He testified that at the time he placed the ad on August 7, he did not intend to leave Seattle, but planned to continue residing there after A.B.A.M.\u2019s August visitation in Missoula. B.A. admitted that it was not until after the August visitation failed to occur that he decided to move back to Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">\u00b610 B.A. further testified that he was currently living in Missoula and had been employed by a temporary agency for about a month, but expected to be permanently hired into the position he held. He stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>that he was still using his Washington cellular phone number.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">\u00b611 On December 17, 2003, the Montana District Court and the Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas held a telephonic hearing concerning the issue of which state properly had jurisdiction over the case. Although the Pennsylvania Court concluded that it had jurisdiction over the case in its entirety, the Montana District Court disagreed and issued an Order in which it agreed to cede temporary emergency jurisdiction to Pennsylvania, but refused to relinquish jurisdiction of the case. From the Montana District Court\u2019s refusal to relinquish jurisdiction, C.M. timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">\u00b612 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine if the findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Vannatta v. Boulds, </em>2003 MT 343, \u00b6 7, 318 Mont. 472, \u00b6 7, 81 P.3d 480, \u00b6 7. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Vannatta, </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">\u00b613 Did the Pennsylvania court appropriately assume jurisdiction over the custody and parenting issues related to A.B.A.M., and was it proper for the Montana District Court to refuse to relinquish jurisdiction once the Pennsylvania court had assumed jurisdiction over the matter?</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">\u00b614 The Parental Kidnaping Prevention Act (PKPA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A, and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act(UCCJEA), \u00a7\u00a7 40-7-101, <em>et. seq., </em>MCA (1999), govern our resolution of this case. C.M. argues that, while the Montana District Court correctly held that jurisdictional issues in this matter had to be determined under Montana law, it erred when it found that B.A. had not become a resident of the State of Washington prior to the commencement of the proceedings. C.M. argues that, under the PKPA and UCCJEA (as codified in Montana), the Pennsylvania Court acted within its proper authority to assume jurisdiction, and that the Montana District Court has improperly refused to relinquish jurisdiction to Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">\u00b615 B.A. responds that \u201cthe necessary events to shift jurisdiction from Montana to another state have not occurred.\u201d He argues that the most significant factor in determining the jurisdictional issue is the fact that he remains a Montana resident, and that he never had the requisite intent to change his residency to Washington. Thus, he argues, since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>A.B.A.M. has a parent currently residing in Montana, and since Montana has been the jurisdiction in which child custody determinations involving A.B.A.M. have been made since her birth, there is no basis upon which Montana should relinquish jurisdiction. \u00b616 Relying on \u00a7 40-7-202(l)(b), MCA, a provision of the UCCJEA as adopted in Montana, B.A. asserts that a Montana court has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction over a child custody determination until \u201ca court of this state or a court of another state determines that neither the child, a parent, nor any person acting as a parent presently resides in this state.\u201d Thus, he concludes, since he remains a Montana resident, it would be improper for Pennsylvania to assume jurisdiction over the matter. B.A. further argues that C.M. should not have brought the jurisdictional issue before the Pennsylvania Court, but rather should have sought a determination of proper jurisdiction in a Montana District Court, noting that under \u00a7 40-7-107, MCA, a court may not exercise its jurisdiction if at the time of commencement of the proceeding, a custody proceeding had been previously commenced in a court of another state having jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">\u00b617 C.M. replies that the issue of whether the Pennsylvania Court properly assumed jurisdiction of this matter is dispositive. C.M. argues that Pennsylvania acted in accordance with the UCCJEA, and specifically \u00a7 40-7-202(l)(b), MCA, when it - as a \u201ccourt of another state\u201d - determined that neither the child nor either of the child\u2019s parents presently resided in Montana. She further argues that B.A.\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 40-7-107, MCA, is misplaced, because the proceeding commenced in the Montana District Court on August 19, 2003, was commenced after the Pennsylvania Court had already assumed jurisdiction, and in the absence of a termination of the proceedings in Pennsylvania. Thus, C.M. concludes, the Montana District Court erred when it then refused to relinquish its jurisdiction in the matter, since a court of another state had already made a determination, in accordance with Montana law, that B.A. did not reside in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"AIK\">\u00b618 The record reflects that proceedings commenced in Pennsylvania on August 8, 2003. It is undisputed that on that date, B.A. was to be found in Seattle, Washington, with a Washington driver\u2019s license and vehicle registration, and a Seattle mailing address and phone number. In addition, he had transferred his child support payments and his National Guard membership to the Seattle area, and had placed an advertisement the day before the Pennsylvania hearing seeking housing in Seattle. B.A. returned to Montana nine days later, on August 17, 2003. When the Pennsylvania Court conducted further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>hearings on this matter on September 4,2003, B.A. did not appear and did not contest the Pennsylvania Court\u2019s conclusion that he had given up his Montana residency. B.A. has not appealed the Pennsylvania Court\u2019s decision, but rather has chosen to attack it collaterally here.</p>\n<p id=\"AfF\">\u00b619 In its Order of December 18, 2003, the Montana District Court found that B.A. moved back to Montana on August 17,2003, and that B.A. had not established a new residence in Washington. In reaching its decision, the Montana District Court relied upon \u00a7 1-1-215(6), MCA, which mandates that one may change residency \u201conly by the union of act and intent.\u201d Thus, although it agreed to cede temporary emergency jurisdiction to Pennsylvania, the Montana District Court refused to relinquish jurisdiction of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">\u00b620 The difficulty with the December 2003 Order from the Montana District Court lies in the fact that the District Court\u2019s findings contradict findings previously made by the Pennsylvania Court pursuant to the UCCJEA as codified in Montana, and the PKPA. The PKPA established national standards under which jurisdictions could determine whether they had jurisdiction and what effect to give the decisions by courts of other jurisdictions. <em>Erler v. Erler, </em>261 Mont. 65, 69, 862 P.2d 12, 15. As we explained in <em>In re Marriage of Shape, </em>276 Mont. 409, 415, 916 P.2d 744, 747,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">The PKPA generally requires the courts of a state to enforce - and decline to modify - child custody determinations made by the courts of other states. <em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(a). </em>A specific exception to the general rule authorizes a court to modify a child custody determination made by a court in another state when two requirements are satisfied: (1) the court has jurisdiction to make a child custody determination; and (2) the court of the other state no longer has jurisdiction or has declined to exercise jurisdiction. <em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(f).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">\u00b621  It is undisputed that, when the Pennsylvania proceedings were initiated on August 8, 2003, A.B.A.M. and C.M. resided in Pennsylvania and B.A. had moved to Seattle and intended to remain there. Because \u00a7 40-7-202(l)(b) allows either a court of this state or a court of another state to determine that neither the child nor any of the parents reside in the original state, the Pennsylvania Court had authority under our Montana statutes to make this determination. Our review of the record further indicates that the Pennsylvania Court had ample evidence before it to support such a determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">\u00b622 C.M. further directs our attention to the Commissioners\u2019 Note, Number 2, to \u00a7 40-7-202, MCA. The Commissioners\u2019 Notes explain that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>states must give full faith and credit to custody determinations made by the original decree State-in this case, Montana-unless one of two situations occurs, the second of which is,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-4\">Continuing jurisdiction is lost when the child, the child\u2019s parents, and any person acting as a parent no longer reside in the original decree State.... It is the intention of this Act... that... subsection (l)(b) ... means that the named persons no longer continue to actually live within the State. Thus, unless a modification proceeding has been commenced, when the child, the parents, and all persons acting as parents physically leave the State to live elsewhere, the exclusive, continuing jurisdiction ceases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">The phrase \u2018do not presently reside\u2019 is not used in the sense of a technical domicile. The fact that the original determination State still considers one parent a domiciliary does not prevent it from losing exclusive, continuing jurisdiction after the child, the parents, and all persons acting as parents have moved from the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">If the child, the parents, and all persons acting as parents have all left the State which made the custody determination prior to the commencement of the modification proceeding, considerations of waste of resources dictate that a court in State B, as well as a court in State A, can decide that State A has lost exclusive, continuing jurisdiction... .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">Jurisdiction attaches at the commencement of a proceeding.... Exclusive, continuing jurisdiction is not reestablished if, after the child, the parents, and all persons acting as parents leave the State, the non-custodial parent returns.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">\u00b623 In <em>Vannatta, </em>we examined a situation in which one parent remained in the child\u2019s birth state of North Dakota, while the other parent relocated to Montana. The Montana parent attempted to commence a custody proceeding here at a time when the child also resided in North Dakota with the other parent. <em>Vannatta, </em>\u00b6 3. We held that, because the child and one parent remained residents of a state which had already exercised jurisdiction in a related custody matter, the Montana District Court did not gain jurisdiction in the absence of a determination by a North Dakota court that it no longer has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction, or that a Montana court would be a more convenient forum. <em>Vannatta, </em>\u00b6 13. However, we further noted that, if either the Montana or the North Dakota court were to determine that neither the child nor either parent resided in North Dakota, this would also allow Montana to assume jurisdiction in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>matter. <em>Vannatta, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">\u00b624  In the current case, we are faced with that situation. At the beginning of this proceeding, B.A. was to be found in Seattle, Washington, and C.M. and A.B.A.M. resided in Pennsylvania. Thus, at that time, Pennsylvania could make a determination, pursuant to \u00a7 40-7-202(l)(b), MCA, that neither A.B.A.M., C.M., nor B.A. \u201cpresently\u201d resided within Montana on the day the proceeding commenced. Once this determination was made in Pennsylvania-on the basis of ample, credible and essentially undisputed testimony-the Montana District Court no longer had exclusive, continuing jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\u00b625  Thus, we conclude that the Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas appropriately assumed jurisdiction over this case pursuant to its application of \u00a7 40-7-202(l)(b), MCA, and in accordance with the PKPA, and we further conclude that the Montana District Court erred in its determination that it retained jurisdiction in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">\u00b626 For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the Order of the Montana District Court in which it refused to relinquish jurisdiction to the Court of Common Pleas of the Seventeenth Judicial District Court, Snyder County Branch, Pennsylvania.</p>\n<judges id=\"b438-8\">JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
