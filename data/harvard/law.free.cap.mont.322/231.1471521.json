Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Sandrock\u2019s motion for a mistrial?</p>\n<p id=\"b256-16\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it allowed a social worker to testify about matters concerning sexual abuse and religious manipulation and control?</p>\n<p id=\"b256-17\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b256-18\">\u00b65 Sandrock met Lorri Sandrock (Lorri) in late 1987 in Great Falls. They married in 1988, during a private ceremony in Lord\u2019s bedroom. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Lorri had a daughter, Megan, from a previous marriage, who was seven years old at the time Sandrock and Lorri \u201cmarried.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">\u00b66 Sandrock told Lorri that he was the fourth Son of God and that Megan was his natural daughter. He referred to Lorri as \u201cLorelei\u201d and to Megan as \u201cZeri.\u201d He referred to himself as \u201cMikahila.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\u00b67 About a year after they married, Lorri and Megan went to stay with Lorri\u2019s parents in Billings. While she was gone, Sandrock and Lorri kept in contact through letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">\u00b68 In these letters, Sandrock told Lorri that he had God-like powers, calling himself a death angel, as God assigned him the task of destroying those who needed it. He constantly told Lorri that \u201c[t]o fail or go back on one\u2019s word or not serve totally will meet with a punishment no one would want to pay.\u201d He ordered Lorri to receive tattoos-fourteen in total-and ordered that Lorri have Megan tattooed as well. Sandrock also demanded that Lorri and Megan live by his \u201cTen Basic Laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">\u00b69 In his letters, Sandi'ock told Lorri that he would take Megan as his wife. He instructed Lorri to teach Megan how to be his wife, namely how to kiss and to perform oral sex. Lorri did as she was told, as she feared for her life and the life of her daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">\u00b610 Lorri and Megan returned to Great Falls in the summer of 1989. Lorri and Sandrock then lawfully married on August 18, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">\u00b611 Lorri and Megan lived a life of abuse and isolation that was controlled by Sandrock-a fact to which he did not dispute. Sandrock conducted \u201copening of the mind sessions\u201d with Megan. In these sessions, Sandrock told Megan that she would be an adult at age eight, which meant that she could then hug and kiss him. Sandrock then began having sexual intercourse with Megan, eventually abusing Megan daily. Megan, at that time, was in the third grade. Sandrock continued abusing Megan until she was fifteen years old, stopping only after Megan purposely gained enough weight that Sandrock found her disgusting.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">\u00b612 Lorri\u2019s niece, Sonja, who was nine years old at the time, thereafter began visiting the Sandrock home annually. Sandrock abused Sonja just as he had abused Megan, claiming that she was his wife and that he again had God-like powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">\u00b613 Sandrock never spoke \u201creligiously\u201d outside of the home. He maintained regular employment, handled the family finances, had no legal problems, and never took medication during the thirteen years Lorri and Megan endured his abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">\u00b614 In January 2001, Sonja told her parents about the abuse and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>ultimately reported the abuse to law enforcement. Lorri and Megan confirmed the years of sexual and emotional abuse. Subsequently, Sandrock was charged with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent, twelve counts of incest, and two counts of tampering with a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\u00b615 Sandrock maintained that he was suffering from amental disease or defect, and could not have committed the crimes with which he was charged, as he could not have formed the requisite mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u00b616 During Sandrock\u2019s trial, the jury received considerable testimony regarding the aforementioned occurrences. The jury also received considerable expert testimony, including that of Dr. Joseph Rich (Dr. Rich) and Angela Dailey (Dailey).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\u00b617 In the course of discussing his review of the letters that Sandrock wrote to Lorri, Dr. Rich, a forensic psychiatrist with thirty years of experience, testified that he believed Sandrock knew right from wrong. Sandrock objected to this testimony as going to the ultimate issue of the case and moved for a mistrial. The District Court denied this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">\u00b618 Dailey, a clinical social worker and qualified expert in sexual abuse, also testified about her experiences in a \u201cChristian sect\u201d and the sexual and religious manipulation that were part of her experience. Sandrock objected to this testimony as well, claiming it was irrelevant. The District Court overruled Sandrock\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">\u00b619 Ultimately, the jury convicted Sandrock on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">\u00b620 Sandrock now appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion for a mistrial and the admission of Dailey\u2019s testimony. The specifics of both Dr. Rich\u2019s and Dailey\u2019s expert testimony are the subject of Sandrock\u2019s present appeal. This specific testimony will be discussed as it becomes applicable in the following analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">\u00b621 We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Strauss, </em>2003 MT 195, \u00b6 18, 317 Mont. 1, \u00b6 18, 74 P.3d 1052, \u00b6 18. A district court has broad discretion in determining the admissibility of evidence, and we will not overturn a district court\u2019s rulings absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Strauss, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b258-13\">\u00b622 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Sandrock\u2019s motion for a mistrial?</p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>\u00b623 Sandrock argues that the District Court abused its discretion in <em>denying his </em>motion for a mistrial because Dr. Rich\u2019s testimony regarding Sandrock\u2019s ability to distinguish right from wrong violated the statutory prohibition on ultimate issue testimony. Specifically, Sandrock contends that Dr. Rich \u201ctestified directly about Sandrock\u2019s mental state,\u201d namely that \u201cDr. Rich told the jury that while Sandrock was an \u2018oddball\u2019 he \u2018knew right from wrong<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> when he committed these crimes.\u201d Sandrock argues that by allowing this testimony, the State of Montana (the State), in effect, was allowed to \u201csupplant\u201d its need to prove Sandrock\u2019s mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\u00b624 The State argues that Dr. Rich did not \u201cgive specific testimony that Sandrock acted with purpose or knowledge during the sexual offenses....\u201d Further, the State argues that \u201cthe prosecutor did not ask Dr. Rich any questions regarding Sandrock\u2019s ability to act with purpose or knowledge at the time of the charged offenses.\u201d [Emphasis in original.] Rather, the State argues that Dr. Rich\u2019s statement \u201cwas simply clarifying that a personality disorder does not, in and of itself, mean that a person cannot discern right from wrong.\u201d And, the State argues that Dr. Rich was referring to Sandrock\u2019s letters when he made his statement and \u201cnot to Sandrock\u2019s state of mind during the offenses charged.\u201d Moreover, Sandrock did not request Dr. Rich\u2019s statement be stricken, nor did he request a cautionary jury instruction. Indeed, the prosecutor was the one to request a cautionary instruction. Regardless, the State contends that should this Court hold that Dr. Rich\u2019s statement violated \u00a7 46-14-213(2), MCA, admission of that statement was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\u00b625 A person commits the offense of sexual intercourse without consent if that person \u201cknowingly has sexual intercourse without consent with another person....\u201d Section 45-5-503(1), MCA. Knowingly is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">[A] person acts knowingly with respect to conduct or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when the person is aware of the person\u2019s own conduct or that the circumstance exists. A person acts knowingly with respect to the result of conduct described by a statute defining an offense when the person is aware that it is highly probable that the result will be caused by the person\u2019s conduct. When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, knowledge is established if a person is aware of a high probability of its existence.... Section 45-2-101(34), MCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">\u00b626  In Montana, no constitutional right to an insanity defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>exists. However, Montana does allow consideration of a defendant\u2019s mental disease or defect at three separate stages of a criminal proceeding: (1) prior to trial, a defendant may be examined to determine whether he is able to understand the proceedings against him or to assist in his own defense, \u00a7 46-14-103, MCA; (2) at trial, a defendant may introduce evidence of mental disease or defect whenever relevant to prove that he did not have the requisite mental state, \u00a7 46-14-102, MCA; and (3) dining sentencing, a convicted defendant may claim that at the time he committed the offense, he was suffering from a mental disease or defect that rendered him unable to appreciate the criminality of his behavior or to conform his behavior to the requirements of law, \u00a7 46-14-311, MCA. <em>See also State v. Santos </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 125, 137-38, 902 P.2d 510, 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">\u00b627 Expert testimony is allowed when \u201cscientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge\u201d held by an expert \u201cwill assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue....\u201d Rule 702, M.R.Evid. A witness qualifies as an expert witness through the expert\u2019s \u201cknowledge, skill, experience, training, or education,\u201d and an expert may testify to matters in the form of an opinion. Rule 702, M.R.Evid. Testimony that is in the form of an opinion or an inference, that would otherwise be admissible, \u201cis not objectionable because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.\u201d Rule 704, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">\u00b628 Regarding a psychiatrist\u2019s expert testimony, that psychiatrist \u201cmay make a statement as to the nature of the examination and the medical or psychological diagnosis of the mental condition of the defendant... [including] any explanation reasonably serving to clarify the expert\u2019s examination and diagnosis....\u201d Section 46-14-213(2), MCA. However, \u201c[a] psychiatrist... may not offer an opinion to the jury on the ultimate issue of whether the defendant did or did not have a particular state of mind that is an element of the offense charged.\u201d Section 46-14-213(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\u00b629 In <em>Santos, </em>the defendant killed two elderly people and then stole their El Camino in an attempt to escape. <em>Santos, </em>273 Mont. at 129, 902 P.2d at 512. In reviewing the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, we held that admission of the following testimony, although harmless error, was violative of \u00a7 46-14-213(2), MCA. We held that this testimony related \u201cdirectly to whether Santos [the defendant] possessed the requisite mental state of\u2018knowingly\u2019 or \u2018purposely* as to the theft of the El Camino.\u201d <em>Santos, </em>273 Mont. at 134, 902 P.2d at 515. This testimony included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Q: At least by the defendant\u2019s own words, those acts would certainly demonstrate a purpose of the defendant to carry out specific abilities, would they not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-4\">A: I would say that, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">Q: And they at least demonstrate a conscious objective on his part to engage in a particular form of conduct, do they not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">Q: And that it was his purpose, by his own description, to cause a particular result; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-8\">A: Based on the interview, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-9\"><em>Santos, </em>273 Mont. at 134, 902 P.2d at 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">\u00b630 The above-quoted testimony came after the jury heard testimony that the defendant \u201chad taken the victims\u2019 vehicle, had attempted to change the license plate and had driven the vehicle out of town.\u201d <em>Santos, </em>273 Mont. at 133-34, 902 P.2d at 515. The jury was instructed that \u201c[a] person commits the offense of theft if he purposely or knowingly obtains or exerts unauthorized control over property of the owner, and has the purpose of depriving the owner of the property.\u201d <em>Santos, </em>273 Mont. at 134, 902 P.2d at 515. Taken together, the testimony related \u201cdirectly to whether Santos [the defendant] possessed the requisite mental state of \u2018knowingly\u2019 or \u2018purposely\u2019 \u201d because it targeted both the defendant\u2019s actions and his mental state at the time of the commission of the crime. <em>Santos, </em>273 Mont. at 134, 902 P.2d at 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">\u00b631 The defendant in <em>Santos </em>also argued that he did not have the requisite mental state to commit the homicides with which he was charged. Consequently, he argued that testimony elicited from a psychiatric expert violated \u00a7 46-14-213(2), MCA, as the testimony addressed the ultimate issue of his mental state. Specifically, the expert testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-12\">Q: Doctor, without giving me specific instances,, were the materials you read, in your professional opinion, replete with examples of conduct by the defendant which amounted to conscious deliberate behavior?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-13\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-14\">Q: And which amount to conscious object to carry out particular actions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-15\">A: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-16\"><em>Santos, </em>273 Mont. at 135, 902 P.2d at 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-17\">\u00b632 In holding that the above-elicited testimony did not violate \u00a7 46-14-213(2), MCA, we noted the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Questions and expert opinions on a criminal defendant\u2019s mental capacity are not prohibited under the above statute [\u00a7 46-14-213(2), MCA]; what the statute prohibits are expert opinions on the ultimate issue of whether the defendant actually possessed the requisite mental state at the time the offense was committed. We believe that this narrow reading of the statute supports the purpose of expert testimony as an aid to the finder of fact, based upon the expert\u2019s particular knowledge or experience, in determining the fact at issue. <em>Santos, </em>273 Mont. at 135, 902 P.2d at 516.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\u00b633 Hence, the expert\u2019s testimony, within the context that it was elicited, did not target the ultimate issue of whether Santos acted knowingly or purposely during the time he committed the homicides. Rather, having consulted various materials, such as police reports and witness statements, the expert testified to his opinion of the defendant\u2019s mental state with regard to those reports and statements. \u00b634 Here, Dr. Rich testified, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">[By Sandrock\u2019s attorney:]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">Q: The jury has heard about the letters. You know, there\u2019s stuff in there about thinking he is the Fourth Son of God and angels and you name it. You have heard all the things that are in there calling people by their heavenly name, thinking his name is Mikahila.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">Why not-why does that not show a serious mental illness, or does it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">[By Dr. Rich:]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-9\">A: It shows a serious something. I guess it \u2014 if I put all this together, and I do want to talk about this in detail, but having read all these letters and looking at all the things that he had to say, and seeing how everything got focused right down on his control over some females, his control of them for one purpose, his sexual fulfillment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-10\">Then I-I have come to the conclusion that, sure, maybe, maybe in this personality disorder he had over the years he had some feelings that he is kind of special and this is a schizotypal living out his fantasies, and I guess we have all had fantasies of being something pretty special.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-11\">But it is like he was living out his fantasies, and I am of the opinion that the way that he used all that really fits into the malingering aspect of this, as opposed to his mental disorder. And there are just multiple citations in these letters that I can point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>to that, to <em>me </em>anyway, look very controlling, very manipulative. And this entire purpose of just the fulfillment of his own narcissistic sexual needs to the exclusion of someone else\u2019s well-being.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\">And one other thought is that if an individual was seriously mentally ill, and really believed in this stuff when he was doing it, I have never seen anyone who was seriously mentally ill who was having fun, who was enjoying themselves. You know, it is a very disturbing thing to be mentally ill, whether it is schizophrenia or schizotypal personality disorder. Those are not fun ways to go through life, I am telling you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\">And he is having fun in these letters. He is making jokes. And there are times when he is saying extremely serious and highly manipulative things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">And in the next paragraph, he will tell jokes to his wife, or give her advice on how to fill out her exemptions for the income taxes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">It doesn\u2019t make sense, except from a malingering point of view. Q: So you said adjustment disorder, schizotypal personality disorder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-8\">Are those mental diseases or defects or-A: Well, they are mental problems. They are in the book, Manual of Mental Disorders. Sure. They\u2019re mental disorders, but it is different.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-9\">Q: Like nicotine addiction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-10\">A: Marijuana use, you know, all kinds of things that we would feel are much more trivial in contrast to schizophrenia or delusional disorder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-11\">But a personality disorder is a personality disorder, even with weird thoughts, even being an oddball, he still knew right from wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-12\">And I can show you places in these letters where he is cautioning-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">\u00b635  The ultimate issue before the jury was whether Sandrock acted purposely or knowingly with regard to the sexual intercourse without consent, incest, and tampering with a witness charges. The above-quoted testimony shows that, with regard to the letters that Sandrock wrote to Lorri, it was Dr. Rich\u2019s expert opinion that Sandrock generally knew right from wrong when Sandrock wrote those letters. Dr. Rich\u2019s testimony did not concern Sandrock\u2019s actions during the commission of the sexual intercourse without consent, incest, or tampering with a witness, unlike the testimony did in <em>Santos, </em>which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>concerned the defendant\u2019s actions dining the theft and the defendant\u2019s mental state at that time. Rather, Dr. Rich\u2019s testimony concerned his expert opinion of Sandrock\u2019s ability to know right from wrong with regard to the content of his letters. The letters provided Dr. Rich examples of Sandrock\u2019s ability to know right from wrong at the time those letters were written, like the materials provided the expert in <em>Santos. </em>Hence, we hold that Dr. Rich\u2019s testimony regarding Sandrock\u2019s ability to know right from wrong did not target the ultimate issue of whether Sandrock actually possessed the requisite mental states at the time the sexual intercourse without consent, incest, or tampering with a witness occurred. The District Court did not err in denying Sandrock\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\u00b636 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it allowed a social worker to testify about matters concerning sexual abuse and religious manipulation and control?</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\u00b637 Sandrock argues that Dailey\u2019s expert testimony regarding cult behaviors, such as sexual abuse and religious manipulation and control, was irrelevant, and admission of it again worked to \u201csupplant\u201d the State\u2019s need to prove Sandrock\u2019s mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u00b638 The State argues that Dailey\u2019s testimony \u201cprovided the jury members with some context to digest the horrendous and bizarre uncontested facts of the case.\u201d Consequently, Dailey \u201cdid not provide any testimony specific to Sandrock, nor did she ever refer to him as a cult leader.\u201d In addition, the State argues that should this Court hold that Dailey\u2019s testimony was relevant, admission of her testimony was harmless \u201c[s]ince Sandrock himself admits that he controlled Lorri, Megan, and Sonja....\u201d Hence, the State contends that Sandrock \u201ccan hardly claim he was prejudiced by Daily\u2019s very brief and generalized testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">\u00b639 Relevant evidence is evidence having \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Rule 401, M.R.Evid. Generally, all relevant evidence is admissible. Rule 402, M.R.Evid. However, a court may exclude relevant evidence when the probative value of that evidence is \u201csubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d Rule 403, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">\u00b640 Specifically, regarding sexual abuse and religious manipulation and control, Dailey testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Q: Have you presented any seminars or workshops or conferences?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-4\">A: I am a guest speaker each year at the University of Montana in a Sociology of Cults class<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">Q: What is the topic of your speech?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">A: I talk about my own personal experience in what is mostly considered to be a Christian sect. And my primary reason for talking in that class is to talk about recovery issues, defection is what it\u2019s called, coming out of groups and the dynamics that are involved in coming out of those groups.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">Q: Okay. Now, you said your own experience. Let\u2019s start with that. What-please tell the jury about your own experience in-what would you call it-unorthodox religious group?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">A: I would call it a Christian sect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">Q: Okay. Please tell the jury about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-10\">A: Okay. I was involved for nearly ten years in a religion that involved a belief in end time prophet. It was a sort of what might be referred to as a holiness group. The women wore long dresses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-11\">Q: Okay. Was there sexual abuse that took place, to your knowledge, in this cult or group?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-12\">A: After I left, I discovered that our pastor had been sleeping with almost every woman in the church and some of the kids....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-13\">Q: I do not want to ask you your age, but you weren\u2019t involved as a licensed clinical social worker back then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-14\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-15\">Q: That took place afterwards?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-16\">A: Yes. I\u2019ve been out of this group for 19 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-17\">Q: Do you treat people who have come out of these groups like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-18\">A: Yes. And I have to say in Teton County we don\u2019t have a lot of incidents of this sort of thing. But I have treated people who have come from as far as Bozeman and Helena who have come out of very rigid religious groups.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-19\">Q: Okay. Miss Dailey, let\u2019s get into the meat and potatoes. You <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>received all that information, the letters, the communications between the defendant and his wife and daughter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-4\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\">Q: All right. And I\u2019m not going to ask you a lot of specific questions about that, other than to say, do you recognize certain principles in those letters? Are there manifestations of certain principles of religious groups in those letters and in the materials? A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">Q: All right. Could you give me some characteristics of how you would define a group like this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">A: Generally they involve rigid controlling beliefs. There is some sort of leadership that is thought to have some special relationship with God that is not necessarily available to everyone. The members are usually controlled at least to some extent by fear. Generally fear of hell or some kind of retribution from God. They tend to be more isolated, I think, than other mainstream religious groups.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">Q: Okay. Next question is, you described a few of the, I guess, destructive elements; is that fair to say? Were there destructive elements in this group you were part of?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-10\">Q: Then why did you not recognize that and leave? I guess that\u2019s the big question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-11\">A: Well, because when you\u2019re in the group, you adopt the belief system. And the belief system usually has itself covered. Christian belief systems, for instance, like the one I was in, used scriptures from the Bible to support things like not having any associations with your family or other people in the world who speak against what you believe. So you become more and more isolated, for instance. There is less and less accountability to the outside world. And you expect to be persecuted for your beliefs. That\u2019s part of the belief system. So the more you get into it, the more you don\u2019t see it for what it is. You do not see that it\u2019s destructive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">\u00b641 Here, as evidenced by the above-quoted testimony, Dailey did not testify that Sandrock was a cult leader, nor did she state that Sandrock had formed a cult. By reference to her experiences in a \u201cChristian sect,\u201d Dailey merely provided the jury a context for them to understand the intricacies of \u201creligious groups\u201d in general. In that respect, Dailey\u2019s testimony was relevant. In addition, Dailey\u2019s testimony was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>unfairly prejudicial, as: (1) Sandrock himself admitted to the control to which he subjected Lorri, Megan, and Sonja; and (2) Dailey did not state that Sandrock himself exhibited or performed the beliefs that are typical of the religious groups about which she testified in general.</p>\n<p id=\"ACh\">\u00b642  A district court has broad discretion in admitting evidence. <em>Strauss, </em>\u00b6 18.

We\u2019ve heard testimony in this case so far that is beyond the comprehension of a layperson to understand the dynamics of a relationship like this. Not only dynamics of how Lorri and Megan can be subjected and controlled by the content [sic], which we\u2019ve heard here, but also under which the defendant can exert that control over them. It definitely requires an expert testimony to understand that and put it into some kind of framework ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-10\">Mr. Jensen: Yeah, Your Honor. Here is my written - I\u2019ve got lots of concerns with this, Your Honor. And one of them is, you know, we\u2019re not contesting any of this stuff happened. We\u2019re not disputing it. We\u2019re not saying that he didn\u2019t have control of these women. We\u2019re not saying the sexual abuse didn\u2019t happen, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-11\">And so I don\u2019t know why the jury needs this additional information in order to make their decision in this case, because what it comes down to is mental disease or defect. And the state already has had three doctors look at him, Your Honor ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-12\">And what I think the state is trying to do, although they\u2019re <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>couching it as not doing this, is to try and holster Lorri up for her i failure. And I didn\u2019t really attack her on that very vigorously, Your Honor. We\u2019ve not been disputing that, and I\u2019m not - my direction is what happened, where the nature of those things and my client\u2019s mental illness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-4\">What they\u2019re trying to do is alleviate any personal responsibility she may have in the jury\u2019s mind, whatever the jury thinks, and make my client even worse in their mind. What they\u2019re trying to do is try and explain away some of these behaviors. We\u2019re admitting all this stuff happened. We know it took years for it to come out. I think the jury understands why it took so long for it to come out based on the testimony of Megan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">And, Your Honor, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s relevant to any issue, and it\u2019s not necessary for them to make any determination of any of the issues in this case, my client\u2019s guilt or my client\u2019s mental state</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">Mr. Thompson: The focus is on the dynamic. I\u2019ll tell you how it\u2019s relevant to Mr. Sandrock, apart from the facts that this actually did happen. She\u2019s going to explain that there is a common dynamic to religious control, and then the jury can make the connection there to the fact that this was not an insane act .... These tools were used in a manner that was not under unknowing or unintentional.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">\u00b647 The decision concerning relevance is in the broad discretion of the District Court. <em>Strauss, </em>\u00b6 18. The trial judge was faced with making a decision whether the witness Dailey\u2019s testimony was for no purpose, or for the purpose of making Mr. Sandrock a bad man, on the one hand, or on the other hand would tend to prove that he acted with purpose and knowledge. The trial judge, after hearing the voir dire of the jury, hearing the opening statements of counsel, listening to and observing the witnesses give several days of testimony, and considering the arguments of counsel, decided that the proposed testimony would tend to prove that Defendant Sandrock acted with purpose or knowledge, the main fact at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">\u00b648 The transcript indicates that this was a carefully considered decision taking into consideration the entire trial dynamic. It was indeed a difficult decision, but not one that I second guess. It was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b268-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"AJW\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">\u00b649 I concur in the Court\u2019s opinion on issue one, but respectfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>dissent from that opinion on issue two. I would reverse the District Court\u2019s admission of Dailey\u2019s testimony and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\u00b650 The record reflects that Dailey is a licensed clinical social worker. She first was designated an expert in the area of child sexual abuse over defense objections. Dailey later was designated as an expert in the area of \u201creligiously controlling organizations, groups[,]\u201d also over defense objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\u00b651 Dailey\u2019s substantive testimony began with her personal experiences in a \u201cChristian sect\u201d nearly 20 years previously and her treatment of people who have \u201ccome out of very rigid religious groups.\u201d It went on to discuss \u201cprinciples of religious groups\u201d and related \u201crigid controlling beliefs\u201d in the context of information she reviewed relating to Sandrock\u2019s family. It is true that Dailey did not describe Sandrock as a cult leader or state that he had formed a cult; she did testify, however, about \u201ccult\u201d leadership and relationships. In any event, the fact that-as the Court puts it-Dailey \u201cmerely provided the jury a context for them to understand the intricacies of \u2018religious groups\u2019 in general\u201d does not lead logically or legally to the Court\u2019s conclusion that the testimony was relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u00b652 Relevant evidence is \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Rule 401, M.R.Evid. \u201cEvidence which is not relevant is not admissible.\u201d Rule 402, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">\u00b653 Sandrock was charged with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent, twelve counts of incest, and two counts of tampering with a witness. The \u201cfacts of consequence\u201d in this action were those necessary for the State to prove the elements of the offenses charged. Those facts were presented through witness testimony and documentary exhibits. Indeed, the record reflects that Sandrock did \u201cnot in any way contest[] the fact that both [victims] were sexually abused.\u201d Thus, Dailey\u2019s testimony was totally irrelevant. There simply was no fact \u201cof consequence to the determination of the action\u201d at issue in this case, as required for relevance in Rule 401, with regard to the \u201cintricacies of\u2018religious groups\u2019 in general.\u201d Consequently, I conclude that the District Court abused its discretion in admitting Dailey\u2019s irrelevant testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">\u00b654 Nor could it seriously be argued that Dailey\u2019s testimony-which covers in excess of 40 transcript pages-was not highly prejudicial to Sandrock. Notwithstanding the care taken by the State not to elicit opinions from Dailey that Sandrock was a cult leader or had formed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>cult, she was permitted to testify about cults, cult leadership and cult relationships. No rational jury could have missed the (barely) implicit suggestion by the State via Dailey\u2019s testimony that Sandrock was just that-a cult leader. And, indeed, the prosecutor made effective-if indirect-use of the testimony in his closing argument to the jury in the guise of commenting on Sandrock\u2019s mental disease or defect defense, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-4\">Charles Manson believed he could start a race war by killing a few affluent whites and making it look like it was done by hateful blacks, and the group would rule the world.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">Jim Jones made a nice following by making his victims believe he was God. Under his leadership, they performed 100 sexual acts in front of each other. He made them believe the leader should have sex with so many of his congregation, and yet followed him down to Guyana where they drank poisoned Kool-Aid and killed themselves with their children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">No testimony from any witness other than Dailey could have supported these kinds of arguments. And what juror who remembers, as I do, the horrors and consequences of those cult leaders, having heard Dailey\u2019s testimony, could have done other than conclude that Sandrock was in fact a cult leader and fail to even consider the evidence supporting Sandrock\u2019s mental disease or defect defense from one of the leading experts in Montana?</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">\u00b655 It is my view that the State sought to present Dailey\u2019s irrelevant testimony for these very reasons, namely, to poison the jury against Sandrock\u2019s defense and the expert testimony which supported it long before the defense had an opportunity to put on its case. While one cannot, of course, say with certainty that this strategy resulted in the jury rejecting Sandrock\u2019s defense, I believe one can say that the admission of Dailey\u2019s irrelevant testimony was substantially prejudicial to Sandrock.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">\u00b656 I would reverse the District Court\u2019s admission of Dailey\u2019s testimony and remand for a new trial. I dissent from the Court\u2019s failure to do so.</p>\n<judges id=\"b270-9\">JUSTICE LEAPHART joins in the foregoing concurring and dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
