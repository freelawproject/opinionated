While we agree the District Court erred in concluding that Defendants owed no duty to Hinkles, we affirm the summary judgment on the issue of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">\u00b62 1. Did the District Court err when it granted Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the basis that no duty was owed to Hinkles because the alleged harm was not foreseeable?</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">\u00b63 2. Did the District Court err when it granted Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the basis that Hinkles\u2019 expert did not establish causation?</p>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b106-13\">\u00b64 Defendants stipulated that, for the purposes of their motion for summary judgment, they would rely upon the facts as testified to in the depositions of Rocky and his pediatrician Dr. Fred Gunville, which we relate here. A freshman at Shepherd High School, Rocky traveled on the pep band bus to a basketball game in Belgrade on March 5, 1998. After the game, the band ate dinner at Pizza Hut in Bozeman. Rocky, along with his bandmates, band instructor Browning, and bus driver Horn, consumed pizza and soft drinks.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-14\">\u00b65 Some students requested a restroom stop during the return trip to Shepherd. Rocky heard other students teasing those who had requested the restroom stop. Horn pumped the brakes to jar the bus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>and aid in teasing the students who needed to use the restrooms. Browning allowed Horn to stop the bus at a convenience store in Big Timber, where Rocky purchased a bottle of water which he drank on the bus. As the bus continued toward Shepherd, some students threw candy and cheese at other students. Rocky had candy and cheese thrown at him, but he did not otherwise participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\u00b66 A little while later, Rocky needed to relieve himself and asked Browning if the bus could stop so he could use a restroom. Browning did not respond. After a second inquiry, Browning refused. Rocky then asked a third time and Browning ignored him. At this point, the bus was approximately fifteen minutes away from Shepherd High School. The other students on the bus began to tease Rocky by making references to running water and waterfalls. At first, Rocky was not bothered by the mild teasing, but as the drive continued and Rocky\u2019s situation became more urgent, the teasing intensified, the food-throwers targeted Rocky, and more students participated in both. Rocky didn\u2019t recall ever specifically telling Browning that his need to use a restroom was an emergency, but he did ask other students for a bottle in which he could relieve himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\u00b67 Approximately one quarter-mile from Shepherd High School, Browning announced that no one could leave the bus before it was cleaned. The other students on the bus, aware of Rocky\u2019s situation, cheered. Rocky said, \u2018You let me off this fucking bus.\u201d Browning asked Rocky what he said and Rocky repeated himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\u00b68 As the bus neared the school, Horn pumped the brakes again. As a result of the jarring movement of the bus, Rocky lost continence and wet himself. As soon as the bus stopped at the school, Rocky rushed off the bus and into the boys\u2019 locker room. He used the restroom, returned to the bus to retrieve his belongings, and then left with his father, who was waiting at the school for him. The front of Rocky\u2019s jeans was noticeably wet, but he was not sure if any of the other students realized that he had had an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">\u00b69 The following day, Browning told Rocky that he would not be allowed to participate in the pep band for their next game, and that he might be removed from the band permanently for embarrassing Browning on the bus by using profanity. Rocky explained to Browning that he had been upset because of his need to use the restroom and because of the extent of the teasing by other students on the bus. Browning asked Rocky who had been teasing him and Rocky named seven students. Browning and Rocky then narrowed the list down to the three students whom Rocky asserted were the ringleaders.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>\u00b610 The following Monday, Rocky was summoned to the principal\u2019s office and given a one-day out-of-school suspension for his use of profanity on the bus. After returning from his suspension on Wednesday, Rocky was again summoned to the principal\u2019s office and told that three students and a teacher had told the principal that Rocky was the instigator behind the antics on the bus. Rocky denied this, but the principal explained that he did not believe Rocky and ordered him to serve three days of lunch detention. Rocky was very upset and felt he was being treated unfairly.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">\u00b611 Rocky claims that it was his discomfort, combined with the stress of being intensely teased by the other students on the bus, which caused him to be so upset that he used profanity on the bus. He argues that, although it was standard procedure for the band bus to be emptied row by row with Browning checking each row to be sure it was clean before allowing its occupants to disembark, Browning had announced that no one could leave the bus in order to delay his exit. He believes the students and teacher lied about his involvement in the teasing on the bus, and that he was being punished repeatedly for a single incident over which he had no control.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u00b612 On Friday, March 13, Rocky went to his brothers\u2019 residence after school and spent the weekend with them. They played video games, watched movies, and ate junk food. Throughout the weekend, Rocky did not feel well and experienced some vomiting. On Monday, his mother took him to his pediatrician. Dr. Gunville tested Rocky for strep throat and gave him a shot of penicillin.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u00b613 Rocky\u2019s condition worsened and he revisited his pediatrician a few days later. He was ultimately diagnosed with ketoacidosis, a condition in which his body was not producing enough insulin, which in turn caused his blood to become dangerously acidic. Gravely ill, he was transported by air ambulance for advanced care in Denver, Colorado. He was in a life-threatening condition for several days before he began to recover. He now suffers from Type I diabetes and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">\u00b614 Rocky and his parents filed a lawsuit against Browning, Horn, and the Shepherd School District, alleging that various breaches of duty on their parts triggered or accelerated Rocky\u2019s development of diabetes and caused his PTSD. Rocky\u2019s parents also sought on their own behalf damages for emotional harm incurred by them due to the treatment Rocky received from Defendants and Rocky\u2019s subsequent medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">\u00b615 In his deposition, Dr. Gunville stated that the added stress in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Rocky\u2019s life could have contributed to the diabetic situation, and noted that Rocky\u2019s situation was very unusual in that he became extremely ill without having exhibited symptoms for very long. Dr. Gunville stated that Rocky\u2019s stress came both from school and from an upper respiratory infection. He admitted that, while Rocky would have eventually developed diabetes irrespective of the stress he was experiencing, stress likely accelerated its onset. Dr. Gunville could not differentiate between the physical stress from Rocky\u2019s infection and the emotional stress from the bus incident, or state whether one or the other or both were the stressors that accelerated Rocky\u2019s diabetes. He agreed that Rocky\u2019s experiences on the bus-the thirst, the urgent need to reheve himself, the incontinence, and his reactiveness-were possibly symptoms of his emerging diabetic condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">\u00b616 Defendants filed two motions for summaryjudgment. In their first motion, they claimed Hinkles failed to comport with the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure in regards to their disclosure of expert witnesses, that their experts should thus be excluded, and that Defendants were therefore entitled to judgment. The District Court denied this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b617 Defendants next moved for summaryjudgment on the grounds that they owed no duty to protect Rocky from injuries that were not foreseeable, and alternatively that his injuries were not caused by Defendants\u2019 actions. Oral argument on this motion was held in the District Court on January 31, 2002. On October 21, 2002, the District Court concluded that, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the chain of events stemming from the bus incident caused both the PTSD and the onset of Rocky\u2019s diabetes, such harm was unforeseeable by Defendants, and thus they did not have a duty to protect Rocky from such harm. The District Court also concluded that Hinkles\u2019 expert failed to establish causation. The District Court therefore granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants. Hinkles timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">\u00b618 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summaryjudgment de <em>novo, </em>applying the same evaluation under Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., as the district court. <em>Glacier Tennis Club at the Summit, LLC v. Treweek Constr. Co., </em>2004 MT 70, \u00b6 21, 320 Mont. 351, \u00b6 21, 87 P.3d 431, \u00b6 21 (citations omitted). In other words, the party moving for summary judgment has the initial burden of proving that there are no genuine issues of material fact that would permit a non-moving party to succeed on the merits of the case, and if the moving party meets that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>burden, then the non-moving party must provide substantial evidence that raises a genuine issue of material fact in order to avoid summary judgment in favor of the moving party. <em>Glacier, </em>\u00b6 21 (citations omitted). Once it is established that no genuine issues of material fact exist, the district court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and this Court reviews that determination to determine whether the district court erred. <em>Glacier, </em>\u00b6 21 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">DISCUSSION ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\u00b619 1. Did the District Court err when it granted Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the basis that no duty was owed to Hinkles because the alleged harm was not foreseeable?</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">\u00b620 Hinkles maintain the District Court erred when it concluded as a matter of law that Defendants owed Hinkles no duty because Rocky\u2019s injuries were not foreseeable. They claim that the question of whether injuries are foreseeable by a defendant is a question of fact for the jury, citing <em>Kolar v. Bergo </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 262, 929 P.2d 867. Hinkles argue that it is appropriate for a district court to grant summary judgment in a negligence action only if reasonable minds could reach but one conclusion. They insist that here, based on the stipulated facts, reasonable minds could differ as to whether it was foreseeable that Horn\u2019s intentional jarring of the bus could cause a student, known to be in need of a restroom, to lose continence and suffer extreme embarrassment and stress which could then lead to other health problems. They further argue that Browning breached his duty of care to Rocky by tolerating Horn\u2019s braking actions, failing to stop the teasing from the other students, and refusing to order Horn to stop the bus so that Rocky could relieve himself. Hinkles also claim that Shepherd School District breached its duty to adequately and reasonably interview, hire, train, manage and supervise its employees, and that it breached further duties by failing to protect Rocky, and by later allowing him to be blamed and punished for the incident on the bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">\u00b621 Hinkles maintain that the situation on the bus, combined with the series of unfair punishments which Rocky received afterwards, caused Rocky to experience extreme stress which either triggered his development of diabetes, or at the very least accelerated and exacerbated its onset. They also cite these incidents as causing Rocky to develop PTSD, although it is unclear if Hinkles argue that the PTSD <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>stemmed directly from the bus incident and its aftermath independently of the diabetes, or if Rocky\u2019s diabetic condition caused the PTSD.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">\u00b622 Defendants argue that Hinkles misunderstand the concept of foreseeability and, citing <em>Poole v. Poole, </em>2000 MT 117, \u00b6 19, 299 Mont. 435, \u00b6 19, 1 P.3d 936, \u00b6 19, assert that the analysis of whether a duty is owed is a question of law for the court. They argue in their brief on appeal that, without foreseeability, there is no duty, and Defendants could not have foreseen that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-5\">by not stopping to allow Rocky Hinkle to use the restroom fifteen minutes from school, when Rocky Hinkle did not indicate that it was an emergency situation; by not intervening while children teased each other on the bus related to falling and running water; and the pumping of the brakes by Shorty Horn, would lead to Rocky Hinkle using the \u2018F\u2019 word twice to his teacher, which would lead to punishment for Rocky Hinkle uttering the \u2018F\u2019 word in front of his teacher on two occasions, which punishment consisted of one out-of-school suspension and three in-school lunch detentions, could cause any injury to Rocky Hinkle, let alone diabetes, exacerbation of diabetes, or post-traumatic stress disorder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">\u00b623  Ordinarily, negligence actions involve questions of fact and are not susceptible to summary judgment. <em>Poole, </em>\u00b6 14 (citation omitted). However, if a plaintiff fails to offer proof of any one of the elements of negligence (duty, breach, causation, and damages), then summary judgment in favor of the defendant is proper. <em>Singleton v. L.P. Anderson Supply Co., Inc. </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 40, 44, 943 P.2d 968, 970 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">\u00b624 In the case at hand, the Defendants as the moving parties stipulated that, for purposes of the summary judgment motion, they would accept as true the facts as testified to in the depositions of Rocky and Dr. Gunville. While Hinkles have also referred to some testimony from Horn\u2019s deposition, and appear to rely on the depositions of Victor and/or Marilyn Hinkle to establish their claim for damages, we refuse to consider such references because these depositions were never published and are therefore not a part of the record on appeal. We take this opportunity to remind parties that we cannot consider the contents of documents which were not submitted to the District Court and delivered in turn to this Court as part of the record. In any event, because we affirm the District Court\u2019s entry of summary judgment, the cited evidence tending to suggest that Hinkles suffered damages is irrelevant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>\u00b625  The existence of a duty of care depends upon the foreseeability of the risk and upon a weighing of policy considerations for and against the imposition of liability. <em>Jacobs v. Laurel Volunteer Fire Dep\u2019t, </em>2001 MT 98, \u00b6 13, 305 Mont. 225, \u00b6 13, 26 P.3d 730, \u00b6 13. Foreseeability constitutes a limitation on the otherwise potentially infinite liability which would follow every alleged negligent act, and the law of torts holds a defendant liable only for injuries to others which, to the defendant at the time, were reasonably foreseeable. <em>Mang v. Eliasson </em>(1969), 153 Mont. 431, 437, 458 P.2d 777, 781. A defendant owes a duty with respect to those risks or hazards whose likelihood made the conduct unreasonably dangerous and hence negligent in the first instance. <em>Mang, </em>153 Mont, at 437, 458 P.2d at 781. A judicial determination of duty involves various policy considerations, including the moral blame attributable to the defendant\u2019s conduct; the prevention of future harm; the extent of the burden placed on the defendant; the consequences to the public of imposing such a duty; and the availability of insurance for the risk involved. <em>Jacobs, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">\u00b626 In its Order and Memorandum in this case, the District Court noted, \u201cThe fact that Defendants\u2019 acts may have been unprofessional, inappropriate or inconsiderate is not indicative of the foreseeability of the alleged harm.\u201d Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Defendants\u2019 actions could have caused Rocky\u2019s diabetes and subsequent PTSD, we must determine whether or not Defendants could have foreseen that their treatment of Rocky would result in injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">\u00b627 We find Hinkles\u2019 reliance on <em>Kolar </em>to be misplaced. In <em>Kolar, </em>this Court reversed a grant of summary judgment for the defendant because material fact issues involving contributory negligence, causation, and the alleged negligence of multiple defendants were in dispute. <em>Kolar, </em>280 Mont. at 267, 929 P.2d at 870. <em>Kolar </em>involved a practical joke gone awry, in which the target of the practical joke collided with a motorcyclist while rushing to rescue a child from a fictitious emergency. On appeal, we noted that there were several factual disputes at issue, including whether the party who played the practical joke knew that the intended target of the joke was drinking alcohol, or knew that he might respond to the fictitious emergency by attempting to drive to the child\u2019s aid. <em>Kolar, </em>280 Mont, at 267, 929 P.2d at 870. Although we did address foreseeability in our <em>Kolar </em>Opinion, our holding was ultimately premised on the moving party\u2019s failure to demonstrate that no genuine issues of material fact existed. <em>Kolar, </em>280 Mont, at 267, 929 P.2d at 870. Here, for purposes of summary judgment, the material facts are not in dispute. Thus, <em>Kolar </em>is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">\u00b628  The inapplicability of <em>Kolar </em>does not end our inquiry. The District Court found dispositive the fact that Rocky\u2019s PTSD and diabetes complications could not have been foreseen by Defendants. In other words, Defendants had to have foreseen these particular injuries. Under the law, however, the <em>specific injury </em>need not be foreseeable. Rather, the question is whether the defendants could have foreseen that their conduct would result in injuries to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\u00b629 We have previously addressed this question in cases involving foreseeability as an element of causation. In <em>LaCock v. 4B\u2019s Restaurants, Inc. </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 17, 919 P.2d 373, we addressed jury instructions given in a case involving an alleged intervening cause. We reversed for a new trial, concluding that the district court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury that the specific injury to the plaintiff need not have been foreseen, affected the plaintiffs substantial rights. We said that the jury should be instructed consistently with the provisions of \u00a7 27-1-317, MCA, which provides that the measure of damages for breach of an obligation not arising from contract \u201cis the amount which will compensate for all the detriment proximately caused thereby, <em>whether it could have been anticipated or not.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) We recently reaffirmed this principle in <em>Samson v. State, </em>2003 MT 133, \u00b6 26, 316 Mont. 90, \u00b6 26, 69 P.3d 1154, \u00b6 26, \u201cconfirming that in cases alleging an intervening cause, juries must be instructed that the specific injury to the plaintiff need not have been foreseen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\u00b630 A review of our case law reveals that the issue of whether the specific injury must be foreseeable has usually been addressed in cases in which intervening causation has been at issue. <em>See, e.g., Lopez v. Great Falls Pre-Release Services, Inc., </em>1999 MT 199, 295 Mont. 416, 986 P.2d 1081. However, in <em>Lopez </em>we did address foreseeability in the duty context. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-7\">Put simply, in analyzing foreseeability in the duty context, we look to whether or not the injured party was within the scope of risk created by the alleged negligence of the tortfeasor-that is, was the injured party a foreseeable plaintiff?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-8\"><em>Lopez, </em>\u00b6 28 (citations omitted). We can conceive of no reason why the rule regarding foreseeability of injury should be different in cases where foreseeability is an element of causation as opposed to an element of duty. We therefore reaffirm the principle that, in analyzing foreseeability, whether in the causation or duty context, the inquiry must be whether the defendant could have reasonably foreseen that his or her conduct could have resulted in an injury to the plaintiff. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>particular resulting injury need not have been foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">\u00b631  Returning to the case before us, as noted above, the District Court concluded as a matter of law that Defendants owed no duty to Hinkles because Rocky\u2019s injuries were not foreseeable. This was a decision properly before the trial court for resolution. We have held that, \u201cthe existence of a legal duty is a matter of law to be determined in the first instance by the trial court.\u201d <em>LaTray v. City of Havre, </em>2000 MT 119, \u00b6 18, 299 Mont. 449, \u00b6 18, 999 P.2d 1010, \u00b6 18 <em>(citing Nautilus Ins. Co. v. First Nat\u2019l Ins., Inc. </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 296, 299, 837 P.2d 409, 411.) Based upon the foregoing, we conclude that the District Court erred in determining no duty was owed because the court focused on the foreseeability of the particular injury as opposed to the foreseeability that Defendants\u2019 conduct could result in some injury to Rocky. However, we must still address the remaining question resolved on summary judgment, which is whether Hinkles\u2019 expert satisfied the causation element of Hinkles\u2019 negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\u00b632 2. Did the District Court err when it granted Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the basis that Hinkles\u2019 expert did not establish causation?</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">\u00b633 Even though a particular injury need not be foreseeable in the duty context, Hinkles still must prove the causation element of their negligence claim-i.e., that the claimed injury was caused by Defendants\u2019 conduct. Hinkles argue that the District Court erred when it concluded that Hinkles\u2019 expert did not establish that Defendants\u2019 actions caused Rocky\u2019s injuries. In its Order and Memorandum, the District Court indicated it was unable to determine from the pleadings the chain of causation upon which Hinkles relied. We likewise are unable to determine if Hinkles allege that Defendants caused Rocky to develop diabetes, or simply that their conduct accelerated or exacerbated a nascent medical condition, and whether this occurred because of the initial bus incident or because of the series of events which followed the bus incident. A further question is whether Hinkles allege that Rocky\u2019s PTSD resulted from the bus incident or the bus incident aftermath, or perhaps came about as a result of the stress he experienced from his traumatic and life-threatening bout of ketoacidosis, or from his having to deal with the stress of managing his diabetes, or some combination thereof. Unfortunately for Hinkles, this difficulty in framing the causation paradigm pervades not only the pleadings in this case, but also the medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>\u00b634 In its Order and Memorandum, the District Court concluded that expert testimony would be required for Hinkles to establish a causal connection between the alleged negligence of Defendants and Rocky\u2019s injuries. The District Court further concluded that, according to his deposition testimony, Dr. Gunville could not say that it was more likely than not that Rocky\u2019s ketoacidosis, Type I diabetes, or PTSD were a result of the actions of Defendants during the bus incident or its aftermath.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">\u00b635 Hinkles\u2019 ability to establish causation hinges on the testimony of their expert witness Dr. Gunville. Rule 702, M.R.Evid., provides, \u201cIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\u201d We have held that expert testimony is required when the issue presented is sufficiently beyond the common experience of the trier of fact and the expert testimony will assist the trier of fact in determining the issue or understanding the evidence. <em>Dayberry v. City of E. Helena, </em>2003 MT 321, \u00b6 17, 318 Mont. 301, \u00b6 17, 80 P.3d 1218, \u00b6 17. Here, Hinkles do not dispute that the development of ketoacidosis, Type I diabetes, and PTSD is beyond the common experience and understanding of the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">\u00b636  A medical expert\u2019s opinion is admissible if it is based on an opinion that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that the alleged wrongdoing caused the plaintiffs injury. <em>Butler v. Domin, </em>2000 MT 312, \u00b6 13, 302 Mont. 452, \u00b6 13, 15 P.3d 1189, \u00b6 13 (citations omitted). In <em>Butler, </em>we concluded that the district court correctly excluded the testimony of a medical expert who testified in his deposition that a particular injection \u201ccould have\u201d caused the plaintiffs injury. <em>Butler, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\u00b637 Hinkles point to a portion of Dr. Gunville\u2019s deposition, in which he testifies, \u201c[I]f Rocky suffered emotional distress, I can-I would never say that it did not cause harm to him. If he suffered emotional distress, I would have to say, as certain as anyone could state, that it would definitely cause harm.\u201d In their brief, Hinkles argue, \u201cDr. Gunville will testify that the stress <em>could have </em>accelerated the onset of, or agitated, Rocky\u2019s medical condition and at least caused Rocky harm.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">\u00b638  Hinkles\u2019 own argument concedes that Dr. Gunville\u2019s testimony would be that the stress <em>could have </em>had <em>something </em>to do with Rocky\u2019s medical condition. It <em>could have </em>accelerated or agitated it. As we held in <em>Butler, </em>this does not meet the threshold of establishing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Defendants\u2019 actions more likely than not caused the injuries claimed. Hinkles argue that the jury should be given the opportunity to hear expert testimony from both sides and be allowed to weigh the credibility of that testimony and draw its own conclusions.
