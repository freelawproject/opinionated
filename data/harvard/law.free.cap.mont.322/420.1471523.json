We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel failed to file a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">\u00b63 On March 21,2001, Highway Patrolman Myron Dingley saw a car parked off Highway 87 near the Alpha 1 missile access site. Officer Dingley pulled over to do a welfare check and noticed that the driver was slumped over into the passenger seat and that the motor was running. The officer knocked on the window but received no response. He knocked harder, and the driver, who was later identified as Raymond Maki (Maki), sat up and rolled down the window.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">\u00b64 Officer Dingley asked Maki to step out of the car, and as Maki did so, he nearly fell down. Dingley requested Maki to take field sobriety tests, but Maki did not appear to understand what Dingley was saying. Throughout the encounter, Maki seemed confused, off-balance and uncooperative, and he smelled of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">\u00b65 Officer Dingley arrested Maki and charged him with driving under the influence of alcohol in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA. Maki appeared <em>pro se </em>in Justice Court, filing a motion to dismiss the charge. Relying on statements made to him by a woman at Malstrom Air Force Base who told him that the area in which he was parked was an easement on the missile site, Maki argued that he was not on a \u201cway[] of this state open to the public\u201d as defined by \u00a7 61-8-101(1), MCA. The court apparently denied the motion and convicted Maki of the charge. The Justice Court sentenced him to six months in jail, all suspended save one day, plus a $500 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">\u00b66 Maki appealed to the District Court but was again convicted, this time by a jury, and he was sentenced to six months in jail, all suspended save fifteen days, plus a $500 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>\u00b67 Maki now appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\u00b68 <em>Did the defendant receive ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel failed to file a motion to dismiss?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\u00b69  The right to counsel in criminal prosecutions is guaranteed by the United States and Montana constitutions, and ineffective assistance of counsel may impinge the fundamental fairness of the proceeding being challenged. <em>State v. Henderson, </em>2004 MT 173, \u00b6 4, 322 Mont. 69, \u00b6 4, 93 P.3d 1231, \u00b6 4. In considering ineffective assistance of counsel claims, this Court has adopted the two-pronged test articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ-\">First, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is rehable. Unless a defendant makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction or death sentence resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-7\"><em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693; <em>see also State v. Turnsplenty, </em>2003 MT 159, \u00b6 14, 316 Mont. 275, \u00b6 14, 70 P.3d 1234, \u00b6 14. \u201cWhen a convicted defendant complains of the ineffectiveness of counsel\u2019s assistance, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687-88, 104 S.Ct. at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">\u00b610 We have recently declined to consider ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal where the record, as here, is silent as to why counsel made his decisions during the criminal proceeding. <em>See State v. Herrman, </em>2003 MT 149, \u00b6 33, 316 Mont. 198, \u00b6 33, 70 P.3d 738, \u00b6 33; <em>State v. St. John, </em>2001 MT 1, \u00b6 40, 304 Mont. 47, \u00b6 40, 15 P.3d 970, \u00b6 40. However, the issue of why Maki\u2019s counsel did not file a motion to dismiss is not relevant here because the substantive legal basis of Maki\u2019s argument cannot provide relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">\u00b611  Maki argues that his trial defense counsel should have filed a motion to dismiss the charge because Maki was not on a \u201cway[] of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>state open to the public\u201d as defined by \u00a7 61-8-101(1), MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-4\">61-8-101. Application-exceptions. (1) As used in this chapter, \u201cways of this state open to the public\u201d means any highway, road, alley, lane, parking area, or other public or private place adapted and fitted for public travel that is in common use by the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Section 61-8-401, MCA, under which Maki was charged, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">61-8-401. Driving under influence of alcohol or drugs. (1) It is unlawful and punishable, as provided in 61-8-442, 61-8-714, and 61-8-731 through 61-8-734, for a person who is under the influence of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\">(a) alcohol to drive or be in actual physical control of a vehicle upon the ways of this state open to the public;...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">However, because \u201cways of this state open to the public\u201d is an element of the offense defined by \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA, the issue was before the jury, and Maki had the opportunity to contest the point. He did not need to offer a motion to dismiss to raise this issue. Moreover, the jury necessarily decided as a matter of fact that Maki was on a \u201cway[] of this state open to the public\u201d in order to convict him of the offense charged, though Maki does not challenge this aspect of the jury\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">\u00b612  Therefore, Maki was neither prejudiced nor deprived of a fair trial by his counsel\u2019s failure to present a motion to dismiss. As an element of the offense, the public roadway question was placed at issue by the trial itself and resolved by the jury. Accordingly, we hold that Maki did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel failed to file a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">\u00b613 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b447-12\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
