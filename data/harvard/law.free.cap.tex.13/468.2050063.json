She saw Mr. Logan in defendant\u2019s room, after e upper one evening, holding a candle for defendant, while she was fixing on some part of her dress to go to the show that night; defendant\u2019s conduct towards Mr. Logan was very kind, loving and affectionate ; Mr. Simons had started to-South Carolina on business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-5\">On cross-examination this witness said that Mrs. Nancy Blackburn was at her house at the time. In answer to a ques-: tion whether defendant did not sleep with Mrs. Blackburn while at her house, witness said she did not; Mrs. Blackburn1 and defendant were intimate friends at that time. In answer to a question about the intention of defendant to go to the eastern part of the State, and about her being prevented from starting at a particular time, the stage being crowded, witness replied that she \u201c did not know; defendant had. left her house at the time, and was at her father\u2019s.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-6\">Mrs. Blackburn testified that she staid all night at Mr. Pi J.

In answer to <em>a </em>question whether defendant left witness\u2019 bed that night, and where she went to, witness replied, \u201c She slept in the same bed with me, and if she left \u201c the bed that night I did not know it. I never missed her \u201c during the night.\u201d Same month, witness saw defendant at Mrs. Gray\u2019s, and Cartwright Logan was there also; never saw any gentleman in defendant\u2019s room there, neither-by day nor by night.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-7\">\u25a0Cross-examined.

The defendant filed a petition for a writ of error, which, after describing the judgment and decree, continued,^61 and within the time prescribed by law your pe- \u201c titioner filed a motion for a new trial, which was overruled \u201c by the Court; all of which judgments, decrees and rulings \u201c of said Court are and were erroneous, and all of which said \u201c judgments, decrees and rulings of said Court, are hereby as- \u201c signed as error ; and your petitioner further assigns as error \u201c the granting of any judgment in favor of Paul J.

Leigh, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmK\">I. In all cases of divorce, the decree of the Court must be rendered upon full and satisfactory evidence, independent of the confessions or admissions of either party. Now it is apparent and clear that there is one link in the chain of evidence, necessary to the attainment of the object sought, wanting. Where is the record or the witness to prove that the parties were ever married <em>\\ </em>And will the Court grant a divorce when it does not appear from independent proof that the parties have been married ? The proof of such fact at the trial is indispensable. (6 Tex. R. 16.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-8\">II. Again: the evidence upon which the Court below acted, to my mind is not satisfactory. First, because the only witness who testified to the adultery was, according to his own representations, a party to the crime.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-9\">But observe in the statement of facts a- letter written by Mm to some gentleman. In this letter he declares and represents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Mrs. Simons, the plaintiff in error, to be a virtuous woman\u2014\u25a0 that he knew nothing against her, &amp;c. He is not obliged nor compelled to answer a question which may degrade him. Why, then, this change ? But hear the testimony of his sister Mrs. Blackburn. She states that she was on terms of intimacy with Mrs. Simons, and that she never saw anything criminal in her conduct, though she regarded it at sometimes as imprudent. Mrs. Gray seems to think her conduct imprudent, but saw nothing criminal. The letter abofe referred to, and the deposition of Mrs. Blackburn, go far to sustain the reputation of Mrs. Simons, and these ought, in my opinion, to be received in preference to the evidence of Logan. All the presumptions of law are in favor of innocence. As to the sufficiency of Logan\u2019s evidence to establish such a charge, see <em>2 </em>Greenleaf, page 43, Sec. 46, and the authorities cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-4\">HI. By examining the amended answer of the plaintiff in error, the Court will observe that she is desirous of obtaining a divorce, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-5\">But before concluding this brief, it may be proper to remark that the fact of the finding of the jury being in accordance with Logan\u2019s evidence should not prevent the Court from, taking a different view of the testimony, as it probably would do in ordinary cases. It is true that the statute requires that a jury shall pass upon the facts, but it is equally true that the testimony should be satisfactory to the Court. The Court must be satisfied as well as the jury.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b480-6\"><em>Yoakum ds </em>Branch, for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJ5Z\">We find no errors assigned here. The general statement in the petition for writ of error, assigning all the proceedings in the cause as error generally, is believed to be not such an assignment of errors as our statute contemplates.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b480-7\">Lipscomb, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAZ\">This was a suit brought by the defendant in error, against the plaintiff in error, for' a divorce from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>bonds of matrimony, on the ground of two distinct acts of adultery with one Cartwright Logan. There was a trial, and a verdict for the plaintiff, in the Court below, on which a decree was entered up, dissolving the bonds of matrimony subsisting between the parties. The defendant below, the wife, brings the decree before this Court for revision, and the insufficiency of the evidence to support the decree is assigned and mainly relied on to reverse the decree. The first ground of the insufficiency of proof is supposed to be in this, that the marriage of the parties at the time and place alleged in the petition was not proven. There can be no doubt but the fact of marriage ought to be proven, because, if there has been no marriage, there can be no divorce; (see Wright v. Wright, 6 Tex. 16;) but the answer in this case admits the marriage as charged and set out in the petition. The plaintiff in error supposes this admission of the wife, in her answer, cannot dispense with the proof of the fact by proper evidence; and he rests his objection on Art. 856, Hart. Dig. The portion of the Article relied on is as follows, i. e.: \u201cbut the decree of 66 the Court shall be rendered upon full and satisfactory evidence, independent-of the confession or admission of either \u201c party, and upon the verdict of the jury affirming the mate- \u201c rial facts alleged in the petition.55 That the averment of the marriage is material in the petition, is not an open question in this Court. In Wright v. Wright, above cited, the language of the Court is, \u201c The intermarriage of the plaintiff \u201c and defendant, and its continuance to the present time are \u201c alleged; there are essential preliminary averments, and their \u201c proof at the trial is indispensable.55 It being so material a fact, it must be proved at the trial independent of any admission or confession of the party.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">There is, however, another objection to the sufficiency of the evidence, more important because it goes to the grounds of the suit, the criminality of the defendant. The charge of adultery was not proven positively but by one witness, and to the disgrace of manhood, that witness the alleged paramour <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>in the adulterous intercourse. It could hardly be questioned that he might have refused to testify, because as a <em>particeps criminis, </em>he could not be required to inculpate himself; and farther, ifc might have been furnishing evidence against himself in a suit against him at the instance of the husband. Professor Greenleaf dismisses this kind of evidence in a very summary way. He says \u201cthe paramour is an admissible witness; but being <em>particeps criminis, </em>his evidence is but weak.\u201d (2 vol. Sec. 46.) It was not corroborated by any other witness or circumstance. Mrs. Gray testifies nothing that would be in the slightest degree incompatable with innocence; and the other female witness, called too by the plaintiff, and. sister to the alleged paramour, so far from criminating, exculpates her from the charge. If we were to stop here, this paramour\u2019s evidence, in the language of Professor Greenleaf, would be weak. But it seems that a letter was written by this witness and read in evidence, in which he puts the seal of condemnation and falsehood upon the charge, in the most emphatic terms. This letter, it is true, could not destroy the admissibility of Ms evidence, but it certainly renders that that was weak before, still weaker, and leads to a strong suspicion of his wish to acquire an infamous notoriety by boasting of favors never received. The sacred marriage bond can never be legally dissolved on a charge however grave, if only supported by such weak, flimsy and incredible testimony. We are disposed to question the propriety and policy of the rale even, admitting the paramour to the witness stand, under the iorand of infamy, as Professor Greenleaf\u2019s rule admits Mm. The question has not been viewed in all of its tendencies. He is only viewed as <em>a particeps </em>criminis, ready to swear to Ms own guilt; and if we were certain that such witness would be only called on when there was in truth guilt, it might well be allowed them to swear with the express understanding that their evidence was weak, and, without corroboration, would be insufficient to establish the fact of guilt. But we have reason to believe that such testimony would be often offered when there had been no guilt committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>We will suppose that when this witness is put upon the stand to prove the fact, if it is in his power to answer truthfully in the affirmative, the temptation to one who had a single spark of generous, manly, chivalric feeling to woman in his bosom, would be so strong to screan and protect the guilty fair one, that there would be imminent danger of his being driven to the commission of perjury. He would be further induced to adopt this alternative, from a knowledge of the fact, that if he answered in the affirmative he thereby fixed on himself the indelible seal of infamy, that would exclude him from the companionship of all men of honorable feeling. But suppose he was to refuse to answer, upon the ground that he could not do so without criminating himself, although by doing so, he could prevent a conviction of guilt, yet the female, by his silence, would have, in the opinion of the public, the seal of condemnation fixed on her reputation, never to be effaced. And this would be the result, even if she was in truth innocent, and the witness to play the part for which he was called, by an unkind and inhuman husband, to destroy the reputation of his innocent wife, by the witness standing mute when questioned, when if he had answered with truth, he could not have said anything against her innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Such being the effect of permitting such persons to take the witnesses stand, when it is conceded that he was barely admissible, and entitled to not much credit, we believe that policy forbids his being sworn at all in such eases, when the prospect of advancing the truth falls infinitely short of the evil that would be most likely to result from his swearing at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The decree must be reversed and the cause remanded to the Court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The filing the petition for <em>a </em>divorce, grounded upon the supposed adultery of the wife, is not, of itself, sufficient ground to support the cross-petition of the wife, praying to be divorced from her husband. If the husband should fail in Hs snitfor the divorce, and afterwards should continue to asperse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>her character, publicly denouncing her as an adulteress, how far such facts would sustain the wife\u2019s application for a divorce, would require some consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
