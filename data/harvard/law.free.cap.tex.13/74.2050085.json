Edward Toney.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b82-6\">Where the indictment was against Edward Toney Joseph Scott, late of Bastrop county, laborers, and Edward Toney pleaded in abatement that his name was Edward Toney and that he was never known as or called Edward Toney Joseph Scott, the plea in abatement was held good.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-7\">Appeal from Bastrop. This was an indictment against Edward Toney Joseph Scott, late of Bastrop county, laborers, for permitting gambling in a house kept for the retailing of spirituous liquors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-8\">Edward Toney pleaded in abatement, that his real name is Edward Toney, and that he was never known or called Edward Toney Joseph Scott. The plea was sustained. The indictment quashed, and the State appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b82-9\"><em>Attorney </em>General, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1\">The indictment, as the body of it shows, was jointly against Edward Toney and Joseph Scott, described in the indictment, as \u201c Edward Toney Joseph Scott, late of Bastrop county, laborers.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-10\">It would be difficult, if not altogether impracticable, to adduce any standard authority for holding that the trifling omission of the conjunction \u201c and \u201d between two several names of different defendants jointly indicted, while clearly distinguished by after-words in the same instrument, (as hereby the word \u201c laborers\u201d in the plural number,) amounts to misnomer, as a ground for abatement.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b82-11\">Hemphill, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AfT\">We are of opinion that there was no error in the judgment. If Edward Toney Joseph Scott be in fact two persons, it should have appeared with such certainty on the face of the indictment as not to be mistaken. We may infer that more than one person was intended from the addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>tion \u201c laborers\u201d being in the plural number, and from their being described as \u201c possessors and occupiers of a house,\u201d &amp;c. But this should have been made certain, and not left to inference. If Edward Toney Joseph Scott be two persons, there is no certainty upon the indictment as to their names. They might be Edward and Toney Joseph Scott\u2014or Edward Toney Joseph and Toney Joseph Scott\u2014or other changes might be rung on the name.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
