Action by the appellant, on a promise in writing by the appellee, to pay money to Edwin Waller or order, assigned to Thomas L. Bertrand and Gustavus A. Bertrand, assigned to Thomas L. Bertrand. This action was commenced on the 26th of February, 1851. On the 21st of February, 1848, one Jonathan D. Waters had sued the said T. L. and G. A. Bertrand on a promissory note, as assignee of the present defendant, who was the payee in the note. The Bertrands being then the holders of the claim now sued on, pleaded it in set-off, alleging that the assignment of the note to Waters was colorable only, or that at all events he had notice of their set-off when he obtained the note. There was a trial by jury in that case, and a verdict and judgment in favor of Waters for the full amount of the note. This judgment was pleaded by the defendant, as a bar to this action. The plea was not excepted to, but at the trial the plaintiff offered to prove by parol evidence, that the claim now sued on, although pleaded in the said former action, was not introduced in evidence, but was withdrawn and not submitted to to the jury, which the Court refused to permit, and instructed the jury that if they were \u201c satisfied from the testimony, that 61 the claim sued on is the one pleaded as a credit in the case \u201c of Jonathan D. Waters v. T. L. <em>&amp; </em>G. A. Bertrand, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>\u201c said T. L. Bertrand, one of the defendants in that suit is the \u201c plaintiff in this, then the plaintiff is barred by said plea and \u201c suit from recovering on the same in this suit.\u201d Yerdict and judgment for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b275-5\"><em>D. </em>D. Atchison, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AY3\">We contend that to bar a cause of action by former judgment, the former suit must have been between the same parties or their privies, and on the same points. (1 Stark. Ev. 217; Cheatum v. Chambers, 6 Rand. 86; Moore <em>v. </em>Cason, 1 How. Miss. 53; Eastman v. Cooper, 15 Pick. 276; Many v. Harris, 2 J. R. <em>24</em>; 1 Martin, 316; Neafir v. Neafir, 7 Johns. C. R. 1.) The Court erred in not allowing the appellant in the Court below to show by parol testimony that the obligation now sued on was withdrawn by leave of the Court and the counsel for Waters in the case referred to. (Jackson v. Swartwout, 8 Johns. R. 383; Philips v. Berrick, 16 Johns. R. 136; Wood v. Jackson, 8 Wend. 9.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b275-6\"><em>J. W. </em>Harris, also, for appellant</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b275-7\"><em>J. H. </em>Bell, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b275-8\">Wheeler, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AT7\">There is and can be no controversy as to the rule of law invoked by the defendant; that is, that a matter once litigated and determined by competent authority cannot a second time be brought in controversy between the same parties. In the concise and perspicuous language of Lord Chief Justice De Grey in the Duchess of Kingston\u2019s case, so universally quoted with approbation, \u201c the judgment of a \u201c Court of concurrent jurisdiction, directly upon the point, is, \u201casa plea, a bar; or as evidence, conclusive, between the \u201c same parties, upon the same matter, directly in question in \u201c another Court.\u201d But to give a judgment such effect, it is an essential element in the rule that there be an identity of parties. For it is a principle universally acknowledged, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>no one can, in general, be bound by a judgment, unless he be a party to the suit, or be in privity with the party. (1 Stark. Ev. 217 n.) \u201c It is (says Starkie) a general rule, that a ver- \u201c diet shall not be used as evidence against a man where the \u201c opposite verdict would not have been evidence for him ; in \u201c other words, the benefit to be derived from the verdict must \u201c be mutual. This (he adds) seems to be no more than a \u201c branch of the former rule, that to make the judgment con- \u201c elusive evidence, the parties must be the same; for then the \u201c benefit and prejudice would be mutual and reciprocal.\u201d (Id. 220.) cl Both the litigants must be alike concluded, or \u201c the proceedings cannot be set up as conclusive upon either.\u201d (1 Greenl. Ev. See. 524.)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Are the parties to the present suit the same as the parties to the judgment relied on by the defendant as a bar to the action ? Is the present defendant concluded by the proceedings in the former suit ? Clearly not. He was not a party to that suit. He was not made a party in any of the forms known to the law. The answer of the defendants in that suit did not make him a party to the suit. Hot being a party to the record, he is not concluded by the judgment; and as it is essential that in order to be binding its operation be mutual, neither can the plaintiff in this action he concluded by that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">It is insisted that the plaintiff is estopped by the averments in his answer in the former suit, from denying that the defendant was a party to that suit. It might be replied that the judgment on which he relies as imparting absolute verity, is an adjudication of the contrary. That averment was as certainly controverted and pnt in issue in the former suit, as any other averment in the answer; and was as certainly negatived and adjudged to be untrue by the judgment of the Court in that case. The plaintiff must have an equal right with the defendant, to insist upon the verity and conclusiveness of that adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">It is evident the defendant was not a party to the former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>judgment; and ifc cannot avail him, either as a plea in bar, or as evidence in this suit. The instructions and judgment of the Court, maintaining the contrary, are therefore erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-3\">It is true, the plaintiff sought to recover his demand of the plaintiff in the former suit; and that he failed to establish the liability of the latter. But because the plaintiff in that suit, who was not a party to the contract and is not a party to this suit, was not liable upon the contract here sued on, ifc is neither a legal nor logical deduction that the present defendant is not. The plaintiff may have misconceived Ms remedy, and prosecuted his demand against the wrong party; but sorely he is not thereby precluded from suing the right one.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Be versed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
