Where the Government permitted its military airplanes to fly SO' low over plaintiffs\u2019 land as to' deprive plaintiffs of use and .enjoyment of their land for purposes of raising chickens, there was a \u201ctaking\u201d, so as to entitle plaintiffs to recover just compensation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-10\">2. Market value fairly determined is the normal measure of recovery in condemnation proceedings, and that value may reflect the use to which the property could readily be converted as well as the existing use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APJV\">3. Landowner owns at least as much or the airspace above ground as he can occupy or use in connection with the'land, and the fact that he does not occupy it in physical sense by erection of buildings and the like is not material.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-13\">4. The meaning of \u201cproperty\u201d, as used in the Fifth Amendment prohibiting the talcing of private property for public use without just compensation, is a \u201cFederal -question\u201d, but it will normally obtain its content by reference to local law, and in the instant case a holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>that flights by army airplanes over plaintiffs\u2019 land constituted a \u201ctaking\u201d, so as to entitle them to just com-Sensation, was not inconsistent with the local law of forth Carolina governing landowners\u2019 claim to immediate reaches of the superadjacent airspace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-5\">5.Flights by airplanes of the Federal Government over private lands are not a \u201ctaking\u201d, so as to entitle owner to just compensation, unless they are so low; and so frequent as to be a direct and immediate interference' with the enjoyment and use of the land.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-6\">6.A claim for taking of private land by the Government is a \u201cclaim founded upon the Constitution\u201d and is within the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims to determine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-7\">7.On certiorari from the Supreme Court to the Court of Claims, a deficiency in findings of fact by the Court of Claims cannot be rectified by statements in its opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-8\">8.On certiorari from the Supreme Court to the Court of Claims, the Supreme Court will not examine the evidence to determine whether it would support a finding of fact, if such finding had been made by the Court of Claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-9\">9.Where the Court of Claims in the instant case held that an easement was taken but its findings of fact contained no description as to whether the easement taken was permanent or temporary, it would be premature for the Supreme Court to consider whether the amount of award made by the Court of Claims was proper.</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b883-10\">In a dissenting opinion,</p>\n<judges id=\"A05\">in which Mr. Justice Burton joined,</judges>\n<author id=\"A2V\">Mr. Justice Black</author>\n<p id=\"AqAa\">concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">In my opinion this case should be reversed on the ground that there has been no \u201ctaking\u201d in the constitutional sense.</p>\n<judges id=\"b883-12\">Mr. Justice Jackson took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
