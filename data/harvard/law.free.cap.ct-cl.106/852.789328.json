The narrow question involved is whether a contractor\u2019s failure to exhaust the administrative appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>provisions of a Government contract bars Mm from bringing suit in the Court of Claims to recover damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-3\">2. When the contractor chooses without due cause to ignore the provisions of Article 15 (of the standard Government construction contract) he destroys his right to sue for damages in the Court of Claims. That court is then obliged to outlaw his claims, whatever may be their equity. To do otherwise is to rewrite the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-4\">3. Both the dispute over the footing excavations and the dispute over the bricklayers\u2019 wages were \u201cquestions arising under this contract\u201d within the meaning of Article 15.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-5\">4. Where provision in Government construction contract for automatic increase of contract price by reason of increase in wages did not come into operation because wage increase was not established by Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works as required, the authority of contracting officer to direct the wage increase and the effect of ruling of Board of Labor Review purporting to fix prevailing wages to apply to another contract within vicinity where contract was being performed, presented questions on which contractor should have secured an administrative determination, pursuant to provisions in the contract, before resorting to the courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-6\">5. In this instance no justifiable excuse is apparent for respondent\u2019s failure to exhaust the appeal provisions of Article 15. Certainly the reasons relied upon by the Court of Claims are lacking in merit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-7\">6. Respondent having failed to avail itself of the procedure created by Article 15 for the settlement of disputes arising under the contracts, it was precluded from bringing suit on such matters in the Court of Claims. And the Court of Claims erred in entertaining and deciding the claims involving those disputes.</blockquote>\n<judges id=\"b881-8\">Mr. Justice Douglas filed an opinion dissenting, in part, in which Mr. Justice Frankfurter and Mr. Justice Rutledge joined.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b881-9\">Mr. Justice Jackson took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
