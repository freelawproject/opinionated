Enforcement of the restrictive covenants would deny defendants the equal protection of the law and would therefore violate the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">2. The covenants are void because they are contrary to the public good and to public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">Agreements such as these here involved have heretofore been held to constitute a lawful exercise of the freedom to contract and as such to be enforceable by court action. <em>(Los Angeles Investment Co. </em>v. <em>Gary </em>(1919), 181 Cal. 680, 683-684 [186 P. 596, 9 A.L.R. 115]; <em>Wayt </em>v. <em>Patee </em>(1928), 205 Cal. 46, 49-50 [269 P. 660]; <em>Littlejohns </em>v. <em>Henderson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>(1931) , 111 Cal.App. 115, 118 [295 P. 95]; <em>Letteau </em>v. <em>Ellis </em>(1932) , 122 Cal.App. 584, 587 [10 P.2d 496]; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1944), 66 Cal.App.2d 264, 269 [152 P.2d 19]; <em>Shideler </em>v. <em>Roberts </em>(1945), 69 Cal.App.2d 549, 557 [160 P.2d 67]; see also <em>Fairchild </em>v. <em>Raines </em>(1944), 24 Cal.2d 818, 827 [151 P.2d 260].) However, on May 3, 1948, the Supreme Court of the United States in the cases of <em>Shelley </em>v. <em>Kraemer </em>and <em>McGhee </em>v. <em>Sipes, </em>334 U.S. 1 [68 S.Ct. 836, 92 L.Ed. -]; 16 Law Week 4426 (see also <em>Hurd </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>May 3, 1948, 334 U.S. 24 [68 S.Ct. 847, 92 L.Ed. -] ; 16 Law Week 4432), resolved in defendants\u2019 favor the first of the above stated contentions. In the Shelley and McGhee eases the plaintiffs sought the enforcement of racial covenants similar in essential aspects to those now before us. The court held: \" [p. 4428 of 16 Law Week] We conclude . . . that the restrictive agreements standing alone cannot be regarded as a violation of any rights guaranteed to petitioners [defendants] by the Fourteenth Amendment. So long as the purposes of those agreements are effectuated by voluntary adherence to their terms, it would appear clear that there has been no action by the State and the provisions of the Amendment have not been violated. . . . But here there was more. These are cases in which the purposes of the agreements were secured only by judicial enforcement by state courts of the restrictive terms of the agreements. . . . [p. 4431] Upon full consideration, we have concluded that in these cases the States have acted to deny petitioners the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d It follows that the judgments here appealed from must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">The judgment in each case is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
