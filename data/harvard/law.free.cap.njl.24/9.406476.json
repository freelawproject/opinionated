Stat.. </em>125), it is an indictable offence for the cashier of au incorporated bank of this state to convert to his own use bank notes, the property of the said corporation, with intent wrongfully to make use of the same, and it is not necessary to allege that such notes were intrusted to him. as cashier.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b21-9\">2. It is not necessary, in an indictment for such offence, to charge either that the cashier <em>embezzled </em>the notes, or that he took them with <em>intent to defraud the corporation.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b21-10\">3.

It is not necessary to aver the value of coins of the government; they have a value established by law, of which courts will take notice.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b21-14\">7.

C., c. </em>25, \u00a7 60.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-17\">III. The indictments in this case are defective, <em>in point of form, </em>in the following particulars :</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-18\">1. In the specification of time, no year is alleged. The abbreviation <em>\u201cA. </em>D.\u201d is used. Such abbreviations are not sufficient in an indictment or any other pleading. <em>Rev. Stat. </em>991, \u00a7 17; 1 <em>Chit. Crim. Law </em>217, 176.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-19\">2. Yo <em>venue </em>is laid for several material facts, as\u2014 <em>[a) </em>the fact that defendant was cashier at the time of the offence; (6) the fact that he was cashier when he converted to his use.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-20\">3. A wrong <em>venue </em>is laid in the first two indictments for the commission of the offence charged, <em>viz: \u201cat the township </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number><em>of Paterson.\u201d </em>There was no such township when the indictments were found. <em>Charter of the city of Paterson, Statute Laws of </em>1851, 444.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-5\">4. <em>The articles alleged to have been converted are not specified with sufficient certainty. </em>The only description (except in the first cotint of the 3d indictment) is as follows: \u201c $19,000 <em>of money and </em>$19,000 <em>of bank notes \u201d </em>of the said incorporated company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-6\">5. This description is defective, both as to the <em>money </em>and as to the <em>bank notes. </em>1 <em>Chit. Crim. Law </em>235-6; 3 <em>Ib. </em>947; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>3 <em>Maule &amp; Sel. </em>539. (This case shows the utmost verge to which the courts have gone in dispensing with certainty.) <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Furneaux, Russ. &amp; Ry. </em>335; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Frye, Ib. </em>482; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Tyer, Ib. </em>404.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-7\">The British parliament passed an act (7 and 8 Geo. IV., c. 29, \u00a7 48,) for the purpose of allowing a more general mode of statement in cases of embezzlement. <em>Archb. Crim. Pl. and Ev. </em>383; <em>Act Do. Appx. </em>48.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-8\">Before the passage of that act it was necessary to set forth specifically some one or more articles. <em>Archb. Cr. Pl. and Ev. </em>263 <em>(ed. </em>1840); 5 <em>C. &amp;. P. </em>300, under this act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-9\">[N. B. The precedents referred to by Mr. Barkalow, in 3 <em>Chit. Crim. Law </em>962, are taken from or founded on the precedent in <em>Russ. &amp; Ry. </em>62,- which is expressly referred to by Chitty for his authority. But this precedent was overruled in' the subsequent cases in <em>Russ. &amp; Ry., </em>to wdiich reference has been made.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-10\">The legislature of Massachusetts also passed an act, in 1834, to authorize generality in the statement of the offence. <em>Whart. Amer. Crim. Law </em>423.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-11\">All which goes to show what the common law rule, <em>as to certainty, </em>and as applied to the statutory offence of embezzlement, was, and yet is.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-12\">The state, under these indictments, would at the trial have a wide and indefinite range, and would not be confined to what the grand jury had specifically in view. We say they ought to have designated with such certainty that we could prepare our defence. As it is, we may be prepared for one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>case which we suppose to have been indicated, and at the trial we may be surprised by an entirely di\u00ed\u00edereut ease.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-5\">IV. The indictments are defective in point of substance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-6\">1. <em>It does not appear by the indictments that the bank was defrauded, or that there toas any intent to defraud it.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-7\"><em>We </em>contend that this <em>must </em>appear, either from the character of the acts charged or by direct averment. The <em>title </em>of the act under which the indictments are found is thus: \u201cAn act to punish <em>frauds committed on the incorporated banks of this state </em>,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-8\">The whole scope and evident intent of the act indicate the same thing. It is not for defrauding other persons or injuring other persons, but for <em>defrauding and injuring </em>the bank, of which the accused is an officer, that so severe a punishment is provided.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-9\">How the indictments charge that the defendant, being cashier, converted to his own use $19,000 of money and $19,000 of bank notes of the said incorporated company, the property of the bank, with intent wrongfully to make use of the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-10\">The bank notes are alleged to have been the notes of the Paterson Bank itself. These notes were valueless (except as so much printed paper) when not in circulation. .It does not appear, by the indictment, that the defendant put them into circulation. It therefore does not appear that the bank was injured or defrauded one dollar. The act of the legislature is certainly not directed against the conversion of bank notes that have been redeemed, and that have no value as money; but only against a conversion or embezzlement of the \u201c funds,\u201d the \u201c moneys \u201d of the bank, that which has value as \u201c money,\u201d otherwise a clerk or officer could be convicted of a \u201chigh misdemeanor\u201d for kindling his fire with old bank notes that have been long ago redeemed and laid aside.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-11\">Therefore, as the bauk notes alleged to have been converted were the notes of the bank itself, such a conversion of them should have been shown <em>(viz. </em>by putting them into circulation) as would have a tendency to defraud the bank. As nothing of this kind is shown, except by intendment, nay, as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>is not shown even by intendment, the indictments are fatally defective.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-5\">The mention of \u201cmoneys\u201d in the same count in every ease cannot save the indictments. If the count is bad in part, it is bad in whole. I can find no such authority to the contrary, as mentioned by Mr. Barkalow. The authority to which he referred, I think, must have been this, that only part of what is charged need be proved. But then all the charges made must be legal. It is not like the case of a general verdict of guilty on several counts, some of which are good and some bad. Here each count is bad. What judgment can this court render, so as to direct the court of trial to receive evidence under part of a count and not under the whole of it ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-6\">, These remarks, of course, do not apply to the first count of the third indictment; that count is erroneous on other grounds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4\">- 2. It does not appear by the indictments that the acts charged were committed by the defendant in his official capacity as cashier; in other words, it does not appear that he obtained the funds converted, or that he had possession of them .as cashier.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-8\">We contend that this is necessary to constitute the offence which the legislature had in view.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-9\">The criminality of the offence of embezzlement by cashiers and other bank officers resides materially in the great trust and confidence reposed in them as officers of the bank. It was, undoubtedly, this sort of criminality which the legislature intended to punish, and it exists only in cases where the funds embezzled or converted came into the hands' or possession of the accused in his official capacity. Hence, we say, it must be alleged that he had them, or came by them as cashier.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-10\">The words of the act are \u201c purloin, embezzle, or convert to his own use;\u201d and although they are connected together disjunctively, so as to make, by a strict reading, \u201cpurloining,\u201d <em>\u201c </em>embezzling,\u201d and \u201c conversion \u201d distinct offences, yet they are rather to be viewed as variations of phraseology used by the legislature to describe and point out substantially one and the same offence. Persons holding a fiduciary capacity, like bank officers, and embezzling or converting to their own use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>moneys intrusted to them in that capacity, could not be convicted of larceny at common law. It amounted only to a breach of trust. This is the offence which the legislature intended to reach; this the mischief which the law was intended to remedy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-5\">Now, to constitute this offence, it is not only necessary that the offender should hold the confidential relation of an officer of the bank, but that he should take advantage of his position, as such officer, to perpetrate the offence; that is, it most be shown that he had or obtained possession of the moneys as cashier or other officer of the bank.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-6\">It will not do to follow the dry letter of the act, the scope and spirit of it most be regarded in framing an indictment upon it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-7\">What is the object of the act? Is it not plainly this, to punish bank officers who take advantage of the trust which the stockholders and the public are obliged to repose in them?</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-8\">To make them liable to this punishment, therefore, must it not be shown that they had or obtained the missing funds in consequence or by virtue of their office; or, at least, that they knew them to be the funds of the, bank, and that, having such possession or knowledge, they converted them to their .own use ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-9\">This has always been my reading and understanding of the statute. It seems to me to be as much involved in it as though it had been expressly stated. Suppose that one of the directors of the bank should receive, in trust for a special purpose or a deposit, a sum of money from a third person, who had purloined it from the bank without the knowledge of such director, would that director be criminally liable under this act if he should use such money for his own purposes ? Certainly not. And yet it would be the money of the bank, and he would convert it to his own use, with intent wrongfully to make use of the same; and an indictment drawn precisely as these indictments are would be true.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-10\">This illustration shows most conclusively that if these indictments are good, an innocent man might be convicted under them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>The grand fault lies here. The indictments fail to show that the cashier had or obtained, the moneys as cadiier, or that he knew them to be the moneys of the bank, or that he converted them with intent to defraud the bank. We insist that at least one of these allegations, if not more, should have been contained in the indictments.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-5\">3. The first count of the third indictment, besides that it is open to the last objection equally with the others, is fatally erroneous in another particular. It charges a wrongful conversion of a certain promissory note.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-6\">Now the act does not speak of promissory notes, nor is a promissory note within its purview. The language of the act is, \u201c convert to his own use any money, bank bill, or note.\u201d This language clearly refers to no other notes than bank notes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-7\">The 45th section of the crimes act, <em>Rev. Stat. </em>269, has the same expression, and goes on to enumerate bills of exchange, orders, promissory notes, &amp;c., as distinct species of securities. This appears to be so plain a matter, that it is hardly worth while to spend words about it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-8\">[The prosecutor admitted that it had not occurred to him, and intimated, as I understood him, that this count was not, in his opinion, tenable.]</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b30-9\"><em>D. Barkalow, </em>for the state.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-10\">I. As to the allegation of time and place, it is designated with sufficient certainty; the letters A. D. have a known English signification, and are well understood by every one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-11\">II. As to the alleged defect in the description of the subject matter of the offence. The offence is laid in the words of the statute by which it is created, and it is a settled rule that such description is sufficient. All that is required in an indictment is a certainty to a common intent. <em>Arch. Cr. Pl. &amp; Ev. </em>40, 41, and 43.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-12\">These, indictments, in this particular, are according to the established and approved forms of English indictments under their embezzlement acts. <em>Arch.

Law </em>1020.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>It is sufficient in such indictments if they have all the certainty the subject matter is capable of. <em>Arch. Cr. Pl. &amp; Ev. </em>42, 45.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>6 <em>Mass. </em>337, it was held, on an indictment for larceny, that \u201c a bank note at the value of ten dollars of the goods and chattels of N.

Stat. </em>125. By that section, it is enacted, \u201c that if any director of any incorporated bank in this state, or any cashier, book-keeper, or other officer or agent of any such bank, shall knowingly overdraw his account with the bank of which he shall be director, cashier, book-keeper, officer, or agent, for his own private use or benefit, or <em>shall purloin, embezzle, or convert to his own use any money, bank bill or note, the property of the said corporation, with intent to defraud, the said corporation, or wrongfully to make use of the same, </em>in every such case the person so offending shall be judged guilty of a high misdemeanor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">All the counts of these indictments charge, in substance, that the defendant, being cashier of the Peoples Bank of Paterson, did unlawfully convert to his own use certain money, bank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>bills and notes, the property of the said corporation, Avith intent to defraud the same. The defendant demurs, both for lack of form and of substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">In relation to offences created by statute, the statute contains a definition of the offence. The offence consists in the commission of certain acts under specified circumstances, and in some cases Avith a particular intent, and an indictment founded on the statute must with certainty and precision charge the defendant Avith having committed or omitted the acts, under the circumstances and with the intent mentioned in the statute. <em>Archb. Crim. Plead. </em>(1st <em>Am. ed.) </em>23.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The statute makes the offence which forms the siibject matter of these indictments to consist in the purloining, embezzling, or converting to his own use, by the cashier of any incorporated bank in this state, money, bank bills or notes, the property of the said corporation, Avith intent to defraud the said corporation or wrongfully to make use of the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">So far as the ingredients which compose the offence are concerned, they are all set out in the indictment literally or substantially in the words of the statute. It is averred that the defendant Avas the cashier of an incorporated bank in this state, incorporated by the laAvs of this state, and that, being such cashier at the time of the commission of the offence charged in the indictment, he did convert to his OAvn use money and bank notes, the property of the said bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">It is insisted, hoAveAmr, that although the indictment has used the language of the act, it has not described the offence which the legislature designed to punish; that the indictment should have alleged not merely that the defendant was cashier at the time of the commission of the offence, but that he committed the act charged against him in his fiduciary capacity; that the funds were intrusted to him in such capacity, and that in the commission of the offence he abused the confidence reposed in him as cashier. It is further insisted that, as the indictment does not charge an <em>embezzlement </em>by the use of a phrase of technical import, it should have charged that the defendant converted the funds to his own use, Avith <em>intent to defraud the corporation. </em>The objection resolves itself into this, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number><em>viz. </em>that the only offence which the legislature designed to prohibit was embezzlement by the cashier of the property of the corporation with which he was intrusted.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The answer, and it would seem the decisive answer to this objection, is, that the statute does not make either of the facts, the omission of which forms the subject of the objection, an ingredient in the offence. The indictment charges the defendant with having committed the act charged under the circumstances and with the intent mentioned in the statute. If the terms used in the statute, <em>ex vi terminorum, </em>import the existence of any other ingredient or element in the constitution of the offence, the language of the indictment must necessarily have the same import. If no other element than that expressed in the statute is necessarily implied in its language, it cannot be necessary in the indictment to aver the existence of any other element.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Admitting, for the sake of the argument, that the terms of the statute are broader in their application than necessity or sound policy would dictate, it must be conceded that the introduction of the averments, alleged to be essential, into the indictment would materially narrow the prohibition of the statute, and introduce into the offence an ingredient not specified by the legislature. If the language of the statute was of doubtful import, the force of the objection might be admitted. The statute must be strictly construed. But when the terms of the \u00e1ct are clear and unequivocal, there is no authority by which courts may narrow its prohibition or limit its operation. It is not pretended that there is any ambiguity in the language of the statute. It is conceded, indeed, that, in order to sustain the objection, the court must alter the language of the statute, so that <em>embezzling </em>by the cashier, and <em>converting to his own use, </em>shall constitute but one offence. The plain terms of the act have a different import. And the legislature may well have considered that the public welfare and sound policy demanded that the, act should be as broad in its prohibitions and as penal in its sanctions as its language plainly imports.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">It is further insisted that the offence itself is not charged with sufficient certainty and minuteness;, that although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>facts which constitute the crime be set forth in the words of the statute, yet the circumstances which give individuality to the crime are not stated with such certainty and precision as to apprize the defendant of the particular offence with which he stands charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The general rule is, that in indictments for misdemeanors created by statute, it is sufficient to charge the offence in the words of the statute. 1 <em>Arch. Crim. Pl. </em>213, 214; <em>United States </em>v. Mills, 7 <em>Peters </em>142; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lacoste, </em>2 <em>Mason </em>141; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lancaster, 2 McLean </em>250; <em>The People </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>3 <em>Denio </em>93. But the rule, though general, admits of many exceptions. In all cases the offence must be set forth with clearness and all necessary certainty to apprize the party accused of the offence with which he stands charged. \u201c It dotli not seem,\u201d says Hawkins, \u201c to be always sufficient to pursue the very words of the statute, unless by so doing you fully, directly, and expressly allege the fact in the doing or not doing whereof the offence consists without the least uncertainty or ambiguity.\u201d 2 <em>Hawk. P. C., Book </em>2, <em>cap. 25, </em>\u00a7 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">In an indictment against a servant for embezzlement, it is not sufficient to charge that money or bank bills were delivered to the defendant by his master, and that he withdrew himself from his master with intent to defraud, but the indictment must specify the article delivered, its nature, and the name of the master. 3 <em>Chitty\u2019s Crim. Law </em>980; <em>Archb. Crim. Pl. </em>156. So where a statute makes the malicious killing of cattle felony, it is not enough to charge the defendant with killing cattle, but the species and the number must be stated. <em>Archb. Crim. Pl. </em>24.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Some degree of individuality, it is admitted, must be given to the offence with which the defendant is charged. How much, is a question of some difficulty and embarrassment, in regard to which it is difficult to reconcile all the cases in the books. The certainty should be such as to identify the offence, so that the defendant may know what crime he is called upon to answer, and that he may plead the conviction or acquittal in lieu of another indictment for the same offence. But the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>particularity required is not such as to screen the offender from conviction or to embarrass the prosecution with useless technicalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">It is clear that it would not be sufficient, in an indictment upon the statute now under consideration, to charge, in the words of the statute, that the defendant did convert to his own use money and bank notes, the property of the bank. There must be some description, either of number, denomination, or value, by which the particular offence charged may be, to' some extent at least, identified. The allegation of time and place does not materially aid the description, for although essential, it is not necessary that they be truly alleged. In indictments for larceny or embezzlement, it is usual to allege the species, the number, and the value of the articles stolen or embezzled. Thus in an indictment for stealing or embezzling bank notes, the familiar form of the charge is, that the defendant took nine bank notes Yor the payment of five dollars each, and of the value of five dollars each; or if the particular notes cannot be described, then the form of the averment is, that he took nine bank notes for the payment of divers sums of money, amounting in the whole to the sum of $500 and of the value of $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">In one count of these indictments it is charged that the defendant unlawfully converted to his own use $19,000 of money and $19,000 of bank notes. The count is clearly bad for uncertainty. It contains no description, either of the number or the denomination of the coin or of the notes. The charge is, not that the defendant converted 19,000 coins, or coins amounting to the value of $19,000, but that he converted $19,000 of money. The design of the pleader probably was to charge the conversion of money or coin, amounting in value to $19,000, but that is not the charge as made. Can a charge of converting $10,000 in coins be sustained by proving that the defendant converted coins of other denominations to the value of $10,000 ? If the charge was that the defendant had converted 10,000 half dollars, that charge would not be sustained by proving the conversion of 20,000 quarters or of 50,000 dimes. It would be, to say the least, doubtful whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>the charge contained in this could be sustained by any other proof than that of converting 20,000 coined dollars, and the doubt results from the fact, that the charge itself lacks the requisite legal - precision. It is doubtful whether the pleader meant to charge the conversion of 20,000 coined dollars, or the conversion of coins of other denominations amounting to $20,-000. The phrase may well bear either import.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">No such uncertainty could arise from charging in an indictment in England the conversion or embezzlement of \u00a320,000 of money, because there is no such coin as a pound. It has no physical existence, but is a mere expression of value in computation, and hence the charge of stealing or embezzling twenty pounds is bad. The charge must be, that the defendant stole so many shillings or guineas, or at lea-t coins, of the value of \u00a320. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Fry, </em>1 <em>Rus &amp; Ryan </em>481.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">But the term dollar is both the name of a coin and an expression of value, and hence the charge of embezzling $20,000 of coin is uncertain and vicious. It may be that the phrase used has an import which is sufficiently intelligible in common parlance; but in criminal pleading, in a charge involving personal character and liberty, the dictates of justice, no less than the rules of good pleading, require that the charges should be made with such precision as to admit of no uncertainty. This objection extends to all the counts which charge the conversion of money and bank notes, except the second count of the third indictment. That count charges the conversion of bank notes amounting to the sum of $7000. But in this count, as in the others, there is no averment of the <em>number </em>of the notes, and, what is more material, there is no averment of their <em>value. </em>The same objection extends to two counts of the first indictment. They charge the conversion of $19,000 of bank notes, without alleging that they possessed any value whatever. It is certainly true that it is not necessary to state the value of coin, because every genuine current coin of the government has a fixed value by law, of which the courts will take notice. It is also true that the offence do.es not depend upon the <em>value </em>of the notes embezzled or converted in violation of the statute. It is equally an offence by the statute to convert ten dollars or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>ten thousand dollars. Nor does it seem to be clearly settled that it is necessary in an indictment to charge the value of personal chattels which are the subject of a misdemeanor, except When they constitute, as in larceny, an ingredient in the crime. But the subject of the offence must possess some value. To embezzle or convert the notes of a broken bank which are perfectly valueless, cannot constitute the offence contemplated in this statute. The object of the statute is to guard against frauds, and to protect the funds of the corporation against embezzlement or unlawful conversion by its officers. To embezzle or convert waste paper is not a crime within the purview of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The twenty-first section of the act of Congress of the third of March, 1825, (3 <em>Story\u2019s Laws U. S. </em>1985) provides that if any person employed in any of the departments of the post office establishment shall secrete, embezzle, or destroy any letter, packet,' bag, or mail of letters with which he shall be intrusted, or which shall come to his possession, and are intended to be conveyed by post, containing any bank note or bank post bill, he shall, on conviction, be subject to fine and imprisonment. The twenty-fourth section of the act subjects to the same penalties those who shall procure and advise or assist in doing or perpetrating any of the crimes forbidden by the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">In indictments for violations of this statute, it has been deemed not necessary to describe either the letter embezzled or destroyed, or the notes contained in it. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>7 <em>Peters </em>138; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lancaster, </em>2 <em>McLean </em>431.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Taking the notes, the court say, does not constitute the principal offence. The main offence is the violation of the sanctity of the mail: a description of the notes is therefore unnecessary. But a counterfeit note, being of no value, or a note on a bank which never existed or which is wholly insolvent, would not constitute the offence under the statute. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nott, </em>1 <em>McLean </em>505.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">In the present case, the conversion of the notes constitutes the principal offence. That the notes should be of some value, is an essential ingredient in the constitution of the offence. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>is clear, therefore upon principle, that in charging the conversion of bank notes, which <em>per se </em>contain no intrinsic value, the indictment must contain an express averment of value.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Upon one or the other of the grounds stated, all the counts charging the defendant with the conversion of money or bank notes are defective in form.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The first count of the third indictment charges the defendant with converting to his own use <em>a promissory note </em>made by individuals for $1000. The statute creating the offence makes it penal for the cashier of any incorporated bank to convert to his own use any <em>money, bank bill or note, </em>the property of the said corporation, with intent, <em>&amp;c. </em>The offence charged in this count of the indictment is neither within the words nor the meaning of the statute. The phrase \u201c <em>bank bill or note\u201d </em>means bank bill or bank note. This ellipisis of the adjective is not only familiar in oral discourse, but in formal writing, and is in strict accordance with the rules of grammatical construction. The prohibition of the statute extends only to bank bills or bank notes, and not to promissory notes or other commercial paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">The legislature have frequently used the same phraseology in a way to leave no doubt as to their meaning. Thus the act for the punishment of crimes <em>(Rev. Stat. </em>271, \u00a7 48,) makes criminal the forging or counterfeiting of any <em>bank bill or note, </em>check, draft, bill of exchange, or <em>promissory note </em>for the payment of money. And the same act, section 69, prohibits the destroying of any <em>bank bill or note, </em>check, draft, bill of exchange, or <em>promissory note </em>for the payment of money; and in sections 43 and 45 of the same act, the same phraseology is used, manifestly with the same import.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">This construction is in accordance with the manifest intent and spirit of the prohibition. The design of' the statute was to make the embezzlement of coins and of bank notes, (of money, strictly so called, and of the ordinary substitute for money) either of which may with facility be purloined or embezzled by the officers of the bank. Promissory notes for the payment of money, which may be readily identified and their fraudulent embezzlement or conversion detected and proved, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>are neither within the letter nor meaning of the prohibition. Checks, drafts, and other commercial paper are as liable to embezzlement as promissory notes, and would doubtless have been enumerated, had either of them been within the contemplation of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The statute is highly penal. It makes criminal acts which are neither <em>mala in se </em>nor prohibited by the common law. It must be strictly construed, and its prohibitions be confined within the letter of the act. This count is bad in substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">There must be judgment for the defendant upon the demurrers to all the indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Justices Ogden and Potts concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">Cited <em>in Lair </em>v. <em>Killmer, </em>1 <em>Dutch. </em>525; <em>State </em>v. <em>Malloy, </em>5 <em>Vr. </em>413.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
