Being in the exercise of a special statutory jurisdiction, and the statute not authorizing the judges to seal bills of exception in such cases, the paper offered is nothing more than a mere voluntary return of a state of facts, made by the court wjthout any legal authority, by which, of course, the adverse party is not bound, and being objected to, it cannot be received. The proper course to get the facts before the court above, on <em>certiorari, </em>is to take a rule upon the court below to certify 'what the facts were, in the first instance, and then if the court fail to certify, a resort may be had to a rule for affidavits. <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Beatty, </em>3 <em>Zab. </em>259.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">Ogden, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-14\">Cited <em>in Parsell </em>v. <em>State, </em>1 <em>Vr. </em>549.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
