JOSEPH W. RECKLESS.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b439-7\">By a discharge in bankruptcy a debt is extinguished ; it cannot, he revived, hut may be the consideration of a new promise or agreement; but conversations liad by the bankrupt after his discharge, in which he declares his intention to pay the debt, will not amount to a promise.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-8\">This was an action on a promissory note for $124, dated April 1, 1842, payable in one year, with interest. There were several pleas to the declaration, but it is only necessary to notice the 4th, which was a discharge under the bankrupt act of 1841. To this plea the plaintiff replied \u2014 1. A new promise by defendant, after the discharge, to wit, September 15th, 1846. 2. A new promise by defendant to pay when he should be able, made after the discharge, to wit, September 15th, 1846, and that he was able to pay. Issue was joined on both these replications.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-10\">On the trial, the plaintiff proved the original note and the defendant\u2019s present ability to pay. The proof of the new promise relied on was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-11\"><em>Charles Britton </em>testified that he heard defendant say he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>owed Stewart a note of about $500, presumed it was the plaintiff in this suit; as to the exact time he could not say, thought it was the fall of 1846, probably in September; was not exactly sure of that. Reckless .said he owed Isaac Stewart two notes, one of about $50, the other of about $500. He said he-intended to pay both notes, the small note the following spring; and he had some lots near New York, he hada prospect of selling them, and then he intended to pay the large note. He said Isaac Stewart was a poor man, and he had always told him he intended to pay him; he was obliged to taire the benefit of the bankrupt law, but intended to pay him, as he was a poor man. And being <em>cross-examined </em>said \u2014This conversation with Reckless was at his own house; no person was present at this conversation except witness and Reckless. Witness was there as a constable on a state\u2019s warrant, and arrested defendant on said warrant; the warrant was on the complaint of Isaac Stewart; witness had told him he had this warrant against him before this conversation took place. In <em>chief </em>\u2014 It was the same day I heard defendant have a conversation with Judge Vanderbeck, which was the same in substance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-5\"><em>Cornelius Vanderbeoh </em>testified \u2014 In September, 1846, about the middle of the month, both plaintiff and defendant were brought before me by state\u2019s warrant. Stewart came before me and made complaint. I endeavored to reconcile them; and while Stewart had gone into the village to get security, I was talking with the defendant what was the difficulty between them. He said the difficulty was he owed plaintiff some money on two notes; the small one, of between $40 and $50, he would pay about the 1st of April; the large one, of $400 or $500, he would pay as soon as he was able or convenient. Nobody but Britton was by.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-6\">The defendant produced in evidence a certificate of discharge under the bankrupt act; and the evidence being closed, the defendant\u2019s counsel moved for a nonsuit, which was denied <em>pro forma, </em>and a verdict for the plaintiff was taken, subject to the opinion of this court, whether, upon the case made, the plaintiff is entitled to recover.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Tins causo was argued before the Chief Justice and Justices Elmer and Potts,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A3P\">by Mr. <em>Randolph </em>for the plaintiff, and Mr. <em>Dayton </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b441-5\">Mr. <em>Randolph </em>cited,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANq\">in support of the action, 7 <em>Hals. </em>339, <em>Belles </em>v. <em>Belles; </em>1 <em>Pet. 351, Bell </em>v. <em>Morrison; </em>5 <em>Taunt. </em>36, <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Moggridge; Cowp. </em>290; 11 <em>Ad. &amp; Ell. </em>438; <em>Eastman </em>v. <em>Saville, </em>9 <em>M. &amp; </em>W. 615; <em>Story on Prom.

And if the promise be coupled with a condition, or a contingency, that the condition has been performed, or the contingency has happened. <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>1 <em>Peters, </em>362; <em>Wetzell v. Bussard, </em>11 <em>Wheaton, </em>309; <em>Sands </em>v. <em>Gelson, </em>15 <em>Johns. R. </em>511; <em>Bang </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>2 <em>Pick. </em>368.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">It lias been held that the promise is not to be regarded as the revival of the old debt, but as a new contract, springing out of, and supported by the original consideration. Upon this question, however, it must be conceded that the authorities to be found in the books, as well as the practice adopted or sanctioned by the courts, are very much in conflict. But recurring to the language of the 4th section of the bankrupt act of 1841, wliioh governs this case, it seems to me there is but little room for any difference of opinion. That section enacts, that; \u201c such discharge and certificate, when granted, shall, in all courts of justice, be deemed a full and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>complete <em>discharge </em>of all debts, contracts and other engagements of such bankrupt, which are provable under this act, and shall be pleaded as a <em>full and, complete bar </em>to all suits,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">A debt discharged is a debt extinguished. If the old debt was extinguished \u2014 the obligation to pay gone \u2014 nothing remained of legal liabilities. But as the debt had been discharged, not by payment, not by the act of the creditor, but by the operation of the law, there remained a moral obligation, which has been held to be a sufficient consideration to support a new promise, agreement, or contract to pay. But, then, it is a clear, logical deduction from the premises, that the new contract is the foundation of the action, and not the former indebtedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The plaintiff, here, alleges a new promise; the defendant denies it. This is the issue, and the burthen is on the plaintiff to prove it. Has he done so ?</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">The evidence upon which the counsel for the plaintiff relies, is the admission of Reckless made to <em>Britton, </em>that <em>\u201c </em>he had always told Stewart he <em>intended </em>to pay him.\u201d As to the rest, it only amounts to an acknowledgment by the defendant of his former indebtedness on the two notes, and his <em>intention </em>to pay the large note when he sold certain lots, or when he should be able, or it was convenient; not made to or in the presence of the plaintiff or his agent, but to \u201cthird parties. Then, is this a promise, an agreement, or contract to pay the plaintiff the amount of the old note ?</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">The expression of an <em>intention </em>to do a thing, is not a <em>promise </em>to do it. An intention is but the purpose a man forms in his own <em>mind; </em>a promise is an express undertaking, or agreement to carry the purpose into effect. The intention may begin and end with the person who forms it. A promise, supported by a good consideration, can only be rescinded by the act of both the parties to it \u2014 for to make a binding promise, there must be, a promisee as well as a promisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">There is no evidence in this case, of any express promise made by the defendant to the plaintiff, or to any body <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>acting as Lis agent in the premises; and nothing, therefore, upon which to found a legal liability to pay this debt; and I therefore am of opinion that the verdict should be set aside and judgment entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Green, Ch. J., and Elmer, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
