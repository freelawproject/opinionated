The court denied request No. 1, granted request No. 3, and denied request No. 2, copy of which is as follows:\u2014 <em>\u201c2. </em>There is no evidence in this case which as a matter of law would warrant a finding of negligence,\u201d and in connection with said denial the court made and filed the following memorandum: \u2014 \u2018\u2018Inapplicable as I find on the facts that the defendants permitted a rug to be placed upon the landing of the defendants\u2019 premises commonly used by office visitors, which was of a light and dangerous material for travel upon the marble substructure and that the plaintiff was injured thereby. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The court found for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">On the evidence most favorable to the plaintiff, including the evidence admitted against the defendants\u2019 objection, the court could have found that on Monday, September 21,1942, at about 2 p. m., the plaintiff accompanied one Mrs. Marshall to the office of a doctor located in the premises owned or controlled by the defendants; that it had been raining; that when the plaintiff entered the defendants\u2019 premises the weather was cloudy and that she carried an umbrella and a hand bag in her hand; that the floor just inside the entrance of the defendants\u2019 premises was of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>marble with four marble steps going up to a landing with a marble floor, in area about 50 feet by 20 feet, extending back to the doctor\u2019s office with a cotton or woolen rug about 5 feet long and 3 feet wide lying on the marble floor of this area, about 2 or 3 inches from its outer edge; that the plaintiff noticed this rug and its position on the floor of said area while on her way into the doctor\u2019s office; that said rug had been placed in that position on the previous day to prevent the tracking* of mud into the defendants\u2019 premises'; that when leaving the defendants\u2019 premises the plaintiff had hold of the left arm of Mrs. Marshall who, with her right hand had hold of the hand railing; that when the plaintiff had taken two or three steps across the rug it slipped several inches under her, causing her to fall; that while falling she turned her head and hit the doorstop at the bottom of the four marble steps and was knocked out; that cotton rugs placed upon a marble floor act as a sled; that there is for sale in the open market a material made of rubber, or- cotton impregnated with rubber and netting, which can be placed under such rugs to keep them from slipping.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\">These findings if made would not, and do not, in law, warrant a finding of negligence on the part of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">\u201cThe presence of throw rugs upon a polished floor (in the instant case there was no evidence that the marble floor upon which the rug was placed was polished) is' not negligence.\u201d <em>Gibbons v. Harris Amusement Co., </em>109 Pa. Super. Ct. 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">It is common knowledge that it isl a common practice to place throw rugs of varying material upon floors, including highly polished floors, without anything to anchor the rugs to the floor, and that only reasonable care in such circumstances is required to avoid a fall. Where as here, the plaintiff, prior to her fall, and while on her way to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>doctor\u2019s office, had opportunity to, and did, observe the rug and its position on the floor, it cannot be said that as a matter of law in the circumstances here appearing, the slipping of the rug was the result of any fault on the part of the defendants. <em>Cutro et al., Appellants, v. Scranton Medical Arts Building, </em>329 Pa. 382. <em>Kitchen v. Women\u2019s City Club of Boston, </em>267 Mass. 229. <em>Crone v. Jordan Marsh Co., </em>269 Mass. 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\">There was no evidence to warrant the finding made by the trial judge that the rug involved in this case \u201cwas of a . . . material dangerous for travel upon the marble substructure.\u201d A rug whether of cotton or wool and even though light in weight, as are throw rugs in general, cannot, as a matter of law, be said to be of dangerous material for travel across or upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">The defendants\u2019 request No. 2 for ruling of law should have been granted. The court\u2019s denial of said request was error prejudicial to the defendants \u2019 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">In the light of what we have here said it is unnecessary to pass upon any of the remaining questions'of law raised by the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Finding for plaintiff vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Judgment for defendants to be entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
