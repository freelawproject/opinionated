(\u201cVineyard Bay\u201d), Alamo Title Insurance (\u201cAlamo\u201d), and Bruce Liesman.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-23\">Hugh Robertson, the president of Vineyard Bay, and his wife, Maureen, were personal friends of Thomas Kearns and his wife. Vineyard Bay borrowed $800,000 from Kearns and executed a promissory note made payable to Kearns in that amount. The note was secured by. a deed of trust on certain properties that also secured debt owed to Alamo and Liesman by Vineyard Bay. The note matured on July 15, 1988, and Vineyard Bay had not repaid the debt as of that date. On January 15, 1989, Kearns and Vineyard Bay entered into a formal, written agreement extending the note\u2019s maturity date to July 15, 1989. Vineyard Bay did not repay the debt by the extended maturity date, and Kearns did not take legal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-24\">On October 31, 1994, Vineyard Bay filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. On February 9, 1995, Kearns filed an $840,000 proof of claim in Vineyard Bay\u2019s bankruptcy proceeding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Vineyard Bay brought the adversary proceeding out of which this appeal arises, objecting to Kearns\u2019s proof of claim. Alamo and Liesman intervened as plaintiffs in the adversary proceeding. Appellees asserted that the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>of limitations bars Kearns\u2019s claim. Kearns in answer pleaded estoppel and acknowledgment. The bankruptcy court granted appel-lees\u2019 motions for summary judgment on limitations grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">As a preliminary matter, appellees urge this court to dismiss Kearns\u2019s appeal as moot because Kearns did not seek a stay of the bankruptcy proceedings pending appeal, and, they claim, there has been a substantial consummation of Vineyard Bay\u2019s bankruptcy plan. Although it is true that this court \u201cmay decline to consider the merits of a confirmation order when there has been substantial consummation of the plan such that effective judicial relief is no longer available,\u201d <em>In re Manges, </em>29 F.3d 1034, 1039 (5th Cir. 1994) (citations omitted), this equitable mootness doctrine is prudential rather than jurisdictional. <em>Id. </em>Because we conclude with little difficulty that the judgment of the district court should be affirmed, and no interference with the confirmed plan will result from our disposition of this appeal, we proceed to reach the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Kearns does not dispute that, unless saved by an exception, his claim is barred by the statute of limitations governing a suit on a debt. Under Texas law, a suit on a debt that is not commenced within four years of the time that the cause of action accrues is barred. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code \u00a7 16.004(a)(3). Texas law also provides, however, that limitations may be avoided by a written acknowledgment that meets certain prerequisites:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-8\">An acknowledgment of the justness of. a claim that appears to be barred by limitations is not admissible in evidence to defeat the law of limitations if made after the time the claim is due unless the acknowledgment is in writing and signed by the party to be charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code \u00a7 16.065. Under Texas law, an acknowledgment operates as a new obligation rather than merely as a revival of the prior debt. <em>Allied Chem. Corp. v. Koonce, </em>548 S.W.2d 80, 81 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 1977, no writ).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">An acknowledgment must \u201ceither evidence an express promise to pay the debt or an unequivocal acknowledgment of its justness from which it is said the law will imply a promise to pay it.\u201d <em>Cotulla v. Urbahn, </em>104 Tex. 208, 135 S.W. 1159, 1162 (1911). Although the amount of the debt need not be specified in the acknowledgment, it must be \u201csusceptible of ready ascertainment.\u201d <em>House of Falcon, Inc. v. Gonzalez, </em>583 S.W.2d 902, 905 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Corpus Christi 1979, no writ). Whether a writing is sufficient under Section 16.065 to constitute an acknowledgment upon which suit may be brought is a question of law. <em>Martindale Mortg. Co. v. Crow, </em>161 S.W.2d 866, 870 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014El Paso 1941, writ ref'd w.o.m.).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">In response to appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment, Kearns relied on two letters that he claims \u201ccorroborate\u201d the acknowledgment necessary to defeat the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"APF\">The first letter upon which Kearns relies was written by counsel for Vineyard Bay to Kearns\u2019s counsel. In that letter, counsel for Vineyard Bay takes the position that the statute of limitations has expired, but that Robertson has nevertheless \u201cindicated .... a willingness to attempt to work with Mr. Kearns to accomplish a liquidation of the collateral which was posted to secure the obligation and provide for the payment of net proceeds of that collateral to Mr. Kearns.\u201d Kearns\u2019s claim that this letter constitutes an acknowledgment is without merit. Far from being an unequivocal acknowledgment of the justness of the debt, the letter expressly states, \u201cThe matters set forth herein are a general outline of a proposed resolution or settlement of a controversy and therefore are not to be deemed by way of admission, which they expressly are not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-13\">The second letter upon which Kearns relies was written by Robertson to Kearns on November 1, 1994, the day after Vineyard Bay\u2019declared bankruptcy. The subject line of the letter read \u201cNote Payable &amp; Collateral.\u201d In the letter, Robertson represented that Vineyard Bay had been placed in bankruptcy \u201cto protect your collateral and provide a reasonably prompt way to sell the lots with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>proceeds to go to you.\u201d He concluded by stating that he and his wife \u201cgenuinely appreciate your patience and are making every effort to expedite the largest repayment to you that we can muster.\u201d Whether this letter constitutes a sufficient acknowledgment is a closer question. Texas courts have held that similar writings were sufficient to constitute acknowledgments. <em>See Healy v. Masters, </em>504 S.W.2d 594, 595-96 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014 Fort Worth 1974, no writ); <em>Friedman v. Worthy Fabrics, </em>347 S.W.2d 639, 640 (Tex. Civ.App.\u2014El Paso 1960, no writ).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Assuming without deciding that the letter from Robertson to Kearns would otherwise be sufficient to defeat limitations under Texas law, federal bankruptcy law prevents such a result in this case. Robertson \"wrote the letter after Vineyard Bay filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Under the Bankruptcy Code, a debtor cannot incur post-petition debt without court authorization following notice and a hearing. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 364. Vineyard Bay did not obtain court authorization to make a new promise regarding the otherwise time-barred pre-petition debt to, Kearns. In fact, Kearns himself appears to acknowledge that this letter alone, because it was written after Vineyard Bay declared bankruptcy, is insufficient to defeat limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Finally, Kearns contends that even if the writings upon which he relies do not satisfy the requirements of Section 16.065, Vineyard Bay is nevertheless es-topped from invoking limitations because Kearns relied to his detriment on oral representations by Hugh Robertson and his wife Maureen. We reject this contention. Texas law precludes an estoppel defense to limitations based upon oral representations. <em>See Nassar v. Nelson, </em>112 S.W.2d 757, 760 (Tex. Civ.App.\u2014San Antonio 1938, writ ref'd) (construing Article 5539, recodified as Tex. Civ. Prac. <em>&amp; </em>Rem.Code \u00a7 16.065). ,</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
