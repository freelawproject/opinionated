We shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Shearwater applied to the Port Wardens of Annapolis for permission \u201cto construct piers, pilings, bulkheading, and to dredge and fill\u201d contiguous to its property on Spa Creek. For a review of the powers of that body under the charter of the City <em>see Port Wardens v. Md. Cap. Yacht Club, </em>261 Md. 48, 273 A. 2d 102 (1971), and <em>Lunter v. Laudeman, </em>251 Md. 203, 246 A. 2d 540 (1968). The Port Wardens considered and approved the application on June 18, 1970. More than 30 days later appeals were filed with the Mayor and Aldermen of Annapolis by certain individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Section 40 of the Annapolis charter as amended on March 3, 1970, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">\u201cIn all differences that shall arise between any citizen of Annapolis and the said Wardens, touching the discharge of their duty, an appeal de novo shall lie to the Mayor and Aldermen. Appeal must be filed in writing with the City Clerk within 30 days of the final decision of the said Port Wardens.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">Shearwater learned the day after the hearing that the application had been approved. It obtained this information by a telephone call from its president to the office of the Director of Public Works of the City, an <em>ex officio </em>member of the Port Wardens whose office seemed to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>responsible for their operation. The citizens who attempted to appeal to the Mayor and Aldermen did not learn of the decision until more than 30 days after it was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">The minutes of the Port Wardens reflect opposition to the application by three named individuals, none of whom were appellants. One of the objectors presented a petition with the names of 30 people on it who were said to oppose the application. She was asked for a better copy of the petition \u201cas many of the names were illegible.\u201d The president of Shearwater also requested a copy. It is claimed that the objector asked to be notified of the decision of the Port Wardens and was told that she would be so notified, a point which is in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The names of individuals who appealed to the City do not appear in the minutes of the Port Wardens as opponents of the application, nor have they claimed that their names were among those on the petition in opposition to the proposal or that they were present as protestants at the hearing before the Port Wardens. In fact, the individual who executed the affidavit in opposition to the motion for summary judgment there alleged that there was a promise at the public hearing to notify a representative of the protestants of the action of the Port Wardens \u201c[ajlthough [she did] not have personal knowledge of that fact.\u201d From this the inference can be drawn that she was not present at the hearing. In short, there is nothing in the record to disclose any opposition on their part to the proposal prior to the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The Mayor and Aldermen determined, against the advice of the city attorney who here has the unhappy task of attempting to defend a position contrary to his advice, that it would hear the appeal notwithstanding the time when it was filed. It denied the application. Shearwater then filed a bill of complaint in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County for a declaration that the resolution of the City was \u201cunconstitutional, illegal and void\u201d and to require issuance of a building permit. Those who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>had appealed to the Mayor and Aldermen were permitted to become parties to the proceeding in the circuit court. Shearwater moved for summary judgment which was granted by Judge Mayfield on the ground that the appeal was not timely filed with the Mayor and Aldermen.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The City points to Code (1957, 1966 Repl. Vol.) Art. 23A, \u00a7 8 providing that all meetings of the legislative bodies of municipal corporations \u201cshall be public meetings and open to the public at all times,\u201d except that executive sessions may be held, \u201cbut no ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation shall be finally adopted at such an executive session.\u201d It contends that the action approving Shearwater\u2019s application was taken at an executive session and \u201cthat there was a legal obligation and duty on the part of the Port Wardens to make its decision known to those who were promised notification.\u201d Parenthetically it should be said that nowhere in the record does it appear that this action was held at \u201can executive session from which the public [was] excluded.\u201d It may well be true that the public was not present when the action was taken, but that fact does not mean that the public was excluded. We do not regard that point as decisive here, however. The City then goes on to fashion an argument that \u201csince notice of the decision was not given to the Citizens of Annapolis by the Port Wardens * * * any Citizen could appeal within 30 days of notice or when he learned of the decision. The appeal in this case was noted as soon as it could be, as soon as notice of the decision was made known.\u201d Therefore, it concludes the appeal is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The fallacy in the City\u2019s argument is its assumption that \u201cany citizen\u201d could appeal. The right of appeal does not automatically flow from the fact that an individual may be unhappy or dissatisfied with some particular decision. In <em>Bosley v. Dorsey, </em>191 Md. 229, 60 A. 2d 691 (1948), the People\u2019s Counsel for the Public Service Commission of Maryland attempted to appeal from a decision of that commission setting rates. He contended he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>the right to appeal as an agent of the persons affected by an order fixing gas and electric rates, and that the Public Service Commission law gave him this right by implication. The Court held that he did not come within the statute giving \u201cthe right to proceed in the courts to vacate, set aside or have modified any order of said Commission on the grounds that such order is unreasonable or unlawful\u201d to \u201c[a]ny company, corporation, association, person or partnership subject to any of the provisions of [that] subtitle, or other person or party in interest.\u201d It has been held that when circuit courts sit in the exercise of a special, limited statutory jurisdiction there is no appeal to this Court unless the appeal is granted by statute. <em>Simpler v. State, Use of Boyd, </em>223 Md. 456, 460-61, 165 A. 2d 464 (1960); <em>Davis v. Board of Education, </em>166 Md. 118, 123, 170 A. 590 (1934); <em>M., &amp;c., Hyattsville v. Washington, W. &amp; G.R.R., </em>124 Md. 577, 580, 93 A. 151 (1915), and cases there cited. More recently in <em>Urbana Civic v. Urbana Mobile, </em>260 Md. 458, 272 A. 2d 628 (1971), we held the County Commissioners of Frederick County without authority to pass an ordinance providing for judicial review of subdivision regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Parties to a proceeding cannot by their consent confer jurisdiction on this Court to hear a matter. <em>Eggert v. Montgomery Co. Council, </em>263 Md. 243, 247, 282 A. 2d 474 (1971), and <em>Price v. Hobbs, </em>47 Md. 359, 378 (1877). Nor may the parties by consent confer jurisdiction upon any court. <em>Hadaway v. Hynson, </em>89 Md. 305, 315, 43 A. 806 (1899); <em>Danner v. State, </em>89 Md. 220, 228, 42 A. 965 (1899); and <em>Meyer v. Henderson, </em>88 Md. 585, 593, 41 A. 1073 (1899). In <em>Price </em>Judge (later Chief Judge) Alvey said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">\u201cThese actions being actions at law, of course, no consent of parties can confer power or jurisdiction on this court to review the judgments therein, and determine the rights of parties upon any other principles than such as properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>apply to such actions, and which the court below would have been authorized to make the rule of its decision. Otherwise, it would be in the power of the parties to a cause, by their mere agreement, to confer original jurisdiction, where the Constitution and laws have conferred appellate jurisdiction only. The jurisdiction of this court is one solely of review, and the consent of parties cannot clothe it with power, on an appeal from a judgment at law, to convert the action into a bill in equity, and so shape and form the proceedings as to give force and effect to principles exclusively of equitable cognizance. It is a well established maxim that consent of parties will not confer jurisdiction on a court, where no jurisdiction exists without such consent. <em>Bents v. Graves, </em>3 McCord, 280; <em>Overstreet v. Brown, </em>4 McCord, 79; <em>Lindsay v. McClelland, </em>1 Bibb, 262.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 378-79.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Where a statute establishes a fact-finding body or commission and it has jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter its decisions on questions of fact are conclusive and final in the absence of fraud, unless an appeal is provided by law to some appellate or supervisory tribunal. <em>Schluderberg, Etc. Co. v. Baltimore, </em>151 Md. 603, 613-14, 135 A. 412 (1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">In cases that have arisen under some zoning ordinances a person in order to appeal must be one \u201caggrieved by the decision of the board.\u201d In <em>DuBay v. Crane, </em>240 Md. 180, 213 A. 2d 487 (1965), Judge Horney said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">\u201cIn zoning cases, the rule in this State is that for a person to be aggrieved by an adverse decision of the administrative agency, and thus entitled to appeal to the courts, the decision must not only affect a matter in which the protestant has a specific interest or property right but his interest therein must be such that he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>personally and specially affected in a way different from that suffered by the public generally. See <em>Loughborough v. Rivermass, </em>213 Md. 239, 131 A. 2d 461 (1957); <em>Pattison v. Corby, </em>226 Md. 97, 172 A. 2d 490 (1961); <em>Toomey v. Gomeringer, </em>235 Md. 456, 201 A. 2d 842 (1964); <em>Marcus v. Montgomery County Council, </em>235 Md. 535, 201 A. 2d 777 (1964); and <em>City of Greenbelt v. Jaeger, </em>237 Md. 456, 206 A. 2d 694 (1965).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 185.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-8\"><em>See also Shore Acres v. Anne Arundel Co., </em>251 Md. 310, 316, 247 A. 2d 402 (1968); <em>Bryniarski v. Montgomery Co., </em>247 Md. 137, 144, 230 A. 2d 289 (1967); and <em>Town of Somerset v. Board, </em>245 Md. 52, 225 A. 2d 294 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">The appeal granted in the Annapolis charter is concerned with \u201cdifferences that shall arise between any citizen of Annapolis and the said Wardens, touching the discharge of their duty.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>(unabr. ed. 1961) defines \u201cdifference\u201d in the sense it is here used as \u201cdisagreement in opinion,\u201d while <em>The Random House Dictionary of the English Language </em>(unabr. ed. 1967) defines it as \u201ca dispute or quarrel.\u201d In <em>Port Wardens v. Md. Cay. Yacht Club, </em>261 Md. 48, 59, we expressly held under the charter provision as it then existed that the appeal to the Mayor and Aider-men from the Port Wardens was \u201cconfined to the record made before the Port Wardens and that no <em>de novo </em>hearing [was] contemplated.\u201d Although the charter has since been amended to provide for a <em>de novo </em>hearing, the charter provision has not otherwise been changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">We conclude that the \u201cdisagreement in opinion,\u201d \u201cdispute,\u201d or \u201cquarrel\u201d by way of a \u201cdifference\u201d that a citizen of Annapolis may have,with the Port Wardens which he may appeal to the Mayor and Aldermen is not a mere disapproval as a member of the public at large of some action of the Port Wardens, but must arise from that citizen\u2019s having been involved in a matter pending before that body, either as applicant or protestant, a person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>involved in the record making process. The appellants from the decision of the Port Wardens do not appear from the record to have been involved in any way in the hearing. Therefore, there is no difference which they are permitted to appeal and that appeal should not have been entertained by the Mayor and Aldermen for that reason. Accordingly, we do not reach the question of the timeliness of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">\n<em>Order affirmed; appellant to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b317-11\">.
