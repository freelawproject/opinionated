The policy in question was issued by The National Guild Insurance Company (Company) to Mr. Charles A. Swanson (the insured), and contained the following familiar exceptions to its coverage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-11\">\u201c* * * This policy does not apply: * * * (b) to bodily injury to (1) the spouse or any parent, son, or daughter of the insured or (2) the named insured, or (3) <em>any member of the family of the insured residing in the same household as the insured.\u201d </em>(Emphasis Supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">Thomas J. Hatem, appellee, as the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Maryland and the appointed receiver of the Company, and Mrs. Georgia I. Bishop, appellant, submitted by way of a request for a declaratory judgment (Code, 1971 Repl. Vol., Art. 31A) the question of whether Mrs. Bishop was eligible for coverage under the policy to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (DuFour, J.) upon the following stipulated statement of facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-13\">\u201cCharles A. Swanson, RD #5, Elkton, Maryland was insured under National Guild Insurance Company policy No. ACM 29751 an automobile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>liability policy. On July 5, 1965, while the policy was in effect, Swanson was driving a 1950 Willys station wagon, the insured vehicle. With him as a passenger was one Georgia I. Bishop. The auto driven by Swanson went out of control and struck a bridge abutment. Mrs. Bishop suffered injuries to her right hip and right knee for which she has filed a liquidation claim in the amount of $30,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">\u201cGeorgia Bishop and Charles Swanson had been occupying the same household on Dogwood Road, RD #5, Elkton, Maryland, uninterruptedly for a number of years prior to the accident. They were not married to each other. About nine years before the accident Mrs. Bishop\u2019s nephew began living in the same household. Mrs. Bishop was regularly employed. Mr. Swanson was intermittently employed. All three ate together. Mrs. Bishop and Mr. Swanson lived as man and wife.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">The lower court, in arriving at the conclusion that the \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d clause barred a recovery under the policy by the appellant, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-10\">\u201c* * * this court finds that irrespective of the absence of consanguinal ties, Georgia Bishop was indeed a member of the family of the insured residing in his household. Their living together ostensibly as man and wife under one head for a period of time exceeding nine years was conducive to cozy and collusive claims; the very object and purpose of the exclusionary provision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-11\">\u201cThis court finds that the phrase of the policy here involved is not ambiguous in the sense that its general meaning is uncertain or that it can be construed in alternate ways. That a term cannot be precisely defined so as to make clear its application in .all varying factual situations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>does not mean that it is ambiguous. <em>Allstate v. Humphrey, </em>246 Md. 492, 496. Absent such a finding, the provisions cannot be construed most strongly against the insurer. Maryland has not adopted the rule followed in many jurisdictions that an insurance policy is to be most strongly construed against the insurer. <em>Allstate v. Humphrey, supra, </em>page 497.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The issue presented on appeal is the interpretation to be given to the word \u201cfamily\u201d as used in the \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d clause, and, more specifically, whether or not Mrs. Bishop should be considered a \u201cmember of the family\u201d of the insured. The appellant suggests that the word \u201cfamily\u201d connotes a blood relationship, and perhaps a marital relationship, existing among individuals, while the appellee would define the term as \u201ca sociological entity consisting of persons habitually residing under one roof, forming one domestic circle and having a permanent domestic character.\u201d For the purposes of this case, we are not inclined to adopt either definition verbatim. However, for the reasons to be stated we hold that Mrs. Bishop was not a \u201cmember of the family\u201d of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">We initiate the discussion of the question presented with the observation that this Court has long recognized that the word \u201cfamily\u201d has a variety of meanings, depending on the manner in which it is employed. See <em>Krug v. Mills, </em>159 Md. 670, 673, 152 A. 493 (1930); and <em>Pearre v. Smith, </em>110 Md. 531, 534, 73 A. 141 (1909). Additionally, Judge McWilliams, speaking for the Court in <em>The Peninsula Insurance Company v. Knight, </em>254 Md. 461, 255 A. 2d 55 (1969), stated as a general rule for the construction of contracts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">\u201cIn the construction of contracts, even more than in the construction of statutes, <em>words which are used in common, daily, now-technical speech should, in the absence of evidence of a contrary intent, be given the meaning which they have </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>for laymen in such daily usage rather than a restrictive meaning which they may have acquired in legal usage. </em>* * *\u201d 254 Md. at 472-473.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-5\"><em>The Random House Dictionary of the English Language </em>(Unabridged 1966 ed.) defines \u201cfamily\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">\u201c1. parents and their children, whether dwelling together or not. 2. the children of one person or one couple collectively. 3. the spouse and children of one person. 4. any group of persons closely related by blood, as parents, children, uncles, aunts and cousins. 5. all those persons considered as descendants of a common progenitor. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">It is not until we come upon the seventh meaning attributed to the word \u201cfamily\u201d that the interpretation urged by the appellee appears:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-8\">\u201c* * * 7. a group of persons who form a household under one head, including parents, children, servants, etc. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">An excerpt from <em>Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary </em>(Unabridged 1961 ed.) discloses a similar definition of \u201cfamily\u201d :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-10\">\u201c* * *2a: a group of persons of common ancestry. b: a people or group of peoples regarded as deriving from a common stock. 3a: a group of individuals living under one roof, b: the body of persons who live in one house and under one head including parents, children, servants and lodgers or boarders. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">It would thus appear that in common parlance and usage the word \u201cfamily\u201d more frequently connotes the existence of a marital or blood relationship, or a legal status approximating such a relationship.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>The appellee places primary reliance for his interpretation upon the case of <em>Hunter v. Southern Farm Bureau Casualty Ins. Co., </em>129 S.E.2d 59 (S.C. 1962). In <em>Hunter </em>which involved a factual setting almost identical with the case at bar, the Supreme Court of South Carolina determined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">\u201cIn light of the clear purposes intended to be accomplished by the exclusion clause in question, we think the term \u2018family\u2019, as here used, includes \u2018such persons as habitually reside under one roof and form one domestic circle\u2019. * * * If the injured person is a member of such family circle, liability of the insurer is excluded.\u201d 129 S.E.2d at 61.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Although this Court has upheld the validity of the \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d clause and stated its purpose to be \u201c* * * to protect the insurer against collusive or cozy claims, [and] to exempt him from liability stemming from one whose natural ties and pulls are likely to favor a claimant who lives in the same household,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> * * *\u201d we are not prepared to expand the breadth of the clause by a liberal interpretation of its terms. Although we are not presented with a situation in which the use of an ambiguous term would require the construction of the policy against the company preparing it <em>(Allstate v. Humphrey, supra), </em>the statement of the Court in <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company v. Pennington, </em>324 F. 2d 340 (8th Cir. 1963) would still seem appropriate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-9\">\u201c* * * even though there does exist that familial relationship which is the ordinary object of the exclusionary clause, there is no exclusion unless the factual situation fits the exclusionary language.\u201d 324 F. 2d at 344.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Cf. <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company v. Thompson, </em>372 F. 2d 256 (9th Cir. 1967) in which the use of the word \u201cfamily\u201d in a \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d clause was called \u201cat best imprecise\u201d and the Court decided that \u201cit may fairly be said to be ambiguous.\u201d See also 12 Couch On Insurance 2d, \u00a7 44:414, p. 6, wherein the author provides the following guidance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">\u201cIn accord with general principles, policy exceptions are strictly construed and do not reduce the coverage beyond their express terms. * * *\u00bb&gt;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Moreover,, a limited construction of the word \u201cfamily\u201d is supported in this instance by the use of the word \u201chousehold\u201d in the same phrase. If the intention of the Company was to exclude from coverage all of those persons who might fall within the broad definition of the term \u201cfamily,\u201d which is urged upon this Court by the appellee, it could have done so by merely excluding the members of the insured\u2019s household. However, the use of both of the words \u201cfamily\u201d and' \u201chousehold\u201d in the exclusionary clause leads us to believ\u00bf that they were not intended to be used in a synonymous fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Finally, regarding the interpretation given to the word \u201cfamily\u201d by the Court in <em>Hunter, supra, </em>it should be borne in mind that while the State of South Carolina recognizes the concept of \u201ccommon law marriage,\u201d Maryland does not. <em>Henderson v. Henderson, </em>199 Md. 449, 454, 87 A. 2d 403 (1952). Therefore, in this State, it cannot be said that the appellant possesses a legal status which is the equivalent of being a family member.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap_\">\n<em>Decree reversed; appellee to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b300-12\">. We view the broad definition of \u201cfamily\u201d found in the \u201cCriminal Injuries Compensation Act,\u201d Code (1971 Supp.), Art. 26A, \u00a7 2 (d) as limited to the purposes of that Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b301-10\">.
