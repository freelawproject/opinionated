Lindner, </em>252 Md. 271, 272, 249 A. 2d 717 (1969) that \u201ca detailed review of the facts which gave rise to this controversy is not particularly rewarding\u201d is equally applicable to the present case and for a somewhat related reason, <em>i.e., </em>the ability of a dissolved foreign corporation to \u201cmaintain\u201d the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">The appellee, State National Bank of Bethesda (State Bank), filed nine actions in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County in February and March 1967 against the appellants, Gibraltar Construction and Engineering, Inc. (Gibraltar), as maker, and Robert Youso and Nellie Youso, as guarantors of the payment of nine promissory notes containing warrants to confess judgment. Judgments were confessed against the appellants and motions were made by them to permit the imposition of defenses, which were granted. The appellants, as defendants below, filed counterclaims against State Bank, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>claiming that State Bank had improperly interfered with Gibraltar\u2019s business by terminating Gibraltar\u2019s contract with one of its sub-contractors. Later, the actions were removed for trial to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, where, on September 26, 1968, the various actions were consolidated for trial. In addition to the nine notes mentioned, there was a tenth note made by the Yousos to secure a loan made by State Bank to them in connection with the purchase of a cabin cruiser. Gibraltar was not involved in this note; State Bank sued the Yousos on the $3,749.73 note and this action (No. 78335) was consolidated for trial with the other nine cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">At the end of the trial, at which a substantial amount of testimony was taken and many documentary exhibits offered in evidence, Judge Haile overruled the motions of State Bank for a directed verdict in its favor on the counterclaims and submitted the case to the jury with detailed instructions. The jury, on August 4, 1970, found a verdict in favor of State Bank against all of the defendants for $41,161.26 on the nine promissory notes with interest and costs, but found in favor of the cross-claimants against the plaintiff, State Bank, in the amount of $60,000.00 plus interest and costs. The jury found a verdict in favor of State Bank against the Yousos in No. 78335 for $1,879.00 for which judgment was duly entered. The Yousos filed a timely appeal from this judgment; but there was no contention on appeal that this judgment was not properly entered or that the Yousos had any claim against State Bank. In its motion for judgment n.o.v., State Bank sought the entry of a judgment for the $3,749.73 claimed by it, rather th\u00e1n a judgment for $1,879.00 based on the jury\u2019s verdict for this latter amount; but the lower court declined to disturb the jury\u2019s verdict of $1,879.00. State Bank filed no cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Also in its motion for a judgment n.o.v., State Bank sought the entry of a judgment for $56,161.26 upon the nine promissory notes instead of $41,161.26, the amount of the jury\u2019s verdict. Here again, the lower court de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>dined to disturb the jury\u2019s verdict for $41,161.26 and State Bank filed no cross-appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">State Bank filed a motion for a judgment n.o.v. in its favor on the counterclaim and Judge Haile granted this motion on November 13, 1970. From a judgment entered on the same day, the defendants took a timely appeal to this Court on December 10, 1970. Since the appeal was taken, Robert Youso died in October 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">State Bank, in addition to its briefing and arguing the merits of the appeal, urged us in its brief and argument that the appeal of Gibraltar should be dismissed because of the revocation of the certificate of incorporation of that foreign corporation by the District of Columbia on September 9, 1968, and by the cancellation of that corporation\u2019s authority to do business in Maryland by the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation on December 20,1967, for failure to file its personal property return.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">We have concluded that the motion to dismiss Gibraltar\u2019s appeal has merit and will be granted. The judgment in favor of State Bank against the Yousos for $1,879.00, interest and costs, will be affirmed, there being, as we have indicated, no contention by the appellants in their brief or at the argument that the Yousos have any claim against State Bank under the counterclaim or otherwise. The judgment for $41,161.00, interest and costs, in favor of State Bank against Gibraltar and the Yousos will also be affirmed for the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Turning now to the motion to dismiss the appeal, Code (1966, Repl. Yol. 1971 Supp.), Art. 23, \u00a7 91 (c) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">\u201c(c) <em>When suit may be maintained by corporation. </em>\u2014 No suit shall be maintained in any court of this State by any such foreign corporation or by anyone claiming under such for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>eign corporation if such foreign corporation is doing or has done intrastate or interstate or foreign business in this State without having complied with the requirements of \u00a7 90 of this article, until such foreign corporation or the person claiming under it has shown to the satisfaction of the court</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-4\">\u201c (1) That such foreign corporation, or a foreign corporation successor thereto, has complied with the requirements of \u00a7 90 [of] this article, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">\u201c(2) That neither such foreign corporation nor any foreign corporation successor thereto is continuing to do intrastate or interstate or foreign business in this State, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">\u201c(3) That such foreign corporation or the person claiming under it has paid to the Department the penalty provided for in subsection (d) hereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">It will be observed that \u00a7 91 is a part of Art. 23 of the Code containing the provisions in regard to \u201cForeign Corporations.\u201d By \u00a7 87, the phrase <em>\u201cforeign corporation\u201d </em>is defined and \u201cshall mean every corporation, association or joint-stock company formed or existing under the statute or common law of any state (other than this State), territory, district, possession or foreign country, or the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Gibraltar was incorporated under the Laws of the District of Columbia on March 2, 1966, and was a \u201cforeign corporation\u201d as defined by \u00a7 87. Under its corporate char-, ter, it was empowered \u201cto make contracts for the purpose or purposes of engaging in the business of construction and building, either as a General Contractor or as a Sub-Contractor; to perform all types of construction, excavation, building, erection, repair, remodeling, demolition and any and all other such activities, either under contract or agreement or otherwise for owners, lessors, contractors or any other persons or com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>panies or corporations. In general, to carry on any other business connected with or incidental to the foregoing objects and purposes, and to have and exercise all the powers conferred by the laws of the District of Columbia upon corporations formed under the District of Columbia Business Corporation Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">The record indicates that Gibraltar qualified to do business in Maryland on July 14, 1966, and thereafter actively engaged in the contracting business in Maryland. There is no evidence in the record to indicate when Gibraltar ceased to do business in Maryland, and it will be presumed that it continued to do business in this State until the contrary is shown. See <em>Tully v. Dasher, </em>250 Md. 424, 432-33, 244 A. 2d 207, 212 (1968) and 31A C.J.S., <em>Evidence, </em>\u00a7 124 (1) at 222 <em>et seq. </em>The facts in regard to the doing of intrastate business in Maryland are particularly within Gibraltar\u2019s knowledge and the burden of coming forward with evidence to indicate a change in this regard was upon it. <em>Tully, supra. See also Clinton Petroleum Services, Inc. v. Norris, </em>264 Md. 15, 284 A. 2d 413 (1971); 29 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 131, at 164-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">As we have indicated, Gibraltar\u2019s authority to do business in Maryland was cancelled on December 20, 1967, for failure to file its personal property returns, pursuant to the authority granted to the State Department of Assessments and Taxation by Code (1969 Repl. Vol.) Art. 81, \u00a7 253, which provides that after the required notice by the Department to the foreign corporation, it shall \u201cforfeit all right to do intrastate business in this State and shall be in all respects subject to the same penalties, rules and legal provisions as if it had never been qualified or licensed to do business in this State; * * Art. 23, \u00a7 90 (f) provides that a \u201cforeign corporation shall be qualified to do intrastate business in this State so long as * * * (4) Such corporation has not forfeited its right to do such intrastate business under the laws of this State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">There is no question that by the action of the Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>ment, Gibraltar forfeited its right to do business in Maryland under the applicable State laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">As we have seen, by virtue of the provisions of Art. 23, \u00a7 91 (c), no foreign corporation in the unhappy position of Gibraltar shall <em>maintain </em>any suit in <em>any </em>court of this State. Hence, even though Gibraltar had filed its respective counterclaims prior to December 20, 1967, when its authority to do business in Maryland was revoked, it thereafter had no authority to maintain its counterclaim further by appeal to this Court and when the facts of the revocation of its charter by the District of Columbia authorities and of the cancellation of its authority to do business in Maryland were brought to the attention of this Court \u2014 and these facts are not disputed by Gibraltar \u2014 by State Bank\u2019s motion to dismiss, we are obliged to grant the motion to dismiss in order to comply with the mandatory provisions of \u00a7 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Gibraltar has not shown to us that it has complied with the provisions of \u00a7 90 or that it is not continuing to do intrastate business in Maryland and that it has paid to the Department the $200.00 penalty provided for in Subsection (d) of \u00a7 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Gibraltar seeks to rely upon Art. 23, \u00a7 82 (a) which provides that the dissolution \u201cof a corporation shall not * * * abate any pending suit or proceeding by or against the corporation and all such suits may be continued with such substitution of-parties, if any, as the court directs.\u201d See also Maryland Rule 222 to the same effect, implementing the provisions of \u00a7 82 (a). In our opinion this reliance is misplaced inasmuch as \u00a7 82 (a) is applicable only to <em>Maryland domestic </em>corporations and not to <em>foreign </em>corporations. See \u00a7 76 (a) in regard to dissolution of \u201cany corporation <em>of this State </em>* * *\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) and subsequent sections through \u00a7 83. As we have noted, the provisions of Art. 23 in regard to \u201cforeign corporations\u201d begin with \u00a7 87 and continue through \u00a7 93A, including, of course, \u00a7\u00a790 and 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Gibraltar also seeks solace in Title 29, Section 716 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>the District of Columbia Code (1967 ed.) which provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-4\">\u201cNo action pending in favor of or against any corporation shall be discontinued or abate by the dissolution of the corporation, whether such dissolution occur by the expiration of its charter or otherwise, but all such actions may be prosecuted to final judgment in its corporate name; and on all judgments so obtained, whether before or after its dissolution, execution may be had and satisfaction enforced in such corporate name.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">It obtains no comfort from this section which applies to actions <em>in the District of Columbia, </em>and not to actions by foreign corporations <em>in Maryland, </em>which, as we have observed are governed in the instant case by Art. 23, \u00a7 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">We might add that our review of the record, briefs and arguments would have led us to the same result had we considered Gibraltar\u2019s appeal on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">\n<em>Motion to dismiss appeal as to Gibraltar Construction and Engineering, Inc., one of the appellants, granted; judgments in favor of State National Bank of Bethesda against Robert Youso and Nellie Youso, two of the appellants, for $1,879.00, with interest and costs, and against Gibraltar Construction and Engineering, Inc., Robert Youso and Nellie Youso, for $41,161.00, with interest and costs, affirmed; Gibraltar Construction and Engineering, Inc., one of -the appellants, to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AGR\">. The jury\u2019s verdict was for $41,161.26. In ruling on the mo.tion for judgment n.o.v., Judge Haile ultimately directed the entry of judgment for $41,161.00.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
