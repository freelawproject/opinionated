He contends that the BIA abused its discretion by denying his motion because the new evidence he submitted in conjunction with his motion established a material change in country conditions such that his motion was not subject to those time and numerical limitations. He also contends that he has made a prima facie showing of his eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">We have jurisdiction to entertain Liu\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen based on changed country conditions. <em>Panjwani v. Gonzales, </em>401 F.3d 626, 632 (5th Cir.2005). The denial of a motion to reopen is reviewed \u201cunder a highly deferential abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Manzano-Garcia v. Gonzales, </em>413 F.3d 462, 469 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cSuch discretion is not to be disturbed \u2018so long as it is not capricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in evidence, or otherwise so aberrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Pritchett v. INS, </em>993 F.2d 80, 83 (5th Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-16\">Except in specific circumstances, there is a 90-day time limit for filing a motion to reopen. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) &amp; (3). Additionally, a party generally may file only one motion to reopen. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7); \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). An alien is not bound by the time and number limitations of \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i), however, if the motion to reopen requests asylum or withholding of removal \u201cbased on changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality ... if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)\u00ae; <em>see </em>\u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); <em>Panjwani, </em>401 F.3d at 631. In determining whether there has been a material change in country conditions, the BIA compares \u201cthe evidence of country conditions submitted with the motion to those that existed at the time of the merits hearing below.\u201d <em>In re S-Y-G, </em>24 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 247, 253 (BIA 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-17\">The evidence submitted by Liu supports the BIA\u2019s determination that he did not establish a material change in country conditions since the time of his initial removal hearing. <em>See In re S-Y-G, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 253. The State Department\u2019s 2004 report on China, which was submitted into evidence during Liu\u2019s original removal proceedings, indicated that the Chinese gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>ernment\u2019s respect for religious freedom was poor. The report indicated that religious activities were monitored and that the government required all places of religious activity to register. Although respect for religious freedoms varied widely by province, activities at registered churches generally occurred without interference. Religious services at unregistered or underground churches, however, were often broken up and, in some instances, the location was destroyed. The report noted that church leaders and worshipers at underground churches were often harassed, detained, or beaten. The report further observed that Chinese authorities were increasingly vigilant \u201cagainst foreign infiltration under the guise of religion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Liu\u2019s evidence that his mother and brother were arrested and detained after being caught worshiping at an underground house church is consistent with the Chinese government\u2019s historical restriction on religious freedoms and does not represent changes in the country conditions since his initial removal hearing. Similarly, his evidence that Chinese authorities sought to conduct an inquiry into his unsanctioned religious activities is consistent with the government\u2019s historical restrictions on freedom of religion and wariness towards foreign infiltration under the guise of religion. Therefore, the evidence Liu relies on does not establish a material change in country conditions. <em>See Panjwani, </em>401 F.3d at 631; <em>In re S-Y-G, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">As Liu failed to establish a material change in country conditions, his motion to reopen was not excepted from the time and number limitations on such motions. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(i); \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C); <em>Panjwani, </em>401 F.3d at 631. Liu\u2019s second motion to reopen exceeded the time and number limitations of \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C). Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Liu\u2019s second motion to reopen on those grounds. <em>See Manzano-Garcia, </em>413 F.3d at 469. The petition for review is, therefore, DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b469-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
