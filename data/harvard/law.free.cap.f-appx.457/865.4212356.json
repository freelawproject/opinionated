On appeal, Chappell argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to adequately consider mitigating evidence and also placed undue emphasis on his criminal history. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">We review the sentence a district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-12\">In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we typically perform two steps. <em>Id. </em>First, we \u201c \u2018ensure that the district <em>court </em>committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-13\">If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we must consider the \u201c\u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). This review is \u201cdeferential,\u201d requiring us to determine \u201cwhether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[W]e will not second guess the weight (or lack thereof) that the [district court] accorded to a given factor ... as long as the sentence ultimately imposed is reasonable in light of all the circumstances presented.\u201d <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 872 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation, alteration and emphasis omitted), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2962, 180 L.Ed.2d 245 (2011). We will \u201cvacate the sentence if, but only if, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 8553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc) (quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">When imposing a sentence, the district court need only acknowledge that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and need not discuss each of the factors individually. <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 833 (11th Cir.2007). And, although we do not automatically presume reasonableness for a sentence within the guidelines range, we ordinarily expect a within-guidelines sentence to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). The party challenging the sentence carries the burden of establishing unreasonableness. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">Chappell has not carried his burden of demonstrating that his sentence was substantively unreasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, the district court imposed a sentence within the guideline range for the grouped counts, and we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>Hunt, </em>526 F.3d at 746. Additionally, as the record shows, the district court specifically discussed several of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors at the sentencing hearing, including Chappell\u2019s personal history and characteristics, the need to deter Chappell from future criminal conduct, and the advisory sentencing guideline range, while also acknowledging that it had taken all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors under consideration prior to imposing Chappell\u2019s sentence. Moreover, contrary to Chappell\u2019s contention on appeal, the record of the sentencing hearing reflects that the district court did consider counsel\u2019s mitigation arguments regarding Chappell\u2019s employment and family history. And in any event, even if the district court emphasized only some of the sentencing factors, it did not need to discuss each of them individually. <em>Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d at 833. Therefore, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the totality of the circumstances in this case, we affirm Chappell\u2019s sentence as reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b888-10\">. In the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Congress raised the threshold required to trigger the 5-year statutory minimum sentence for cocaine base from 5 grams to 28 grams. Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. 111-220, \u00a7 2(b), 124 Stat. 2372 (2010). Because the district court determined that the Fair Sentencing Act was retroactively applicable to Chappell\u2019s case, this is not an issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b889-8\">. As an initial matter, Chappell does not specifically challenge the procedural reasonableness of his total sentence and has waived any claim in this respect. <em>See United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003) (holding that issues not raised in an initial brief on appeal are deemed abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
