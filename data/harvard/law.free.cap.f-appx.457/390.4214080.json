The written judgment required: \u201cWithin 72 hours of being placed on supervised release or upon completion of the custody sentence, the defendant shall surrender to a duly authorized immigration official.\u201d Vasquez maintains: because the court did not impose this condition orally at sentencing, the written judgment should be amended to conform to the court\u2019s oral pronouncement. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">Because Vasquez had no opportunity at sentencing to challenge the subsequent inclusion of the condition in the written judgment, review is for abuse of discretion. <em>E.g., United States v. Bigelow, </em>462 F.3d 378, 381 (5th Cir.2006). \u201c[W]hen there is a conflict between a written sentence and an oral pronouncement, the oral pronouncement controls\u201d. <em>United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 935 (5th Cir.2003) (citation and quotation marks omitted). \u201c[T]he judgment\u2019s inclusion of conditions that are mandatory, standard, or recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines does not create a conflict with the oral pronouncement\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 938. On the other hand, \u201cif the district court fails to mention a <em>special </em>condition at sentencing, its subsequent inclusion in the written judgment creates a conflict that requires amendment of the written judgment to conform with the oral pronouncement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 936 (emphasis in original) (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-14\">As Vasquez contends, the condition imposed in the written judgment is not listed among the standard conditions of supervised release found either in Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 5D1.3(c) or the relevant portion of the Southern District of Texas\u2019 General Order No. H-1996-10. Furthermore, the condition does not comport with the recommended special condition of supervised release ordering deportation in Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 5D1.3(d)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-15\">AFFIRMED in part; VACATED in part; and REMANDED for amendment of the written judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b413-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
