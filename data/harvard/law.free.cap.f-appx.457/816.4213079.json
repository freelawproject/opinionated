The Board found that Lawrence was statutorily ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility because he had been convicted of drug related offenses. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1182(c) (repealed Sept. 1996), 1251(a)(2)(B)\u00ae (transferred to section 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00ae in Sept. 1996). We dismiss in part and deny in part Lawrence\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>In 2006, the Department of Homeland Security charged Lawrence with remova-bility for violating laws related to a controlled substance. The Department alleged that Lawrence, although admitted to the United States legally, was deportable because, on August 8, 1996, he had been convicted in a Florida court of possessing less than 20 grams of marijuana and possessing drug paraphernalia, Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 893.13, 893.147. Lawrence conceded removability, but he applied for a waiver of inadmissibility and argued that section 1251(a)(2)(B)(i) was enacted after his convictions and did not apply retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Lawrence filed in a Florida court a motion to set aside his August 1996 convictions. In June 2008, the Florida court held a hearing on Lawrence\u2019s motion during which Lawrence sought to set aside his convictions because he faced deportation. The prosecutor and Lawrence agreed that Lawrence could set aside his convictions and plead guilty to two counts of trespassing. The district court granted Lawrence\u2019s motion and adjudged him guilty of two counts of trespassing.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">In July 2008, the immigration judge ordered Lawrence removed from the United States. The immigration judge found that Lawrence was ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility because he had committed offenses relating to a controlled substance after April 24, 1996, the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1182(c), 1251 (a) (2) (B) (i). Lawrence appealed to the Board, which remanded the case for the immigration judge to determine whether the Florida court had vacated Lawrence\u2019s convictions on the merits or to aid him in immigration proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Lawrence filed a motion to terminate the proceedings, but the immigration judge denied the motion and again ordered Lawrence removed from the United States. The immigration judge found that the Florida court had modified Lawrence\u2019s drug related convictions only to aid him in immigration proceedings and that the convictions rendered him ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility. <em>See Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 810 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">Lawrence appealed to the Board, but the Board dismissed Lawrence\u2019s appeal. The Board \u201cagree[d]\u201d with the findings of the immigration judge that Lawrence\u2019s drug related convictions were modified \u201cto affect [his] immigration proceedings\u201d and that Lawrence \u201cremainfed] removable as charged\u201d under section 1227(a)(2)(B)(i). The Board found that Lawrence was \u201cnot eligible for a waiver under the laws ... in effect\u201d when he was convicted of the drug related offenses and, \u201cas [he] was and is statutorily ineligible for the requested relief, the various federal regulations that have controlled the applications for waivers of inadmissibility do not affect his eligibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">Lawrence challenges the decision of the Board on three grounds that we lack jurisdiction to consider. First, Lawrence argues that the Board should have considered the procedural arguments he allegedly raised in his motion to set aside his drug related convictions, but Lawrence failed to submit a copy of his motion to the Board. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006). Second, Lawrence argues that the Board violated his right of due process by refusing to consider his motion, but Lawrence never presented that argument to the Board. <em>See id. </em>Third, Lawrence argues that the Board should have given full faith and credit to the modified convictions, but \u201c[w]here a constitutional claim has no merit ... we do not have jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1333 (11th Cir.2003). The Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>applies to the states, and the Board did not violate the principles of the Clause by examining Lawrence\u2019s modified convictions after the Florida court failed to identify a defect in his convictions for drug related offenses. We dismiss in part Lawrence\u2019s petition about these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">Lawrence argues that the Board misapplied the law in finding that he was ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility, but Lawrence\u2019s argument fails. Under the law in effect on August 8, 1996, Lawrence was ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility because of his convictions for drug related offenses. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1182(c) (repealed Sept. 1996), 1251(a)(2)(B)\u00a9 (transferred to section 1227 in Sept. 1996). Lawrence argues that he is eligible for a waiver under <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), but that decision permits a waiver for aliens convicted before April 24,1996. Lawrence challenges the refusal of the Board to credit his modified convictions for trespass, but the Board did not misapply the law when it found that Lawrence remained convicted of two drug related offenses. A conviction that is later vacated nonetheless remains a \u201cconviction\u201d under the immigration laws \u201c \u2018if a court vacates a conviction for reasons unrelated to the merits of the underlying criminal proceedings,\u2019 \u201d such as to obtain relief based on \u201c \u2018rehabilitation or immigration hardships.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ali, </em>443 F.3d at 810 (quoting <em>In re Pickering, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 621, 624 (BIA 2003). We deny that part of Lawrence\u2019s petition that challenged his order of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
