In the motion seeking injunctive relief, Jernard seeks to enjoin defendant prison officials from violating his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights by denying him access to certain legal documents. Jer-nard was denied access to a self-help legal manual because, in the prison warden\u2019s opinion, the manual was \u201ctoo large.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was further denied access to photocopies of legal forms because they did not come from the publisher itself or an attorney of record, as required by the prison regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-14\">A district court may grant preliminary injunctive relief only if the moving party shows that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-15\">(1) it has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-16\">(2) irreparable injury will be suffered unless the injunction issues;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-17\">(3) the threatened injury to the movant outweighs whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party; and (4) if issued, the injunction would not be adverse to the public interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-18\"><em>Keeton v. Anderson-Wiley, </em>664 F.3d 865, 868 (11th Cir.2011). A preliminary injunction is considered \u201can extraordinary and drastic remedy,\u201d which should not be granted unless the movant clearly establishes that he has satisfied all four requisites. <em>Siegel v. LePore, </em>234 F.3d 1163, 1176 (11th Cir.2000) <em>(en </em>banc) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>We review the decision to deny a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion. <em>Scott v. Roberts, </em>612 F.3d 1279, 1289 (11th Cir.2010). In so doing, we review the findings of fact of the district court for clear error and legal conclusions <em>de novo. Id. </em>However, in First Amendment cases, we review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a preliminary injunction under a unique abuse of discretion standard: ordinary historical facts are reviewed for clear error and include the \u201cwho, what, where, when and how of the controversy.\u201d <em>Keeton, </em>664 F.3d at 868 (quotation omitted). Constitutional facts are reviewed <em>de novo </em>and include \u201cthe crucial or ultimate facts\u201d that determine whether the defendant\u2019s actions violated the First Amendment. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Irreparable injury \u201cis the <em>sine qua non </em>of injunctive relief.\u201d <em>Siegel, </em>234 F.3d at 1176. On appeal, Jernard asserts that he has satisfied the four requirements necessary for a preliminary injunction motion to be granted, and specifically argues that he is threatened with irreparable harm to his First Amendment rights to access to the courts and to receive mail in prison.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, Jernard fails to show how he will suffer irreparable harm in being denied access to this <em>specific </em>legal manual. As Jernard himself asserts, he is \u201ca paralegal and the law library aid for this prison.\u201d Therefore, he has access to the law library and, presumably, other legal self-help manuals. While we agree that access to legal materials and to courts is a constitutional right, and, under certain circumstances, states have an affirmative obligation to ensure that indigent prisoners have a fair opportunity to present their legal claims by assisting inmates in the preparation of various legal papers and providing them with adequate law libraries or other assistance, <em>Barbour v. Haley, </em>471 F.3d 1222, 1225 (11th Cir.2006), in order to show actual injury a prisoner must show that his \u201cefforts to pursue a nonfrivolous claim were frustrated or impeded by a deficiency in the prison library or in a legal assistance program.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Jernard\u2019s proffers in this regard do not show a deprivation of constitutional magnitude, or explain the irreparable injuries that would flow from the denial of access to this particular book and to these particular photocopied documents.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Notably, \u201c[t]he burden of persuasion in all of four requirements is at all times upon the plaintiff.\u201d <em>United States v. Jefferson Cnty., </em>720 F.2d 1511, 1519 (11th Cir.1983). Thus, the \u201cirreparable injury,\u201d prong which is necessary to sustain a grant of a preliminary injunction, cannot be satisfied with respect to Jernard\u2019s First Amendment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\"><em>Pro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and are liberally construed. <em>Bingham v. Thomas, </em>654 F.3d 1171, 1175 (11th Cir.2011). However, to the extent that Jernard is also making a claim of substantive due process under the Four<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>teenth Amendment, such a claim does not exist where constitutional amendment covers the right at issue. <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 395, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989). To the extent that Jernard is making a claim of procedural due process, he must demonstrate: (1) a deprivation of a constitutionally-protected liberty or property interest; (2) state action; and (3) constitutionally-inadequate process. <em>Grayden v. Rhodes, </em>345 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2003). This Court has specifically held that there is no constitutionally-protected liberty interest in access to a grievance procedure provided for voluntarily by a prison. <em>Bingham, </em>654 F.3d at 1177-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">Because a failure to satisfy one of the preliminary injunction requirements is dis-positive, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Jer-nard\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b860-11\">. Specifically, the Warden cited the Georgia Department of Corrections Standard Operating Procedure (GDOC SOP) IIB06-0001(I) which clearly states that inmate property must be \"limited to quantities which can be neatly and safely stored in the inmate's locker or storage area, so long as the property does not pose a fire, sanitation, security or housekeeping problem.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b861-6\">. Although a prisoner \"retains those First Amendment rights that are not inconsistent with his status as a prisoner or with the legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system,\u201d <em>Al-Amin </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>511 F.3d 1317, 1333 (11th Cir.2008), it is well established that \"the Constitution sometimes permits greater restriction of [First Amendment] rights in a prison than it would allow elsewhere.\u201d <em>Beard v. Banks, </em>548 U.S. 521, 528, 126 S.Ct. 2572, 165 L.Ed.2d 697 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b861-9\">. Although there appears to be a factual dispute, unresolved in the record, as to whether the photocopied documents at issue were otherwise available in the law library, this dispute does not affect the court's ruling that Jernard has failed to state a claim of irreparable injury sufficient to support a grant of a preliminary injunction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
