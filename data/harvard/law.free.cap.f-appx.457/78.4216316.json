Schweitzer, III, has a two-decade history of defrauding the Department of Defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Schweitzer, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>454 F.3d 197, 198 (3d Cir.2006). This history has resulted in his convictions of mail fraud and other federal crimes in 1985, 1995 and 2005. <em>See id. </em>at 198-200. We have affirmed them. <em>See id. </em>at 206; <em>United States v. Schweitzer, </em>116 F.3d 470 (Table) (3d Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Schweitzer, </em>800 F.2d 1141 (Table) (3d Cir.1986). We also have rejected Schweitzer\u2019s numerous collateral challenges to these convictions and his sentences over the years. <em>See Schweitzer v. United States, </em>354 Fed.Appx. 601, 602 (3d Cir.2009). The convictions have never been invalidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">At issue here is a civil complaint that Schweitzer filed in 2007. Schweitzer named and sought monetary damages from the United States and forty-six other state, federal and private defendants, including investigators, prosecutors, probation officers, privately retained counsel, judges, court employees, government witnesses, and virtually everyone else involved in his criminal proceedings and sentences. In general terms, Schweitzer alleges that he is innocent and that defendants have conspired to wrongly convict him and deprive him of various constitutional rights in connection with his criminal proceedings, collateral challenges, and the service of his sentences. Schweitzer later filed a very similar complaint against many of the same defendants in a different District Court. That court dismissed the complaint, and we dismissed his resultant appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). <em>See Schweitzer, </em>354 Fed.Appx. at 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Meanwhile, the defendants filed motions to dismiss Schweitzer\u2019s complaint in the present action as well. The District Court granted those motions in a series of rulings. By order entered March 29, 2011, it dismissed the complaint as to two law firms and one lawyer. By order entered March 30, 2011, it dismissed the complaint as to another law firm and lawyer. By order entered April 13, 2011, it dismissed the complaint as to the state defendants. Finally, by order entered September 22, 2011, it dismissed the complaint as to the federal defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Schweitzer appeals. He mentions only the District Court\u2019s September 22 order in his notice of appeal, but even if we liberally construed it to include the District Court\u2019s prior orders our ruling would be the same. Because we have granted Schweitzer leave to proceed in forma pau-peris, we must screen this appeal to determine whether it is frivolous. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). An appeal is frivolous if it \u201clacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.\u201d <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Schweitzer\u2019s appeal lacks any such basis. The District Court thoroughly explained its reasons for dismissing the complaint against each defendant, and those reasons included collateral estoppel on the basis of our previous rulings, statutes of limitations, prosecutorial and judicial immunity, the favorable termination requirement of <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and failure to state a claim on numerous other grounds. The District Court also properly explained why leave to amend would be futile. We have carefully reviewed Schweitzer\u2019s complaint and the District Court\u2019s opinions. We discern no arguable basis to question the District Court\u2019s rulings, for the reasons the District Court already has thoroughly and adequately explained. Schweitzer\u2019s submission in support of his appeal, the first sentence of which urges us to \u201c[fjorget the criminal judgments,\u201d states no such basis. For these reasons, we will dismiss this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
