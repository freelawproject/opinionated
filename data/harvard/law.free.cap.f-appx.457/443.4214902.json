Wyatt, federal prisoner # 04900-051, has filed an application for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, following the dismissal for lack of jurisdiction of his federal habeas petition challenging the validity of his conviction for possession with intent to distribute marijuana. A movant for IFP on appeal must show that he is a pauper and that he will present a nonfrivolous appellate issue. <em>Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">Before the district court, Wyatt argued that his criminal conviction was invalid because the statute of conviction, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, did not constitute an \u201cAct of Congress.\u201d The district court construed Wyatt\u2019s \u201cwrit of a habeas corpus ad subju-diciendum\u201d as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition and concluded that it was improperly submitted because Wyatt\u2019s challenge to the validity of his conviction should be presented under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Because Wyatt was challenging matters arising pri- or to the imposition of his federal sentence, his claims arose under \u00a7 2255. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425-26 (5th Cir.2005). A \u00a7 2241 petition raising such a claim may be considered only where the petitioner establishes that \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001). To show that \u00a7 2255 was rendered inadequate or ineffective in his case, Wyatt must show that his claim (1) \u201cis based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and (2) \u201cwas foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904. Wyatt\u2019s challenge to the statute of conviction does not meet this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-15\">Wyatt\u2019s assertion that the district court denied his due process rights by failing to inform him whether it derived its powers from Article I or Article III of the Constitution does not entitle him to relief. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Raddatz, </em>447 U.S. 667, 676-77, 100 S.Ct. 2406, 65 L.Ed.2d 424 (1980). He is incorrect in his assertion that the district court could not convert his generic writ of habeas corpus to a statutory writ or to a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243; <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). The district court was not obligated to obtain an answer from the respondent before concluding that Wyatt\u2019s claims were meritless. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2243.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-16\">Because Wyatt has not met the requirements for proceeding under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255, and because he has not established that the district court committed a procedural error in addressing his case, he has not established that he will raise a nonfrivolous appellate issue. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number><em>See Carson, </em>689 F.2d at 586. Accordingly we DENY the motion to proceed IFP on appeal and we DISMISS Wyatt\u2019s appeal as frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 n. 24 (5th Cir.1997); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. All other outstanding motions are likewise DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b466-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
