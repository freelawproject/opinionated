Williams appeals his conviction and 42-month sentence for possession with intent to distribute controlled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">On June 6, 2010, in Savannah, Georgia, a police officer on patrol approached Defendant Williams, who was sleeping on his sister\u2019s poi\u2019ch. The officer noticed a handgun between Williams\u2019s feet and called for backup. The officer then secured the handgun, woke Williams, and asked Williams for identification. Williams told the officer that he had identification in his pocket and gave the officer permission to retrieve it. While searching Defendant Williams for identification, the officer discovered 34.4 grams of marijuana, 5.54 grams of powder cocaine, and 4 grams of cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-13\">A grand jury indicted Defendant Williams on one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) and one count of possession with intent to distribute controlled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Williams unconditionally pled guilty to the drug offense, and the government agreed to dismiss the firearm offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-14\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) calculated Williams\u2019s total offense level as 15, which included (1) a base offense level of 16 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(12), (2) a two-level enhancement under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) for possessing the handgun during the \u00a7 841 offense, and (3) a three-level reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b) for acceptance of responsibility. Williams\u2019s criminal history yielded 13 criminal history points and a criminal history category of VI. These calculations yielded a Guidelines range of 41 to 51 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-15\">At sentencing, Williams objected to the two-level enhancement for possessing the handgun. Although conceding that Williams was on the porch and that the handgun was next to Williams, defense counsel offered to have Williams\u2019s sister testify that she looked out on the porch about an hour before the police officers arrived and did not see a handgun. Defense counsel also offered to have Williams testify that he \u201cpassed out from consuming alcohol and drugs\u201d on the night of his arrest, did not have a gun when he passed out, and knew neither where the gun came from nor to whom it belonged. After clan-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>fying that Williams\u2019s sister would testify only that the handgun was not present an hour before the officers arrived, the district court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">The district court granted a downward departure on the ground that Williams\u2019s criminal history category of VI overstated his criminal history but otherwise adopted the PSI\u2019s Guidelines calculations. After reducing Williams\u2019s criminal history category to V, the district court calculated a Guidelines range of 37 to 46 months\u2019 imprisonment. After hearing Williams\u2019s mitigation arguments, the district court imposed a 42-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">A. Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">On appeal, Williams attempts to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. However, we decline to review Williams\u2019s conviction because he unconditionally pled guilty to the \u00a7 841 drug offense and therefore waived any non-jurisdietional defect in the conviction\u2014including the error, if any, in the denial of his motion to suppress. <em>See United States v. Pierre, </em>120 F.3d 1153, 1155 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201cA defendant\u2019s unconditional plea of guilty, made knowingly, voluntarily, and with the benefit of competent counsel, waives all non-jurisdictional defects in that defendant\u2019s court proceedings.\u201d (quotation marks and alteration omitted)); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2) (permitting a defendant to enter a conditional plea of guilty \u201creserving in writing the right to have an appellate court review an adverse determination of a specified pretrial motion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">B. Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">On appeal, Williams challenges the district court\u2019s application of the two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) for possession of the handgun during his drug offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-15\">Section 2D1.1(b)(1) increases the base offense level by two levels if \u201ca dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). \u201cThe enhancement should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. (n. 3). In other words, the government need not establish a connection between the offense and the firearm, only that the firearm was present. <em>United States v. Hall, </em>46 F.3d 62, 64 (11th Cir.1995). \u201cOnce the prosecution has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the firearm was present at the site of the charged conduct, the evidentiary burden shifts to the defendant to show that a connection between the firearm and the offense is clearly improbable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-16\">Although conceding that the government met its burden and established by a preponderance of the evidence that the firearm was present at the time and place he was arrested, Williams argues that the \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement should not apply because (1) he was found asleep in a place open to the public and denied having any knowledge of the firearm and (2) the government declined to pursue the firearm charge in his indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-17\">The problem for Williams is that he did not present evidence that a connection between the firearm and the offense was \u201cclearly improbable.\u201d Williams\u2019s sister\u2019s testimony, even if presented and credited by the district court, showed only that she did not see a firearm on the porch an hour <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>before the officers arrived. And even if Williams had testified, the district court was not obligated to credit his self-serving testimony that he did not know where the gun between his legs came from. Although he was \u201cpassed out,\u201d Williams had all of the drugs on his person when the officers arrived, and the gun was well within arms reach. Finally, the government\u2019s dismissal of the firearm charge in the indictment did not prevent the district court from considering the handgun in determining Williams\u2019s sentence for the drug offense. <em>See United States v. Lynch, </em>934 F.2d 1226, 1234 n. 8 (11th Cir.1991) (rejecting a defendant\u2019s argument that his sentence on drug convictions could not include a \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) enhancement because he was acquitted of a separate firearms charge in his indictment). The district court did not err in apply the two-level enhancement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b871-11\">.
