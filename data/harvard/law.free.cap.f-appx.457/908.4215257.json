Devo argues that the district court erred in sentencing him as an armed career criminal, because his prior felony conviction for resisting an officer with violence was not a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d). This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>whether a prior conviction is a violent felony for purposes of the ACCA. <em>United States v. McGill, </em>618 F.3d 1273, 1274-75 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-20\">The ACCA imposes a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence on an offender who has three prior convictions \u201cfor a violent felony or a serious drug offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Devo does not contest that he had two prior drug convictions that qualify under the statute. His only argument is that his prior conviction in Florida for resisting arrest does not qualify as a \u201cviolent felony,\u201d and that he therefore is not subject to the ACCA mandatory minimum.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b932-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>Under Florida Statute \u00a7 843.01, it is a felony to \u201cknowingly and willfully\u201d resist, obstruct, or oppose \u201cany officer ... in the lawful execution of any legal duty, by offering or doing violence to the person of such officer.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01. Under this Court\u2019s precedent, a conviction under this statute qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the ACCA. <em>See United States v. Nix, </em>628 F.3d 1341 (11th Cir.2010), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 258, 181 L.Ed.2d 150 (2011) (adopting the rationale of <em>United States v. Hayes, </em>409 Fed.Appx. 277 (11th Cir.2010) (unpublished), <em>cert. </em>denied-U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 125, 181 L.Ed.2d 47 (2011)). In <em>Hayes, </em>we \u201cha[d] no difficulty concluding that one who commits the crime of resisting arrest by knowingly and willfully offering or doing violence to an arresting officer has committed a \u2018violent felony\u2019 for purposes of ACCA, and that such a person is properly subject to ACCA\u2019s fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence as an \u2018armed career criminal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hayes, </em>409 Fed.Appx. at 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">Devo argues that the <em>Nix </em>and <em>Hayes </em>decisions fail to apply the recent Supreme Court precedent, <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008). In that case, the Supreme Court held that a conviction under New Mexico\u2019s driving under the influence (DUI) statute did not qualify as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the ACCA because it was not similar enough in kind to the enumerated felonies (burglary, arson, extortion and use of explosives). However, Devo glosses over the central point in <em>Begay: </em>\u201cthat DUI does not fall within the scope of the Act\u2019s clause [because it] nowhere \u2018has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u2019 \u201d <em>Begay, </em>128 S.Ct. at 1584 <em>(citing </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(I)). In contrast, Florida courts have noted that a conviction under Florida\u2019s resisting arrest statute <em>does </em>require proof of such conduct or attempted conduct involving threatened or actual physical force with violence. <em>Walker v. State, </em>965 So.2d 1281, 1283-84 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">Devo also argues that the residual clause in the ACCA is unconstitutionally vague because an ordinary person would not know what conduct the language references. He correctly points out that the ACCA\u2019s residual clause reads as follows: \u201cor otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). Because Devo did not raise this argument in the district court, we review it for plain error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005). Devo does not cite to any precedent holding that any specific ACCA provision, much less the entire statute, is unconstitutionally vague. Moreover, neither we nor the Supreme Court have ever held that the ACCA, or any of its sections, are unconstitutionally vague. Accordingly, the district court did not plainly err in failing to find that the ACCA\u2019s residual clause was unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b931-13\">. The ACCA defines a \"violent felony\u201d as \"any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-14\">(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aau2\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
