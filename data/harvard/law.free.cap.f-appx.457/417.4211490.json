Hudson appeals the district court\u2019s judgment revoking his term of supervised release and sentencing him to 23 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>months of imprisonment and an additional supervised release term of 13 months. Hudson timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Hudson first argues that the district court plainly erred in imposing his sentence by considering factors identified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), such as the need \u201cto provide just punishment for the offense\u201d and its \u201cseriousness.\u201d Because Hudson did not object in the district court to the court\u2019s consideration of a prohibited factor in determining his sentence, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Martinez, </em>485 F.3d 270, 272-73 (5th Cir.2007). To show plain error, Hudson must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">After Hudson was sentenced, while the instant appeal was pending, we decided <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841 (5th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 496, 181 L.Ed.2d 345 (2011). In <em>Miller, </em>we held that \u201cit is improper for a district court to rely on \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) for the modification or revocation of a supervised release term.\u201d 634 F.3d at 844. To the extent that the district court relied on a \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factor, such reliance was impermissible under <em>Miller.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">Our circuit has issued inconsistent cases on the subject of whether the \u201cplainness\u201d of an error is judged at the time of sentencing or at the time of appeal. <em>Compare United States v. Garcia-Rodriguez, </em>415 F.3d 452, 455 (5th Cir.2005) (\u201c \u2018Plain\u2019 is synonymous with \u2018clear\u2019 or \u2018obvious,\u2019 and at a minimum, contemplates an error which was clear under current law at the time of trial.\u201d); <em>United States v. Hull, </em>160 F.3d 265, 272 (5th Cir.1998) (same), <em>with United States v. Bishop, </em>603 F.3d 279, 281 (5th Cir.) (\u201cWe determine whether an alleged error is plain by reference to existing law at the time of appeal.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 272, 178 L.Ed.2d 180 (2010); <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Terrazas, </em>529 F.3d 293, 298 (5th Cir.2008) (\u201c[T]he error need only be plain at the time of appellate consideration.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Gloria, </em>440 Fed.Appx. 362, 364-65 (5th Cir.2011)(unpublished)(concluding <em>Miller </em>error was not plain because of circuit split at the time of sentencing). Accordingly, we apply the earliest pronouncement of this determination following the Supreme Court\u2019s explication of the plain error factors in <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). <em>United States v. Knowles, </em>29 F.3d 947 (5th Cir.1994) (holding that error is plain when it is plain at the time of appeal). Where \u201ctwo previous holdings or lines of precedent conflict, the earlier opinion controls and is the binding precedent in this circuit.\u201d <em>United States v. Wheeler, </em>322 F.3d 823, 828 n. 1 (5th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we conclude that the district court plainly erred in considering a factor under \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">We conclude that this error affected Hudson\u2019s substantial rights. Although the district court references factors it \u201cshould consider\u201d under 3553(a) in pronouncing the sentence, it discussed only two facts expressly not permitted to be considered under Miller\u2014the seriousness of the offense and punishment. Thus, we conclude that the error resulted in the imposition of an impermissible sentence affecting Hudson\u2019s rights. Finally, we conclude that it is appropriate to exercise our discretion to correct this error.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>We also review for plain error Hudson\u2019s second argument, <em>ie., </em>that the district court erred by considering his need for rehabilitation in determining his sentence. This argument is based on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Tapia v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2382, 180 L.Ed.2d 357 (2011). In the wake of <em>Tapia, </em>however, we have held that the limitations on the consideration of rehabilitation at issue in <em>Tapia </em>do not apply in a revocation proceeding. <em>See United States v. Breland, </em>647 F.3d 284, 287-90 (5th Cir.2011). Therefore, this argument is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Hudson\u2019s sentence is REVERSED, and the case is remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b440-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
