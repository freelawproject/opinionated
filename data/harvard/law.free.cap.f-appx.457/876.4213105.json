Dellasera challenges the admission of the testimony of Janeth Becerra and the denial of Dellasera\u2019s request to instruct the jury that coconspirator Theresa Gonzalez was a \u201cmissing witness.\u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted testimony from Becerra. Dellasera offered Becerra, a coworker at Baptist Hospital, an opportunity to make $10,000 by serving as a straw buyer in a real estate transaction. Becerra testified that she rejected that offer because she knew that a transaction in which she received \u201cmoney just to purchase ... property\u201d to be \u201cplace[d] ... in her name\u201d was fraudulent. Becerra\u2019s testimony conveyed her rational \u201cperception\u201d of Dellasera\u2019s offer, Fed.R.Evid. 701, and aided the jury in determining whether Del-lasera intentionally participated in a scheme to defraud, <em>see United States v. </em>Jennings, 599 F.3d 1241, 1251 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion by refusing to instruct the jury that Gonzalez was a \u201cmissing witness.\u201d Gonzalez was not \u201cpeculiarly within the control of\u2019 the government. <em>United States v. Nahoom, </em>791 F.2d 841, 846 (11th Cir.1986). Although Gonzalez agreed to \u201chonor whatever obligation she [had] under her plea agreement,\u201d the government stated that Gonzalez intended to \u201cinvoke her Fifth Amendment rights\u201d and was allowed to do so \u201c[u]nder <em>United States [v.] Kuku,\u201d </em>in which this Court held that \u201ca defendant retains the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination prior to sentencing, despite having entered a guilty plea, because of the possible impact that compelled testimony may have on [her] as yet undetermined sentence.\u201d 129 F.3d 1435, 1438 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">We AFFIRM Dellasera\u2019s convictions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
