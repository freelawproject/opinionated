On appeal, Johnson argues that the district court erred in applying a four-level enhancement to his offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), because it clearly erred in its factual finding that he had possessed a firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense. Johnson contends that the term \u201cclose proximity,\u201d as contained in the commentary to \u00a7 2K2.1, should mean \u201cextreme or immediate nearness such that it is irrefutably presumed that the firearm is connected to the commission of the offense involving the drugs.\u201d Johnson states that the drugs and drug paraphernalia discovered at his residence were in different rooms than the firearm and ammunition, and thus, the government failed to satisfy its burden of proof with respect to the enhancement. Johnson further argues that, because there was insufficient detail provided regarding Johnson\u2019s house, the district court could not reliably conclude that the firearm was connected to the drug-distribution offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-15\">We review a district court\u2019s application and interpretation of the Guidelines <em>de novo, </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d 690, 693 (11th Cir.2002). The district court\u2019s determination that the defendant used a firearm in connection with another felony offense is a factual finding that we review for clear error. <em>United States v. Whitfield, 50 </em>F.3d 947, 949 (11th Cir.1995). The government bears the burden to establish the facts that are necessary to sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>port a sentencing enhancement \u201cand it must do so by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez-Oliveros, </em>479 F.3d 779, 783 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, a four-level enhancement applies where the defendant \u201cpossessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). Generally, we have held that a defendant can possess a weapon through both actual and constructive possession. <em>See United States v. Gunn, </em>369 F.3d 1229, 1234 (11th Cir.2004) (addressing possession of a firearm under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)). A defendant has actual possession of a firearm when he has direct physical control over the item. <em>Id. </em>at 1235. A defendant has constructive possession when he exercised \u201cownership, dominion, or control\u201d over an item itself or the place of concealment of the item. <em>See United States v. Derose, </em>74 F.3d 1177, 1185 (11th Cir.1996) (addressing possession of marijuana under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 843).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Before 2006, the phrase \u201cin connection with,\u201d as used in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), was not defined in the Guidelines. <em>See Rhind, </em>289 F.3d at 695. We, however, noted that in other guidelines sections involving the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d we gave the phrase an expansive interpretation and rejected the notion that a firearm must facilitate the underlying offense to trigger application of the four-level enhancement. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Young, </em>115 F.3d 834 (11th Cir.1997)). We held, in interpreting analogous guideline provisions, that, in circumstances where it was reasonable to assume that the defendant possessed a firearm to prevent the theft of property related to the underlying offense, mere possession of a firearm could be enough to satisfy the \u201cin connection with\u201d requirement. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>276 F.3d 1231, 1234 (11th Cir.2001) (citations omitted); <em>see Rhind, </em>289 F.3d at 695 (holding that it is reasonable to conclude that the presence of firearms in a vehicle protected counterfeit money from theft during the execution of a counterfeit felony). Additionally, we held that a firearm that was not on a defendant\u2019s person can still be possessed in connection with a felony offense if the gun could have been easily retrieved. <em>United States v. Flennory, </em>145 F.3d 1264, 1270 (11th Cir.1998) (holding that a defendant possessed a firearm in connection with a crime when the firearm was kept in a car across the street from where the defendant was selling drugs), <em>superceded by regulation on other grounds, as stated in United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">In 2006, the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 was amended in order to address a circuit conflict pertaining to the use of a firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d drug offenses. U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 691. The amendment made clear that the guideline applied where the firearm only had the potential of facilitating another offense. <em>Id. </em>The November 1, 2010 Guidelines include an application note that states that \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) applies where \u201cthe firearm or ammunition facilitated, or had the potential of facilitating, another felony offense.... \u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, comment, (n. 14(A)). Where the felony offense is a drug offense, the guideline applies where \u201ca firearm is found in close proximity to drugs, drug-manufacturing materials, or drug paraphernalia. In these cases, application of [the guideline] is warranted because the presence of the firearm has the potential of facilitating another felony offense.... \u201d <em>Id., </em>comment, (n. 14(B)); <em>see United States v. Pham, </em>463 F.3d 1239, 1246 (11th Cir.2006) (noting that guns are the \u201ctool[s] of the drug trade,\u201d as there is a \u201cfrequent and overpowering connection between the use of firearms and narcotics traffic\u201d in the context of determining whether U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>\u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) was applicable to defendant\u2019s offense level (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">The presentence investigation report shows that Johnson possessed a loaded firearm and 47 additional rounds of ammunition at his small residence where officers found marijuana and drug paraphernalia. The district court determined at the sentencing hearing that drug paraphernalia was scattered throughout Johnson\u2019s residence. Johnson did not object to any of these facts. Based on these facts, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in determining that Johnson\u2019s firearm was found in \u201cclose proximity\u201d to the marijuana and that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Johnson\u2019s total sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
