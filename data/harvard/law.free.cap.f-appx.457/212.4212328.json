We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See Santiago v. Warminster Twp., </em>629 F.3d 121, 128 &amp; n. 4 (3d Cir.2010). For the reasons discussed below, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-16\">Montilla, a state prisoner, filed a complaint in the District Court alleging that the defendants<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> violated his Eighth Amendment rights by providing him with inadequate medical care. More specifically, he claimed that while one prison doctor informed him that he needed hip-replacement surgery, other doctors overruled that recommendation and prescribed only physical therapy. Montilla also raised medical malpractice claims under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-17\">The defendants filed motions to dismiss, which the District Court granted in full. The Court concluded that Montilla did not \u201callege sufficient facts to support a plausible claim that the medical defendants intentionally refused to provide medical care in disregard of substantial risk to his health or safety or denied reasonable requests for medical treatment,\u201d and therefore dismissed his Eighth Amendment claim. Further, the Court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Mon-tilla\u2019s state law claims. Montilla then filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-18\">We agree with the District Court\u2019s analysis in full. As the Supreme Court has explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-19\">a prison official cannot be found liable under the Eighth Amendment for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement unless the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety; the official must both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-4\"><em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). \u201cTo act with deliberate indifference to serious medical needs is to recklessly disregard a substantial risk of serious harm.\u201d <em>Giles v. Kearney, </em>571 F.3d 318, 330 (3d Cir.2009). For instance, a plaintiff may make this showing by establishing that the defendants \u201cintentionally den[ied] or delay[ed] medical care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). However, \u201c[w]here a prisoner has received some medical attention and the dispute is over the adequacy of the treatment, federal courts are generally reluctant to second guess medical judgments and to constitutionalize claims which sound in state tort law.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Walker v. Fayette Cnty., </em>599 F.2d 573, 575 n. 2 (3d Cir.1979) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Here, Montilla has challenged his doctors\u2019 decision to treat his hip condition with only physical therapy. However, while Montilla believes that his condition requires hip-replacement surgery, he acknowledges that the defendants have provided him treatment; we have recognized that courts will \u201cdisavow any attempt to second-guess the propriety or adequacy of a particular course of treatment[,] which remains a question of sound professional judgment.\u201d <em>Inmates of Allegheny Cnty. Jail v. Pierce, </em>612 F.2d 754, 762 (3d Cir.1979) (internal alterations, quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the District Court did not err in dismissing this claim. <em>See generally Johnson v. Doughty, </em>433 F.3d 1001, 1014 (7th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">We likewise conclude that the District Court acted within its discretion in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Montilla\u2019s state law claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3); <em>Figueroa v. Buccaneer Hotel Inc., </em>188 F.3d 172, 181 (3d Cir.1999). Finally, we are satisfied that amendment to Montilla\u2019s complaint would be futile, and therefore conclude that the District Court properly dismissed the complaint without providing leave to amend. <em>See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">Accordingly, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order dismissing Mon-tilla\u2019s complaint. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b235-14\">. Montilla sued numerous defendants, who will be treated collectively in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b236-6\">. We acknowledge that Montilla alleged that the defendants refused to order surgery in order to save the attendant costs. However, this allegation is entirely conclusory, and therefore does not suffice to state a claim. <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
