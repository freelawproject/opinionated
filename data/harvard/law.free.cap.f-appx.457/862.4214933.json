On appeal, Reynolds-Buckley argues that the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) erred by discounting the medical opinion of Dr. Nadim Khan regarding her heart condition. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">We review a Commissioner\u2019s decision to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence and whether the proper legal standards were applied. <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cWe may not decide facts anew, reweigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the Commissioner.\u201d <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1210 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation and brackets omitted). We review the decision of the ALJ as the Commissioner\u2019s final decision when the ALJ denies benefits and the Appeals Council denies review of the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-13\">The Social Security Regulations outline a five-step process used to determine whether a claimant is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). Under the first step, the claimant has the burden to show that she is not currently engaged in substantial gainful activity. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(i). Next, the claimant must show that she has a severe impairment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(h). She then must attempt to show that the impairment meets or equals the criteria contained in one of the Listings of Impairments. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iii). If the claimant cannot meet or equal the criteria, she must show that she has an impairment which prevents her from performing her past relevant work. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a) (4) (iii) and (iv). Once a claimant establishes that she cannot perform her past relevant work due to some severe impairment, the burden shifts to the Commissioner to show that significant numbers of jobs exist in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>the national economy which the claimant can perform. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(v).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">The Social Security Regulations also provide guidelines for the ALJ to use when evaluating medical opinion evidence. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527. The ALJ considers many factors when weighing such evidence, including the examining relationship, the treatment relationship, whether an opinion is well-supported, whether an opinion is consistent with the record, and a doctor\u2019s specialization. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1527(d). Generally, the opinions of examining or treating physicians are given more weight than non-examining or non-treating physicians unless \u201cgood cause\u201d is shown. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 404.1527(d)(1), (2); <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997). Treating sources are given more weight because \u201cthese sources are likely to be the medical professionals most able to provide a detailed, longitudinal picture of [the claimant\u2019s] medical impairment(s).\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2). To qualify as a treating source, the physician must have an ongoing treatment relationship with the claimant. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1502. We have found \u201cgood cause\u201d to afford less weight to a treating physician\u2019s opinion where the opinion was conclusory or inconsistent with the physician\u2019s own medical records or where the evidence supported a contrary finding. <em>Lewis, </em>125 F.3d at 1440. The ALJ may discount a treating physician\u2019s report \u201cwhen it is not accompanied by objective medical evidence or is wholly conclusory.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1159 (quotation omitted). Because our limited review precludes us from reweighing the evidence, when the ALJ articulates specific reasons for failing to give the opinion of a treating physician controlling weight, and those reasons are supported by substantial evidence, there is no reversible error. <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1212 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">In this case, regardless of whether Dr. Khan qualified as a treating source, the ALJ had good cause and properly articulated reasons, supported by substantial evidence, for assigning less weight to the opinion of Dr. Khan than to the contradictory opinions of other medical professionals. Indeed, Dr. Khan\u2019s opinion was inconsistent with the medical evidence on the record and was not supported by any treatment notes or by an analysis of any test results. Notably, Dr. Louis Castro, a cardiologist, indicated that Reynolds-Buckley was \u201creally not cognizant\u201d of her heart racing when he examined her in 2007. After diagnosing Reynolds-Buckley with persistent tachycardia and running numerous cardiac tests, Dr. Caruso recommended only \u201crisk factor modification and medical therapy.\u201d In addition, Dr. Aliya Rathore\u2019s reports indicate that Reynolds-Buckley had been able to control her tachycardia by taking medication. Moreover, after a monitoring test in February 2009 revealed that Reynolds-Buckley had a normal baseline sinus rhythm with intermittent episodes of sinus tachycardia, Dr. Sunil Gupta recommended only that Reynolds-Buckley take beta blockers or calcium channel blockers, and did not indicate any restrictions in her ability to work. Because Dr. Khan provided no independent treatment notes or analysis of test results to support his conclusions about the severity of Reynolds-Buckley\u2019s condition, and those conclusions contradicted Dr. Gupta\u2019s test-supported conclusions from less than three months earlier, the ALJ did not err in attaching little weight to Dr. Khan\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">Although Reynolds-Buckley argues that, based on the February 2009 echocar-diogram, her condition had deteriorated when she saw Dr. Gupta in 2009 compared to when she first saw Dr. Caruso in 2007, she has not shown that her disability had become so severe that it rendered her unable to work. <em>McCruter v. Bowen, </em>791 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>F.2d 1544, 1547 (11th Cir.1986) (holding that \u201cthe \u2018severity\u2019 of a medically ascertained disability must be measured in terms of its effect upon ability to work, and not simply in terms of deviation from purely medical standards of bodily perfection or normality.\u201d). Notably, the baseline rhythm of 89 beats per minute recorded by the monitoring test was actually an improvement from the 110-beats-per-minute rate from the 2007 electrocardiogram, and Dr. Gupta did not place any restrictions on Reynolds-Buekley\u2019s ability to work. Finally, although Reynolds-Buckley contends that the ALJ \u201ccherry-picked\u201d the medical evidence and substituted his own judgment for that of the medical professionals, the record reflects that the ALJ considered all of the medical evidence, including a questionnaire by Dr. Khan, and Reynolds-Buckley has not shown that any medical evidence, aside from Dr. Khan\u2019s, contradicted the ALJ\u2019s conclusion. Because the ALJ did not err in weighing the medical opinion evidence, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
