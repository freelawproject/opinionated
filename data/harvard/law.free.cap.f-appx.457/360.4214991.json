We previously vacated the district court\u2019s denial of Yett\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines governing cocaine base offenses and remanded for further proceedings. <em>United States v. Yett, </em>407 Fed.Appx. 779 (5th Cir.2011). On remand, the district court reduced Yett\u2019s sentence from 360 months to 324 months, which was within the career offender range of 262 to 327 months now applicable to Yett. Yett appeals his reduced sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">A district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, and its interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). Yett first challenges the determination of the applicable guidelines range. He argues that he was sentenced outside the revised cocaine base guidelines range of 235 to 293 months and that the district court used the wrong statutory sentencing range of 10 years to life to determine his career offender level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 (1994) (offense level table). Yett contends that this latter determination turned on a judge-made finding of drug quantity, in violation of <em>United States v. Doggett, </em>230 F.3d 160, 164-65 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-16\">These arguments are without merit. Because the career offender level was greater than the amended cocaine base level, Yett was entitled to a reduction within the career offender range. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>596 F.3d 273, 276-77 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 93, 178 L.Ed.2d 58 (2010); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(1) (providing that a court must employ the amended guideline range that would have applied if the amendment had been in effect when the defendant was sentenced). With respect to the determination of the career offender level, Yett may not challenge it in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2694, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-21\">Yett also contends that the district court erred by employing the comparable reduction methodology set out in \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(B) and Application Note 3 to that Guideline. Pursuant to \u00a7 1B1.10, \u201c[i]f the original term of imprisonment imposed was less than the term of imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>ment provided by the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing, a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range ... may be appropriate.\u201d \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B). Application Note 3 gives an example of determining a comparable reduction employing a percentage-based methodology. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 3). The district court concluded that Yett\u2019s original sentence of 360 months was 1% below the top of the original range of 292 to 365 months. Therefore, pursuant to \u00a7 IB 1.10 and Application Note 3, the court determined that a sentence of 324 months, or 1% below the upper level of the amended range, was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Yett\u2019s original term of imprisonment was not less than the term provided by the guidelines range applicable to him at the time of his sentencing. Thus, the comparable reduction methodology set out in \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B) and Application Note 3 does not, on its face, apply. A \u201cdefendant is entitled to have his sentence modified by a judge aware of his discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>655 F.3d 426, 433 (5th Cir.2011). We are unable to discern from the record whether the district court simply exercised its discretion to conclude that such a reduction was appropriate in this case, or whether, as Yett contends, the court believed it lacked authority to reduce the sentence further. In addition, we cannot conclude on this record that error, if any, was harmless. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, we remand for the limited purpose of permitting the district court to clarify whether it believed it was bound by the comparable reduction methodology or merely chose to use it in the exercise of its discretion. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Ortiz, </em>310 F.3d 792, 795-96 (5th Cir.2002). We will retain jurisdiction over the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">We turn next to Yett\u2019s argument that the district court failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court expressly stated that it considered those factors as well as the parties\u2019 written arguments, which were before the court. Thus, Yett\u2019s argument fails. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Finally, Yett contends that his due process rights were violated because he was not provided an opportunity to review the probation officer\u2019s sentencing memorandum and supplemental report (collectively, the supplemental report) pri- or to the district court\u2019s ruling on his motion. If the district court intends to rely on a sentencing report addendum in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence, the defendant is entitled to notice and an opportunity to respond. <em>United States v. Mueller, </em>168 F.3d 186, 189 (5th Cir.1999). The record indicates that, although the supplemental report was sent to the Government, Yett first received a copy as an attachment to the Government\u2019s surreply. The district court issued its final ruling before Yett had an opportunity to reply. Thus, there was error. <em>See Mueller, </em>168 F.3d at 1891. Nevertheless, reversal is not required. The calculations set forth in the sentencing memorandum were fully addressed in the Government\u2019s initial response to Yett\u2019s motion, and Yett was given an opportunity to respond. Yett has not indicated what additional arguments or objections he could have made if he had been provided the supplemental report prior to the court\u2019s final ruling. Accordingly, we conclude that the error was harmless. <em>Cf. Mueller, </em>168 F.3d at 189 (finding that error was not harmless where the presentenee report addendum employed the wrong edition of the Guidelines, and the defendant argued that he could have objected if it had been disclosed). We reject Yett\u2019s related contention that improper ex parte communications occurred. There is no evidence of any communications between the probation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>officer and the Government regarding Yett\u2019s case beyond the transmission of the supplemental report.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we order a LIMITED REMAND for the purpose of permitting the district court to clarify whether it recognized its authority to reduce the sentence further and simply chose not to do so, or whether it erroneously believed it was bound by the comparable reduction methodology. <em>See Garcia-Ortiz, </em>310 F.3d at 796. We retain jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b383-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
