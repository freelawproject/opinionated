In 2008, Chrysler contracted with Linamar to produce four \u201cspecial purpose machines\u201d for the manufacture of dual-clutch transmissions at Chrysler\u2019s Kokoma, Indiana facility. Linamar subcontracted with Ann Arbor Machine (AAM) to build the machines. AAM agreed to pay Plaintiff McNaughton-McKay Electric Company (McNaughton) $424,015.42 to supply the electrical components necessary for construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-16\">After McNaughton supplied the electrical components but before AAM paid it, Chrysler cancelled its contract with Lina-mar. Chrysler paid Linamar $10.25 million in satisfaction of its claims; Linamar, in turn, paid AAM $5 million. AAM filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>for bankruptcy and never paid McNaughton under the parties\u2019 supplier contract. AAM\u2019s creditor took possession of the special purpose machines, which were subsequently sold at auction.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">McNaughton sued Linamar under a theory of unjust enrichment alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Morris Pumps v. Centerline Piping, Inc., </em>273 Mich.App. 187, 729 N.W.2d 898 (Mich.Ct.App.2006) supported a general contractor\u2019s liability for materials provided by a subcontractor\u2019s unpaid supplier. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Distinguishing <em>Morris Pumps, </em>the district court denied McNaughton\u2019s motion and granted Lina-mar\u2019s motion for summary judgment. McNaughton appeals the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">After carefully reviewing the district court\u2019s opinion, the record, and the applicable law, we are satisfied that the issues were thoroughly and correctly resolved by the district court and that summary judgment in favor of Linamar was proper. We are similarly satisfied that the instant case is factually dissimilar from <em>Morris Pumps, </em>wherein the general contractor retained and used the materials of its subcontractor\u2019s supplier despite constructive knowledge that the supplier had not been paid. <em>See id. </em>at 195-96, 729 N.W.2d 898. . Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court on the grounds stated in its well-reasoned opinion dated August 11, 2010, 2010 WL 3180402.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
