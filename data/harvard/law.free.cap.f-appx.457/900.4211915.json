On appeal, Morris argues that his conviction under \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional both facially and as-applied because the possession of a firearm by a convicted felon does not substantially affect interstate commerce, and because his own possession did not substantially affect interstate commerce. Specifically, Morris argues that \u00a7 922(g)\u2019s phrase \u201cin or affecting commerce\u201d does not limit the definition of commerce to \u201cinterstate or foreign commerce,\u201d and that \u00a7 922(g) does not require that the possession of the firearm by a convicted felon \u201csubstantially\u201d affect interstate commerce. The government argues that Morris waived his challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g) by pleading guilty, and that his challenge is otherwise foreclosed by our precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-16\">Although we generally review challenges to the constitutionality of a statute <em>de novo, </em>we review for plain error where, as here, the challenge is raised for the first time on appeal. <em>United States v. Wright, </em>607 F.3d 708, 715 (11th Cir.2010). \u201cPlain error occurs if (1) there was error, (2) that was plain, (3) that affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and (4) that seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cA plain error is an error that is obvious and is clear under current law.\u201d <em>United States v. Humphrey, </em>164 F.3d 585, 588 (11th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-17\">A guilty plea generally waives all non-jurisdictional challenges to a conviction. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>532 F.3d 1125, 1127 (11th Cir.2008). Issues not raised in an appellant\u2019s initial brief are deemed abandoned. <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-18\">In <em>Scarborough v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 563, 97 S.Ct. 1963, 52 L.Ed.2d 582 (1977), the Supreme Court examined a former statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202(a), that prohibited convicted felons from possessing firearms in or affecting commerce, and held that proof that the possessed firearm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>previously had traveled in interstate commerce was sufficient to satisfy the required \u201cminimal nexus\u201d between the convicted felon\u2019s possession and commerce. <em>Id. </em>at 564, 577-78, 97 S.Ct. at 1964, 1970. In <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), the Supreme Court considered whether a federal statute banning the possession of firearms in school zones exceeded Congress\u2019s authority to regulate interstate commerce. <em>Id. </em>at 551, 115 S.Ct. at 1626. Noting that Congress\u2019s commerce power included the power to regulate activities that had a substantial effect on interstate commerce, and that the statute at issue contained no jurisdictional element to \u201censure, through ease-by-case inquiry, that the firearm possession in question affects interstate commerce,\u201d the Supreme Court held that the statute exceeded Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause authority. <em>Id. </em>at 558-59, 561, 567-68, 115 S.Ct. at 1629-31, 1634. The Supreme Court contrasted the statute at issue in <em>Lopez </em>with the former 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202(a), noting that, unlike the statute at issue in <em>Lopez, </em>\u00a7 1202(a) had an express jurisdictional element limiting its reach to firearm possessions that had an explicit nexus with interstate commerce. <em>Id. </em>at 561-62, 115 S.Ct. at 1631. Finally, in <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000), the Supreme Court held that Congress lacked the authority to regulate \u201cnoneconomic, violent criminal conduct based solely on that conduct\u2019s aggregate effect on interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 617, 120 S.Ct. at 1754. The Court noted that the statute at issue, like the statute at issue in <em>Lopez, </em>contained \u201cno jurisdictional element establishing that the federal cause of action is in pursuance of Congress\u2019 power to regulate interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 613, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 129 S.Ct. at 1751.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">We previously have rejected an appellant\u2019s claim that, in light of <em>Lopez, </em>\u00a7 922(g)(1) was unconstitutional because it exceeded Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power. <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387, 388 (11th Cir.1996). We held that the \u201cjurisdictional element\u201d in \u00a7 922(g), requiring that the felon\u2019s possession of any firearm or ammunition be \u201cin or affecting commerce,\u201d distinguished \u00a7 922(g) from the statute at issue in <em>Lopez </em>and defeated the appellant\u2019s facial challenge to its constitutionality. <em>Id. </em>at 389-90. We also rejected the appellant\u2019s argument that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to him because <em>Lopez </em>had abrogated the \u201cminimal nexus\u201d requirement that the Supreme Court had established in <em>Scarborough. Id. </em>at 390. Noting that \u201c[njothing in <em>Lopez </em>suggests that the \u2018minimal nexus\u2019 test should be changed,\u201d we held that the statute applied to the appellant because the government had demonstrated that the firearm he had possessed previously had traveled in interstate commerce. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">Subsequently, we rejected another appellant\u2019s argument that our reasoning in <em>McAllister </em>had been abrogated by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Morrison. See United States v. Scott, </em>263 F.3d 1270 (11th Cir.2001). We held that, even after <em>Morrison, </em>the jurisdictional element of \u00a7 922(g)(1) continued to immunize the statute from facial constitutional attack. <em>Scott, </em>263 F.3d at 1273. Finally, we have rejected the argument that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is constitutionally invalid because the term \u201ccommerce\u201d is not defined as \u201cinterstate or foreign commerce.\u201d <em>United States v. Nichols, </em>124 F.3d 1265, 1266 (11th Cir.1997). We held that \u201cthe phrase \u2018in or affecting commerce\u2019 indicates a Congressional intent to assert its full Commerce Clause power.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">We conclude that Morris\u2019s claim is not barred by his guilty plea because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>necessarily implicates the district court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction. If, as Morris claims, \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional, either facially or as applied in his case, then the district court would lack jurisdiction to convict and sentence him for violating that statute. However, because Morris\u2019s challenges to the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)(1) are foreclosed by our precedent, he has not shown any error, much less plain error, with respect to his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Morris\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
