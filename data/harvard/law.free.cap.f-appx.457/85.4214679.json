For the reasons set forth below, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">In the late 1990s, state and federal authorities came to believe that Gatson was the leader of a group that committed a string of burglaries in New Jersey. They assembled a task force and began to gather evidence against him. To this end, they interviewed informants, tapped Gatson\u2019s phone, and subpoenaed a variety of records. This investigation led the authorities to obtain a warrant that permitted them to search Gatson\u2019s home, his aunt\u2019s home, and his grandmother\u2019s home, and to seize a 28-foot Bayliner boat, which authorities believed Gatson had purchased with the fruits of his crimes. In 2001, New Jersey police officers executed the warrant. In the process, they seized over $256,000 in cash, the Bayliner boat, and assorted jewelry.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-14\">Ultimately, state officials charged Gat-son with numerous offenses, and in November 2004, Gatson was convicted in New Jersey state court of two counts of receipt of stolen property. The Appellate Division affirmed Gatson\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-15\">In 2009, Gatson filed the action at issue here against numerous defendants (who will be treated collectively in this opinion). Gatson raised two claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. First, he alleged that the defendants conspired to invent a criminal case against hi m, violating his rights at every step; he has framed this as a malicious prosecution claim. Second, he claimed that the defendants deprived him of his property in violation of his due process rights. More specifically, he alleged that after his trial, the defendants should have returned the cash, jewelry, and boat that they had seized from hi m; instead, they disposed of this property without according him due process. Gatson also raised several state law claims. The District Court dismissed Gatson\u2019s complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, and Gatson then filed a timely notice of appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-16\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and exercise a plenary standard of review. <em>Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000). As an initial matter, we will dispose of two preliminary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>issues. While Gatson\u2019s appeal was dismissed for failure to prosecute because he neither paid the fees nor filed an application to appeal in forma pauperis (IFP), he soon thereafter filed an IFP application and a motion to reopen. We are satisfied that Gatson has established good cause to reopen his ease, <em>see </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 107.2(a), and that he is entitled to proceed IFP, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. Accordingly, we will grant his motion to reopen and his IFP application.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">Nevertheless, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. Gatson\u2019s first claim is that he was the victim of malicious prosecution. To establish malicious prosecution, however, Gatson must show that \u201cthe prior criminal proceedings ... have terminated in [his] favor.\u201d <em>Hector v. Watt, </em>235 F.3d 154, 156 (3d Cir.2000). In his complaint, Gatson acknowledges that he was, in fact, convicted, and that his conviction remains valid. Accordingly, this claim fails as a matter of law. <em>See Kossler v. Crisanti, </em>564 F.3d 181, 190 n. 6 (3d Cir.2009) (en banc).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">We will likewise affirm the District Court\u2019s disposition of Gatson\u2019s due process claim. This claim arises under \u00a7 1983 and, as a consequence, is subject to a two-year statute of limitations. <em>See O\u2019Connor v. City of Newark, </em>440 F.3d 125, 126-27 (3d Cir.2006). In his complaint, Gatson alleges that the defendants improperly withheld and disposed of his property after his November 2004 conviction. This claim thus accrued soon after his conviction, <em>see Wallace v. Kato, </em>549 U.S. 384, 388, 127 S.Ct. 1091, 166 L.Ed.2d 973 (2007); however, he did not file his complaint until April 3, 2009 \u2014 well outside the limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Moreover, we perceive no basis to toll the statute of limitations. State law typically governs the issue of whether a limitations period should be tolled. <em>See Dique v. N.J. State Police, </em>603 F.3d 181, 185 (3d Cir.2010). In New Jersey, a statute of limitations may be tolled \u201cuntil the injured party discovers, or by exercise of reasonable diligence and intelligence should have discovered, that he may have a basis for an actionable claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Here, Gat-son\u2019s own allegations reveal that he was aware of this claim soon after he was convicted in November 2004, but nevertheless failed to file his federal complaint until April 2009. Accordingly, we agree with the District Court that Gatson\u2019s due process claim is time-barred.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See generally Fogle v. Pierson, </em>435 F.3d 1252, 1258-59 (10th Cir.2006) (explaining that dismissal is appropriate under \u00a7 1915 when it is \u201cpat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>ently clear\u201d that tolling argument lacks merit).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Finally, we conclude that the District Court acted within its discretion in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Gatson\u2019s state law claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3); <em>Figueroa v. Buccaneer Hotel Inc., </em>188 F.3d 172, 181 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Accordingly, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order dismissing Gat-son\u2019s complaint. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-12\">. While Gatson filed his notice of appeal more than 30 days after the District Court entered its order dismissing his complaint, he timely requested and received an extension from the District Court under Rule 4(a)(5) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. Gatson\u2019s appeal is therefore timely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b110-6\">. In the course of setting forth his malicious-prosecution claim, Gatson alleges that each part of the criminal investigation \u2014 including the searches \u2014 violated his constitutional rights, and that as a consequence, the government unlawfully obtained all the evidence that it used against him at trial. It is not clear whether Gatson intended to raise stand-alone Fourth Amendment claims; to the extent that he did, we conclude that the claims were properly dismissed. Under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), a prisoner may not use \u00a7 1983 to obtain damages if success on the merits necessarily would imply the invalidity of a conviction. Here, Gatson affirmatively contends that the allegedly illegal searches resulted in an unlawful conviction, and accordingly, he cannot bring these claims until and unless he successfully attacks his conviction. <em>See Gibson v. Superintendent of N.J. Dep\u2019t of Law &amp; Pub. Safety-Div. of State Police, </em>411 F.3d 427, 445 (3d Cir.2005); <em>see also Evans v. Poskon, </em>603 F.3d 362, 364 (7th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b110-10\">. Because this claim \u2014 that the defendants disposed of his property without according him due process \u2014 does not implicate the validity of Gatson\u2019s conviction, the deferred-accrual rule of <em>Heck </em>does not apply. <em>See Harvey v. Waldron, </em>210 F.3d 1008, 1016 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
