R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6)\u201d motion. We will affirm and, to the extent one is needed, we deny the issuance of a certificate of appealability under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">In 1996, Bush was convicted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania of three charges related to a bank-robbery conspiracy. He was sentenced to 210 months in prison, five years of supervised release, restitution, and a special assessment. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal. <em>See United States v. Bush, </em>151 F.3d 1027 (3d Cir.1998) (table). Bush then filed an unsuccessful motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which was denied in 2001. <em>See United States v. Bush, </em>No. 01-4211 (order denying certificate of appealability entered Nov. 22, 2002). Bush has attempted, since that time, to mount additional collateral attacks on his conviction and sentence, such as one commenced under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See Bush v. United States, </em>No. 09-02152, 2010 WL 1500931, at *3 (M.D.Pa. Apr. 14, 2010) (dismissing petition for lack of jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-13\">In his <em>Hazelr-Atlas </em>motion, his newest challenge to his conviction, Bush asserted that a witness in his criminal case, Lisa Wynn, who \u201ctestified to allegations that she rented cars held guns and ammunition among other things for the alleged conspirators in this case,\u201d was \u201cemployed [during trial] as a waitress in the same hotel in which the jury members were sequestered.\u201d <em>Hazel-Atlas </em>Mot. 3, ECF No. 412 (typographical errors corrected). According to Bush, this resulted in \u201cthe use of a prosecution witness to create deliberate fabrication of evidence, through the jury, calculated to interfere with the judicial system\u2019s ability impartially to adjudicate a matter by improperly influencing the trier or unfairly hampering the presentation of the opposing party\u2019s claim or defense.\u201d <em>Hazel-Atlas </em>Mot. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-14\">The District Court determined that Bush\u2019s motion was, in reality, a second or successive motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which had not been authorized by this Court as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b), 2255(h).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It therefore denied the motion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number><em>See </em>Order, ECF No. 422. Bush timely appealed, moving in this Court for issuance of a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. \u201cIn general, \u00a7 2255 provides the exclusive procedural mechanism by which a federal prisoner may test the legality of detention.\u201d <em>Lorentsen v. Hood, </em>223 F.3d 950, 953 (9th Cir.2000); <em>see also Application of Galante, </em>437 F.2d 1164, 1165 (3d Cir.1971) (discussing narrow scenario in which 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d). We agree with the District Court that Bush\u2019s motion is a clear attack on his original conviction, as he alleges that his trial was polluted by fraud and conspiracy. He must therefore proceed under \u00a7 2255, which \u2014 at this stage \u2014 would require that permission to do so be granted by this Court. Ergo, Bush\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability (to the extent that one would be needed) is denied, as the District Court\u2019s resolution below would not be \u201cdebatable amongst jurists of reason.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>see also Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">In the alternative, and assuming the application of <em>Hazel-Atlas </em>in this context, Bush has not met demonstrated, by \u201cclear, unequivocal^] and convincing evidence,\u201d that there was \u201c(1) an intentional fraud; (2) by an officer of the court; (3) which [wa]s directed at the court itself; and (4) in fact deceive[d] the court.\u201d <em>Herring v. United States, </em>424 F.3d 384, 386-87 (3d Cir.2005) (quoting <em>In re Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings in Antibiotic Antitrust Actions, 538 </em>F.2d 180, 195 (8th Cir.1976)). As the Government observed, Bush\u2019s allegations of fraud are conclusory at best. His own submissions reveal that, at the time of trial, the District Court and counsel were well aware of Wynn\u2019s employment situation, and took steps to avoid any improper contact between Wynn and the sequestered jury. Far from being redolent of \u201codious machinations\u201d on the part of court officers, the lengthy sidebar Bush quotes actually appears to demonstrate the contrary. His allegations of fraud, in short, are without any factual basis and, at this stage, are purely speculative. Therefore, even if <em>Hazel-Atlas </em>and Rule 60 were devices by which Bush could test the validity of his conviction and his sentence, he would not be entitled to relief under the demanding standard applicable to accusations of fraud on the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">In sum, to the extent that a certificate of appealability is required in this matter, it is denied. To the extent that a certificate of appealability is not needed, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. Mur<em>ray v. Bledsoe, </em>650 F.3d 246, 248 (3d Cir.2011) (per curiam); <em>see also </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b117-11\">. <em>Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v.
