Dwyer argues that he should have been permitted to testify about allegedly coercive statements made by a drug supplier and a confidential informant and that he was entitled to a related jury instruction about duress. Taylor complains about being denied the opportunity to allocute before pronouncement of his sentence, despite receiving a sentence at the low end of the advisory guideline range. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>The district court correctly denied Dwyer\u2019s requests to admit hearsay statements made by the supplier and informant and to give a jury instruction on duress. \u201cUnder the law of this circuit, to establish a defense of duress[,] a defendant must show that he acted under an immediate threat of death or serious bodily injury, that he had a well-grounded fear that the threat would be carried out, and that he had no reasonable opportunity to escape or inform [the] police.\u201d <em>United States v. Alzate, </em>47 F.3d 1103, 1104 (11th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). Dwyer contended that the informant and supplier coerced him to join the conspiracy to import, but Dwyer failed to \u201cproffer evidence sufficient to prove the essential elements of the defense\u201d of duress, <em>United States v. Montgomery, </em>772 F.2d 733, 736 (11th Cir.1985). Dwyer proffered that, in November 2008, the supplier admonished Dwyer after customs officials interrupted a drug smuggling operation that Dwyer had coordinated to aid the cash-strapped informant, and in March 2010, the supplier warned Dwyer that if he failed to \u201csettle up [his] bill\u201d by importing cocaine, Dwyer \u201c[knew] what [the supplier was] going to do.\u201d According to Dwyer\u2019s proffer, he faced no immediate harm and he had numerous opportunities to contact law enforcement before his arrest in April 2010. <em>See United States v. Sixty Acres in Etowah Cnty., </em>930 F.2d 857, 860-61 (11th Cir.1991). Dwyer was not entitled to testify about hearsay statements of the supplier or the informant or to have the jury instructed about the defense of duress.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">The district court erred when it failed to permit Taylor to allocute, but the error did not substantially prejudice Taylor\u2019s rights. When it asked whether \u201c[counsel] or [his] [client] [had] anything [they] wished to add\u201d or whether there was \u201c[a]nything else anyone wants to say,\u201d the district court failed to \u201cclearly inform [Taylor] of his allocution rights\u201d or eliminate \u201c \u2018doubt that [he] [had] been issued a personal invitation to speak prior to sentencing,\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Gerrow, </em>232 F.3d 831, 833 (11th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Green v. United States, </em>365 U.S. 301, 305, 81 S.Ct. 653, 655, 5 L.Ed.2d 670 (1961)). Taylor failed to object and cannot establish that the error, although plain, prejudiced his substantial rights. <em>See id. </em>at 834. Taylor requested and received a sentence at the low end of the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">We AFFIRM Dwyer\u2019s convictions and Taylor\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
