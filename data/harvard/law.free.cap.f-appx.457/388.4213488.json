The parties consented to proceed before the magistrate judge (MJ), and a judgment was rendered in favor of the defendants following a bench trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-23\">Stokes argues that the MJ erred in denying his motion for appointment of counsel. A district court is not required to appoint counsel for an indigent plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>asserting a claim under \u00a7 1983 absent exceptional circumstances. <em>Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982). This court will not overturn a district court\u2019s decision regarding appointment of counsel unless the appellant shows a \u201cclear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Cupit v. Jones, </em>835 F.2d 82, 86 (5th Cir.1987). Stokes has competently filed numerous motions; he demonstrated an ability to investigate his case by filing discovery requests; he was able to present his version of the case through testimonial evidence; and the legal contours of his claim are not particularly complex. We discern no clear abuse of discretion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In his reply brief, Stokes also argues that Elisa Moore was an incompetent witness; that the defense witnesses falsified their testimony at trial; and that the MJ abused his discretion by denying his motion requesting a videotape. This court generally will not consider an issue raised for the first time in a reply brief. <em>See United States v. Prince, </em>868 F.2d 1379, 1386 (5th Cir.1989). Nonetheless, this court has discretion to consider an issue raised for the first time in a reply brief if it is in response to an issue raised in an appellee\u2019s brief. <em>See United States v. Ramirez, </em>557 F.3d 200, 203 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Because Stokes\u2019s arguments regarding Elisa Moore and the denial of his motion were raised for the first time in his reply brief, we will not consider these claims. <em>See Prince, </em>868 F.2d at 1386. To the extent that Stokes\u2019s argument regarding the defense witnesses\u2019 false testimony can be construed as a response to the Government\u2019s brief, we will consider the issue. This court will not \u201csecond guess the district court\u2019s decision to believe one witness\u2019 testimony over another\u2019s or to discount a witness\u2019 testimony.\u201d <em>Canal Barge Co. v. Torco Oil Co., </em>220 F.3d 370, 375 (5th Cir.2000). Although Stokes contends that the defense witnesses testified falsely, he has failed to demonstrate that their testimony was incredible as a matter of law. <em>See Migis v. Pearle Vision, Inc., </em>135 F.3d 1041, 1052 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED. Stokes\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED. <em>See Schwander v. Blackburn, </em>750 F.2d 494, 502-03 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b410-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
