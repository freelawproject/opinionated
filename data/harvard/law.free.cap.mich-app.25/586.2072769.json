MCLA \u00a7 750.116 (Stat Ann 1962 Rev \u00a7 28.311) and MCLA \u00a7 750.92 (Stat Ann 1962 Rev \u00a7 28.287).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Defendant and another were charged with possession of burglar\u2019s tools but offered to plead guilty to attempted possession of burglar\u2019s tools after several days of jury trial before the Honorable James Montante, Judge of Wayne County Circuit Court, on January 11, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Judge Montante explained the defendant\u2019s right to continue with the jury trial, the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses and to present his own witnesses, and the privilege not to take the stand. The court further explained that the offense was punishable by a five-year maximum prison term. Defendant acknowledged that no one had threatened him or promised him anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Defendant\u2019s plea was accepted and on February 6,1968, defendant was sentenced to 2-1/2 to 5 years in prison. Defendant appeals as of right arguing that the record failed to show the necessary elements of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">After careful review of the record, it is clear to this Court that there is more than a substantial factual basis in the record to justify the acceptance of the proffered plea. <em>People </em>v. <em>Bartlett </em>(1969), 17 Mich App 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">Defendant also contends that the lesser included offense of attempted possession is not possible. We do not agree with this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">The Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Webb </em>(1901), 127 Mich 29, stated every charge of crime necessarily includes an attempt. Defendant argues, however, that that pertains to the crimes consisting of differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>ent degrees; and argues further that this crime he is charged with did not consist of degrees. We do not agree; we feel that the trial court, in its discretion, may accept a plea of guilty of attempted possession of burglar\u2019s tools not only to help facilitate the plea-bargaining process but also to provide lesser maximum sentences in areas where the court deems it advisable. The court, in this matter, felt that the five-year maximum sentence was a sufficient maximum to satisfy and meet the ends of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Motion to affirm granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
