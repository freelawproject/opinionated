Foley sitting without a jury. Defendant was convicted of robbery unarmed,<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> and subsequently sentenced to a term of 10 to 15 years imprisonment. A timely claim of appeal filed on behalf of defendant by his court appointed appellate counsel raises a single question for review. It is contended that defendant\u2019s constitutional right to counsel was violated when identification testimony grounded on a previous lineup was introduced without showing that defendant had been advised of his right to counsel at that lineup. The people have filed a motion to affirm the conviction pursuant to GrCB- 1963, 817.5(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The record fails to disclose any objection to the identification procedure relative to defendant\u2019s right to counsel. Where the objection to defendant\u2019s not having counsel present at the lineup is made for the first time on appeal, it is made too late. <em>People </em>v. <em>Montgomery </em>(1970), 22 Mich App 87; <em>People </em>v. <em>McClendon </em>(1970), 21 Mich App 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The motion to affirm is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b232-8\"> MCL/A \u00a7 750.530 (Stat Ann 1954 Bev \u00a7 28.798).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
