The district court accepted his plea and sentenced him to 41 months in prison, which was at the low end of the sentencing guideline range, followed by two years of supervised release.</p> <p id=\"b905-22\" pgmap=\"905\">Despite the appeal waiver, Mr. Valdez-Borja has appealed the district court\u2019s judgment. The government has moved to enforce the waiver under United States v. Hahn, 359 F.3d 1315 (10th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (per curiam). Discerning no meritorious issues for appeal, Mr. Valdez-Borja\u2019s attorney filed an Anders brief and a motion for leave to withdraw. See Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967) (defense counsel may \u201crequest permission to withdraw\u201d when counsel conscientiously examines a case and determines that an appeal would be \u201cwholly frivolous\u201d). As required by An-ders, defense counsel provided Mr. Valdez-Borja with a copy of the brief. In addition, the Clerk of Court gave him notice of his counsel\u2019s position and directed him to file a response showing why this court should not enforce the waiver. The deadline for doing so has passed, with no response.</p> <p id=\"b905-23\" pgmap=\"905(31) 906(61)\">After independently and thoroughly examining the record per Anders, see id., we agree with the government and defense counsel that Mr. Valdez-Borja\u2019s appeal waiver was valid. Hahn instructs us to enforce appeal waivers as long as three conditions are met: (l) the matter on appeal falls within the scope of the waiver; (2) the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his appellate rights; and (3) enforcing the waiver will not result in a miscarriage of justice. Hahn, 359 F.3d at 1325. All three factors support enforcing the waiver here.</p> <p id=\"b906-6\" pgmap=\"906\">First, the matter on appeal falls within the scope of the waiver, which provides:</p> <blockquote id=\"b906-7\" pgmap=\"906\">WAIVER OF APPEAL RIGHTS</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b906-8\" pgmap=\"906\">The defendant is aware that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 afford a defendant the right to appeal a conviction and the sentence imposed. Acknowledging that, the defendant knowingly waives the right to appeal the defendant\u2019s conviction(s) and any sentence, including any f\u00edne, at or under the maximum statutory penalty authorized by law.... In addition, the defendant agrees to waive any collateral attack to the 'defendant\u2019s conviction(s) and any sentence, including any fine, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241, 2255 ... except on the issue of defense counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance.</blockquote> <p id=\"b906-9\" pgmap=\"906\">Mot. to Enforce (Sept. 19, 2017), Ex. 1 at 6. Second, the motion to enforce pinpoints numerous excerpts from the plea agreement and the plea hearing that establish Mr. Valdez-Borja knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal. Finally, we see nothing to suggest that enforcement of the appeal waiver would cause a miscarriage of justice.</p> <p id=\"b906-10\" pgmap=\"906\">Exercising our jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we grant defense counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and dismiss the appeal.</p> <footnote label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b905-18\" pgmap=\"905\">This panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. See Fed. R. App.. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
