Holmes, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b899-16\">Pro se<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> state prisoner Albert McElha-ney appeals from the dismissal of his application for Writ of Habeas Corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court dismissed Mr. McElhaney\u2019s petition as time-barred under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). In the same order, the court denied his request for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). Mr. McElhaney now appeals from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-17\">Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we deny his request for a COA and dismiss the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b899-19\">In July 2010, Mr. McElhaney pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, driving with a suspended license, carrying an open liquor container, and failing to display a current vehicle tag on his car. He was sentenced to fifty years in prison. On September 7, 2010, Mr. McElhaney filed a motion to withdraw his plea. The state trial court held a hearing and denied that motion on September 30, 2010. Mr. McEl-haney did not appeal that denial, but later filed two state post-conviction motions. Both motions were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-20\">In March 2016, Mr. McElhaney filed a \u00a7 2254 petition in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma. Six weeks later, the district court ordered the State to show cause as to why Mr. McElhaney\u2019s petition should be denied. The State then filed a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>dismiss, arguing that Mr. McElhaney\u2019s petition was time barred under \u00a7 2244(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">In response, Mr. McElhaney argued that \u00a7 2244(d)\u2019s limitations period was tolled until he filed his petition in March 2016. He first contended that he was entitled to equitable tolling because prison officials kept him from using the law library or filing timely motions, and because his disabilities kept him from exhausting state remedies. He also maintained that the statutory limitations period should have been tolled because he is actually innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">The district court rejected both arguments. In a March 31, 2017 order, the court noted that Mr. McElhaney \u201cha[d] not presented any facts or evidence to support\u201d his claim for equitable tolling. R. at 123.' It also pointed out that, \u201capart from his unsupported allegations, there [was] no evidence in the record to suggest [that Mr. McElhaney was] actually innocent of the charges,\u201d nor had he made any showing that \u201cother uncontrollable circumstances impeded him from timely filing his federal claim.\u201d R. at 125. The court granted the State\u2019s motion to dismiss and denied a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">As a state prisoner proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, Mr. McElhaney must receive a COA in order to be heard on the merits of his appeal. <em>See, e.g., Montez v. McKinna, </em>208 F.3d 862, 866-67 (10th Cir. 2000); <em>see also Gonzalez v. Thaler, </em>565 U.S. 134, 142, 132 S.Ct. 641, 181 L.Ed.2d 619 (2012) (noting the \u201c \u2018clear\u2019 jurisdictional language ... in \u00a7 2253(c)(1)\u201d). \u201cWe may grant a COA only if the petitioner makes a \u2018substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u2019\u201d <em>Milton v. Miller, </em>812 F.3d 1252, 1263 (10th Cir. 2016) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2)). This requires a \u201cshowing that reasonable jurists could debate whether ... the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were \u2018adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u2019 \u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quoting <em>Barefoot v. Estelle, </em>463 U.S. 880, 893 n.4, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">The issue becomes \u201csomewhat more complicated\u201d when a district court denies a petition on procedural grounds. <em>Id. </em>In that situation, the petitioner must also make a second showing: that \u201cjurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Coppage v. McKune, </em>534 F.3d 1279, 1281 (10th Cir. 2008) (\u201cIf the application was denied on procedural grounds, the applicant faces a double hurdle.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">Although \u00a7 2244(d)\u2019s limitations period is subject to equitable tolling, <em>see Holland v. Florida, </em>560 U.S. 631, 645-49, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010), the doctrine applies only in \u201crare and exceptional circumstances,\u201d <em>Gibson v. Klinger, </em>232 F.3d 799, 808 (10th Cir. 2000) (quoting <em>Davis v. Johnson, </em>158 F.3d 806, 811 (5th Cir. 1998)). To qualify for equitable tolling, a petitioner must \u201cshow[] \u2018(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way.\u2019\u201d <em>Holland, </em>560 U.S. at 649, 130 S.Ct. 2549 (quoting <em>Pace v. DiGuglielmo, </em>544 U.S. 408, 418, 125 S.Ct. 1807, 161 L.Ed.2d 669 (2005)); <em>see also Marsh v. Soares, </em>223 F.3d 1217, 1220 (10th Cir. 2000). A petitioner must show \u201cspecific facts to support [a] claim of extraordinary circumstances and due diligence.\u201d <em>Yang v. Archuleta, </em>525 F.3d 925, 928 (10th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">Furthermore, actual innocence operates as \"an equitable <em>exception </em>to \u00a7 2244(d)(1).\u201d <em>McQuiggin v. Perkins, </em>569 U.S. 383, 133 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>S.Ct. 1924, 1931, 185 L.Ed.2d 1019 (2013); <em>see Doe v. Jones, </em>762 F.3d 1174, 1182 (10th Cir. 2014) (\u201c[U]nder <em>McQuiggin </em>the existence of such <em>a </em>claim will serve as an exception to the [\u00a7 2244(d) ] statute of limitations and he therefore does not have a legitimate concern that the claim will be time barred in federal court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">\u2018\u201c[Ajctual innocence\u2019 means factual innocence, not mere legal insufficiency.\u201d <em>Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 623, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998). \u201c[Pjrisoners asserting innocence ... must establish that, in light of new evidence, \u2018it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>House v. Bell, </em>547 U.S. 518, 536-37, 126 S.Ct. 2064, 165 L.Ed.2d 1 (2006) (quoting <em>Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 327, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995)). The actual-innocence \u201cstandard is demanding and permits review only in the \u2018extraordinary\u2019 case.\u201d <em>House, </em>547 U.S. at 538, 126 S.Ct. 2064 (quoting <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 327, 115 S.Ct. 851).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Moreover, insofar as a petitioner\u2019s attack relates to his sentence, it bears noting that, under our precedent, a petitioner cannot be actually innocent of a noncapital sentence. <em>See Laurson v. Leyba, </em>507 F.3d 1230, 1233 (10th Cir. 2007) (\u201c[A] person cannot be actually innocent of a noncapital sentence.\u201d (quoting <em>Reid v. Oklahoma, </em>101 F.3d 628, 630 (10th Cir. 1996))); <em>see also Black v. Workman, </em>682 F.3d 880, 915 (10th Cir. 2012) (\u201cThis [actual-innocence] exception applies to those who are actually innocent of the crime of conviction and those \u2018actually innocent\u2019 of the death penalty (that is, not eligible for the death penalty under applicable law).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">Having reviewed Mr. McElhaney\u2019s appellate filings, the district court\u2019s order, and the entire record before us, we conclude that Mr. McElhaney is not entitled to a COA. We are convinced that reasonable jurists would not debate the correctness of the district court\u2019s procedural ruling\u2014that is, its determination that Mr. McElhaney\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition is time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we deny Mr. McElhaney\u2019s request for a COA and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b899-13\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32.1 and Tenth Circuit Rule 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b899-21\">. We construe the filings of a pro se litigant liberally, <em>see Erickson v. Pardus, </em>551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007) (per curiam), but our role is not to serve as his advocate, <em>see Gallagher v. Shelton, </em>587 F.3d 1063, 1067 (10th Cir. 2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
