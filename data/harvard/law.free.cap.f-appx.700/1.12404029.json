The Court has afforded the issues full consideration and has determined that they do not warrant a published opinion. See D.C. Cir. R. 36(d). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b27-24\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the petition for review be DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-25\">In Order No. 1000, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission overhauled its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>rules governing the planning and development of electric transmission. <em>South Carolina Public Service Authority v. FERC, </em>762 F.3d 41, 48 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (per curiam) (denying petitions to review Order No. 1000). Pursuant to that order, Southwest Power Pool (\u201cSPP\u201d), the regional transmission organization for large parts of the central United States, revised its open-access tariff and membership agreement. The updated tariff provides for a two-stage process for new transmission projects that seek to receive cost allocation\u2014that is, the right to allocate costs for the new transmission facility across the region. Specifically, SPP proposed to first identify the most efficient and cost effective projects for construction, and then to pick a developer for each project through competitive bidding. The Commission ultimately approved SPP\u2019s tariff in a series of four orders, three of which are at issue here. <em>See Southwest Power Pool, Inc., </em>144 FERC \u00b6 61,059 (July 18, 2013); <em>Southwest Power Pool, Inc., </em>149 FERC \u00b6 61,048 (Oct. 16, 2014); <em>Southwest Power Pool, Inc., </em>151 FERC \u00b6 61,045 (Apr. 16, 2015); <em>see also Southwest Power Pool, Inc., </em>152 FERC \u00b6 61,106 (Aug. 3, 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">LSP Transmission Holdings and LS Power Transmission (collectively, \u201cLSP\u201d) \u201cdevelop and own transmission projects in various areas of the United States and seek to develop and own projects in SPP.\u201d Petitioners\u2019 Br. 8. They petition for review of the Commission\u2019s orders approving SPP\u2019s tariff, alleging that two aspects of the tariff violate Order No. 1000 and the Commission\u2019s statutory duties: (1) some of the criteria by which SPP evaluates developer bids are duplicative or too attenuated from rates, and (2) SPP improperly \u201cexclude[s] projects from competition based on state and local laws\u201d such as rights of first refusal and rights of way granted to incumbent utilities, <em>id. </em>at 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">LSP has suffered no injury-in-fact, however, and thus lacks standing to bring these challenges. <em>See Turlock Irrigation District v. FERC, </em>786 F.3d 18, 23 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (\u201cTo establish constitutional standing, a petitioner must show an ... injury in fact .... \u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). As to LSP\u2019s challenge to the tariffs evaluative criteria, the companies concede that they have no active bids to develop an SPP project, nor has a bid been rejected by SPP. Oral Arg. Rec. 2:28-4:07, 5:44-6:26. Accordingly, \u201c[t]he challenged [Commission] orders do not place any legal burden oh [petitioner] or determine any legal rights. The orders merely change the criteria by which future transmission projects will be evaluated when [the regional transmission organization] decides whether those projects will be eligible to receive cost allocation .... [T]he alleged injury is only conjectural.\u201d <em>New York Regional Interconnect, Inc. v. FERC, </em>634 F.3d 581, 587-88 (D.C. Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">As to LSP\u2019s challenge to the state-law exclusions, LSP could be injured without bidding for a project if SPP deprived it of the opportunity to bid by enforcing a state right. But LSP has identified no specific project that SPP has approved for regional cost allocation in a state whose law gives an incumbent a right of first refusal <em>and </em>that SPP has awarded to the incumbent because the incumbent has exercised that right. For this claim too, \u201cnothing distinguishes\u201d LSP \u201cfrom any other party who might someday wish to build\u201d a project in SPP\u2019s territory. <em>Id. </em>at 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">In its briefs and at oral argument, LSP expressed concern that it would be unable to challenge SPP\u2019s tariff if and when it suffers a concrete injury because we would regard the petition for review as an \u201cinappropriate collateral attack on an approved order,\u201d namely,.the orders under review here. Petitioners\u2019 Reply Br. 7; <em>cf. Sacra</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number><em>mento Municipal Utility District v. FERC, </em>428 F.3d 294, 299 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (dismissing a petition in part as a collateral attack on a FERC order). At oral argument, however, Commission fcounsel agreed that LSP could bring such a challenge and that the Commission would not raise a collateral-attack defense. Oral Arg. Rec. 20:57-21:36. In view of that concession, the Commission would be estopped from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Pursuant to Rule 36 of this court, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after the disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. See Fed. R. App. P. 41(b); D.C. CIR. R. 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
