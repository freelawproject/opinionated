Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The central issue on appeal is whether the Office of Professional Medical Conduct (OPMC) was required to issue a subpoena in order to undertake a comprehensive medical review (CMR) of a doctor\u2019s records. We conclude that a subpoena was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">OPMC, a branch of the Department of Health responsible for investigating and monitoring misconduct, began an investigation of petitioner, Dr. Jeffrey Michaelis, pursuant to Public Health Law \u00a7 230 on October 19, 2001, after receiving a complaint regarding petitioner\u2019s care of a patient. On October 31, OPMC notified petitioner that it was investigating his medical practice, and \u201c[t]he issue under investigation is the care and treatment rendered to [the patient].\u201d During the investigation, OPMC conducted an interview of petitioner on November 28, 2001 pursuant to Public Health Law \u00a7 230 (10) (a) (iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">On August 9, 2002, OPMC informed petitioner, in a letter, that evidence existed of a pattern of inappropriate medical practice and that a CMR of petitioner\u2019s patient records would be conducted. The letter notified petitioner that an OPMC staff person would come to his office on a scheduled date to select for copying a number of patient records and such other office records as related to the issues being reviewed. The letter also warned,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-10\">\u201cAny failure by you to comply with the order would constitute professional misconduct as defined in N.Y. Education Law \u00a7 6530 (15) and will result in a recommendation of prosecution for such misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-11\">In addition, you may be subject to an enforcement proceeding, in New York State Supreme Court, pursuant to Public Health Law 230 (10) (o) (ii).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">Petitioner challenged the CMR order in a CPLR article 78 proceeding. Supreme Court denied petitioner\u2019s claims and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>divided Appellate Division affirmed. The two dissenting Justices maintained that, although OPMC had the authority to issue a CMR order, section 230 (10) (a) (iv) did not expressly indicate the process by which records should be made available. They reasoned that section 230 (10) (k), however, did provide for the issuance of subpoenas by the Executive Secretary of the State Board for Professional Medical Conduct upon approval of the committee and this section should govern OPMC\u2019s ability to conduct a CMR. Petitioner appeals as of right pursuant to CPLR 5601 (a). We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">We first address petitioner\u2019s argument that the OPMC Director lacked authority to compel a CMR. Section 230 of the Public Health Law governs proceedings involving professional medical misconduct. According to Public Health Law \u00a7 230 (10) (a) (iv) (A), when the Director of the OPMC determines, after consultation with an investigation committee, that \u201cevidence exists of a single incident of negligence or incompetence, a pattern of inappropriate prescribing or medical practice . . . the director, in addition to the authority set forth in this section, shall be authorized to conduct a [CMR] of patient records . . . and such office records of the licensee . . . related to said determination.\u201d This subparagraph gives OPMC specific statutory authority to conduct a review of petitioner\u2019s records. The power, moreover, is <em>in addition to </em>the authority set forth in the section, including the power of the Executive Secretary to issue subpoenas (Public Health Law \u00a7 230 [10] [k]).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The subpoena power authorized in Public Health Law \u00a7 230 (10) (k) is thus separate and distinct from the Director\u2019s authority to issue a CMR order under section 230 (10) (a) (iv) (A). It involves the Executive Secretary, not the Director, and does not necessarily relate to a preliminary investigation of a licensee, as a CMR does.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Petitioner\u2019s reliance on <em>Matter of Shankman v Axelrod </em>(73 NY2d 203 [1989]) is misplaced. <em>Shankman </em>involved OPMC\u2019s issuance of an ex parte \u201cinspection\u201d warrant after it had obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>authorization to serve a s\u00fabpoena duces tecum pursuant to Public Health Law \u00a7 230 (10) (k) but failed to do so. The inspection warrant gave OPMC the right to inspect premises, question patients and remove records. This Court reasoned that, since OPMC had been expressly given the power to issue subpoenas and had not been given such ex parte \u201cinspection\u201d warrant right either by statute or inference, OPMC had no such power. In the present case, however, OPMC has specific statutory authority to issue a CMR order through Public Health Law \u00a7 230 (10) (a) (iv). There is no subpoena requirement that should be inferred in this statute. Reading Public Health Law \u00a7 230 (10) (a) (iv) in such a manner would inhibit OPMC\u2019s ability to investigate through a CMR, authority the Legislature intended OPMC to have.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Further, the statute provided petitioner with the opportunity for judicial review of OPMC\u2019s CMR order. Public Health Law \u00a7 230 (10) (o) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">\u201cWhere the director has issued an order for a comprehensive medical review of patient records and office records . . . and the licensee has refused to comply with the director\u2019s order, the director may apply to a justice of the supreme court, in writing, on notice to the licensee, for a court order to compel compliance with the director\u2019s order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Supreme Court shall not compel compliance unless it finds \u201c(i) there was a reasonable basis for issuance of the director\u2019s order and (ii) there is reasonable cause to believe that the records sought are relevant to the director\u2019s order. The court may deny the application or grant the application in whole or in part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Am6\">Accordingly, when a physician refuses in good faith to comply with a CMR order (as petitioner did in this case), OPMC can seek an order compelling compliance pursuant to Public Health Law \u00a7 230 (10) (o). When a physician makes a good faith objection to the CMR, OPMC will not be able to charge a physician with misconduct arising from the failure to comply with the CMR order unless it has first established the propriety of the CMR in a section 230 (10) (o) proceeding (and then only if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>physician continues to refuse to comply). Since the physician has an opportunity to be heard at the section 230 (10) (o) proceeding, his or her due process rights are not violated. The good faith exception, coupled with the opportunity for judicial review accorded by Public Health Law \u00a7 230 (10) (o), are sufficient to protect the physician\u2019s rights, as the facts of this case indicate. Upon petitioner\u2019s refusal to comply with the CMR order, OPMC cross-moved to enforce the CMR order under section 230 (10) (o). Both courts below held that OPMC established the reasonableness and relevance of the CMR order, a conclusion with which we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Petitioner additionally claims that OPMC was required to divulge the nature of any new issues identified subsequent to the interview before issuing a CMR order. We disagree. Public Health Law \u00a7 230 (10) (a) (iii) states, \u201cThe licensee shall be given written notice of issues identified subsequent to the interview. The licensee may submit written comments or expert opinion to the office of professional medical conduct at any time.\u201d This language is designed to protect a licensee\u2019s right to respond to substantive allegations. It does not signify that OPMC had an obligation to divulge reasons in order to carry out a CMR. Petitioner was entitled to notice of any \u201cissues identified\u201d before charges relating to those issues were brought, but not before producing documents in connection with a CMR.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Petitioner claims that Supreme Court erroneously relied on an in camera affidavit, denying him an opportunity to respond fully to allegations charged within, and thereby denying him due process. This Court has stated, \u201cIf the issuing agency demonstrates the delicacy of a particular investigation or the risk of and consequences attendant on premature disclosure, it may be appropriate to take proof of the threshold foundation <em>in </em>camera\u201d <em>(Matter of Levin v Murawski, </em>59 NY2d 35, 42 n 4 [1983]). We agree with petitioner that the use of in camera submissions should be limited. Here, while much of the material contained in the in camera affidavit was properly withheld from petitioner, because it involved confidential aspects of the OPMC\u2019s investigation, some of the material\u2014notably OPMC\u2019s description of its communications with petitioner himself\u2014 should not have been submitted in camera. It is clear, however, that no information in the latter category was material to the decision here, so any error in allowing material to be submitted without notice was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Finally, we underscore that OPMC\u2019s letter of August 9, 2002 was inaccurate in stating that a physician\u2019s failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>comply would itself constitute professional misconduct and result in prosecution. Education Law \u00a7 6530 (15) defines as misconduct, \u201cFailure to comply with an order issued pursuant to subdivision seven, paragraph (a) of subdivision ten, and subdivision seventeen of section two hundred thirty of the public health law.\u201d This language makes an exception for a timely good faith failure to comply due to a dispute over the availability, scope or necessity of records requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Petitioner\u2019s remaining claims are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Graffeo, Read and R.S. Smith concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-8\">. Public Health Law \u00a7 230 (10) (k) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">\u201cThe executive secretary of the board with the specific approval of a committee on professional conduct of the board shall have the power to issue subpoenas requiring persons to appear before the board and be examined with reference to a matter within the scope of the inquiry or the investigation being conducted by the board and produce books, papers, records or documents pertaining thereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b402-8\">. <em>See </em>Governor\u2019s Program Bill Mem, at 3, Bill Jacket, L 1986, ch 266 (stating section 230 [10] [a] [iv] was enacted to \u201cbroaden the investigative authority of the [OPMC]\u201d); Letter from State Dept of Health, July 7, 1986, at 2, Bill Jacket, L 1986, ch 266 (stating that the. amendments would \u201cenhance the State\u2019s ability to identify incompetent physicians and monitor their compliance with conditions for continued practice\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
