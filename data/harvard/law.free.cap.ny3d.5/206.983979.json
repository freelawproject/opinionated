Feinberg, Surrogate of Kings County, asks this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Court to reject the determination of the Commission on Judicial Conduct that he be removed from office on grounds of systematic failure, over a period of more than five years, to apply statutory requirements regarding the award of legal fees to counsel for the Public Administrator, and conduct that conveyed an appearance of impropriety. We accept the Commission\u2019s determined sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Background Law</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Article VI, \u00a7 12 (d) of the New York State Constitution confers upon the elected surrogates of each county jurisdiction over all proceedings and actions \u201crelating to the affairs of decedents, probate of wills [and] administration of estates.\u201d Most relevant here, the Surrogate\u2019s Court Procedure Act (SCPA)\u2014in an article entitled \u201cPublic Administrators of the Counties Within the City of New York\u201d\u2014provides that each surrogate within the City\u2019s five counties can appoint a public administrator to administer the estates of citizens who die intestate without an heir willing and able to do so. The salary of the public administrator, paid by the City, is fixed at two thirds the amount paid to the New York City surrogates (SCPA 1105).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">The statute also allows a New York City surrogate to appoint one or more counsels to the public administrator (SCPA 1108 [2] [a]).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While the public administrator is a salaried employee paid by the City, counsel is entitled to \u201creasonable compensation\u201d paid out of the estate (SCPA 1108 [2] [b]). The Surrogate\u2019s Court Procedure Act offers no schedule or guideline as to what compensation is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Over the years, excessive, undocumented fee awards to counsels for New York City public administrators have been the subject of investigation by the New York State Attorney General and the State Comptroller. Their 1992 joint report suggested that, having unsuccessfully \u201cmade repeated attempts to obtain voluntary compliance with our recommendation that legal fees should be charged based on actual services provided for each estate,\u201d counsel be required to submit affidavits of legal services performed in each estate to support fee requests (New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>York State Attorney General and State Comptroller, Estate Assets Continue to be at Risk, at 32 [July 1992]; <em>see also </em>New York State Attorney General and State Comptroller, New York City Public Administrators: An Operational Review [Nov. 1987]). In addition, the Attorney General twice in the past attempted to rein in counsel fees approved by the Kings County Surrogate, reaching agreements in 1988 and 1994 with then-counsel to limit fee awards to six percent of an estate\u2019s value, with additional payment only in special cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Responding to the reports and recommendations, and concerned about \u201cthe imposition of questionable fees by the . . . [public administrators\u2019] outside counsel,\u201d in 1993 the Legislature amended Surrogate\u2019s Court Procedure Act \u00a7 1108 (2) to require in each case documentation establishing that fees are commensurate with the legal services provided (Assembly Mem in Support, Bill Jacket, L 1993, ch 655). This requirement was, in part, designed to ensure that the beneficiaries\u2014often helpless to challenge, or even to know about, excessive legal fees\u2014were being charged appropriately for work actually done on the estates <em>{id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The amendment\u2014section 1108 (2) (c) of the Surrogate\u2019s Court Procedure Act\u2014applies plainly and pointedly to counsel for the New York City public administrators. In its entirety, the paragraph reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-7\">\u201cAny legal fees allowed by the court pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subdivision shall be supported by an affidavit of legal services setting forth in detail the services rendered, the time spent, and the method or basis by which requested compensation was determined. In fixing the legal fees, the court shall consider the time and labor required, the difficulty of the questions involved, the skill required to handle the problems presented, the lawyer\u2019s experience, ability and reputation, the amount involved and benefit resulting to the estate from the services, the customary fee charged by the bar for similar services, the contingency or certainty of compensation, the results obtained, and the responsibility involved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">The statutory requirements of an affidavit and specification of factors the surrogate must consider when fixing the fee offer assurance that the amount paid out of an estate\u2014and therefore not available as a distribution to beneficiaries\u2014reflects the true and reasonable cost of the services rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>In addition, in 1993 the Legislature created an administrative board empowered to \u201cestablish guidelines and uniform fee schedules for the operation of the offices of public administrators\u201d (SCPA 1128 [2]). While the board has no oversight responsibility with regard to the appointment of counsel or payment of fees for legal services, in October 2002 it recommended a uniform fee schedule for the counsels to the New York City public administrators\u2014setting a sliding scale of maximum legal fees based on six percent of the estate\u2019s value for the first $750,000, with decreasing percentages charged for estates in inverse proportion to the estate\u2019s size beyond the initial $750,000 (Interim Report and Guidelines of the Administrative Board for the Offices of the Public Administrators [Oct. 2002]). The parties stipulated that, during the period at issue in this proceeding, the other five New York City surrogates calculated counsel fees\u2014capped at six percent\u2014based on a percentage of the total value of the estate. It was also stipulated that prior to approving a fee, in each case the other surrogates reviewed the required affidavits of legal services provided by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Petitioner as Kings County Surrogate</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Petitioner was elected Surrogate in 1996, not long after the 1992 joint report, the 1993 statutory amendment and the Attorney General\u2019s 1994 agreement with the Kings County Surrogate, all specifically aimed at ending abuses in documenting fees for counsel to the public administrator. Upon taking office in January 1997, petitioner formed a committee that conducted a public search for a new public administrator. Petitioner also replaced the firm that had for several decades served as counsel to the Public Administrator, but he did so without any search or interview process, appointing his long-time friend and law school classmate Louis Rosenthal to that lucrative position.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rosenthal had helped to raise funds for petitioner\u2019s election campaign. His experience in Surrogate\u2019s Court practice was limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">As the record reflects, in the years between January 1997 and mid-May 2002, when an estate came within his purview Rosenthal would generally conduct a review of its assets and liabilities, at which point he would file an initial accounting. Upon filing, the Surrogate\u2019s Court chief clerk would calculate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>eight percent of the anticipated final value of the estate, and petitioner would approve 60% of that sum. After the accounting, the estate would settle its debts, conduct kinship hearings (if necessary) and make initial distributions to heirs. Counsel would then submit a final decree, which included a line for an additional fee request. That additional fee request was also generally calculated by the Surrogate\u2019s Court chief clerk, though on many occasions by Rosenthal himself, frequently worked out on a post-it note attached to the final decree. The additional fee was calculated to bring the total awarded to a percentage\u2014 generally eight percent\u2014of the total value of the estate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">From January 1997 until mid-May 2002, petitioner never required Rosenthal to submit an affidavit of legal services before approving a fee request, nor did he determine fees based on consideration of the statutory factors specified in SCPA 1108 (2) (c). While petitioner claimed to have coincidentally considered factors similar to those codified in section 1108, he repeatedly acknowledged during these proceedings that prior to May 2002 he was unaware of the statutory requirements. He testified that he only \u201cskimmed through\u201d the Surrogate\u2019s Court Procedure Act, never reading the entire Act\u2014the statutory basis for his office and jurisdiction\u2014claiming that it was \u201cquite voluminous\u201d and characterizing his failure to pay greater attention to the statute as an \u201coversight.\u201d Instead of following the statutory prescription, petitioner relied on the calculations of Rosenthal and the chief clerk as they appeared on the post-it notes. Petitioner did not individually review the estate files himself. In no instance did he reject or reduce a fee request submitted by counsel, and there is no evidence that he ever questioned a request or sought additional information before ruling on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">As to the application of eight percent, petitioner maintained that he inherited from his predecessor, Surrogate Bernard Bloom, the practice of awarding fees representing a relatively high portion of the estate, because \u201cthat was the way it had been done in the Surrogate\u2019s Court for 30 plus years.\u201d However, he never discussed counsel fees with the surrogates of the other New York City counties, nor did he ask any other counsels how their fees were determined. Further, though the chief clerk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>knew of the 1988 and 1994 agreements with the Attorney General limiting fees, petitioner claimed he did not know the content of those agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Between January 1997 and December 2002, petitioner awarded Rosenthal a total of $8,613,009.35 in legal fees. Of that amount, about $1,935,000 was net income to Rosenthal as counsel to the Public Administrator, apart from other estate-related fees (which totaled $458,824.66 between 1997 and 2002) and his law firm earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">In the spring of 2002, petitioner learned that the New York Daily News was about to run an expos\u00e9 of the Kings County Surrogate, revealing petitioner\u2019s practice of approving counsel\u2019s fee requests without affidavits or individualized review of the cases. In anticipation of the story, petitioner asked Rosenthal to submit affidavits of legal services, retrospectively detailing the work done on each estate. After petitioner received these affidavits, however, not a single fee was adjusted.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">On March 18, 2003, the State Commission on Judicial Conduct filed a disciplinary complaint against petitioner alleging one charge of misconduct for continuing violations of three Rules of Judicial Conduct: 22 NYCRR 100.3 (B) (1) (a \u201cjudge shall be faithful to the law and maintain professional competence in it\u201d); 100.2 (B) (to avoid the appearance of impropriety, a \u201cjudge shall not allow family, social, political or other relationships to influence the judge\u2019s judicial conduct or judgment\u201d); and 100.3 (C) (3) (a \u201cjudge shall not approve compensation of appointees beyond the fair value of services rendered\u201d). The Commission appointed former Justice Felice K. Shea to hear evidence, report findings of fact and make conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">Following a seven-day hearing, the Referee first determined that petitioner violated 22 NYCRR 100.3 (B) (1) by awarding legal fees without affidavits of legal services as required by SCPA 1108 (2) (c) and by failing to consider the enumerated statutory factors when fixing counsel fees. Second, she concluded that petitioner violated 22 NYCRR 100.3 (C) (3) by awarding a standard eight percent fee without consideration of the statutory factors when the customary fee in other New York City counties was six percent and when the agreement between prior counsel and the Attorney General set a general limitation on fees of six percent of the estate\u2019s value.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">The Commission adopted the Referee\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, adding the violation of 22 NYCRR 100.2 (B) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>for conveying an appearance of impropriety and favoritism by awarding fees to his long-time friend without giving each case the statutorily required individualized consideration, failing to ensure that the fee requests were supported by affidavits of legal services and setting fees greater than those granted in the other New York City counties. The Commission determined that removal was the appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Upon our plenary review of the record and consideration of the evidence and arguments, we agree with the Commission\u2019s conclusions that petitioner failed to maintain professional competence in the law and that his conduct conveyed the appearance of impropriety, and we conclude that petitioner\u2019s actions constitute misconduct warranting removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">A judge must maintain professional competence in the law (22 NYCRR 100.3 [B] [1]). Petitioner\u2019s office and duties are governed by the Surrogate\u2019s Court Procedure Act and, whether voluminous or not, he was under an obligation to familiarize himself with the contents of that legislation, the primary authority for practice in the Surrogate\u2019s Court. Petitioner\u2019s repeated explanation that he \u201cjust read through sections\u201d or \u201cskimmed\u201d the SCPA, and that his failure\u2014over a period of more than five years\u2014to know of and adhere to the single paragraph requirement of affidavits of legal services and individualized consideration of fee requests was an \u201coversight,\u201d demonstrate a shocking disregard for the very law that imbued him with judicial authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">The purpose of the statutory affidavit and individualized consideration requirements is to ensure that beneficiaries of estates that, by definition, lack interested parties capable of offering independent review are paying only for the actual cost of administering the estates. While we recognize a benefit of a fee structure that protects smaller estates from being depleted by hourly legal fees, petitioner\u2019s pro forma practice of awarding eight percent of an estate\u2019s value, approved without attention to the actual work done and unsupported by affidavits of legal services, provides no assurance that the estates benefitted in proportion to the amounts they were charged and violates the clear legal requirement and legislative intent of SCPA 1108 (2) (c). Had petitioner additionally briefed himself on the agreements with the Attorney General\u2019s office, he would have been aware of the State\u2019s concerns about the flat eight percent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>practice. Disregarding the content of those agreements only further suggests that he did not maintain competence in the responsibilities of his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Though petitioner insists that this failure was mere legal error and not misconduct, the two are not necessarily mutually exclusive <em>(see Matter of Reeves, </em>63 NY2d 105, 109-110 [1984]). Indeed, a judge\u2019s systematic failure to conform to legal requirements may form the basis for removal <em>(see Matter of Bauer, </em>3 NY3d 158 [2004]). Petitioner disregarded the clear statutory mandates of his office repeatedly over the course of more than five years and 475 proceedings, educating himself on the SCPA requirements only in response to a newspaper\u2019s investigatory series. Petitioner\u2019s consistent disregard for fundamental statutory requirements of office demonstrates an unacceptable incompetence in the law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Petitioner\u2019s argument that the language of SCPA 1108 (2) (c) stating that a surrogate \u201cshall consider\u201d the factors set forth therein cannot mean that a surrogate \u201cmust consider\u201d those factors is unavailing. While the statute vests discretion in the surrogate to make legal fee determinations, the plain language of SCPA 1108 (2) (c) directs a surrogate to review the statutory factors prior to compensating counsel. \u201cShall\u201d plainly did not mean \u201cmay.\u201d Considering the statutory factors does not divest the surrogate of discretionary authority to award fees, but it does satisfy the concern that fees are justified by the services rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Petitioner\u2019s failure was made all the more egregious by his appointment, without considering other candidates, of a close personal friend and political supporter to whom he summarily awarded, between 1997 and 2002, more than $8.5 million, and who personally took home a substantial portion of that amount without the Surrogate\u2019s independent assurance in each case that the compensation was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">The Rules of Judicial Conduct require that a judge not \u201callow family, social, political or other relationships to influence the judge\u2019s judicial conduct or judgment\u201d (22 NYCRR 100.2 [B]). A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>judge\u2019s conduct is under a sterner microscope than other members of the public, as \u201cthere is no higher order of fiduciary responsibility than that assumed by a Judge\u201d <em>(Matter of Spector v State Commn. on Jud. Conduct, </em>47 NY2d 462, 469 [1979]). While appointment of a friend does not itself convey an appearance of impropriety, when, as here, that appointment is coupled with the unsubstantiated award of several million dollars in fees from estates that, by definition, lack adversarial parties to challenge the practice, the taint of favoritism is strong. Here, the record reflects not mere lapses or errors in judgment but a wholesale failure of petitioner\u2019s duty, reflecting an indifference if not cynicism toward his judicial office. Petitioner\u2019s failure to abide by the legal requirements of his office, in a manner that conveyed the appearance of impropriety and favoritism, debased his office and eroded public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary. We conclude that the proper remedy for this misconduct is removal from office.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Accordingly, the determined sanction should be accepted, without costs, and Michael H. Feinberg removed from the office of Surrogate of Kings County.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B. Smith, Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Graffeo, Read and R.S. Smith concur in per curiam opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Determined sanction accepted, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-9\">. Outside New York City, public administrators can employ counsels of their choice (SCPA 1206). Public administrators\u2019 offices exist in New York City, Erie, Monroe, Nassau, Onondaga, Suffolk and Westchester counties. Elsewhere, the function of the public administrator is undertaken by the county\u2019s chief fiscal officer (SCPA 1001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b291-8\">. In years prior to Rosenthal\u2019s appointment, counsel to the Public Administrator was paid $1,126,250 (1994) and $1,482,860 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b292-7\">. The parties submitted 475 estate files, of which petitioner himself selected 21 to serve as representative. Fifteen of those estates reflected legal fees of between 7.999% and <em>8% </em>five were between 7.8% and 7.97% and one was 8.27%. A few of those fees included payment to the firm that had completed work prior to Rosenthal\u2019s appointment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b295-9\">. Petitioner\u2019s failure to procure any affidavits of legal services was apparently unique to him\u2014Surrogate Bloom required affidavits starting in 1993, as do the surrogates in the other four New York City counties. Of course, even the fact that petitioner inherited a lax culture from a predecessor would not excuse such misconduct. \u201cPetitioner was responsible for his own conduct in the discharge of his judicial duties\u201d <em>(Matter of Greenfeld, </em>71 NY2d 389, 392 [1988]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
