At the time of the accident prompting this lawsuit, plaintiff TBS Group, Inc., formerly Arbor Handling Services, Inc., was one of Raymond\u2019s vendors. The issue on this appeal is whether the vendor\u2019s endorsement in the commercial general liability policy that National issued to Raymond covers personal injury claims caused by the vendor\u2019s independent acts of negligence. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the vendor\u2019s endorsement only covers those claims stemming from a defective product.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">In 1994, Arbor sold Joseph T. Ryerson &amp; Son, a steel distributor, two new Raymond sideloaders for installation in its Philadelphia facility. Because its new cantilever rack system<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was put into place months before the sideloaders\u2019 anticipated delivery date, Ryerson asked Arbor to secure two rental units for its use in the meantime. Arbor had one rental sideloader in-house in its own fleet, and agreed to \u201csupport . . . as if it were its own\u201d any second sideloader that Ryerson might locate either \u201cinternally or externally.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">Ryerson subsequently located a second Raymond sideloader in Chicago. Ryerson rented this unit, which was disassembled and shipped to its facility in Philadelphia. Arbor sent two service technicians to reassemble and adjust the sideloader, which was configured for use in a rail-guided system where the guide rails were both closer together and higher than at Ryerson\u2019s facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>In a rail-guided system, guide rollers are attached to the four corners of a sideloader and engage the rails, which are secured to the floor of the aisles between the racks. With proper adjustment, the guide rollers run against the parallel-facing rails with minimal clearance. A rail-guided system reduces the need for steering and thus the risk of injury to the operator, who does not have to place his head outside the vehicle to look at the wheels.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">Arbor\u2019s technicians did not properly fit the sideloader\u2019s guide rollers within the rails at Ryerson\u2019s facility. As a result, the sideloader tended to wobble from side to side and to jam. A Ryerson employee sustained serious head and brain injuries while operating it. The parties do not dispute that Arbor\u2019s negligence\u2014not any defect in Raymond\u2019s product, the sideloader\u2014 caused this accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The injured worker sued Raymond and Arbor, among others, for damages. During discovery, one of the two Arbor technicians essentially admitted that he knew the sideloader was unsafe when he placed it into service. Arbor and Raymond settled the action prior to trial for $6 million, and Arbor\u2019s primary liability insurer contributed $3 million toward the settlement. Raymond looked to National for the balance, contending that the vendor\u2019s endorsement, which listed Arbor as an additional insured, provided coverage. National contested coverage. Ultimately, however, National and Raymond agreed to contribute $2.5 million and $500,000 respectively, while reserving their rights to resolve their coverage dispute in a separate action.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Raymond and Arbor brought this action seeking judgment against National for Raymond\u2019s $500,000 contribution towards the settlement of the underlying action. National counterclaimed for judgment against Raymond in the amount of its $2.5 million contribution. After discovery, both parties moved for summary judgment. Supreme Court denied Raymond\u2019s motion and granted National summary judgment, dismissing Raymond\u2019s complaint and issuing judgment on National\u2019s counterclaim. The court concluded that the vendor\u2019s endorsement was limited to personal injury claims arising out of a product defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The Appellate Division, unlike Supreme Court, read the vendor\u2019s endorsement as broad enough to cover claims arising out of the vendor\u2019s negligence. Accordingly, the Appellate Division reversed, on the law, denied National\u2019s motion, and granted Raymond summary judgment, declaring that Arbor is an ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>ditional insured under the policy. National appealed, and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The vendor\u2019s endorsement (Endorsement 5 [\u201cAdditional Insured\u2014Vendors Schedule\u201d]) in the policy states that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">\u201c \u2018[s]ection III\u2014Who is An Insured\u2019 is amended to include as an Insured any person or organization (referred to below as \u2018vendor\u2019) shown in the schedule, but only with respect to \u2018Bodily Injury\u2019 or \u2018Property Damage\u2019 arising out of \u2018Your Products\u2019 [Raymond\u2019s products] shown in the schedule which are distributed, sold, repaired, serviced, demonstrated, installed or rented to others in the regular course of the vendor[\u2019]s business, subject to\u201d several exclusions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\u201cIn determining a dispute over insurance coverage, we first look to the language of the policy. We construe the policy in a way that affords a fair meaning to all of the language employed by the parties in the contract and leaves no provision without force and effect\u201d <em>(Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y. v Allstate Ins. Co., </em>98 NY2d 208, 221-222 [2002] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]). We will \u201cnot disregard clear provisions which the insurers inserted in the policies and the insured accepted, and equitable considerations will not allow an extension of coverage beyond its fair intent and meaning in order to obviate objections which might have been foreseen and guarded against\u201d <em>(Caporino v Travelers Ins. Co., </em>62 NY2d 234, 239 [1984] [citation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Here, the policy covers vendors, such as Arbor,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\">\u201conly with respect to \u2018Bodily Injury\u2019 or \u2018Property Damage\u2019 <em>arising out of [Raymond\u2019s products] . . . which are distributed, sold, repaired, serviced, demonstrated, installed or rented </em>to others in the regular course of the vendor[\u2019]s business\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">We conclude that bodily injuries \u201carising out of [Raymond\u2019s products]\u201d means injuries arising out of defects in the products, rather than arising out of the vendor\u2019s negligence. The modifying phrase, \u201cwhich are distributed, sold, repaired, serviced, demonstrated, installed or rented to others in the regular course of the vendor[\u2019]s business,\u201d on which Raymond places so much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>emphasis, is most naturally read to describe Arbor\u2019s activities with respect to Raymond\u2019s products, not\u2014as Raymond argues\u2014to indemnify Arbor for its negligent performance of those activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">This phrase reflects that Arbor is not only a vendor of Raymond\u2019s products, but also repairs, services, demonstrates, installs and tents them. A vendor\u2019s endorsement \u201c extend [s] coverage to distributors of [the vendor\u2019s] product who may be sued for breach of warranty or for strict products liability should the product turn out to be defective or unreasonably dangerous and cause an injury\u201d <em>(Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v St. Paul Surplus Lines Ins. Co., </em>280 F3d 744, 745 [7th Cir 2002]). The vendor\u2019s endorsement here also extends coverage for any defective-product suits arising out of all the activities in addition to sale and distribution which Arbor, in fact, performs with respect to Raymond\u2019s products.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The dissent would discover coverage for vendor negligence in negative inferences from the policy\u2019s exclusions, but \u201can exclusion from insurance coverage cannot create coverage\u201d <em>(Continental Cas. Co. v Pittsburgh Corning Corp., </em>917 F2d 297, 300 [7th Cir 1990]; <em>see also Weedo v Stone-E-Brick, Inc., </em>81 NJ 233, 247, 405 A2d 788, 795 [1979] [it is a \u201cbasic principle that exclusion clauses <em>subtract </em>from coverage rather than grant it\u201d]). In any event, the exclusions that trouble the dissenters are consistent with our reading of the endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Exclusion 1 (A) excludes coverage for claims \u201cfor which the Insured is obligated to pay \u2018damages\u2019 by reason of the assumption of liability in a contract or agreement.\u201d For example, in order to obtain business or other favorable contract terms from a customer, Arbor might agree to assume liability in any product-defect suit brought against the customer by Arbor\u2019s employee who installed or repaired Raymond\u2019s product, or by the customer\u2019s employee. By excluding coverage for \u201c[a]ny Express Warranty unauthorized by [Raymond],\u201d exclusion 1 (B) simply provides that the policy\u2019s coverage for product defects is unavailable where the plaintiffs claim is based on an express warranty made by Arbor\u2014for example, in a marketing or sales brochure\u2014when this warranty was unauthorized by Raymond.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Exclusion 1 (D) excludes coverage for Arbor\u2019s failure to make promised or normally-performed \u201cinspections, adjustments, tests or servicing ... in connection with distribution or sale of the products.\u201d Thus, this exclusion provides that, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>defective-product injuries generally fall within the scope of the endorsement, there is no such coverage if Arbor fails to maintain the product. Contrary to the view expressed by the dissent, this exclusion makes sense because neglect to maintain a product properly may eventually cause it to become defective, or so it might be alleged in a product-defect lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Under exclusion 1 (E), the coverage afforded Arbor does not apply to \u2018 \u2018 [d] emonstration, installation, servicing or repair operations <em>except such operations performed by the Vendor\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Thus, there is no coverage where the defective product causing the injury was being demonstrated, installed, serviced, repaired or rented by someone other than Arbor, Raymond\u2019s vendor. This exclusion ensures that Raymond\u2014rather than a nonvendor third party\u2014created the allegedly injury-causing product defect. Exclusions 1 (D) and 1 (E) both supply incentives for Arbor to maintain and demonstrate Raymond\u2019s products itself rather than farm out these activities to third parties who may lack Arbor\u2019s expertise or knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The vendor\u2019s endorsement has its genesis in products liability law. Accordingly, \u201c[s]uch an endorsement covers the vendors\u2019 liability arising out of their role in passing the manufacturer\u2019s product on to customers, but does not cover vendors for their own negligence. Coverage under the vendor\u2019s endorsement is limited to injuries arising out of a defect in the manufacturer\u2019s product\u201d (9 Couch on Insurance 3d \u00a7 130:3 [1997]).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">As the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals elaborated in <em>Hartford,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">\u201cthe purpose of a vendor\u2019s endorsement is to protect the vendor (i.e., dealer or other distributor) <em>against the expense of being dragged as an additional defendant into a lawsuit arising from a defect in a product that it distributes. </em>It makes sense for the manufacturer to buy the insurance, as he has a better sense of the risk that there will be suits complaining about defects in his products. This assumes, however, that the vendor\u2019s role in the distribution of the product is passive. The manufacturer would be unlikely to insure the vendor against defects introduced by the vendor himself, . . . the risk of those defects being better known to the vendor than to the manufacturer. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\">\u201cBeyond that, the vendor\u2019s endorsement is inappli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>cable if the vendor, whether by participating in the creation of the product or by altering or repairing it, may be responsible for the alleged defect out of which the products liability suit arises. That at least is the majority view\u201d (280 F3d at 746-747 [citations omitted and emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">The court further remarked upon the \u201cimprobability of supposing that the manufacturer\u2019s insurer intends to protect others against the risks that the others create\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 747), and noted the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\">\u201cfurther consideration . . . that vendor\u2019s endorsement policies are cheap add-ons to products liability policies . . . and their cheapness makes the most sense if they\u2019re limited to the case in which the vendor, being completely passive in relation to the harm giving rise to liability rather than the active author of the harm, would be entitled to indemnity from the manufacturer in the event that he (the vendor) was sued and held liable and made to pay damages. For in such a case the vendor\u2019s endorsement would be unlikely to impose a big loss on the insurance company even if the vendor was hit with a damages judgment\u201d <em>(id. </em>[citation omitted]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">In sum, the vendor\u2019s endorsement in this case covers Arbor for defective-product suits arising out of its distribution, sale, repair, servicing, demonstration or rental of Raymond\u2019s products. Nothing in the wording of the endorsement (or the exclusions, for that matter) suggests that bodily injuries \u201carising out of\u2019 Raymond\u2019s products encompasses the vendor\u2019s independent acts of negligence. Our interpretation of the endorsement follows its language and comports with the traditional majority view, the origins of the vendor\u2019s endorsement as an outgrowth of products liability law, and common and economic sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the order of Supreme Court reinstated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-10\">.

When asked what he meant by this representation, Arbor\u2019s sales manager explained that Arbor typically would not service a competitor\u2019s unit installed in a customer\u2019s facility; however, \u201cbecause of the unusual circumstances, with [Arbor] not being able to acquire a unit, if [Ryerson] . . . acquire[d] the unit, [Arbor] would fix the unit, should it break down, and . . . provide parts.

Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar9\">(dissenting). I agree that the \u201cpurpose of a vendor\u2019s endorsement,\u201d as it is described in <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v St. Paul Surplus Lines Ins. Co. </em>(280 F3d 744, 746 [7th Cir 2002]) and elsewhere, would be served by reading the endorsement in this case the way the majority does. But I cannot reconcile that reading with the language of the endorsement, and I therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>The endorsement protects vendors like Arbor against claims for \u201c \u2018Bodily Injury\u2019 or \u2018Property Damage\u2019 arising out of \u2018Your [Raymond\u2019s] Products\u2019 . . . which are distributed, sold, repaired, serviced, demonstrated, installed or rented to others in the regular course of the vendors [sic] business.\u201d The majority reads the words \u201carising out of \u2018Your Products\u2019 \u201d to mean \u201carising out of defects in \u2018Your Products\u2019 \u201d (majority op at 162). This reading of the phrase is not an impossible one, though it departs from our usual practice of resolving ambiguities in favor of the insured <em>(United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. v Annunziata, </em>67 NY2d 229, 232 [1986]); I might accept the majority\u2019s reading if the rest of the vendor\u2019s endorsement were consistent with it. When I read the exclusions from the vendor\u2019s endorsement, however, I cannot believe that the author of the document intended only actions arising out of product defects to be within the endorsement\u2019s coverage. If that was the author\u2019s intention, the exclusions are largely unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The vendor\u2019s endorsement contains six exclusions, of which four are rendered pointless by the majority\u2019s interpretation. Those four provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">\u201cThe Coverage afforded the Vendor does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">\u201cA. \u2018Bodily Injury\u2019 or \u2018Property Damage\u2019 for which the Insured is obligated to pay \u2018damages\u2019 by reason of the assumption of liability in a contract or agreement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-8\">\u201cThis exclusion does not apply to liability for \u2018damage\u2019 that the \u2018Insured\u2019 would have in absence of the contract or agreement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-9\">\u201cB.

Or exclusion B, for cases arising not out of product defects, but out of express warranties? Or exclusion D, for cases arising from certain failures by the vendor? Exclusion D is a very strange provision if all failures by the vendor are outside the endorsement\u2019s coverage to begin with. Perhaps most compelling, exclusion E, which denies coverage for \u201c [demonstration, installation, servicing or repair operations <em>except such operations performed by the Vendor,\u201d </em>necessarily implies that coverage does exist for demonstrations and the like that <em>are </em>performed by the vendor.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">I find the majority\u2019s attempts to give these exclusions some meaning that is consistent with its interpretation of the endorsement completely unpersuasive. It is far-fetched to think that exclusion A was intended to cover the very rare case where a manufacturer would not be liable for a product defect but for its assumption of liability in a contract; I am impressed that the majority can come up with a single example\u2014an agreement to waive workers\u2019 compensation protection (majority op at 163)\u2014 but I cannot believe that is what the author of the endorsement had in mind. The majority simply restates exclusion B, mentioning that express warranties might be contained \u201cin a marketing or sales brochure,\u201d but making no attempt to explain why claims based on such warranties would be excluded from an endorsement that did not cover them in the first place <em>(id.). </em>I think the majority is simply wrong in saying that exclusion D \u201cmakes sense because neglect to maintain a product properly may eventually cause it to become defective\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 164); that is not what \u201cproduct defect\u201d means <em>(see </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 450 [8th ed 2004] [\u201cAn imperfection in a product that has a manufacturing defect or design defect, or is faulty because of inadequate instructions or warnings\u201d]). The majority is no doubt right that a product defect caused by poor maintenance, or any other imaginable piece of illogie, \u201cmight be alleged in a product-defect lawsuit\u201d (majority op at 164), but it is highly unlikely that exclusion D was written to provide against that possibility. The majority\u2019s explanation of exclusion E is that it is designed to insure \u201cthat Raymond\u2014rather than a nonvendor third party\u2014created the allegedly injury-causing product defect\u201d <em>(id.). </em>But defects are not product defects unless the manufacturer \u201ccreated\u201d them, and if the endorsement were limited to claims based on product defects, there would be no reason either to exclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>any acts by vendors or to distinguish, as exclusion E does, between third-party vendors and Arbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Thus, I read the vendor\u2019s endorsement here as applicable to a case, like this one, arising out of an injury caused by a Raymond product, whether the product was defective or not. Cases from other jurisdictions support this reading. <em>Pep Boys v Cigna Indent. Ins. Co. of N. Am. </em>(300 NJ Super 245, 692 A2d 546 [1997]) and <em>Sportmart, Inc. v Daisy Mfg. Co. </em>(268 111 App 3d 974, 645 NE2d 360 [1994]) are indistinguishable from this case. Both involved vendors that negligently sold products to minors; in neither case was there any claim that there was anything wrong with the products themselves. Both cases involved policy language that, to the extent it is quoted in the decisions, was word-for-word identical to the language at issue here. In both cases, the vendor was held to be covered by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The majority relies on <em>Hartford </em>but, while Judge Posner\u2019s opinion contains general remarks about vendor\u2019s endorsements that are consistent with the result th\u00e9 majority reaches, <em>Hartford </em>was quite a different case. The vendor there had not only sold the product in question\u2014a diet pill\u2014but had \u201cdesigned the contents of the label, including the warnings\u201d (280 F3d at 746). The injured person claimed that the warnings were inadequate <em>{id.). </em>The vendor\u2019s endorsement contained \u201can express exception for cases in which a claim of products liability is based on the labeling or relabeling of the product by the vendor\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 747)\u2014so that the result in <em>Hartford </em>seems to have been compelled by clear policy language. Nor do any of the cases cited by the <em>Hartford </em>court for what it called the \u201cmajority view\u201d <em>{id.) </em>turn on an interpretation of language similar to that at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The majority also relies on Couch\u2019s treatise, which says that coverage under vendor\u2019s endorsements \u201cis limited to injuries arising out of a defect in the manufacturer\u2019s product\u201d (9 Couch on Insurance 3d \u00a7 130:3 [1997], quoted at majority op at 164). But the treatise does not offer this comment as an interpretation of any particular policy language. The treatise, I believe, must be read as describing what vendor\u2019s endorsements often say, or what its author believes they ought to say. This one does not say it.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">I therefore conclude that the Appellate Division correctly held that the claim against Arbor was within the coverage provided by the vendor\u2019s endorsement, and I would affirm the Appellate Division\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B. Smith and Ciparick concur with Judge Read; Judge R.S. Smith dissents and votes to affirm in a separate opinion in which Judges Rosenblatt and Graffeo concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
