Based on regulations promulgated by the New York State Department of Health, we agree with the courts below that a hearing must be held regarding recoupment of the Medicaid funds in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Medicare and Medicaid are two primary sources of payment for home health care services rendered by providers such as petitioner Visiting Nurse Service of New York Home Care (VNS). There are, however, significant differences between these government-sponsored programs. Medicare is a federal program that provides reimbursement for the medical expenses of persons eligible for Social Security benefits; it is administered exclusively by the United States Department of Health and Human Services <em>(see </em>Social Security Act tit XVIII [42 USC \u00a7 1395 <em>et seq.J). </em>Providers submit claims to the federal agency\u2019s fiscal intermediary for evaluation <em>(see </em>42 CFR 424.32 [a] [1]) and this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>assessment process uses criteria established by federal law and regulations. Providers can pursue an administrative appeal procedure for rejected claims <em>(see e.g. </em>42 CFR 405.710 <em>et seq.; </em>42 CFR 405.724).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">The Medicaid program pays for medical and health services supplied to individuals who fall below a certain income threshold <em>(see </em>Social Security Act tit XIX [42 USC \u00a7 1396 <em>et seq.]). </em>Unlike Medicare, which is fully funded by the federal government, in New York, the State and its counties contribute to the payment of Medicaid-eligible claims <em>(see </em>42 USC \u00a7 1396a [a] [2]; \u00a7\u00a7 1396b, 1396d [b]). Because of this joint participation, in addition to providing Medicaid coverage for an array of medical and health services specified under federal law, a state may establish its own eligibility criteria, expand the types of services that qualify for coverage and set rates for reimbursement <em>(see generally </em>42 USC \u00a7 1396d [a]; \u00a7 1396o [c] [1]; [d]; \u00a7 1396r-l [a]; 42 CFR 440.225, 460.2 [b]).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Health care providers file Medicaid reimbursement claims with the New York State Department of Health (DOH) in accordance with state law and regulations <em>(see </em>Public Health Law \u00a7201 [1] [v]; Social Services Law \u00a7 363-a [1]). Medicaid is referred to as a \u201c \u2018payor of last resort\u2019 \u201d under federal law because other potential sources of payment, such as Medicare, must be exhausted before claims are paid by Medicaid <em>(Gold v United Health Servs. Hosps., </em>95 NY2d 683, 690-691 [2001], quoting S Rep No. 146, 99th Cong, 2d Sess, at 1, 312, reprinted in 1986 US Code Cong &amp; Admin News, at 42, 279; <em>see </em>42 USC \u00a7 1396a [a] [25]). Accordingly, participating providers are required to determine whether health care expenses can be submitted in the first instance to Medicare or some other payor before submission to Medicaid <em>(see </em>18 NYCRR 540.6 [e] [1], [2], [6]). This assessment is particularly critical for persons who are dually eligible for health services under both Medicare and Medicaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">At the time of Medicaid claim submission, the State does not know what efforts were taken by providers to secure payment from other sources, including Medicare. Medicaid claims are therefore subject to postpayment review through the Medicaid Maximization program (MedMax). New York has contracted with a private entity\u2014the Center for Medicare Advocacy (CMA)\u2014to perform MedMax claim eligibility review. CMA is charged with evaluating whether health care claims that were paid by Medicaid should have been submitted for reimburse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>ment to Medicare or another payor. If CMA identifies improperly disbursed payments, it assists DOH in recovering the funds previously paid to providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">During the time frame relevant to this appeal (October 1993 to September 1998), VNS billed Medicaid for approximately $1.7 billion in health care services. After conducting the Med-Max review and finding that certain recipients were dually eligible, CMA concluded that $38.2 million of those Medicaid payments should have qualified for reimbursement by Medicare or other third-party payors. Upon resubmission to Medicare, the federal program paid about $28.4 million to VNS and, in turn, VNS refunded an almost identical amount to the State to satisfy the improper Medicaid charges. Medicare did not, however, accept the remaining approximately $10 million of VNS claims because too much time had elapsed from the date the health care services were rendered,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or due to errors by the provider. These so-called \u201cprovider liability\u201d claims\u2014those disputed Medicaid payments for which VNS was not able to receive compensation by Medicare or another payor\u2014are the subject of this dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">DOH began to offset the outstanding $10 million in alleged improper Medicaid payments by withholding other Medicaid revenue due VNS. As a consequence, by December 2002, DOH had recouped over $2 million. VNS responded by initiating this CPLR article 78 proceeding challenging the State\u2019s withholding of Medicaid funds, asserting that it was not obligated to repay Medicaid unless it had actually received payment for the services provided from Medicare or some other source. VNS also contested DOH\u2019s recoupment procedures on the ground that no administrative hearing had been available for VNS to contest DOH\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Supreme Court granted the provider\u2019s petition, concluding that VNS had a property interest in the Medicaid payments that was protected by due process and, as such, DOH was required to conduct a hearing before recovering Medicaid funds from VNS. The Appellate Division affirmed, similarly ruling that VNS was entitled to a hearing to determine if reasonable measures had been undertaken to assess whether the disputed claims were eligible for payment by Medicare or other third-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>party payors before submission to Medicaid. State recoupment efforts were stayed by the Court because DOH had failed to comply with its own regulatory time frames for conducting hearings. The Appellate Division did, however, agree with DOH\u2019s contention that recoupment of provider liability claims was permissible in those instances where VNS failed to engage in reasonable efforts to ascertain whether services were Medicaid-eligible and to satisfy any conditions of approval by that program. Upon the Appellate Division\u2019s certification of a question to us,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we conclude that a hearing must be held on the issue of whether VNS took reasonable measures to ensure the proper designation and processing of claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">DOH argues that notice and an opportunity to be heard need not be provided to VNS before recoupment efforts are undertaken because Medicaid payments to home health care providers are conditional pending postpayment MedMax review. But this contention is inconsistent with the regulatory scheme promulgated by DOH. Nothing in the relevant regulations indicates that payments to home health care providers are contingent on postpayment audits <em>(see </em>18 NYCRR 505.23 [e]; <em>see also </em>18 NYCRR parts 517, 518, 519). DOH\u2019s reliance on the regulatory provisions that govern payments to nursing homes is misplaced since those regulations specifically state that reimbursement rates are \u201cprovisional\u201d until an \u201caudit is performed and completed\u201d (10 NYCRR 86-2.7; <em>see Matter of Cortlandt Nursing Home v Axelrod, </em>66 NY2d 169, 178-179 [1985]). A similar condition does not appear in the regulations pertaining to home health care providers <em>(see </em>18 NYCRR 505.23 [e]).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Instead, the regulations that cover home health care providers state that if DOH \u201cdetermine^] that any person has submitted or caused to be submitted claims for medical care, services or supplies for which payment should not have been made, it may require repayment of the amount determined to have been overpaid\u201d (18 NYCRR 518.1 [b]). \u201cOverpayment\u201d is defined as \u201cany amount not authorized to be paid under the medical assistance program, whether paid as the result of inaccurate or improper cost reporting, improper claiming, unacceptable prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>tices, fraud, abuse or mistake\u201d (18 NYCRR 518.1 [c]). \u201c[W]hen a determination is made that an overpayment has been made, any person from whom recovery is sought is entitled to a notice of the overpayment and an opportunity to be heard\u201d (18 NYCRR 518.5 [a]) unless \u201cthe department or its fiscal agent adjusts or denies a claim prior to payment or withholds payment pursuant to a notice of withholding\u201d (18 NYCRR 518.5 [b]).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">DOH contends that its \u201coverpayment\u201d definition is a term of art that it has interpreted to exclude provider liability claims and, consequently, VNS does not have a right to a hearing under 18 NYCRR 518.5 (a). Although it is true that an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation generally is entitled to deference, courts are not required to embrace a regulatory construction that conflicts with the plain meaning of the promulgated language <em>(see Matter of 427 W. 51st St. Owners Corp. v Division of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal, </em>3 NY3d 337, 342 [2004]). The funds sought to be recovered by DOH fall within the broad definition of \u201coverpayment\u201d in 18 NYCRR 518.1 (c) and, therefore, deference to DOH\u2019s interpretation is not warranted under the circumstances. As a result, VNS has the right to \u201cnotice of the overpayment and an opportunity to be heard\u201d on the issue of overpayment recoupment (18 NYCRR 518.5 [a]; <em>see </em>18 NYCRR 519.4 [a]).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">We next address whether DOH was properly ordered to cease recoupment pending the administrative hearing. VNS concedes that, as a general proposition, DOH is not required to conduct a hearing prior to seeking recoupment of Medicaid funds <em>(see Clove Lakes Nursing Home v Whalen, </em>45 NY2d 873, 875 [1978]). Departmental regulations permit recoupment efforts to commence prior to a hearing <em>(see </em>18 NYCRR 518.8). Significantly, the same regulation further provides that \u201cif the department is unable to proceed within 90 days of receipt of [a] request [for a hearing], any recovery . . . will be stayed pending the commencement of the hearing\u201d and \u201cany delays . . . occasioned by or attributable to the department will forestall the commencement or continuation of recoupment\u201d (18 NYCRR 518.8 [b]). In light of DOH\u2019s failure to comply with the prescribed 90-day time frame, it was properly barred from continuing to withhold the Medicaid payments in this case pending an administrative hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>As the courts below also concluded, the purpose of the hearing will be to consider whether VNS should be relieved of its obligation to repay the contested Medicaid claims. A health care provider is not required to reimburse DOH for services that were paid by Medicaid if the provider \u2018\u2018produce [s] acceptable documentation to the department that the provider reasonably attempted to ascertain and satisfy any conditions of approval or other claiming requirements of liable third-party payors\u201d (18 NYCRR 540.6 [e] [6]). Whether a provider satisfies this test requires examination of both the provider\u2019s initial assessment that a claim was not eligible for Medicare or other third-party reimbursement and its actions after being notified that a Medicaid-reimbursed claim should be resubmitted to a different payor. At the hearing, the burden will be on VNS to prove that it acted reasonably when it decided to submit the claims at issue to Medicaid rather than to Medicare or other payors and when it was subsequently notified by CMA that certain claims should be resubmitted for Medicare reimbursement eligibility. Recoupment by DOH is prohibited only with respect to claims for which VNS acted reasonably in both instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">Finally, VNS asks us to decide whether federal law precludes DOH from seeking reimbursement for provider liability claims. VNS, however, did not cross-move to appeal and therefore may not obtain affirmative relief in this Court <em>(see 511 W. 232nd Owners Corp. v Jennifer Realty Co., </em>98 NY2d 144, 151 n 3 [2002]).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs, and the certified question answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B. Smith, Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Read and R.S. Smith concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Order affirmed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-7\">. Medicare regulations deem a claim to be timely if it is submitted by the end of the calendar year that follows the fiscal year during which the health care service was provided (i.e., a service provided during fiscal year 2000-2001 had to be submitted by December 31, 2002) (see 42 CFR 424.44 [a]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b585-6\">. The Appellate Division, Third Department, asked: \u201cDid this Court err, as a matter of law, in affirming the judgment of Supreme Court, which partially granted petitioner\u2019s application, in a proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78, to annul a determination of respondent Department of Health directing recoupment of Medicaid overpayments made to petitioner?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b586-7\">. It is unnecessary for us to address DOH\u2019s argument that due process is satisfied by the MedMax review procedure because a distinct administrative hearing is compelled by the cited regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
