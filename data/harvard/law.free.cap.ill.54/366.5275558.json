At the June Term, A. D. 1870, of' the Circuit Court of Cook county, this cause being pending therein on appeal from a j ustice\u2019s court, the defendant below, appellant here, made a motion, before the trial, that the court quash the writ and dismiss the suit for want of a sufficient complaint. The court overruled the motion, and appellant excepted. The cause was submitted to the court by agreement of parties, for trial without a jury. A trial was had, and the court found the defendant guilty. A motion was made by him for a new trial\u2014overruled by the court and exception taken. Judgment was rendered upon the finding, and defendant brings the case here by appeal. The complaint is as follows :</p> <blockquote id=\"b368-5\" pgmap=\"368\">\u201c State oe Illinois, 1 QQ County of Cook, J</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"Adl\" pgmap=\"368\">To J. Winsiiip, Justice of the Peace :</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b368-6\" pgmap=\"368\">Charlotte M. Gillespie, administratrix of the estate of Thomas and Sarah A. Smith, deceased, on being duly sworn, says that on or about the eighteenth day of April, A. D. 1868, the following described premises in the county of Cook, and State of Illinois, to-wit: the two-story frame house known as \u00a1No. 218, Maxwell street, Chicago, were let by the said Charlotte M. Gillespie, administratrix, to John L. Doran for the term of, until May 1, 1869, which term has determined by expiration, and by due notice in writing, served upon the said John L. Doran by delivering a copy thereof to a person above the age of twelve years, residing on said premises, and the said Charlotte M. Gillespie is now entitled to the possession of said premises, and that the said John L. Doran, wilfully and without force, holds over such possession after the determination of the time for which said premises were let to the said Doran, and after such notice, wherefore affiant makes this complaint to said justice, and prays summons in pursuance of the statute.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b368-7\" pgmap=\"368\">Sworn, etc. Charlotte M. Gillespie.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b368-8\" pgmap=\"368\">The ruling of the court below, in overruling the motion to dismiss the suit for want of a sufficient complaint, is assigned for error. If the complaint is substantially defective, the motion should have been allowed. Jackson v. Warren, 32 Ill. 331.</p> <p id=\"b368-9\" pgmap=\"368\">This action was based upon the first section of the forcible entry and detainer act of 1845, and the complaint is plainly defective in substance. The statute prescribes the elements of the cause of action in definite terms: \u201cIf any person shall wilfully and without force, hold over any lands, etc., after the determination of the time for which such lands, etc. were let to Mm, or to the person from whom he claims, after demand made in writing for possession thereof, such person shall be adjudged guilty,\u201d etc.</p> <p id=\"b369-5\" pgmap=\"369\">A construction of this statute as to all the points material to the decision of this case, has been given by repeated decisions of this court, and we decline to re-open the discussion of them. In Prickett v. Ritter, 16 Ill. 96, it was decided that the demand in writing for possession of the premises, under the act, should be made after the determination of the time for which they, were let. \u201c Such,\u201d said the court, \u201c is obviously the meaning of the statute. Reason and analogy sustain this interpretation. 3STo one should be put in the wrong by a demand which another had no right to make, of a thing he had no right to receive or possess.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b369-6\" pgmap=\"369\">The complaint wholly fails to show that the \u201c notice in writing,\u201d therein mentioned, was served, even in the manner stated, after the determination of the time for which the premises were let; nor does it show that it contained any such demand of possession as required by the statute, or that it was made or served by the plaintiff, or any person authorized by her to serve it. The complaint says that the term had been \u201c determined by expiration, and by due notice in writing, served upon said John L. Doran by delivering a copy to a person above the age of twelve years, residing on said premises.\u201d We are not warranted in inferring that it was a demand of possession made by her, from the words \u201cdue notice.\u201d These words express a mere legal conclusion, and will not answer in these complaints. The facts requisite to constitute the cause of action must be stated. By the statute, the jury are \u201c to hear and try the said complaint,\u201d and juries hear and try questions of fact.</p> <p id=\"b369-7\" pgmap=\"369(96) 370(41)\">But if this notice could be deemed a demand of the possession, so far as its contents are concerned, which it can not, then the complaint is defective in substance, because it does not show that it was served by delivering it to, and leaving it with, the defendant. It was never intended by that statute to enable a landlord, in case his tenant was temporarily absent from home, to leave a notice on the premises and turn his family into the streets in his absence. In Seem v. McLees, 24 Ill. 192, the court held that reading the notice to the tenant was not sufficient. \u201c It did not appear,\u201d the court says, \u201c that the notice, or a copy of it, was left with the defendant, but it was read to him.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b370-5\" pgmap=\"370\">The complaint is defective in substance, and the court below erred in overruling the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for such insufficiency. The judgment of the court below is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b370-6\" pgmap=\"370\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
