No exception was taken by the people\u2019s attorney, nor is there any bill of exceptions in the record showing the ground of dismissal. We must, therefore, presume the court acted upon sufficient cause. If it did not, the people\u2019s attorney should have taken a bill of exceptions showing under what circumstances and on what grounds the court made the order. For aught that appears, the people\u2019s attorney may have consented to the action of the court.</p> <p id=\"b280-14\" pgmap=\"280\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
