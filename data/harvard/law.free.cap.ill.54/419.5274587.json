So where in an action on a promissory note given by one partner to his co-partner on the settlement of their partnership affairs, the defendant offered to prove, under a plea of set off, that a mistake was made in the settlement, and that the plaintiff\u2019s share of the rent due the defendant hy the firm for the use of a store owned by him, was accidentally omitted from the settlement, it was held, unless there was an adjustment of these items and a promise by the plaintiff to pay, they constituted no defense at law.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b419-11\" pgmap=\"419\">5.

This was objected to by appellee\u2019s counsel as not pertinent to the issue, and the objection was sustained by the court. Appellant then offered to prove, by his own testimony, that, while they were in partnership, appellee kept the books of the firm, made the statement from the books which he had kept upon which the settlement was made, the partnership dissolved and the note given; that after the note was given, one Clark informed appellant that he (Clark), and appellee had examined the books of the firm, and found a mistake of $172, and that on the settlement, the rent of the store was left out by mistake. This offer was objected to by appellee\u2019s counsel, excluded by the court and exceptions taken.</p> <p id=\"b421-7\" pgmap=\"421\">The affidavit for continuance set forth, substantially, the same facts and line of defense as offered on the trial, except, in addition to those offered at the trial, the affidavit states that appellant expected to prove that appellee took divers sums of money from the drawer, which were not accounted for; that he was charged with having done so, and did not deny it. The question, therefore, is, whether a court of law should take cognizance of such matters, viz.: misappropriation of moneys by one partner, the correction of mistakes in their settlement, and the enforcement of payment, by appellee, of his share of rent, which both parties, as a firm, owed to appellant, the owner of the building used for a store ? . It is not shown, nor was it offered to be shown, that there was an adjustment of these items, and a promise by appellee to pay. But on the contrary, when he was informed of the mistake, he said he would look over the account, and if there was any mistake he would rectify it; and he left on the next train.</p> <p id=\"b422-5\" pgmap=\"422\">How could appellant maintain an action at law against his co-partner, to recover the rent of a store which he owned and furnished for the use of the firm? One partner can not, at law, maintain a suit against his co-partners, to recover the amount of money he has paid for the partnership, since he can not sue them without suing himself, also, as one of the partnership. 1 Story Eq. Jur. 681.</p> <p id=\"b422-6\" pgmap=\"422\">There is no difference between money paid for .the partnership, and a building furnished for it at a given rental, to be paid by the firm. Besides, if the matters in question could, in any manner, be used as a defense to the action on the note, they were admissible only as showing a failure of consideration, and not as a set off. But that defense can be given only under a plea of failure, total or partial, as the case may be. This has been again and again decided by this court. A plea in bar, however, to an action upon a promissory note, which seeks to open partnership accounts for the purpose of showing that there was a mistake in the note, and that its consideration had failed, would be bad on demurrer, on the ground that a court of equity has exclusive jurisdiction of such matters. Rogers v. Rogers, 1 Hall R. 394; Funk v. Ryan, 3 Scam. 322.</p> <p id=\"b422-7\" pgmap=\"422\">The errors assigned not being sustainable, the judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b422-8\" pgmap=\"422\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
