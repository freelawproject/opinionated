Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 785 [183 Cal.Rptr. 810, 647 P.2d 86], our Supreme Court held that, in an action alleging an insurer\u2019s bad faith refusal to pay benefits under an <em>accident policy, </em>the plaintiff was entitled to discover the names and addresses of other claimants whose <em>accident claims </em>had been adjusted by the person who had adjusted the plaintiffs claim. In the case now before us, the trial court held that, in an action alleging an insurer\u2019s bad faith termination of benefits under a <em>disability policy, </em>the plaintiff is <em>not </em>entitled to discover the names and addresses of other claimants whose <em>psychiatric disability claims </em>had been denied during a four-year period. We agree with the trial court that where, as here, the disclosure of a claimant\u2019s identity necessarily discloses the claimant\u2019s psychiatric condition, the claimant\u2019s psychotherapist-patient privilege trumps the plaintiffs right to use this particular form of discovery. For this reason, we deny the plaintiffs petition for a writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">Mark Pollock sued Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>dealing, alleging that Northwestern had wrongfully terminated the payments due to Pollock under a disability income policy. In conclusory terms, Pollock alleges that he sought \u201cmedical tre\u00e1tment for depression,\u201d that his depression \u201cresulted in his total disability\u201d under the terms of his policy, that he submitted a claim to Northwestern, and that Northwestern \u201caccepted and approved\u201d his claim and \u201ccommenced making payments\u201d under the policy but then \u201cwrongfully and totally terminated]\u201d Pollock\u2019s benefits. Northwestern answered and discovery ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">A few months later, Pollock served special interrogatories in which he asked Northwestern a series of questions about the number of other Northwestern insureds who were \u201creceiving psychiatric disability benefits\u201d and then were \u201cdenied further psychiatric disability benefits\u201d over a four-year period. Ultimately, those questions were answered, but Northwestern refused to answer an interrogatory that demanded: \u201cState the name and address of each insured whom you denied a psychiatric disability claim from January 1, 1997 to the present.\u201d Northwestern objected, claiming that disclosure of the claimants\u2019 names and addresses would violate their privacy rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">In response, Pollock offered to stipulate that all information about the claimants would be subject to a protective order, and that his contact with the claimants would be limited to a form letter approved by Northwestern. (See <em>Colonial Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d 785.) Pollock\u2019s proposed letter, to be sent on his lawyers\u2019 letterhead, is set out in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Northwestern rejected Pollock\u2019s proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>Pollock then filed a motion to compel Northwestern to provide the claimants\u2019 names and addresses so that Pollock\u2019s lawyer could send his proposed letter. Northwestern opposed the motion and presented the declaration of F. David Rudnick, M.D., Ph.D. This is what Dr. Rudnick had to say: \u201cIn my opinion, ... it would be an egregious breach of the patient\u2019s right to confidentiality for Northwestern ... to reveal to anyone the names and addresses of those persons who have submitted claims for psychiatric disability. Patients seeking psychiatric help continually express to me their reluctance to seek psychiatric treatment because of the stigma they feel is attached to the existence and treatment of mental conditions. They expect and are entitled to receive absolute confidentiality regarding their condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">\u201cI believe that a patient who has sought treatment from a psychiatrist or a psychotherapist, has made a disability claim based on a mental condition, and who later learns that his identity as a psychiatric patient and claimant has been revealed to third parties, would be at significant risk of having old wounds re-opened and of being re-traumatized by learning of the disclosure, [f] Further, I believe that an insurer who reveals such information to third parties would be exposed to allegations by the patients whose confidentiality was violated that the disclosure triggered additional mental and emotional problems and caused further injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">\u201cBecause of the extremely sensitive and confidential nature of psychiatric treatment, I also believe that there is a danger of harm even if the insurance company were to do nothing more than advise the claimant that it has been asked to seek his permission to reveal his name to others. Accordingly, it is my opinion that many individuals would be extremely upset by such a contact and this could result in an aggravation of their problems, a worsening of their condition, and even a renewal of their disability claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Although Pollock filed a reply, he did not offer any medical evidence to dispute Dr. Rudnick\u2019s opinion (or any evidence at all). Instead, Pollock objected to the trial court\u2019s consideration of Dr. Rudnick\u2019s declaration, contending it was speculative and conclusory, and that it lacked foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">The trial court denied Pollock\u2019s motion, noting that Pollock\u2019s proposed letter would necessarily confront the claimants with the fact that their psychiatric condition had been revealed. When Pollock\u2019s lawyer asked the trial court for an alternative \u201csolution\u201d or \u201csuggestion,\u201d the court refused to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>speculate, left it to the lawyers to do the lawyering, and (quite properly) limited its ruling to the motion before it. Pollock then asked us to order the trial court to order Northwestern to disclose the names and addresses so that Pollock\u2019s lawyer could send the proposed letter. We issued an order to show cause and set the matter for hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">In <em>Colonial Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d 785, a bad faith case arising out of Colonial\u2019s refusal to pay a claim made under an accident policy, the trial court ordered Colonial\u2019s claims adjuster to produce the names and addresses of all persons whose claims for benefits under Colonial\u2019s policies were assigned to that adjuster for settlement, and approved a letter to be sent by the plaintiffs lawyer to those individuals to request their consent to the release of their records. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 789.) In the mandate proceedings before the Supreme Court, Colonial asked for orders that would have prevented plaintiffs counsel from seeking to represent other claimants. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 789-790.) But Colonial did \u201cnot contend that the discovery ordered by the trial court was embarrassing or oppressive. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 789, fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">The Supreme Court rejected Colonial\u2019s arguments, found the discovery relevant, held that it was entirely proper for the plaintiffs lawyer to contact other Colonial claimants through the procedure devised by the trial court, and refused to assume that, faced with an opportunity to solicit clients in the course of legitimate discovery, the plaintiffs lawyer would ignore his ethical obligations. <em>(Colonial Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 794.)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">Pollock contends his proposed letter is within the parameters of <em>Colonial Life. </em>Northwestern disagrees and so do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">The names of Northwestern\u2019s claimants are not discoverable because the disclosure of the names would reveal not only the identity of the claimants but also the nature of their ailments (\u201cpsychiatric disability\u201d). The submission of a claim to Northwestern is a condition precedent to coverage under a policy purchased by the claimant and, therefore, a necessity. For this reason, the psychotherapist-patient privilege is not waived by the claimant, and it cannot be waived by the insurer. (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 912, subd. (d), 992; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number><em>Blue Cross v. Superior Court </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 798, 801-802 [132 Cal.Rptr. 635] [an insured who sued her health care insurer for wrongful refusal to pay medical expenses incurred for psoriasis treatment was not entitled to discover the names of other insureds who had filed claims for psoriasis treatment]; <em>Smith v. Superior Court </em>(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 136, 140-142 [173 Cal.Rptr. 145] [the disclosure of the identity of a psychotherapist\u2019s patients inevitably reveals the fact that the patients suffer from mental or emotional problems, and is therefore not discoverable]; and see <em>Rosso, Johnson, Rosso &amp; Ebersold v. Superior Court </em>(1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 1514, 1519 [237 Cal.Rptr. 242]; <em>County of Alameda v. Superior Court </em>(1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 254, 258-263 [239 Cal.Rptr. 400].)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Although the trial court\u2019s ruling withholds from Pollock \u201cthe most direct means of ascertaining\u201d the information he is after, it by no means precludes other approaches. (See <em>Smith v. Superior Court, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.3d at p. 142.) We note with interest Dr. Rudnick\u2019s opinion that, in the psychiatric treatment context, \u201cthere is a danger of harm even if the insurance company were to do nothing more than advise the claimant[s] that it has been asked to seek [their] permission to reveal [their] name[s] to others.\u201d Since Pollock didn\u2019t suggest any alternative approach, the trial court had no reason to consider whether a letter from an insurer to its own insured could be harmful if the letter made it clear (in plain English) that <em>nothing </em>had been or would be disclosed to <em>anyone </em>and that it was up to the claimant to decide whether to contact Pollock\u2019s lawyer. (Cf. <em>Valley Bank of Nevada v. Superior Court </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 652, 656-658 [125 Cal.Rptr. 553, 542 P.2d 977]; <em>Sehlmeyer v. Department of General Services </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 1072, 1080-1081, fn. 8 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 840]; <em>Planned Parenthood Golden Gate v. Superior Court </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 347, 358-370 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 627].)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Accordingly, the only issue before us is the propriety of the trial court\u2019s order denying Pollock\u2019s motion to compel Northwestern to disclose the names and addresses of the claimants. Since the disclosure of those names would necessarily reveal the existence of the claimants\u2019 psychiatric condition, the motion was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">The petition is denied. The parties are to pay their own costs of these writ proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">Spencer, P.
