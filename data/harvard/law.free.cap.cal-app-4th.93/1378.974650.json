(the Minor), bom mid-January 1999, was declared a dependent of the juvenile court soon after his birth. He was bom with symptoms of drug withdrawal; both parents had histories of drug abuse, and his father had a history of arrests and convictions for violent offenses. He is currently in the care of respondents, his foster parents, with whom he was placed virtually at birth and who wish to adopt him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-11\">Both the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (the Department) and the Minor\u2019s paternal aunt and uncle appeal from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>orders of the juvenile court. Appellants all argued for placement with the paternal relatives, who live in Puerto Rico. The court ordered that the Minor remain with the foster parents and that the adoption by them be set for finalization.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court also ordered that the Minor not be removed from the home of his foster family without prior court order. The Department\u2019s appeal is from the order after a hearing under Welfare and Institutions Code section 366.26.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Manuel and Aleida P., the paternal uncle and aunt who wish to adopt the Minor, appeal from the juvenile court\u2019s order denying their section 388 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-5\">This appeal presents an unusual and difficult factual situation. As observed by the juvenile court, \u201cthe difficulty is unusual because we have two families who wish to take care of Harry for the rest of his life.\u201d At least as of the time the juvenile court\u2019s decision was made, both prospective adoptive families received excellent reviews and were considered by the juvenile court to be appropriate parental choices for the Minor. Although the juvenile court ultimately sided with the foster parents, who had cared for the Minor since he was days old, the court did not express the view that placement with the paternal relatives in Puerto Rico would have been an abuse of discretion by the Department. Indeed, in most of the dependency cases we see, placement with a loving, responsible, biologically related family would be a welcome alternative for children within the system. Had these relatives lived in California instead of in Puerto Rico, where there was a delay in the home study, it is likely the Minor would have been taken from the foster family and placed with them early in the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-6\">The legal question presented to us by the parties is whether the Department or the court has the right to determine the specific family in which a dependent child will be placed for adoption once parental rights have been terminated and whether there is a statutory preference for the caretaker family in the circumstances of the case at bench. We hold that, absent an abuse of discretion, the Department has been given the authority to place dependent children in an adoptive home following termination of parental rights. The statutory \u201cpreference\u201d for the caretaker family is that their application shall be processed and, if satisfactory, the family study \u201cshall be completed before the processing of the application of any other person . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1382\">*1382</page-number>(\u00a7 366.26, subd. (k)), not that the caretaker family will automatically become the adoptive parents, although that frequently occurs. We shall therefore reverse and remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-4\">Procedural History and Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-5\">Within two weeks of the Minor\u2019s birth, the Department filed a section 300 dependency petition. The minor, who was transferred to a neonatal intensive care unit at one day old, was detained and placed with the S\u2019s. He had been bom two months early, with a positive drug screen.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1166-6\">On January 29, 1999, the court found a prima facie case for detaining the Minor; vested temporary placement and custody with the Department; and gave the Department the discretion to release the Minor to any appropriate relative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-7\">The jurisdictional/dispositional hearing report for February 19, 1999, stated that Mother was bom in Chicago but went to Puerto Rico with her parents as a young child. She met Father, a native of Puerto Rico, where relatives of both still live. The social worker opined that the foster mother \u201chas the expertise to meet most of [the Minor\u2019s] emotional and physical needs at this time in her foster home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-8\">On February 19, 1999, the juvenile court ordered the amended petition sustained in large part; declared the Minor a dependent of the court; and ordered family reunification services. Parents were to have visits not less than twice a week, and as often as could be arranged.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1166-9\">A status review hearing report was prepared for August 6, 1999, when the Minor was six months old. The report stated that the foster parents \u201care providing excellent care and supervision for the Minor. They have provided him with a safe [and] stable home and environment\u201d and the Minor \u201cappears to be happy and thriving in his placement\u201d and was bonding with the foster mother. In addition to the Minor, the foster parents cared for a biological daughter and an adopted daughter. According to the report, the Minor had been taken to many doctor visits, including in late July, when he stopped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1383\">*1383</page-number>breathing and became red and the foster mother reported reviving him with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1167-5\">The foster mother also reported that the Minor\u2019s parents had stopped visiting in late March. However, on July 7, 1999, the paternal grandmother called regarding taking custody of the grandchild. She made \u201cnumerous telephone calls\u201d and arrived from Puerto Rico to visit with the Minor. The paternal grandmother and a paternal aunt and uncle all visited with the Minor on July 27, and the grandmother and uncle visited on July 29, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-6\">The foster mother had been contacted by the adoption unit in early July 1999. The adoption assessment dated July 16, 1999, recommended adoption by the current caretaker, who stated she and her husband loved the Minor \u201cvery much\u201d and wanted to adopt him. The CSW\u2019s report also noted: \u201cAdditionally, Mrs. [P.], Minor\u2019s paternal grandmother, living in Puerto Rico arrived in Los Angeles the week of July 25, 1999 and had 2 visits with the Minor in a neutral setting. She continues to desire to receive the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-7\">The paternal grandmother and an aunt appeared at the hearing on August 6, 1999. Mother and Father also appeared. The court was informed that the \u201cgrandmother is here from Puerto Rico and would very much like the Minor placed with her.\u201d The court stated: \u201cIt does appear that the Department is evaluating through the D.I.F. referral the grandmother in Puerto Rico, and I certainly think that would be the most appropriate placement also, ffl] I am ordering that the Department make every effort to place this child through the D.I.F. placement unit in Puerto Rico as soon as possible, assuming that it is appropriate.\u201d Moreover, \u201cIf the child could not for any reason be placed with the paternal grandmother, then certainly the Department should be looking at [another paternal relative, who lives in Carson.][<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] There is no reason with two relatives present that appear appropriate that this child should remain in foster care.\u201d The court specifically ordered the Department to evaluate the paternal grandmother in Puerto Rico \u201cforthwith.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1167-8\">Over parents\u2019 objections and after denial of their request for a hearing on the reasonableness of the reunification services, reunification services were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1384\">*1384</page-number>terminated. The court found the present placement was appropriate and ordered that the paternal grandmother first and then the paternal aunt be evaluated forthwith for placement. Moreover, the court decided that the Department had the discretion to release the Minor to any appropriate relative. The matter was continued for a permanent plan hearing scheduled for December 8, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-4\">By the time of the December 8, 1999, hearing, the Department recommended termination of parental rights and that the Department proceed with adoption planning.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The section 366.26 hearing report noted that the paternal grandmother had returned to Puerto Rico. The likelihood of adoption was reported to be \u201cexcellent\u201d by either the paternal grandmother, paternal uncle, or foster mother. The grandmother, who was unknown to the Department before July 1999, planned to adopt the Minor.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> She was \u201chighly motivated in gaining custody and adoption\u201d and stated the child \u201cis of her blood, and needs to be in a family home, not a [stranger\u2019s] foster home.\u201d The grandmother had called frequently from Puerto Rico as to the status of the home study and transfer of the child to her custody. However, despite her calls to the Puerto Rican Children Services, the home study report from Puerto Rico had not yet been received, possibly due to the \u201cfrequent closure of government offices due to the large number of hurricanes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-5\">The foster mother still wanted to adopt. The Minor was \u201chappy when foster mother reentered the room\u201d and there was \u201ca good bonding\u201d with the foster mother, who reported that the Minor continued to get sick regularly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-6\">A different referee conducted the December 8, 1999, hearing. Mother and Father both appeared. The paternal grandmother and a paternal aunt were present. Counsel for the Minor asked for a continuance, stating that the report was not adequate for the section 366.26 hearing. She believed \u201cthere was a misunderstanding by the Department\u201d regarding placement of the child in Puerto Rico and \u201cit was not the intention of the court and, in fact, the code requires that preference by given to the current caretaker of the child. Those individuals do wish to adopt this child, and they must be considered first, under the code.\u201d Counsel for the Department agreed that a supplemental report was in order and stated \u201cwe did do an evaluation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1385\">*1385</page-number>foster home and found that when we were recommending placement with the foster mother, it is just not contained in today\u2019s report.\u201d Because of the misunderstanding, the Department also asked the matter be put over for a supplemental report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-5\">Counsel for Father asked that family \u201cbe given priority and especially in this case where tremendous efforts have already been made in that regard by the grandmother in Puerto Rico. She has tried to move mountains to make this happen and has been in regular contact with the Department here . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-6\">The Department was to continue evaluating the home of the grandmother in Puerto Rico, not place the Minor there, and was to prepare a report addressing the feasibility of adoption by the foster mother as well as the DIF (Desarrollo Infantil Familiar) update. The court ordered the Minor not to be moved absent prior order of the court unless there was an emergency. A request to approve a family vacation in Mexico with the foster parents was denied without prejudice to bringing in medical evidence that the trip would be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-7\">On December 14, 1999, there was a walk-on request for the Minor to accompany the foster parents on a holiday visit to Mexico. A report was prepared on the feasibility of taking the Minor on vacation to Mexico. The Department recommended against the trip, given Minor\u2019s prior medical assessments and fragility, even though two doctors had cleared the travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-8\">Commissioner Losnick again presided on December 14, 1999. Grandmother was present. Over objection of the Department, Father, and Mother, the vacation request was granted.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Department\u2019s request for a stay of the visit to Mexico was also denied. The court further ordered that the paternal grandmother could visit the Minor as often as possible while she was in Los Angeles.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1169-9\">A supplemental section 366.26 report was prepared for February 1, 2000, when the Minor was 13 months old. There had been no participation by the parents,, so termination of parental rights was recommended. The report indicated that, fortunately for the Minor, there were several prospective adoptive parents. The paternal grandmother had been \u201canticipating the placement of the Minor with her since her first contact with this CSW in July 1999 when the international placement referral was made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1386\">*1386</page-number>A paternal uncle, Manuel P. and his wife, Aleida, were also evaluated. They are the relatives who, along with the Department, are appellants in the matter before us. The uncle, 36 years old, has a bachelor\u2019s degree in criminal justice and has been employed for 11 years with the police in Puerto Rico. His wife was in the fourth year of criminal justice studies and has been employed as a secretary. They do not have a child and are both receptive to adopting the Minor. \u201cThey feel they can offer the Minor a home within his family Puerto Rican tradition. Also, they are resolved to raise the child within their union as they have no other children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-4\">The DIF report on the paternal relatives was attached to the report but had. not yet been translated. The court was informed that the report favored adoption with the paternal uncle \u201cas he provides more resources, larger home and means to provide for the medical care for the minor.\u201d The CSW could not reach the uncle as the telephone had been disconnected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-5\">Furthermore, the foster parents were evaluated. They are a licensed foster home. Mr. S., bom in 1953, in Mexico, was the fifth of seven children; he attended school until the ninth grade in Mexico, attended an English training school in California, and was employed for 11 years as a missile assembly operator. Mrs. S., also bom in Mexico, was the ninth of nine children and attended school until the 11th grade. They came from the same town, knew each other as youths, and married in Mexico when he was 24 and she was 23 years old. She stopped outside employment in 1992. Their natural children are a 21-year-old son and 15-year-old daughter, both of whom live at home and attend school. They adopted now five-year-old Carrie S. The family has bonded with the Minor \u201cimmensely\u201d and has given him \u201cmore than adequate care and love.\u201d The siblings refer to the Minor, who has been in their home since he was two weeks old, as their brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-6\">A status review hearing report was prepared for the February 1, 2000, hearing. The Minor reportedly \u201ccontinued to receive excellent care at the home of his foster parents.\u201d He \u201cappeared to be happy and thriving in his placement.\u201d The trip to Mexico was cancelled \u201cdue to extended family problems and Mrs. [S.] breaking her big toe.\u201d A copy of the home study from Puerto Rico was received on January 14, 2000, in Spanish; it had not yet been translated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-7\">The pediatric rehabilitation department at Miller Children\u2019s Hospital submitted a report based on a December 9, 1999, evaluation. The Minor was doing well, had made great progress, and his foster mother \u201cappears very devoted to him . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1387\">*1387</page-number>At the hearing on February 1, 2000, the juvenile court terminated parental rights. Moreover, the court found it likely the Minor would be adopted. The court ordered that the Minor was not to be moved without prior order of the court and asked for a report for the next hearing to include the date of finalization of adoption hearing. Moreover, the court viewed a photograph of the Minor and stated he looked \u201cquite healthy and happy to me. Though we were given information earlier in his life that he was frail, he does not appear to be frail in that picture.\u201d Father\u2019s counsel added, \u201cI know that the court does not have the authority to choose the adoptive family, but for the record, it is Father\u2019s wish that his mother, the paternal grandmother, be the person to adopt this child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-5\">Grandmother Maria P. in propria persona filed a section 388 petition on April 26, 2000. She sought to modify foster care \u201cbecause he is my grandson and love him and I know I can take good care of him.\u201d Petitioner sought a hearing on the petition. The court denied the petition in that \u201cparental rights have been terminated and petition fails to show a change of circumstances\u201d and \u201con the ground that it does not appear that the best interests of the child(ren) may be promoted by the proposed change of order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-6\">On about June 21, 2000, there was a walk-on request for curtailment of visits by the paternal grandmother and other parties. On May 30, 2000, counsel for the foster parents had written to the Department stating a social worker had visited the foster mother and \u201ctold her that the minor will most likely be moved to the home of his biological grandmother in Puerto Rico.\u201d On July 21, 2000, the court granted the walk-on request for modification of visits and, over the Department\u2019s objections, ordered there be no visits for any birth relatives for the child until the next hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-7\">On August 1, 2000, the date for the next scheduled hearing, the foster parents filed a motion for de facto standing/status. The foster mother\u2019s declaration detailed her care for the Minor, her desire to pursue adoption, and the infrequency of visits by the paternal relatives. The Minor\u2019s pediatrician attested to the \u201cstrong emotional bond and affection\u201d between the Minor and his foster mother and opined that separating the Minor from the foster family would be against his best interest and injurious and detrimental to the Minor\u2019s well-being and development.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-8\">The CSW\u2019s report for August 1, 2000, recommended the Minor be placed with the paternal uncle, Manuel P., and his wife, Aledia, and requested authorization for the Minor to accompany the paternal family to Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1388\">*1388</page-number>The paternal relatives had visited twice in July 1999, once in August 1999, once in July 2000, and were scheduled for a visit on July 24, 2000.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The paternal uncle, his wife, and the grandmother traveled from Puerto Rico in May 2000, but a visit with the Minor was not arranged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-4\">However, the report indicated that the Minor continued \u201cto receive excellent care from his foster parents . . . and has a close relationship with the [foster] family.\u201d Moreover, the CSW observed the Minor \u201cconstantly hugging [the foster mother] during the home visits.\u201d He was still receiving weekly in-home physical therapy for development of his motor skills. Home studies were being completed for both the foster family and the paternal grandmother, uncle, and aunt, all of whom wanted to adopt the Minor. The aunt and uncle stated that \u201cHarry\u2019s arrival to their home would be the best blessing.\u201d The foster mother stated she \u201cloves Harry and wants to adopt him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-5\">At the August 1, 2000, hearing, given the opposition to both motions, the court asked for response and reply briefs on the motions filed by the foster parents and the paternal uncle to be de facto parents. The paternal aunt, uncle and grandmother were permitted at least two visits with the Minor, with the foster parents and the social worker, if desired, present. The court specified that the child should be allowed to play and sit without coercion or cajoling. The matter was continued to September 18, 2000, for a hearing on the motions and to address Minor\u2019s placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-6\">The paternal uncle filed a section 388 petition on August 7, 2000. He declared that he and his wife wanted visitation with the Minor pending further hearing and wanted the Minor to visit in Puerto Rico. He and his wife were desirous of adopting the child but were informed the foster mother opposed the adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-7\">The Department filed a brief stating it was not opposed to the de facto parental status motion of the foster parents or the section 388 motion filed by the paternal relatives. In addition, the Department sought an order permitting placement of the Minor with his paternal relatives for adoptive placement. As it does on appeal, citing section 366.26, subdivision (j), and <em>Department of Social Services </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 721, 734-735 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 239] <em>(Theodore D.), </em>the Department argued it has the authority to replace a child absent a showing that the Department has abused its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1389\">*1389</page-number>discretion. Furthermore, it argued that placement of the Minor with his paternal relatives, who had maintained constant contact and a request for adoption, served the Minor\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-5\">Minor\u2019s counsel argued that the Department\u2019s authority to place children for adoption is not absolute; that the Minor is bonded to his foster family, and the current placement is appropriate. Relying on section 366.26, subdivision (k), the Minor\u2019s counsel asked the court to order the Department to process the application of the foster parents to adopt the Minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-6\">The CSW\u2019s report for September 18, 2000, recommended that the Minor be placed with the paternal uncle and his wife. Furthermore, the Department requested authorization for the Minor to accompany the relatives to Puerto Rico, with a one-way airline ticket for the Minor. The paternal relatives had visited the Minor three times in August 2000.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although there were some transportation problems, the visits \u201cwent well\u201d and the paternal uncles, aunt and paternal grandmother \u201ccontinued to demonstrate a commitment in adopting their relative child.\u201d The aunt is infertile, loves children, and this adoption \u201crepresents a dream come true for her and her husband, and possibly the only opportunity to become parents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-7\">The report also stated that the Minor had been in the foster home since he was an infant and \u201chas a close relationship with the [foster] family,\u201d who still wish to adopt him. The foster parents had provided the Minor \u201cwith a nurturing home environment.\u201d The foster mother stated she loves the Minor and wants to adopt him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-8\">The foster parents and all the paternal relatives were present at the September 18, 2000, hearing. The court started \u201cby indicating . . . this is probably one of the more difficult types of cases that this court has to decide. These are very delicate issues. The circumstances are unfortunate, frankly, in the way that the relatives found out about Harry and the fact that this child was placed with the [S.\u2019s] early in his life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-9\">The court granted the foster parents\u2019 de facto parent motion. The parties then argued the issue of placement, with the Department contending that, absent an abuse of discretion, where a child will be placed prior to adoption is \u201cwithin the purview and exclusive control of the Department . . . .\u201d Furthermore, it would not be an abuse of discretion to place the child with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1390\">*1390</page-number>paternal aunt and uncle who have requested adoption from an early stage, have visited Los Angeles from Puerto Rico at their own expense to visit the boy, and through no fault of theirs but because of reasons beyond their control have been unable to claim custody of the Minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-4\">Counsel for the foster parents argued that concession of their de facto parent status admitted they are the psychological parents of the Minor and in effect conceded that any change in the current status \u201cwould necessarily be disruptive to Harry\u2019s life.\u201d While agreeing \u201cin the abstract\u201d that the abuse of discretion standard applied, counsel did not concede it was the only standard that applied. Instead, when the Legislature decided that following termination of parental rights the court was not to look from the standpoint of the parents, it also should not look from the standpoint of other relatives. Citing section 366.26, subdivision (k), counsel argued that the caretaker has a \u201chead start\u201d in the adoptive process and should be permitted that leg up as \u201cthe people who have demonstrated love, concern, compassion, daily care, control, and custody of that child.\u201d Furthermore, stating it was \u201cunfortunate\u201d the Department did not act quickly and the family members waited so that \u201cso much time has passed,\u201d counsel argued it would be an abuse of authority to disrupt Harry\u2019s life from the only family he has known.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-5\">Counsel for the paternal aunt and uncle argued that they came forward over a year ago and have complied with everything the Department has asked them to do. For whatever reason, the Department did not get the Minor on the plane to Puerto Rico, but that was not the fault of the paternal relatives. The Minor has done well with the P.\u2019s when he has been with him, and counsel offered to produce testimony about that relationship. Moreover, the paternal grandmother is also available to provide care.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-6\">Counsel for the Minor argued that the Department could have placed the Minor with the relative in Puerto Rico very easily early on but did not choose to do so. Such a placement could have been made when reunification services were terminated in mid-1999. In the meantime, the Minor continued to be in a home with good people who have cared for him. Finally, the issue was a legal one for the court, and section 366.26, subdivision (k), mandates a preference for the foster parents who have cared for the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-7\">The Department responded that the Department could not have placed the child with the paternal relatives until an Interstate Compact for Placement of Children was completed, which did not occur until January 2000, just prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1391\">*1391</page-number>to the section 366.26 hearing where parental rights were terminated.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Moreover, there is a familial preference from the detention until the section 366.26 termination of parental rights, and then the Department has the exclusive control unless it is being arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-5\">In explaining its decision, the court stated it had no reason to believe that either the foster parents or the paternal relatives \u201care not sincere, good, well-intentioned families, both of whom want to provide a stable environment and family for this child. [^] [T]his case is not about whether the [S.\u2019s] or the [P.\u2019s] would be better parents. I will take it for granted that each of you . . . would be excellent parents. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re here for today.\u201d Moreover, had the paternal family known about the child, \u201cthey would have stepped forward even sooner. These are very unfortunate circumstances, frankly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-6\">The court noted that one could not seriously argue that a child is not impacted from a change of placement at 18 months. The court agreed with the statutory interpretation that section 366.26, subdivision (k), indicates a preference for the caretakers. \u201cThere are innumerable good reasons for that. In this particular case the [foster parents] had this child placed with them at birth. They are the parents, as far as this child is concerned. The court does not see a reason why they couldn\u2019t adopt this child.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-7\">\u201cThe court did make an order at [the Minor\u2019s counsel\u2019s] suggestion over the Department\u2019s objection that the child not be moved without prior court order. I will, frankly, tell you, and I will through the record of the appellate court that the reason I make those orders not to move children without my further approval is the very nature of this case which is when children are moved from people who had them placed with them with the intention and hope and dream and support of adopting, and the Department moves the children to another placement, be it a relative or not a relative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-8\">The section 388 petition filed August 7, 2000, was denied. In addition, the court ordered the Minor was not to be replaced into any other home or moved without prior court order from the home of the foster family. Adoption was to remain the plan. The court allowed visits with the paternal relatives in the days they would be in town and suggested that \u201cshould the adoption go forward, that the [relatives] get to be a part of the child\u2019s life.\u201d However, the court would not order the visits to be outside the presence of the foster parents. The report for the next hearing was to include the date set for finalization of adoption hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1392\">*1392</page-number>The Department, which had filed a rehearing motion, withdrew that motion, stating the withdrawal was \u201cnot to be construed as a waiver of any and all appellate\u201d or other rights. On November 14, 2000, the Department filed a notice of appeal from the juvenile court\u2019s \u201corder of September 18, 2000.\u201d Represented by a new attorney, the paternal aunt and uncle filed a notice of appeal from the \u201cdenial of the 388 petition on Sept. 18, 2000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-4\">\n<em>Postappeal proceedings in the juvenile court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-5\">As referenced in the Department\u2019s reply brief and in its opposition to Minor\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal and remand for further proceedings in the juvenile court, the Department filed a section 388 petition on June 6, 2001. Responding to the court\u2019s order of February 10, 2000, that the Minor not be moved without prior order of the court, the Department asked that that order be changed and that the Department should be allowed the discretion to suitably place the Minor with the paternal aunt and uncle as prospective adoptive parents. This request was made in light of the May 15, 2001, denial of the home study for the foster parents and the recommendation by the adoption staff that the Minor should be placed with his paternal aunt and uncle, with the goal of adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-6\">According to the exhibits attached to the Department\u2019s papers, the foster parents were informed by letter that the Department was \u201cunable to approve you as an adoptive applicant for the minor . . . based, on but not limited to the following information; you are not allowing this child to reach his developmental milestones. For example, after reviewing the case notes, there were recommendations made by the Regional Center when Harry was 23 months of age, that a pre-school program is needed for him to address his cognitive and language delays. You were not willing to follow the Regional Center recommendations, therefore the minor\u2019s delayed language skills and socialization skills have not been addressed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-7\">In addition, though the Minor\u2019s \u201cprimary physician states that he is a normal healthy child,\u201d the Department was concerned that the Minor \u201chad an excessive amount of medical appointments that resulted in many dosages of medicine and antibiotics. For example, during this first year of life, eight different doctors saw Harry at four different offices. While the majority of the visits were to Dr. Takla or his associates, doctors in South Gate and Montebello also saw Harry. Antibiotics were prescribed at least three times and he was seen in the Emergency Room twice, for a total of 25 visits. [f] In Harry\u2019s second year of life, in a fourteen-month period, Harry was seen 31 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1393\">*1393</page-number>times by Dr. Venegas and was taken to the Emergency Room five times. He was given antibiotics at least ten times. [|] These were 33 visits in his 2nd year of life, five Emergency Room visits. The current total of medical appointment for Harry (who is only 27 months of age) has been at least 60 visits and 7 Emergency Room visits. The doctor is seeing Harry more frequently at this age, than when he was an infant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">The Department concluded from this pattern \u201cthat a number of Harry\u2019s illness or doctor\u2019s visits were exaggerated to prevent visits with his relatives, [f] The above concerns raise questions as to whether or not your home is the best environment for this minor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-6\">An ex parte application filed by the Department, dated May 30, 2001, outlined in detail the foster parents\u2019 alleged obstruction of visitation by the paternal aunt and uncle following a March 19, 2001, statement by the juvenile court giving the Department discretion to arrange such visits, including overnight visits. The CSW\u2019s interviews with the Minor\u2019s pediatrician, the hospital and the public health nurse were included. His pediatrician thought Puerto Rico \u201cwill be great for Harry\u201d and was surprised at the medications given by other doctors and the length of the foster mother\u2019s administration of an antibiotic he had prescribed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1177-7\">Further, the foster mother had objected to further visitation with paternal siblings in San Pedro after a December 1999 visit, saying they \u201cwere too wild and that \u2018my home is not a kindergarten.\u2019 \u201d Visits in April and May 2001 with those siblings went well when supervised by the paternal aunt and uncle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-8\">There were several specific instances where the foster parents reportedly obstructed visits with the paternal relatives, one in which the foster father was \u201cspitting mad\u201d and shoved the child at the CSW. There were angry objections to an unannounced visit by the CSW, who saw that the Minor was healthy and relaxed despite reports by the foster family and their attorney that he was \u201cbecoming increasingly sick with each visit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-9\">On May 18, 2001, the foster parents appealed the Department\u2019s decision to deny the adoptive home study and requested an immediate hearing. They argued that the CSW \u201cwas predetermined to deny the [S.\u2019s] adoption home study.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1394\">*1394</page-number>Contentions on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\">The paternal aunt and uncle contend: 1. They have standing to appeal the denial of their section 388 petition since they are aggrieved by the court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> 2. The court erred in denying placement with them since they had an approved home study and the Department recommended the Minor be placed with them. 3. Notwithstanding section 366.26, subdivision (k), the application of the foster parents is not required to be granted by the court merely because the child has lived in that home since birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">The Department contends: 1. The juvenile court\u2019s only role should have been to review the Department\u2019s placement decision for an abuse of discretion. 2. The Minor may be placed with paternal uncle Manuel P. within the guidelines set forth in section 366.26, subdivision (k).</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-6\">Respondent foster parents contend: 1. The juvenile court appropriately ordered that the Minor not be removed from his de facto parent placement. 2. The section 388 petition was properly denied. 3. Application of section 366.26, subdivision (j), to the extent it grants the Department complete discretion concerning a minor\u2019s placement without judicial oversight, is inconsistent with public policy and this state\u2019s expressed position that changes of placement should be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-7\">The Minor filed a letter brief and request for dismissal arguing that postbriefing occurrences, primarily the Department\u2019s denial of the foster family\u2019s home study for adoption and the juvenile court\u2019s consideration of a section 730 evaluation to address harm to Harry by a move from his family, make dismissal of the appeal and remand to conduct a hearing on the Minor\u2019s best interests would be preferable to considering this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-8\">The Department opposed the motion to dismiss and/or remand. As discussed above, in its opposition the Department attached the section 388 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1395\">*1395</page-number>petition it filed June 6, 2001, and supporting papers. The superior court file, with which we have augmented the record on appeal, states that the motion was denied on June 12, 2001, the written order stating that \u201cthis matter and issue is currently before the court of appeals [jzc].\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">This division denied the motion to dismiss and remand on June 20, 2001.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1179-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-7\">1. <em>Appellants have standing, and this appeal is not an impermissible collateral attack on the April 27, 2000, order.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1179-9\">Preliminarily, respondents contend that the paternal aunt and uncle\u2019s section 388 petition, from the denial of which their appeal is taken, cannot properly seek review of the placement because the petition was more limited in its request. In addition, respondents argue that the Department\u2019s appeal is an impermissible collateral attack on the April 27, 2000, order and that the Department should not be able to seek review by appealing the September 18 order. Although the paternal relatives\u2019 appeal must be reviewed as a denial of a section 388 petition, many of the issues presented may be raised. In any event, the Department\u2019s appeal is timely and appropriate given the changing circumstances presented at each hearing in the juvenile court. (See \u00a7 395; <em>In re Melvin A. </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1243, 1250-1251 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 844] [postdispositional orders are separately appealable and must be appealed within 60 days].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-10\">2. <em>Interaction of the applicable statutes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1179-11\">In the case at bench, the Department recommended adoption by the Minor\u2019s paternal aunt and uncle in Puerto Rico. The court acknowledged that the paternal aunt and uncle were appropriate and made no findings as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1396\">*1396</page-number>whether the Department had abused its discretion in making its decision. Nevertheless, for reasons set forth above, the juvenile court ordered the Minor placed with his foster parents. The parties argue about the application of various statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">Appellants rely in large part on subdivision (j) of section 366.26, which provides: \u201c(j) If the court, by order or judgment declares the child free from the custody and control of both parents, or one parent if the other does not have custody and control, the court shall at the same time order the child referred to the State Department of Social Services or a licensed adoption agency for adoptive placement by the agency. However, no petition for adoption may be granted until the appellate rights of the natural parents have been exhausted. The State Department of Social Services or licensed adoption agency <em>shall be responsible for the custody and supervision of the child and shall be entitled to the exclusive care and control of the child at all times until a petition for adoption is granted. </em>With the consent of the agency, the court may appoint a guardian of the child, who shall serve until the child is adopted.\u201d (Italics added.) Appellants point out that, had Manuel and Aledia P. lived in California, the Minor would likely have been placed with them long before the hearing in February 2000. (See \u00a7 361.3 [preference for placement with relative when child is removed from the physical custody of parents].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">Respondents rely heavily on subdivision (k) of section 366.26, which they contend affords foster parents a preference over all others who attempt to disturb that relationship. Subdivision (k) provides: <em>\u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law, </em>the application of any person who, as a relative caretaker <em>or foster parent, has cared for a dependent child for whom the court has approved a permanent plan for adoption, </em>or who has been freed for adoption, <em>shall be given preference </em>with respect to that child over all other applications for adoptive placement <em>if the agency making the placement determines that the child has substantial emotional ties to the relative caretaker or foster parent and removal from the relative caretaker or foster parent would be seriously detrimental to the child\u2019s emotional well-being, </em>[f] As used in this subdivision, \u2018preference\u2019 means that the application shall be processed and, <em>if satisfactory, </em>the family study shall be completed before the processing of the application of any other person for the adoptive placement of the child.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The statute gives the caretaker or foster parent preference in that \u201cif satisfactory, the family study shall be completed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1397\">*1397</page-number>before the processing of the application of any other person for the adoptive placement of the child.\u201d (\u00a7 366.26, subd. (k).) That language gives preference in time for processing the application but does not necessarily mandate that other applications will not also be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">Case authority supports appellants\u2019 view that, absent an abuse of discretion, the Legislature has given the power to the Department, not the court, to decide where a child should be placed after parental rights are terminated and pending adoption. <em>(Theodore D., supra, </em>58 Cal.App.4th 721, 724-725, 733-734 [\u201cAbsent a showing that DSS\u2019s placement decision is patently absurd or unquestionably not in the minor\u2019s best interests, the court may not interfere and disapprove of the minor\u2019s placement.\u201d]; accord, <em>Los Angeles County Dept. of Children etc. Services </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1, 10-11 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 369].)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">The court in <em>Theodore D., supra, </em>58 Cal.App.4th 721, 736, distinguished <em>C.V.C. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1973) 29 Cal.App.3d 909, 918 [106 Cal.Rptr. 123], decided decades before under different statutes, and where the children were removed from the home of prospective adoptive parents, not the case in <em>Theodore D. </em>The court in <em>C.V.C., supra, </em>29 Cal.App.3d 909, 918-919, concluded that prospective adoptive parents were entitled to a trial de novo in superior court before a child was removed from their home and were entitled to judicial review of the agency\u2019s decision using the independent judgment standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\"><em>In re Stephanie M., supra, 7 </em>Cal.4th 295, reversed a decision of the Court of Appeal which would have favored a Mexican grandmother over the child\u2019s foster parents. Our Supreme Court upheld the juvenile court\u2019s determination on the best interest of the child and held its determination should \u201cnot be disturbed on appeal unless an abuse of discretion is clearly established. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 318.) The Department in <em>In re Stephanie M. </em>agreed with the placement decision of the juvenile court and along with the minor petitioned for review <em>(id. </em>at p. 302), so the Supreme Court did not need to discuss or decide the issue before us, where the Department and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1398\">*1398</page-number>juvenile court differ as to a placement decision. Similarly, in <em>In re Sarah S. </em>(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 274, 279 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 503], the Department and the juvenile court agreed that the proper placement was with the foster parents who had been caring for the child.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We agree with the line of cases that, absent an abuse of discretion, gives the Department authority for placement at this stage in the proceedings. The Department has been given the resources for investigation and evaluation of the placement decision. The juvenile court\u2019s role is to decide if there was an abuse of discretion in the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">Appellants argue there was no abuse of discretion in the Department\u2019s choice of adoptive parents for the Minor. <em>(In re Mark V. </em>(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 754, 759 [225 Cal.Rptr. 460]; <em>Los Angeles County Dept. of Children etc. Services v. Superior Court, supra, </em>62 Cal.App.4th 1, 10, 12.) To be sure, the juvenile court agreed that the paternal relatives would give the Minor a wonderful home. The Department argues that in such a case, where the Department\u2019s decision was not arbitrary, capricious or absurd, the juvenile court exceeded its own powers as limited by statutory and case law and its judgment should be overturned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-5\">Respondents counter that the Department is statutorily and constitutionally limited in exercising its discretion to remove a child from a foster parents\u2019 home. (\u00a7 366.26, subd. (k); see <em>C.V.C. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>29 Cal.App.3d 909, 915-918.) [same court as later <em>Theodore D., </em>58 Cal.App.4th at pp. 724, 731-733].) Moreover, in choosing the paternal relatives instead of the foster parents, the respondents contend that, under the facts of this case, the Department abused its discretion, another ground for affirming the decision of the juvenile court.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1182-6\">Given the applicable law, we must reverse the juvenile court\u2019s decision because it did not give the appropriate weight to the Department\u2019s recommendation. We remand for the juvenile court\u2019s consideration of whether the Department abused its discretion in making the recommendation. However, significant time has elapsed and circumstances may well have changed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1399\">*1399</page-number>either or both families seeking to adopt the Minor and perhaps even in the Department\u2019s recommendation in light of any changing events. We, like all the parties to this appeal, are most concerned with the best interests of the Minor, a child loved by two families, only one of which can adopt him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">We shall therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings in the juvenile court. In reviewing the decision of the Department, the juvenile court may consider circumstances that have arisen following the filing of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-7\">The orders appealed from are reversed, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-8\">Boren, P.

Additionally, the recommendation is based on Minor\u2019s fragile health.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1168-8\">The grandmother was described as a 53-year-old Puerto Rican national, a divorced mother of six, with one adult son living with her.

This amount of money does not include the expenses to retain an attorney.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1175-9\">The court agreed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1177-10\">However, a letter from Dr. Venegas allegedly left out many of the details of their conversation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1178-9\">Their standing is not contested by respondents to the extent that they are aggrieved by the denial of the section 388 petition. However, as respondents point out, their section 388 petition asked only that the court\u2019s order staying visitation be lifted and that the relatives be permitted a visit with the minor in Puerto Rico. There was no request for adoptive placement made in the section 388 petition from which the paternal relatives appeal. Given the visitation granted on September 18, 2000, respondents argue that the paternal relatives\u2019 appeal from the section 388 petition is \u201centirely without merit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-10\">Furthermore, respondents argue that the Department is prevented from seeking review of the April 27, 2000, order denying the requested change of placement because, although a party aggrieved by that order, it neither petitioned for a writ or appealed the April order.

Once the juvenile court determines that reunification efforts have failed, the only statutory preference in the adoption process is for a \u2018relative caretaker or foster parent\u2019 as provided in subdivision (k) of section 366.26.\u201d Because the Department and the court agreed on placement, there was no need to discuss subdivision (j).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1182-8\">Both sides argue that their position is in the child\u2019s best interest, which must always be considered. <em>(In re Sarah S., supra, </em>43 Cal.App.4th 274, 511, fn. 13; <em>In re Stephanie M., supra, </em>7 Cal.4th 295, 320.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
