In case No. B145004, the petitioner, George Rivera, seeks a writ of mandate vacating a trial court order granting the motion of the real party in interest, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>PacifiCare of California (PacifiCare), to compel arbitration in accordance with the plan\u2019s arbitration clause. In case No. B142321, PacifiCare has appealed the order of the trial court denying PacifiCare\u2019s motion to compel arbitration pursuant to the same clause. The respondent, Lisa Ellen Smith, makes the identical arguments in support of the trial court\u2019s order in her case as does Rivera in his.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">As a part of its regulation of health care service plans, California imposes certain disclosure requirements as a predicate to the enforcement of arbitration clauses contained in plan subscriber agreements. Health and Safety Code section 1363.1 (section 1363.1) (see fn. 15, <em>post) </em>provides that a binding arbitration clause in a health care service plan must incorporate various disclosures, including a clear statement of \u201cwhether the subscriber or enrollee is waiving his or her right to a jury trial . . . .\u201d The waiver language must be substantially in the wording provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 1295, subdivision (a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and must appear immediately before the signature line for the individual enrolling in the plan. (\u00a7 1363.1, subds. (c), (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">These cases present the question whether the failure to comply with the mandate of section 1363.1 will invalidate the right of PacifiCare to enforce the arbitration clause in its subscriber agreements with Smith and Rivera. Although it has been held that the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 et seq.) (hereafter FAA) preempt section 1363.1 and prevent its enforcement, what has not yet been decided by a California court, is whether the McCarran-Ferguson Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1011 et seq.) (hereafter McCarranFerguson) overrides the FAA and precludes its preemptive impact on section 1363.1. This is a significant issue, the resolution of which will turn on whether section 1363.1 constitutes a regulation of the business of insurance within the meaning of McCarran-Ferguson.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">After a careful examination of the relevant authorities, we are persuaded that section 1363.1 does constitute such regulation and therefore, the FAA cannot preempt section 1363.1 and the latter\u2019s provisions must be enforced. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>As a result, we will grant the requested writ relief in case No. B145004 and will affirm the trial court\u2019s order in case No. B142321.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Factual and Procedural Background<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">As we summarize below, Rivera and Smith have each filed an action against PacifiCare seeking damages for injuries sustained as the result of PacifiCare\u2019s alleged failure to provide promised plan benefits, including the failure to timely authorize or extend needed treatment by health providers. In each case, PacifiCare responded to the complaints with a motion to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">1. <em>Rivera Background Facts (Case No. B145004)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">In May of 1999, Rivera was an employee of the County of Los Angeles (County). County had previously entered into a contract with PacifiCare to provide health insurance for its employees (referred to in the PacifiCare documents as members). The agreement between PacifiCare and County consists of a \u201cBusiness Agreement\u201d (signed by County)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and three forms of \u201csubscriber agreements\u201d depending on the coverage option selected by the member. All forms of the subscriber agreements contained an arbitration clause to which each member became bound upon his or her execution of the enrollment form.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, the evidence of coverage booklet (31 pages), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>provided to each member following enrollment, contained a further reference to the commitment to arbitrate any dispute.* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Following his enrollment in the PacifiCare plan, Rivera was diagnosed, on May 18, 1999, as suffering from a severe bacterial infection in his left foot. In the complaint he subsequently filed against PacifiCare, he alleged he was denied timely and proper treatment for this condition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He had to wait three days for authorization to see a specialist. By the time of that appointment his condition had progressed to gangrene, and the surgeon recommended, on May 21, 1999, that he be admitted to the hospital that day, and that the small toe on his left foot be amputated within 24 to 48 hours, after antibiotics had controlled the infection. However, the medical group exercising its delegated authority to make utilization management decisions for respondent PacifiCare refused to authorize an admission to the hospital. When he was reexamined two days later, his infection had spread.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">When Rivera\u2019s doctor learned, on May 23, 1999, that Rivera had not been admitted to the hospital as he had directed, he told Rivera to come to the hospital the next morning at 6:00 a.m. for admission and surgery on his foot. When Rivera arrived, however, he learned he was <em>not </em>on a list of patients whose admission had been authorized, and he was required to wait for hours. It turned out that Rivera\u2019s admission had not been authorized by a \u201chospitalist,\u201d a doctor employed by the participating medical group to coordinate hospital admissions and care. He was not seen by the hospitalist for another five hours. Because of the delay in admission, Rivera\u2019s surgery was not scheduled until the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>After one of Rivera\u2019s doctors told Rivera\u2019s wife that he should have had the surgery three days earlier, she insisted that the surgery go forward. The surgeon arrived at 7:00 p.m. and was displeased at having been summoned; however, when he saw how far the infection in Rivera\u2019s foot had progressed he scheduled the surgery immediately. The operation began at midnight. The infection had spread during the time Rivera had been waiting for care, so that instead of having only his small toe amputated, it was necessary to remove two toes and a portion of the foot. A week after the surgery, Rivera\u2019s surgeon referred him for hyperbaric oxygen treatment, a therapeutic technique used to promote healing in necrotic tissue. The surgeon noted in the chart that Rivera\u2019s need was \u201curgent.\u201d Once again, however, PacifiCare delayed authorization for the prescribed treatment. Unfortunately, because of such delay, the gangrene progressed, and Rivera\u2019s surgeon recommended an amputation of the entire foot, above the ankle. When Rivera arrived at the hospital at 6:00 a.m. on the scheduled day, he was again kept waiting for hours\u2014this time for an entire day\u2014because of the need for the plan\u2019s hospitalist to admit him.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Not surprisingly, Rivera claims to have suffered substantial physical and emotional damage as a result of such conduct. Thereafter, he filed this action against PacifiCare on May 11, 2000.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In his first amended complaint (in which he is joined by his spouse, Rita Rivera), filed on June 14, 2000, he alleged 14 causes of action.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">PacifiCare\u2019s response was to file a motion to compel arbitration. This was heard by the trial court on August 15, 2000, and the motion was granted. Rivera filed a petition for a writ of mandate on October 13, 2000. Following some delay occasioned by the filing of additional briefing both in support of and in opposition to the petition, we issued an order to show cause on March 15, 2001, and set the matter on calendar for hearing with the Smith appeal (case No. B142321).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>2. <em>Smith Background Facts (Case No. B142321)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Smith filed her complaint on October 26, 1999.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In that pleading, she alleged the factual basis for her claim against PacifiCare.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> She is the stepdaughter and dependent of Thomas S. Battle, an administrator for the Rim of the World Unified School District in Lake Arrowhead. As an employee of the school district, Battle had the option of enrolling in the health plan offered through the Southern California Schools Employee Benefits Association. Under this plan, he received the bulk of his health care coverage from the Blue Cross Plus Preferred Provider Plan. Mental health benefits, however, were derived solely from a supplemental health plan sponsored by PacifiCare and marketed as PacifiCare Behavioral Health of California (PBHC). Smith, as Battle\u2019s dependent, was also covered under this mental health plan. This plan has language compelling arbitration to resolve any disputes that may arise. Such language is substantially the same as we have already described with respect to the Rivera action. (See fn. 5, <em>ante.)</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Smith became suicidal in 1998 due to an uncontrolled major psychiatric depressive disorder, bulimia nervosa, and anorexia nervosa. In response, PacifiCare terminated her physician-recommended inpatient treatment after only six days and refused to authorize or pay for additional inpatient care even when Smith\u2019s condition deteriorated farther over the next two months. Such termination of the inpatient treatment appears to have been dictated by the terms of PBHC\u2019s plan. This plan offers to provide fall coverage for inpatient stays up to 30 days. However, members are limited to one inpatient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>stay per year, and <em>stays of less than five days do not count toward this limitation. </em>By terminating Smith\u2019s inpatient treatment only six days after her admission, PacifiCare effectively ensured that, regardless of the state of Smith\u2019s mental health, the inpatient benefits Smith received could be kept to the minimum. PacifiCare\u2019s actions also ensured that Smith would receive no further inpatient benefits from PacifiCare for the balance of the year.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">In filing her complaint, Smith, as did Rivera, sought substantial damages for the injuries she claimed to have sustained as the result of PacifiCare\u2019s alleged misconduct. PacifiCare responded to this complaint in the same manner as it did to the Rivera action. On December 15, 1999, it filed a petition to compel arbitration relying on the contractual provisions discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">On February 4, 2000, after reviewing the written arguments filed in support of and opposition to PacifiCare\u2019s petition, the trial court heard the argument of counsel and denied the petition. This is an appealable order (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1294; <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Companies </em>v. <em>Younesi </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 451, 456-457 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 671]) and PacifiCare filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">We thus have before us two different cases, involving substantially the same relevant factual circumstances, the same defendants, the same counsel on both sides and the same legal issue as to which two different trial judges reached the exact opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">Contentions of the Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">Rivera and Smith (hereafter collectively referred to as plaintiffs) contend as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-10\">1. PacifiCare is a health care service plan subject to the regulation of the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975 (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1340 et seq.) (Knox-Keene Act), including section 1363.1;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-11\">2. The arbitration clauses of the PacifiCare agreements which PacifiCare sought to enforce by its petitions to compel arbitration do not comply with the mandatory disclosure requirements of section 1363.1 and therefore (absent the preemption issues raised herein) are unenforceable as a matter of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-12\">3. Health care service plans such as PacifiCare\u2019s are engaged in the business of insurance and section 1363.1 is a state law that regulates the business of insurance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>4. McCarran-Ferguson exempts a state law that regulates insurance from preemption by any federal statute, the effect of which would \u201cimpair, invalidate or supercede\u201d such state law, <em>unless </em>the federal statute <em>\u201cspecifically relates to </em>insurance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\">5. The FAA would preempt and preclude the operation of section 1363.1, unless McCarran-Ferguson is applicable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">6. The FAA is a statute of general application and does <em>not </em>specifically relate to insurance; if the FAA were applied in either of these cases it would \u201cimpair, invalidate or supercede\u201d the operation of section 1363.1;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">7. Since the FAA cannot be applied without violating the mandate of McCarran-Ferguson, it cannot preempt section 1363.1; since the PacifiCare arbitration clauses do not comply with section 1363.1, PacifiCare is not entitled to enforce its demands for arbitration and its motions for such relief were improperly granted in the Rivera matter and properly denied in the Smith case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Of the seven points made by the plaintiffs in the above summarized contentions, <em>PacifiCare concedes that five are not disputed. </em>The only points of disagreement which PacifiCare has are with contention No. 3 and the conclusion expressed in contention No. 7. It is PacifiCare\u2019s position that health care service plans are <em>not </em>engaged in the business of insurance and section 1363.1 is <em>not </em>a statute which regulates insurance. If PacifiCare is correct, then McCarran-Ferguson cannot be applied in this matter to preclude the preemptive effect of the FAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">The problem presented by these consolidated matters is therefore both straightforward and focused; we must decide two questions. First, are health care service plans, such as PacifiCare\u2019s, engaged in the business of insurance? Second, is section 1363.1 a state law that regulates the business of insurance? We answer yes to both questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">1. <em>Applicable General Principles and Undisputed Matters</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">We begin our consideration of these questions by summarizing the factual matters and legal principles as to which there is no real dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>PacifiCare concedes that it is a licensed health care service plan.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Instead of purchasing individual or group health insurance, many persons and employers now contract with health maintenance organizations (HMO\u2019s) which, in turn, contract with health care providers (e.g., doctors, hospitals, medical groups, etc.) to provide actual health care services. (See, e.g., <em>Samura v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 1284, 1289 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 20].) \u201cBeginning in the late 1960\u2019s, insurers and others developed new models for health-care delivery, including HMOs. [Citation.] The defining feature of an HMO is receipt of a fixed fee for each patient enrolled under the terms of a contract to provide specified health care if needed. The HMO thus assumes the financial risk of providing the benefits promised: if a participant never gets sick, the HMO keeps the money regardless, and if a participant becomes expensively ill, the HMO is responsible for the treatment agreed upon even if its cost exceeds the participant\u2019s premiums.\u201d <em>(Pegram v. Herdrich </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 211] 218-219, 147 [120 S.Ct. 2143, 1249, 147 L.Ed.2d 164, 174-175].)</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">In California, health care service plans (or HMO\u2019s) are licensed and regulated by the Department of Managed Care under the Knox-Keene Act.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As already noted, one of the provisions of that act is section 1363.1.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The arbitration provisions of the PacifiCare agreements with the plaintiffs did not comply with the disclosure requirements of section 1363.1. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Essentially, the disclosures made in the agreements were not placed in the mandated juxtaposition with the enrollee\u2019s signature line and did not clearly disclose the scope of the arbitration as required by section 1363.1. PacifiCare does <em>not </em>dispute that there was a failure to comply with the requirements of section 1363.1. Instead, PacifiCare argues that such failure is irrelevant because section 1363.1 is preempted by the FAA and therefore does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">The FAA applies to any \u201ccontract evidencing a transaction involving commerce\u201d which contains an arbitration clause. (9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2.) Section 2 of the FAA provides that arbitration provisions shall be enforced, \u201csave upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, a state court may, without violating section 2, refuse to enforce an arbitration clause on the basis of \u201cgenerally applicable contract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability.\u201d <em>(Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto </em>(1996) 517 U.S. 681, 687 [116 S.Ct. 1652, 1656,134 L.Ed.2d 902, 909] <em>(Casarotto).) </em>Critically, however, a state court may not defeat an arbitration clause by applying state laws \u201capplicable <em>only </em>to arbitration provisions.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Thus, in <em>Casarotto, </em>the Supreme Court found that the FAA preempted a Montana law which had required an arbitration clause to be typed in underlined capital letters on the first page of any contract in order to be enforceable. <em>(Casarotto, supra, </em>517 U.S. 681, 683 [116 S.Ct. 1652, 1654].) Because the Montana law conditioned enforceability of the arbitration agreement \u201con compliance with a special notice requirement not applicable to contracts generally,\u201d it was preempted. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 687 [116 S.Ct. atp. 1656].)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The FAA would appear to apply to the PacifiCare agreements at issue here. First, the contract involves interstate commerce. In providing health services to enrollees, PacifiCare must, and does, contract with out-of-state entities. In addition, the agreement provides that PacifiCare will arrange for the provision of health services for enrollees, wherever they may travel, including out of state. These circumstances bring the PacifiCare agreements within the reach of the FAA. (See, e.g., <em>Summit Health, Ltd. v. Pinhas </em>(1991) 500 U.S. 322, 329 [111 S.Ct. 1842, 1847, 114 L.Ed.2d 366, 375] [Medicare provider that purchased out of state medicines and supplies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>engaged in interstate commerce for purposes of the Sherman Act]; <em>Toledo </em>v. <em>Kaiser Permanente Medical Group </em>(N.D.Cal. 1997) 987 F.Supp. 1174, 1180 [HMO contract concerned interstate commerce under FAA, where coverage provided for out-of-state injuries or illness and HMO obtained physicians and supplies from out of state].)</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Moreover, section 1363.1 is obviously a regulatory provision applicable <em>only </em>to arbitration provisions, not to contracts generally. As already noted, this is precisely what the FAA prohibits. Just as the Montana statute in <em>Casarotto </em>required that an arbitration provision contain particular language and be placed in a particular location in a contract, and hence was invalid under the FAA, so too, does section 1363.1 place restrictions on the manner in which an arbitration provision may be placed in a health care service contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Thus, in <em>Erickson v. Aetna Health Plans of California, Inc. </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 646 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 76], the court held that section 1363.1 was preempted by the FAA. Citing <em>Casarotto, </em>the <em>Erickson </em>court noted that section 1363.1 \u201cimposes on arbitration clauses in health care plans \u2018a special notice requirement not applicable to contracts generally,\u2019 \u201d and such \u201carbitration clauses must satisfy special requirements as to form and content which are not imposed on contracts generally.\u201d <em>(Erickson, supra, </em>at p. 652.) As a result, section 1363.1 \u201c \u2018 \u201ctakes its meaning precisely from the fact that a contract to arbitrate is at issue ...,\u2019\u201d and, consequently, conflicts with section 2 of the FAA.\u201d <em>(Erickson, supra, </em>at p. 652.) Therefore, PacifiCare argues, section 1363.1 is preempted by the FAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 response to this argument is that the FAA cannot preempt section 1363.1 because of the operation of McCarran-Ferguson.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">2. <em>McCarran-Ferguson</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Congress enacted McCarran-Ferguson in 1945.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It sets forth a policy declaration that it is in the public interest that the primary regulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>of the business of insurance be in the states, not in the national government. (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1011.) It was passed in response to a United States Supreme Court decision <em>(United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Assn. </em>(1944) 322 U.S. 533 [64 S.Ct. 1162, 88 L.Ed. 1440]), which held that the business of insurance was \u201ccommerce\u201d within the meaning of the commerce clause and therefore the business of insurance was subject to all federal laws, including those relating to antitrust. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 553 [64 S.Ct. at pp. 1173-1174].) This was a major change in the law. In 1869, the Supreme Court had held <em>(Paul v. Virginia </em>(1868) 75 U.S. (8 Wall.) 168, 183 [19 L.Ed. 357, 361]) that insurance was not \u201ccommerce\u201d and therefore was not subject to federal commerce clause statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">The clear purpose of McCarran-Ferguson was to abrogate this change and to ensure that the states would continue to enjoy broad authority in regulating the dealings between insurers and their policyholders. <em>(Cochran v. Paco, Inc. </em>(5th Cir. 1979) 606 F.2d 460, 462-463 [51 A.L.R.Fed 731].) As the Supreme Court itself later explained, \u201cThe McCarran-Ferguson Act was passed in reaction to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>South-Eastern Underwriters Assn., </em>322 U.S. 533[, <em>supra]. </em>Prior to that decision, it had been assumed, in the language of the leading case, that \u2018[i]ssuing a policy of insurance is not a transaction of commerce.\u2019 <em>Paul v. Virginia, </em>[75 U.S.] (8 Wall.) 168, 183[, <em>supra]. </em>Consequently, regulation of insurance transactions was thought to rest <em>exclusively </em>with the States. In <em>South-Eastern Underwriters, </em>this Court held that insurance transactions were subject to federal regulation under the Commerce Clause, and that the antitrust laws, in particular, were applicable to them. Congress reacted quickly. . . . The McCarran-Ferguson Act was the product of this concern. Its purpose was stated quite clearly in its first section; Congress declared that \u2018the continued regulation and taxation by the several States of the business of insurance is in the public interest.\u2019 59 Stat. 33 (1945), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1011. ... <em>[%] </em>... In context, however, it is relatively clear what problems Congress was dealing with. Under the regime of <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Virginia, supra, </em>States had a free hand in <em>regulating the dealings between insurers and their policyholders. </em>Their <em>negotiations, and the contract which resulted, </em>were not considered commerce and were, therefore, <em>left to state regulation. </em>The <em>South-Eastern Underwriters </em>decision threatened the continued supremacy of the States in this area. The McCarran-Ferguson Act was an attempt to turn back the clock, to assure that the <em>activities of insurance companies in dealing with their policyholders </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number><em>would remain subject to state regulation.\u201d (SEC </em>v. <em>National Securities, Inc. </em>(1969) 393 U.S. 453, 458-459 [89 S.Ct. 564, 567-568, 21 L.Ed.2d 668, 675-676] <em>(National Securities), </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Thus, there seems little question that Congress, by its passage of McCarran-Ferguson, \u201creturned to the states the plenary power to regulate the business of insurance that they had enjoyed prior to the <em>South-Eastern Underwriters </em>decision. If Congress intended to invoke its Commerce Clause powers to occupy part of the field of insurance regulation, it would expressly say so.\u201d <em>(Cochran </em>v. <em>Paco Inc., supra, </em>606 F.2d at p. 463, fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The mandate of McCarran-Ferguson appears to be both plain and clear. An act of Congress may not be construed to \u201cinvalidate, impair, or super-cede\u201d a state law enacted <em>\u201cfor the purpose of regulating the business of insurance\u201d </em>unless the federal act \u201cspecifically relates to the business of insurance.\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1012(b), italics added.)  There is no dispute between the parties that the application of the FAA would have the effect of invalidating, impairing and superseding the operation of section 1363.1; indeed, it would absolutely preclude its use to regulate the wording and organization of PacifiCare\u2019s arbitration clauses. Similarly, there is no argument that the FAA is a statute of <em>general application </em>which does <em>not specifically relate </em>to the business of insurance. Thus, in order for us to conclude that McCarran-Ferguson does preclude the application of the FAA in these consolidated cases we need only address the integrally related questions as to whether health care service plans, such as PacifiCare, are engaged in the business of insurance and whether section 1363.1 is a statute enacted \u201cfor the purpose of regulating the business of insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">3. <em>Health Care Service Plans Are Engaged in the Business of Insurance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">Statutes aimed at protecting or regulating the relationship between insurer and insured, directly or indirectly, are laws regulating the \u201cbusiness of insurance\u201d within the meaning of that phrase as it is used in McCarranFerguson. (Nat<em>ional Securities, supra, </em>393 U.S. 453, 459-460 [89 S.Ct. 564, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>568-569].) As the <em>National Securities </em>court emphasized, the focus of McCarran-Ferguson is upon the relationship between the insurer and its policyholders. <em>\u201cThe relationship between insurer and insured, the type of policy which could be issued, its reliability, interpretation, and enforcement\u2014these were the core of the \u2018business of </em>insurance.\u2019 Undoubtedly, other activities of insurance companies relate so closely to their status as reliable insurers that they too must be placed in the same class. But whatever the exact scope of the statutory term, it is clear where the focus was\u2014it was on the relationship between the insurance company and the policyholder.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 460 [89 S.Ct. at pp. 568-569], italics added.) \u201cCases interpreting the scope of the McCarran-Ferguson Act have identified three criteria relevant to determining whether a particular practice falls within that Act\u2019s reference to the \u2018business of insurance\u2019: <em>\u2018first, </em>whether the practice has the effect of transferring or spreading a policyholder\u2019s risk; <em>second, </em>whether the practice is an integral part of the policy relationship between the insurer and the insured; and <em>third, </em>whether the practice is limited to entities within the insurance industry.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Metropolitan Life Ins.

These cases, however, involved the scope of the antitrust immunity which was granted by the second clause of 15 Unied States Code section 1012(b). (See fn. 16, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">In <em>Royal Drug, </em>independent pharmacists brought an antitrust action against Blue Shield claiming that it was engaged in price-fixing of prescription drugs. The lawsuit attacked Blue Shield\u2019s use of \u201cPharmacy Agreements\u201d between it and any pharmacy in the state that wanted to participate in its program. Under the agreements, a Blue Shield insured would pay the pharmacy $2 for a prescription, and Blue Shield would reimburse the pharmacy for the actual cost of the drugs dispensed. The agreements essentially limited the participating pharmacy\u2019s profit on any prescription to $2. <em>(Royal Drug, supra, </em>440 U.S. 205, 209 [99 S.Ct. 1067, 1072].)</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The issue in <em>Royal Drug </em>was whether Blue Shield\u2019s conduct in entering into the Pharmacy Agreements was \u201cthe business of insurance\u201d and therefore exempt from the antitrust laws. <em>(Royal Drug, supra, </em>440 U.S. at p. 210 [99 S.Ct. at pp. 1072-1073].) The court held that the Pharmacy Agreements were not \u201cthe business of insurance\u201d under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>The court first noted that \u201cinsurance\u201d inherently involves the spreading of risk between the insurer and its insureds, and that the Pharmacy Agreements did not spread risk because they did not involve any contract between the insurer and its insured. Rather, Blue Shield assumed the risk providing its insureds with prescription drugs for $2, and the Pharmacy Agreements were simply the means of providing the promised benefit at a low cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">In the court\u2019s view, the Pharmacy Agreements were \u201cindistinguishable from countless other business arrangements that may be made by insurance companies to keep their costs low.\u201d <em>(Royal Drug, supra, </em>440 U.S. at p. 215 [99 S.Ct. at p. 1075].) Because of this, and because the agreements were between the insurer and entities outside of the insurance industry, the court held that McCarran-Ferguson did not protect the practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">In <em>Pireno, </em>a chiropractor challenged an insurer\u2019s use of a peer review panel to determine which claims for chiropractic care the insurer would pay. The insurer defended by claiming that the use of a peer review committee was exempt from the antitrust laws as part of the business of insurance. <em>(Pireno, supra, </em>458 U.S. 119, 122 [102 S.Ct. 3002, 3005].) The court held that the use of peer review to determine whether to pay claims was not the \u201cbusiness of insurance\u201d within the scope of McCarran-Ferguson, and hence not exempt from the antitrust laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\"><em>Pireno </em>distilled from <em>Royal Drug </em>the \u201cthree criteria relevant in determining whether <em>a particular practice </em>is part of the \u2018business of insurance\u2019 exempted from the antitrust laws by [15 United States Code section 1012(b)].\u201d <em>(Pireno, supra, </em>458 U.S. at p. 129 [102 S.Ct. at p. 3009], italics added.) \u201c[F]irst, whether the practice has the effect of transferring or spreading a policyholder\u2019s risk; second, whether the practice is an integral part of the policy relationship between the insurer and the insured; and third, whether the practice is limited to entities within the insurance industry.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics omitted.) In <em>Pireno, </em>however, the court cautioned that, \u201c[n]one of these criteria is necessarily determinative in itself.\u201d <em>(Pireno, supra, </em>458 U.S. at p. 129 [102 S.Ct. at p. 3009].)</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">Applying the criteria to the peer review practice, the court determined that the practice did not spread risk, since the transfer of risk occurred when the policy was issued, and the peer review process was \u201clogically and temporally unconnected to the transfer of risk.\u201d <em>(Pireno, supra, </em>458 U.S. at p. 130 [102 S.Ct. at p. 3009].) The court also determined that peer review did not involve an integral part of the policy relationship between the insurer and its insured, nor was it limited to entities within the insurance industry, since the chiropractors performing the review were neither insureds nor within the insurance industry. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 131-132 [102 S.Ct. at pp. 3009-3010].)</p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>In <em>Department of Treasury v.

[Citation.] This category necessarily encompasses more than just the \u2018business of insurance.\u2019 . . .

[T]he first clause of [15 United States Code section 1012(b)] was intended to further Congress\u2019 primary objective of granting the States broad regulatory authority over the business of insurance. The second clause accomplishes Congress\u2019 secondary goal, which was to carve out only a narrow exemption for \u2018the business of insurance\u2019 from the federal antitrust laws. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Fabe, supra, </em>508 U.S. at p. 505 [113 S.Ct. at p. 2210].) Thus, \u201c[t]here can be no doubt that the actual performance of an insurance contract falls within the \u2018business of insurance,\u2019 as we understood that phrase in <em>Pireno </em>and <em>Royal Drug. </em>To hold otherwise would be mere formalism. The Court\u2019s statement in <em>Pireno </em>that the \u2018transfer of risk from insured to insurer is effected by means of the contract between the parties . . . and ... is complete at the time that the contract is entered\u2019 [citation], presumes that the insurance contract in fact will be enforced. Without performance of the terms of the insurance policy, there is no risk transfer at all. Moreover, performance of an insurance contract also satisfies the remaining prongs of the <em>Pireno </em>test: It is central to the policy relationship between insurer and insured and is confined entirely to entities within the insurance industry.\u201d <em>(Fabe, supra, </em>508 U.S. at pp. 503-504 [113 S.Ct. at p. 2209].)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">As we pointed out earlier, HMO\u2019s or health care service plans, such as PacifiCare, are engaged in providing a service that is a substitute for what previously constituted health <em>insurance. </em>\u201cThe only distinction between an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>HMO . . . and a traditional insurer is that the HMO provides medical services directly, while a traditional insurer does so indirectly by paying for the service [citation], but this is a distinction without a difference. [Citations.] In the end, HMOs function the same way as a traditional health insurer. The policyholder pays a fee for a promise of medical services in the event that he should need them. It follows that HMOs ... are in the business of insurance.\u201d <em>(Washington Physicians Service Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Gregoire </em>(9th Cir. 1998) 147 F.3d 1039, 1045-1046.) Other courts have also reached the conclusion that HMO\u2019s <em>are engaged in the business of insurance. (Kentucky Assoc. of Health Plans, Inc. v. Nichols </em>(6th Cir. 2000) 227 F.3d 352, 364; <em>Corporate Health Ins., Inc. v. Texas Dept. of Ins. </em>(5th Cir. 2000) 215 F.3d 526, 538; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Humana, Inc. </em>(7th Cir. 1994) 24 F.3d 889, 892; <em>Ocean State Physicians Health Plan v. Blue Cross </em>(1st Cir. 1989) 883 F.2d 1101, 1107-1108.) We believe the reasoning of these cases is sound and we have no trouble also concluding that PacifiCare, as a health care service plan (or HMO), is engaged in the business of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Significantly, the Legislature has reached the same conclusion in a very public way. It has <em>expressly </em>recognized that health care service plans in California <em>are engaged in the business of insurance within the meaning of the McCarran-Ferguson Act. </em>In 1999, it enacted the Managed Health Care Insurance Accountability Act of 1999, Statutes 1999, chapter 536 (Sen. Bill No. 21) section 2, partially codified at Civil Code section 3428. This statute provides a nonexclusive state-law-based remedy for injuries caused by the failure of managed care entities and health care service plans to provide medically appropriate treatment to their subscribers. In an uncodified section 2 to the act, the Legislature stated: \u201cSEC. 2. (a) The Legislature finds and declares as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">\u201c(1) Based on the fundamental nature of the relationships involved, a health care service plan and all other managed care entities regulated under the Health and Safety Code <em>are engaged in the business of insurance in this state as that term is defined for purposes of the McCarran-Ferguson Act </em>(15 U.S.C. Sec. 1011 and following). Nothing in this act shall be construed to impose the regulatory requirements of the Insurance Code on health care service plans regulated by the Health and Safety Code.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The case on which PacifiCare relies <em>(Williams v. California Physicians\u2019 Service, supra, </em>72 Cal.App.4th 722) is not to the contrary. Indeed, it did not even address the issue before us. <em>Williams </em>simply held that a health care service plan regulated by the Knox-Keene Act was not necessarily the equivalent to an insurance company <em>for regulatory purposes. Williams </em>did not purport to address the issue confronting this court. <em>Rather, it simply </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number><em>recognized that the Legislature has elected to subject insurers and health care service plans to distinct regulatory regimes. </em>Insurers are regulated by the Insurance Code and the Insurance Commissioner. Health care service plans fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Managed Care and the Knox-Keene Act. Hence, when the plaintiff in <em>Williams </em>sought to challenge the conduct of her health care service plan by invoking a provision of the Insurance Code, the court correctly held that the statute did not apply. Nothing in the reasoning or holding of <em>Williams </em>justifies PacifiCare\u2019s contention that somehow it is not engaged in the business of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">This leaves us with the final and critical question. Does section 1363.1 constitute a regulation of that insurance business.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">4. <em>Section 1363.1 Does Regulate the Business of Insurance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The Supreme Court has recently made it clear that the so-called <em>Pireno </em>factors are merely \u201c <em>\u2018considerations </em>[to be] weighed\u2019 in determining whether a state law regulates insurance, [Citation], and that \u2018[n]one of these criteria is necessarily determinative.\u2019 \u201d <em>(UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America </em>v. <em>Ward </em>(1999) 526 U.S. 358, 373 [119 S.Ct. 1380, 1389, 143 L.Ed.2d 462, 476] <em>(Ward).) </em>Although it was considering the issue in the context of the \u201csavings clause\u201d of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) (29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001, 1144(b)(2)(A)), the court\u2019s reasoning is obviously relevant here. The court repeated the comment made in an earlier decision where it noted that the <em>first question </em>to be addressed was whether the state law \u201c <em>fit a common-sense understanding of insurance </em>regulation\u2019 \u201d and <em>then </em>the <em>Pireno </em>factors would be looked to as <em>\u201cchecking points </em>or <em>\u2018guideposts, not separate essential elements . . . that must each be </em>satisfied\u2019 to save the State\u2019s law.\u201d <em>(Ward, supra, </em>at p. 374 [119 S.Ct. at p. 1389], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\"> In order to be within the commonsense definition of insurance regulation, \u201ca law must not just have an impact on the insurance industry, but must be specifically directed toward that industry.\u201d <em>(Pilot Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dedeaux, supra, </em>481 U.S. 41, 50 [107 S.Ct. 1549, 1554].) Section 1363.1 falls squarely within the standard announced in <em>National Securities, supra, </em>393 U.S. 453. It regulates the language and terms of the policies that HMO\u2019s can offer in California, by requiring HMO\u2019s that want to use mandatory arbitration to provide certain disclosures in the documents issued to its plan enrollees. Because it defines the language that HMO\u2019s must use in their plan documents, section 1363.1 operates directly on the relationship between the HMO and its insured/enrollee. The disclosure requirement is plainly an effort to protect insureds, hence the state has exercised its power to protect or regulate the relationship between the HMO and its members. This is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>exactly what <em>National Securities </em>says falls within the \u201ccore\u201d of the business of insurance. <em>(National Securities, supra, </em>at p. 460 [89 S.Ct. at pp. 568-569].)</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Nothing in <em>Fabe </em>limits the test announced in <em>National Securities. </em>To the contrary, <em>Fabe </em>reaffirmed that test, holding that the Ohio law involved in that case fell within scope of McCarran-Ferguson because it was \u201c \u2018aimed at protecting or regulating\u2019 the <em>performance of an insurance contract.\u201d (Fabe, supra, </em>508 U.S. at p. 505 [113 S.Ct. at p. 2210], italics added.) The <em>Fabe </em>court rejected the Federal Government\u2019s contention that <em>Royal Drug </em>and <em>Pireno </em>had somehow supplanted the <em>National Securities </em>test, distinguishing those cases, and noting that they did not address the first clause of section 2(b) of McCarran-Ferguson (i.e., 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1012(b)) relating to state laws <em>enacted for the purpose of regulating </em>the business of insurance, but rather focused on the second clause dealing with the narrower question of the antitrust exemption. <em>(Fabe, supra, </em>at pp. 502-504 [113 S.Ct. at pp. 2208-2210].)</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Three federal appellate courts have concluded that state laws that restrict arbitration in the context of insurance are \u201cstate laws enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance.\u201d <em>(Mutual Reinsurance Bureau v. Great Plains Mut. </em>(10th Cir. 1992) 969 F.2d 931, cert. den. (1992) 506 U.S. 1001 [113 S.Ct. 604, 121 L.Ed.2d 540]; <em>Stephens v. American Intern. Ins. Co. </em>(2d Cir. 1995) 66 F.3d 41, 43-45; and <em>Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1997) 121 F.3d 1372, 1381.) In <em>Mutual Reinsurance, </em>(which predated Fabe) the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held that a Kansas law prohibiting arbitration clauses in insurance policies was not preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act, because it was a state law that regulated insurance. <em>(Mutual Reinsurance, supra, </em>969 F.2d at p. 933.) The <em>Mutual Reinsurance </em>court relied primarily on <em>National Securities, </em>explaining that the Kansas statute regulated the relationship between the insured and the policyholder, and was therefore at the core of the business of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">The Second Circuit Court of Appeals reached the same conclusion in <em>Stephens, </em>holding that Kentucky\u2019s legislative scheme for liquidating failed insurance companies, which contained an anti-arbitration provision, was protected by McCarran-Ferguson. The court also relied on <em>National Securities </em>and <em>Fabe, </em>concluding that the statute in question was part of a state liquidation scheme that regulated the performance of insurance policies once an insurer (or reinsurer) is placed in liquidation. <em>(Stephens, supra, </em>66 F.3d at p. 44.)</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">The Ninth Circuit\u2019s discussion of the issue in <em>Quackenbush </em>is admittedly dictum because the court explained that, unlike the Kentucky liquidation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>scheme, California\u2019s liquidation scheme lacked an anti-arbitration provision. <em>(Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., supra, </em>121 F.3d at p. 1381.) But the court was clear that, \u201cif a California law prohibited arbitration of disputes involving an insolvent insurer, then that law would undoubtedly also be saved [by McCarran-Ferguson] from preemption by the FAA.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">Even accepting the contention, however, that the issue should be decided by application of the <em>Pireno </em>factors, we believe that the facts and circumstances presented here demonstrate that those criteria, as recently characterized and applied by the Supreme Court in <em>Ward, supra, </em>526 U.S. 358, are in fact sufficiently met. It is true that section 1363.1 does not transfer risk. Plaintiffs concede the point, but argue that the issue is irrelevant. <em>Ward </em>makes it clear that even if the <em>Pireno </em>test is applied, <em>not all three parts must be met. </em>PacifiCare contends that the second prong is also not met because section 1363.1 regulates arbitration provisions, which, PacifiCare argues, are not an integral part of the policy relationship between the insurer and the insured. PacifiCare contends that arbitration is really nothing more than a shift in forum, leaving a party\u2019s substantive rights under the policy unchanged. <em>Ward, </em>however, does not justify this argument. There, UNUM argued that the notice-prejudice rule \u201cregulates only the administration of insurance policies, not their substantive terms [and] it [therefore] cannot be an integral part of the policy relationship.\u201d <em>(Ward, supra, </em>526 U.S. at p. 375, fn. 5 [119 S.Ct. at p. 1390].) The <em>Ward </em>court expressly rejected this argument. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Here, because section 1363.1 directly regulates the words that PacifiCare may use in its plan if it wants to include an enforceable arbitration clause, it regulates an integral part of the policy relationship. This relates directly to the <em>performance and enforcement </em>of the policy, a factor of critical importance under <em>F'abe.</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">PacifiCare finally contends that the third prong is not satisfied. It argues that because section 1363.1 affects health care service plans, and not insurance companies, the statute is not limited to insurance entities. We have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>already disposed of this contention. HMO\u2019s <em>are </em>engaged in the business of insurance when they offer health coverage to their members, and section 1363.1 clearly regulates this aspect of their endeavor. The fact that they are also involved in other activities that may not constitute the business of insurance is of no consequence to the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Health and Safety Code section 1363.1 is limited solely to HMO\u2019s, and parallels Insurance Code section 10123.19, which requires disability insurers (which includes health insurers) who wish to include arbitration clauses in their policies to make the same disclosures to their insureds. These provisions, which were simply different sections of the same legislation, evidence an effort by the Legislature to regulate the relationship between insureds and their insurers, <em>regardless of the type of coverage being provided.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Ultimately, therefore, even if the <em>Pireno </em>test is to be applied, section 1363.1 meets that test as clarified and applied in <em>Ward. </em>Finally, as a simple matter of common sense, by conditioning the availability of arbitration in HMO subscriber contracts on the HMO\u2019s\u2019 compliance with the mandated disclosures, section 1363.1 regulates insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we conclude that PacifiCare is engaged in the business of insurance and section 1363.1 clearly purports to regulate an important aspect of that business relating to the performance and enforcement of the policy. Thus, section 1363.1 does regulate the business of insurance within the meaning of McCarran-Ferguson. Therefore, the FAA, a federal statute of general application, which does not \u201cspecifically relate\u201d to insurance, is foreclosed from application to prevent the operation of section 1363.1. As a result, PacifiCare\u2019s arbitration provisions may not be enforced because of their failure to satisfy the specific and unambiguous disclosure requirements imposed by section 1363.1.

The question in <em>Standard Sec. Life </em>was whether the statute had been enacted to regulate the \u201cbusiness of insurance.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 823.) The court held that it was enacted for such purpose \u201cbecause it applies to the processing of disputed claims.
