(Havasu), after the trial court granted Havasu\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Gordon argues the trial court erroneously granted summary judgment because there was a triable issue of material fact regarding (1) whether the assumption of risk defense was applicable because Havasu failed to properly design and maintain its airstrip; and (2) whether the conditions at Havasu caused or contributed to his airplane crash. We agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">Gordon purchased a Piper Arrow airplane. A week later, he decided to fly to Lake Havasu to work on his boat, which he stored there, and to meet his niece and her husband for lunch. Melvin Gomez, Gordon\u2019s friend, found out Gordon was flying to Lake Havasu and asked if he could join him. Gordon agreed, and they decided they would fly to Las Vegas and the next morning fly to Havasu, a privately owned mobilehome park with an airstrip.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Gordon had never flown to Havasu or done anything to determine the airstrip\u2019s conditions, but he had seen the airstrip from a distance.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Gordon and Gomez flew from John Wayne airport to Las Vegas and spent the night. The next morning, Gordon checked the airplane and the weather at Lake Havasu and departed from Las Vegas. Gordon began their descent approximately 15 miles from Havasu. Gordon told Gomez they were going to fly over the airstrip to make sure it was clear, circle to the left, and make their approach to the airstrip. Gordon stated the fly-over altitude was approximately 1,000 feet; Gomez, who was not a licensed pilot, said the fly-over altitude was between 800 and 900 feet. Gordon does not remember what happened after he began their descent.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Gomez stated the airplane started shaking. Gordon pushed a lever down, which was located on the dashboard between the two front seats. The airplane went down, and both Gordon and Gomez sustained serious injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Dean Albin, an eyewitness to the crash, stated he was on the ground when he heard Gordon\u2019s airplane fly overhead. Albin said the engine was sputtering. He saw the airplane bank to the left at the beginning of the runway and then straighten out. After it straightened out, he observed the nose of the airplane go straight up, and the airplane \u201c[fell] straight out of the sky.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Gomez and his wife sued Gordon for negligence and strict liability. Gordon and his wife, Elizabeth Gordon, filed a cross-complaint against Havasu for negligence arising from a statutory violation, negligence, premises liability, and loss of consortium. The Gomezes settled with Gordon. Havasu answered the cross-complaint, contending the airstrip did not cause or contribute to Gordon\u2019s accident, and the assumption of risk defense barred his claim. Havasu amended its answer, asserting it was immune under the recreational use statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Havasu filed a motion for summary judgment arguing (1) the primary assumption of risk defense barred Gordon\u2019s claim; (2) there was no evidence Havasu\u2019s airstrip caused or contributed to Gordon\u2019s accident; and (3) Havasu was immune under Civil Code section 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">The trial court granted Havasu\u2019s motion for summary judgment. It concluded Havasu did not cause or contribute to Gordon\u2019s accident, and the primary assumption of risk defense barred Gordon\u2019s claim. The court did not rule on whether Havasu was immune under Civil Code section 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">A \u201cmotion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. In determining whether the papers show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact the court shall consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers . . . and all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence . . . .\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c).)  A defendant \u201chas met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action, even if not separately pleaded, cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action. Once the defendant. . . has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff. . . to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (o)(2); <em>Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 849 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 24 P.3d 493].) \u201cThere is a triable issue of material fact if, and only if, the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.\u201d <em>(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., supra, 25 </em>Cal.4th at p. 850, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">We review the trial court\u2019s granting of a summary judgment de novo. <em>(Vallely Investments v. BancAmerica Commercial Corp. </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 816, 821 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 689].) The moving party\u2019s affidavits should be strictly construed and the opponent\u2019s affidavits liberally construed. <em>(Kolodge v. Boyd </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 349, 355 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 749].) \u201c[A]ny doubts about the propriety of granting the motion must be resolved in favor of the party opposing the motion. [Citations.]\u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\n<em>Assumption of Risk</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Although normally we would discuss whether there were triable issues of material fact on the causation issue before discussing the assumption of risk defense, we will discuss the defense first because its applicability turns on whether Havasu owed Gordon a duty. It is axiomatic a discussion of whether Havasu owes a duty to Gordon precedes a discussion of whether Havasu caused or contributed to Gordon\u2019s accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Gordon argues the trial court erroneously granted summary judgment on the ground of primary assumption of risk because Havasu owed him a duty to design and maintain the airstrip in a safe manner. He contends Havasu breached its duty because the airstrip had a 9:1 clearance approach instead of 20:1 (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 21, \u00a7 3542, subd. (e)), the airstrip had a landing area gradient of 2.3 percent which was in excess of the FAA allowable maximum of 2.0 percent, and Havasu did not have a permit to operate the airstrip (Pub. Util. Code, \u00a7 21663). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>In <em>Knight v. Jewett </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 296, 299-300 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 2, 834 P.2d 696], the Supreme Court addressed the proper application of the primary assumption of risk doctrine in light of its holding in <em>Li v. Yellow Cab Co. </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 804, 828-829 [119 Cal.Rptr. 858, 532 P.2d 1226, 78 A.L.R.3d 393], where it adopted the comparative fault system in place of contributory negligence. The court drew a distinction between primary and secondary assumption of risk. <em>(Knight v. Jewett, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 308.)  \u201cIn cases involving \u2018primary assumption of risk\u2019\u2014where, by virtue of the nature of the activity and the parties\u2019 relationship to the activity, the defendant owes no legal duty to protect the plaintiff from the particular risk of harm that caused the injury\u2014the doctrine continues to operate as a complete bar to the plaintiffs recovery. In cases involving \u2018secondary assumption of risk\u2019\u2014where the defendant does owe a duty of care to the plaintiff, but the plaintiff encounters a known risk imposed by the defendant\u2019s breach of duty\u2014the doctrine is merged into the comparative fault scheme, and the trier of fact, in apportioning the loss resulting from the injury, may consider the relative responsibility of the parties.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 308, 314-315.) The question of whether the defendant owed a legal duty to protect the plaintiff from a particular risk of harm turns on the nature of the activity or sport in which the defendant is engaged and the relationship of the defendant and the plaintiff to that activity or sport. <em>(Knight </em>v. <em>Jewett, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at pp. 308, 313-315.) \u201c[T]he question of the existence and scope of a defendant\u2019s duty of care is a legal question . . . and is an issue to be decided by the court, rather than the jury.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 313, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Havasu, as the party moving for summary judgment, had the burden to establish the doctrine of assumption of risk was a complete defense to Gordon\u2019s cause of action for negligence. Therefore, under <em>Knight, </em>Havasu was required to show it did not owe Gordon a duty to design and maintain its airstrip in compliance with applicable regulations, and the primary assumption of risk defense barred Gordon\u2019s claim. Havasu failed to meet its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">At a minimum, Havasu owed Gordon a duty to design and maintain its airstrip in compliance with applicable regulations. Public Utilities Code section 21013 defines an airport as <em>\u201cany </em>area of land or water which is used, or intended for use, for the landing and take-off of aircraft . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Public Utilities Code section 21663 provides \u201cit is unlawful for . . . any person to operate an airport unless an appropriate airport permit required by rule of the [Department of Transportation] has been issued by the department and has not subsequently been revoked.\u201d California Code of Regulations, title 21, section 3542 provides, \u201cAs a minimum, the following items are required for a <em>permitted </em>airport: [f]. . . ffl] (e) clear 20:1 approach surfaces to each end of the runway\u2019s primary surface or to its displaced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>threshold . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Public Utilities Code section 21650.1 requires airports not open to the general public \u201cshall be marked . . . with letters or symbol selected by the [Department of Transportation] to designate that the airport is not open to the general public.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Havasu does not address Gordon\u2019s argument that it operated an unpermitted and defective airstrip. In fact, Havasu contends Gordon \u201cmiss[ed] the issue\u201d because \u201c[t]he issue in <em>this </em>assumption of the risk case was what [were] the risks inherent in the activity of flying a plane, not in the landing strip.\u201d (Italics added.) Havasu adds, \u201cCommon sense dictates that crashing is a risk inherent in flying a plane.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Havasu suggests <em>this </em>assumption of risk case is different from all others. It is not, and the issue in this case, like all other assumption of risk cases, is whether Havasu owed Gordon a duty. And while we agree crashing is a risk inherent in flying a plane, \u201cit is thoroughly unrealistic to suggest that, by engaging in a potentially dangerous activity or sport, an individual consents to (or agrees to excuse) a breach of duty by others that increases the risks inevitably posed by the activity or sport itself, even where the participating individual is aware of the possibility that such misconduct may occur.\u201d <em>(Knight v. Jewett, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 311.) As Havasu states, Gordon was aware of the risks in flying and was trained to deal with them. However, he did not consent to or agree to excuse Havasu\u2019s breach of its duty to design and maintain a safe airstrip.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">It is undisputed that aircraft land on and take off from the Havasu airstrip. Therefore, the airstrip is an airport within the meaning of Public Utilities Code section 21013, and Havasu was required to obtain a permit to operate the airstrip. Consequently, Havasu owed Gordon a duty to design and maintain its airstrip in compliance with applicable regulations. <em>(Nally v. Grace Community Church </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 278, 292 [253 Cal.Rptr. 97, 763 P.2d 948] [intentional and negligent torts involve violation of legal duty imposed by statute, contract, or otherwise].)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">\n<em>Causation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">Gordon argues the court erroneously granted Havasu\u2019s motion for summary judgment because there were triable issues of material fact as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>whether Havasu\u2019s negligent design and maintenance of the airstrip caused or contributed to Gordon\u2019s accident. Specifically, he argues Havasu was negligent because there were mountains at the end of the airstrip which had a 9:1 clearance approach instead of 20:1 as required by California Code of Regulations, title 21, section 3542. He explains the shortened distance caused him to pull up the airplane too steeply and bank too steeply, which made the airplane engine stall. We agree there is a triable issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">To recover for negligence, the plaintiff must show the defendant owed the plaintiff a legal duty, that the defendant breached the duty, and that the breach was a cause in fact of the plaintiffs injuries. <em>(Ann M. </em>v. <em>Pacific Plaza Shopping Center </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 666, 673 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 137, 863 P.2d 207].) A defendant\u2019s conduct is a cause in fact of the plaintiffs injury if it was a substantial factor in bringing about the injury. <em>(Mitchell </em>v. <em>Gonzales </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 1041, 1049, 1052-1054 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 913, 819 P.2d 872].) However, \u201c \u2018If the conduct which is claimed to have caused the injury had nothing at all to do with the injuries, it could not be said that the conduct was a factor, let alone a substantial factor, in the production of the injuries.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1052.) The issue of causation is usually a question for the jury. <em>(Constance B. v. State of California </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 200, 207 [223 Cal.Rptr. 645].)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Havasu, in its motion for summary judgment, argued the sole cause of the accident was pilot error. It alleged no condition or characteristic at the airstrip caused or contributed to the accident. With its motion, it included affidavits from Robert S. Tymczyszyn, Jim Taylor, and Eugene N. Beliveau.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Tymczyszyn stated he was a professional pilot with over 30 years of flying experience. He reviewed the National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s (NTSB) report of the accident, photographs of the wreckage and crash site, Gordon\u2019s opposition to Havasu\u2019s motion for summary judgment and accompanying affidavits, and the parties\u2019 depositions. He also performed a site investigation of the airstrip and an actual flight simulation of the perceived flight profile leading up to the accident. He was familiar with airport design standards and the conditions at the airstrip. He concluded the cause of the accident was pilot error; Gordon\u2019s accident was caused by lack of familiarity with his new plane, lack of required planning, and lack of preparation. He stated the 20:1 clearance requirement in both the approach and departure ends of the runway \u201cis for terrain clearance only and has nothing to do with preventing a pilot from feeling \u2018visually intimidated.\u2019 \u201d He stated there is rising terrain south of the runway, but it is well beyond the end of the airstrip and there is no \u201cbox effect\u201d created by the terrain. Because the procedure for landing at the airstrip is to land to the south, Gordon had the 20:1 clearance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>He stated Gordon never came close to the alleged 9:1 surface area because his airplane \u201ccontacted the ground less than a third of the way down the runway . . . .\u201d Moreover, because Gordon was flying over the airstrip and would have been at a higher altitude than if he was in an actual approach to landing, the conditions of the airstrip would not come into play and did not cause or contribute to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Taylor declared he was a professional pilot with an extensive background in light aircraft operations and pilot evaluation. He reviewed the log books, the associated maps and charts, photographs of the wreckage, the aircraft wreckage, Gomez\u2019s deposition, the airplane\u2019s operating manual, the relevant FAA regulations, and the NTSB\u2019s report of the accident. He also performed a site investigation of the accident and an actual flight simulation of the perceived flight profile leading up to the accident. He stated he was familiar with airport design standards and the conditions at Havasu\u2019s airstrip. He concluded the cause of the accident was pilot error because Gordon did not become familiar with the available flight information, and he did not maintain control of the airplane.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Beliveau stated he was a pilot, flight instructor, FAA designated pilot examiner, and retired United States Air Force lieutenant colonel. He declared he was familiar with airport design requirements and the conditions at the airstrip. He concluded, \u201cBased upon my evaluation of the accident site, as well as my knowledge, training, and expertise, it is my opinion that neither any condition nor characteristic of the Havasu Palms Resort or the landing strip caused or contributed to the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Havasu showed there was an issue whether causation can be established. The burden shifted to Gordon to show a triable issue of one or more material facts existed on the issue of causation. He did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">In support of his opposition, Gordon submitted two declarations, one from Gerald Dallas, an expert in airport development and operation, and another from J. Phillip Cline, a pilot with over 40 years of flying experience. Dallas stated he had over 30 years of experience in airport development and operation. He explained he reviewed the NTSB\u2019s report, Havasu\u2019s experts\u2019 opinions, witness statements, photographs of the Havasu facility, maps of the area, and FAA regulations. He stated the Code of Federal Regulations provides the \u201cminimum acceptable approach/departure slope for an aircraft landing surface is 20:1.\u201d He explained the slope is measured by the \u201capproach/departure surface that increases one foot in height for every twenty feet out longitudinally from the surface.\u201d He declared the FAA \u201cconsiders any object which exceeds [this] ,standard[] as a hazard to air navigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>. . . .\u201d He concluded, \u201cIn my expert opinion [the increased slope] constitutes an unassumed [sz'c] and increased risk to a pilot using the facility 99</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Cline stated he was familiar with FAA and California regulations and the conditions at the airstrip. Cline said the terrain rises rapidly within a half-mile of the runway and exceeds the FAA\u2019s and State of California\u2019s 20:1 requirement. He declared the terrain can be visually intimidating and may make the pilot feel boxed in. \u201cWhen [a] pilot perceives that he may be running out of space, he may react by pulling up too steeply and banking too steeply in an attempted escape,\u201d which may result in a stall. Cline concluded \u201cthe rapidly rising terrain south of the runway that exceeds the acceptable 20:1 slope contributed to the accident by setting up a situation in which the pilot felt boxed in and reacted by pulling up too steeply and banking too steeply so as to cause the aircraft to stall and crash.\u201d Gordon\u2019s experts\u2019 opinions were sufficient to create a triable issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Relying on <em>Saelzler v. Advanced Group 400 </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 763 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 617, 23 P.3d 1143], Havasu maintains Cline\u2019s declaration lacked evidentiary value because it was speculative and unsupported by evidence. (See also <em>Wanland </em>v. <em>Los Gatos Lodge, Inc. </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 1507, 1518 [281 Cal.Rptr. 890].) We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\"><em>Saelzler </em>v. <em>Advanced Group 400, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th 763 is inapposite. There, the plaintiff was assaulted by three men in defendant\u2019s apartment complex. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 769.) At trial, the plaintiffs expert stated the plaintiff would not have been assaulted had the defendant provided daytime security and kept the apartment gates repaired and closed. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 771.) The court explained that because the plaintiff could not identify her assailants, she could not establish whether they were authorized to enter the apartment complex. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 776.) Therefore, the plaintiffs expert\u2019s opinion was speculative because the assailants may have been tenants and authorized to enter, in which case increased security measures would not have prevented her assault. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In short, there was no factual basis for the plaintiffs expert\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">In contrast, here, Cline\u2019s opinion is supported by the record. Cline based his opinion on matters upon which a pilot reviewing an accident may reasonably rely: the NTSB report, witness statements, the declarations of Beliveau, Taylor, and Dallas, photographs of Havasu, and accident photos. <em>(Smith v. ACandS, Inc. </em>(1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 77, 93 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 457] [expert\u2019s testimony must be based on matters upon which expert may reasonably rely], disapproved on another ground in <em>Camargo v. Tjaarda </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number><em>Dairy </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 1235 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 617, 25 P.3d 1096].) Cline stated the terrain rises rapidly within a half-mile of the runway and exceeds the FAA\u2019s and State of California\u2019s 20:1 requirement. He said the terrain can be visually intimidating, and it made Gordon feel boxed in and that caused him to bank too steeply and pull up too steeply. Cline stated he based his opinion, in part, on witness statements. For example, Albin, an eyewitness to the crash, said he saw the airplane bank to the left and the nose go straight up before it crashed. From these facts one could reasonably conclude the rapidly rising terrain at the end of the runway caused Gordon to pull up and bank too steeply. Cline\u2019s opinion was supported by the record and was not speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\n<em>Immunity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Havasu argues it is immune from liability under Civil Code section 846. As stated above, the court did not rule on this argument. However, because we may uphold the trial court\u2019s judgment if it is correct on any legal theory <em>(Vallely Investments v. BancAmerica Commercial Corp., supra, </em>88 Cal.App.4th at p. 821), we will address the contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Civil Code section 846 provides, \u201cAn owner of any estate or any other interest in real property, whether possessory or nonpossesory, owes no duty of care to keep the premises safe for entry or use by others for any recreational purpose or to give any warning of hazardous conditions, uses of, structures, or activities on such premises to persons entering for such purpose . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There are \u201ctwo elements as a precondition to immunity: (1) the defendant must be the owner of an \u2018estate or any other interest in real property, whether possessory or nonpossessory\u2019; and (2) the plaintiffs injury must result from the \u2018entry or use [of the \u201cpremises\u201d] for any recreational purpose.\u2019\u201d <em>(Ornelas v. Randolph </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1095, 1100 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 594, 847 P.2d 560].)</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">A leasehold interest is sufficient to trigger immunity under Civil Code section 846. <em>(Ornelas </em>v. <em>Randolph, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 1102-1103 [exceptionally broad definition of types of interest in real property which will trigger immunity]; <em>Callahan v. Martin </em>(1935) 3 Cal.2d 110, 118 [43 P.2d 788, 101 A.L.R. 871] [leasehold an estate in real property].) It is undisputed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Havasu has a leasehold interest in the property on which Havasu and the airstrip are located. Therefore, the first element is met.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">As for the second element, Civil Code section 846 provides, \u201cA \u2018recreational purpose\u2019 . . . includes such activities as fishing, hunting, camping, water sports, hiking, spelunking, sport parachuting, riding, including animal riding, snowmobiling, and all other types of vehicular riding, rock collecting, sightseeing, picnicking, nature study, nature contacting, recreational gardening, gleaning, hang gliding, winter sports, and viewing or enjoying historical, archaeological, scenic, natural, or scientific sites.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Havasu says Gordon was engaged in three recreational activities because he was (1) flying, (2) going to fix his boat, and (3) going to meet his niece for lunch. We disagree. Gordon was already engaged in the activity of flying; he was not flying to Havasu for the recreational purpose of flying at Havasu. Similarly, he was not flying to Havasu to fix his boat. He decided to fly to Havasu only after he and Gomez decided to fly to Las Vegas so he would still have time to meet his niece for lunch. In fact, Gordon\u2019s boat was stored closer to the Lake Havasu airport than it was to Havasu\u2019s airstrip. The only recreational purpose here which could trigger immunity would be eating lunch at Havasu\u2019s restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Havasu cites <em>YMCA of Metropolitan Los Angeles v. Superior Court </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 22, 28-29 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 612], for the proposition eating lunch is a recreational activity. In addressing the plaintiffs claim that eating was an essential activity and the YMCA\u2019s release clause, therefore, was an exculpatory adhesion contract, the court stated, \u201cAlthough munching while socializing, shopping, or playing games is not a sporting activity like skiing or swimming, it is a recreational activity which, however pleasurable, is not essential.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 28-29.) Although the YMCA court held \u201cmunching\u201d is a recreational activity, it was not within the context of Civil Code section 846, and we do not find the reasoning persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Gordon correctly notes Civil Code section 846 does not list eating as a recreational purpose and no cases have held eating to be one. However, the phrase \u201crecreational purpose\u201d has been defined broadly based on the statute\u2019s use of the word \u201cincludes,\u201d which ordinarily indicates a term of enlargement rather than limitation. <em>(Ornelas </em>v. <em>Randolph, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 1100-1101.)</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">However broad a reading we give the phrase \u201crecreational purpose,\u201d eating lunch in a restaurant is not a recreational purpose within the meaning of the statute. Eating is not an activity sufficiently similar to the ones listed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>in the statute to be included. Although Civil Code section 846 includes picnicking as a recreational purpose, picnicking contemplates bringing food and eating at an outdoor location. It cannot be said going to a restaurant and buying food is similar, even if one were to eat outside. If eating were held to be a recreational purpose, a restaurant owner would be immune from liability to any customer who was injured while visiting the restaurant, unless one of the exceptions applied. The Legislature never intended to immunize a particular class of business\u2014restaurant owners\u2014from all liability.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>(Ornelas </em>v. <em>Randolph, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1106 [landowners broadly encouraged to allow <em>access </em>to their property].)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The judgment is reversed. Gordon shall recover his costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Bedsworth, Acting P.
