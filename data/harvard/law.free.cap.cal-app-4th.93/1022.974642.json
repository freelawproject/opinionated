The issue arises in the context of a suppression motion that the trial court granted based on the trial court\u2019s view that the stop was unlawful. Because all evidence against defendant was suppressed, the trial court also dismissed the various misdemeanor charges that had been filed against him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Appellate Division of San Bernardino Superior Court (hereafter Superior Court) held that the stop was lawful, and reversed the trial judge. Oh our own motion, in accordance with rule 62(a) and (b) of the California Rules of Court, we ordered transfer of this case from the Superior Court. We conclude that the stop was lawful and, therefore, we will reverse the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">On October 12, 2000, San Bernardino County Sheriffs Deputy Brandon Wiebeld stopped defendant\u2019s pickup truck after noticing that a trailer hitch or tow ball on the truck\u2019s rear bumper blocked the deputy\u2019s view of the middle numeral of the rear license plate. Deputy Wiebald testified that he believed the tow ball\u2019s position violated Vehicle Code section 5201, which requires that license plates be clearly visible. On cross-examination, defendant had Deputy Wiebald identify two photographs that depicted the rear view of defendant\u2019s truck. In one photo, taken from directly behind the vehicle, the trailer hitch ball obscures the lower half of the middle numeral on the rear license plate. Nevertheless, the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and in doing so stated, \u201cI have had similar cases like this before and I know that the appellate . . . department of the court here in San Bernardino County has ruled that in situations such as this, the two [Vc] bar [presumably \u2018tow\u2019 bar] isn\u2019t an obstruction as defined by . . . 5201 of the Vehicle Code. They seem to feel that the section deals with a situation in which there\u2019s dirt or grit or grime or material on the license plate that completely obliterates it, and that a two bar\u2014a tow ball is normally positioned in such a way that one could look around and see it and it is not within the clear definition of that section, and I have gone through motions like this before in the past, and based upon that, I\u2019m going to grant the motion [to suppress].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">Contrary to the trial judge\u2019s understanding of the appellate division\u2019s view regarding trailer hitch balls, the Superior Court appellate division reversed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>the trial court\u2019s order granting defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. In doing so, the court found that the trailer hitch ball was positioned in a manner that violated Vehicle Code section 5201. We agree and adopt the court\u2019s reasoning here.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">We begin with the well-established principle that in reviewing a lower court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress evidence, the reviewing court is \u201cbound by the trial court\u2019s factual findings, whether express or implied, if they are supported by substantial evidence. However, . . . questions of law [are reviewed] independently to determine whether the challenged seizure meets constitutional standards of reasonableness.\u201d <em>(People v. Boissard </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 972, 977 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 738], citing <em>People v. Loewen </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 117, 123 [196 Cal.Rptr. 846, 672 P.2d 436] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Leyba </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 591, 596-597 [174 Cal.Rptr. 867, 629 P.2d 961].)</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">Although the trial court granted defendant\u2019s suppression motion, in doing so the trial court impliedly found that the trailer hitch ball on defendant\u2019s pickup truck partially obscured his rear license plate, at least when viewed from a vantage point directly behind the vehicle.  The first issue we must resolve is whether that obstruction constitutes a violation of Vehicle Code section 5201.  If so, the remaining issue is whether under the pertinent Fourth Amendment principles, the partially obscured license plate afforded Deputy Wiebald a legally cognizable reason to detain defendant. The answer to that question is well settled\u2014a law enforcement officer may, consistent with the Fourth Amendment, briefly detain a vehicle if the objective facts indicate that the vehicle has violated a traffic law. The officer\u2019s subjective motivation in effecting the stop is irrelevant. <em>(Whren v. United States </em>(1996) 517 U.S. 806, 809-810 [116 S.Ct. 1769, 1772-1773, 135 L.Ed.2d 89].)</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">The traffic law at issue in this case is Vehicle Code section 5201, which provides in pertinent part, that \u201cLicense plates shall at all times be . . . mounted in a position to be clearly visible, and shall be maintained in a condition so as to be clearly legible.\u201d The statute imposes two obligations \u2014that the plate be clearly visible when mounted on the vehicle and that it also be clearly legible. In reversing the trial court\u2019s order granting defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the Superior Court concluded, as evidenced by the words used, i.e., \u201cclearly visible,\u201d that the Legislature intended in enacting the noted Vehicle Code section that the view of the license plate be entirely unobstructed. We agree with that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">In interpreting a statute, the object is to determine the intent of the Legislature so as to achieve the purpose of the law. <em>(People v. Coronado </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 145, 151 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 77, 906 P.2d 1232].) \u201cIn determining that intent, we first examine the words of the . . . statute[]: \u2018If there is no ambiguity in the language of the statute, \u201cthen the Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said, and the plain meaning of the language governs.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">The words \u201cclearly visible\u201d are unambiguous. \u201cVisible\u201d means \u201ccapable of being seen,\u201d \u201cperceptible to vision,\u201d \u201cexposed to view,\u201d \u201cconspicuous.\u201d (Webster\u2019s 9th New Collegiate Dict. (1987) p. 1318.) The term \u201cclearly\u201d means \u201cfree from obscurity. . . unmistakable . . . unhampered by restriction or limitation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 247.) In using the phrase \u201cclearly visible\u201d in Vehicle Code section 5201, it is apparent that the Legislature meant a license plate must not be obstructed in any manner and must be entirely readable. A license plate mounted in a place that results in it being partially obstructed from view by a trailer hitch ball violates Vehicle Code section 5201 and, thus, provides a law enforcement officer with a lawful basis upon which to detain the vehicle and hence its driver. Because the detention was lawful, the trial court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and dismissing the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">The judgment of dismissal is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">Hollenhorst, Acting P. J., and Richli, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b850-8\"> After stopping defendant\u2019s truck for the license plate violation, the officer cited him for driving while intoxicated and with a blood-alcohol level of at least .08 percent, in violation of Vehicle Code section 23152, subdivisions (a) and (b), and driving on a suspended license, in violation of Vehicle Code section 14601.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
