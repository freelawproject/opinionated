J.</author>\n<p id=\"b766-10\">Issues on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b766-11\">For over a century and a half, the judiciary has had the implied power to regulate the practice of law. <em>(Hustedt v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 329, 336-337, and fn. 5 [178 Cal.Rptr. 801, 636 P.2d 1139], citing <em>People v. Turner </em>(1850) 1 Cal. 143, 150.) The judiciary traditionally has deferred to legislative enactment of \u201c \u2018a reasonable degree of regulation and control over the profession and practice of law . . . . \u2019 \u201d <em>(Hustedt </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number><em>Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at pp. 337-338.) Congruent with that tradition, the Legislature has authorized the State Bar, with the Supreme Court\u2019s approval, to \u201cformulate and enforce rules of professional conduct for all members of the bar . . . .\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6076; <em>Brydonjack </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1929) 208 Cal. 439, 442-446 [281 P. 1018, 66 A.L.R. 1507].) Pursuant to that authority, the State Bar has adopted a rule of professional conduct that prohibits, with few exceptions, a lawyer from acting as both advocate and witness. (Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 5-210.)</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">In the case at bar, the credibility of the key prosecution witness was the critical issue, as she was the only person who ever gave inculpatory information to law enforcement. Defendant\u2019s trial attorney did not object when the prosecutor took the stand to impeach the exculpatory testimony of that witness. Defendant\u2019s trial attorney then took the prosecutor on cross-examination and elicited evidence of her personal belief in the credibility of that witness at the time when she gave inculpatory information to law enforcement. In argument, without objection by defendant\u2019s trial attorney, the prosecutor expressed her personal belief, as both advocate and witness, in defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The primary issue here is whether, with respect to the State Bar rule of professional conduct that generally prohibits a lawyer from acting as both advocate and witness, defendant\u2019s trial attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel. Before reaching that issue, we decide adversely to defendant the secondary issue of whether the record contains sufficient evidence of child endangerment. We find the failure of defendant\u2019s trial attorney to protect his client against abrogation of that rule of professional conduct undermines our confidence in the integrity and reliability of the trial. That due process concern persuades us that her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is meritorious. On that ground, we reverse and remand for a new trial. Consequently, we need not address the other issues defendant raises.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">The Kern County District Attorney filed an information charging defendant Wanda Marie Donaldson with attempted murder and child endangerment of her two-month-old daughter. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, subd. (a), 273a, subd. (a), 664, subd. (a).) In argument, the prosecutor conceded insufficient evidence of attempted murder. The jury acquitted defendant of attempted murder and found her guilty of child endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>Factual History</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">(1) <em>Prosecution Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Of several self-styled percipient witnesses to the incident that led to defendant\u2019s conviction of child endangerment of her two-month-old daughter (the baby), Bonnie Christopher was the only one who ever gave inculpatory information to law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">(a) <em>Testimony of the Key Prosecution Witness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">On the day of the incident that led to defendant\u2019s arrest, Christopher told defendant\u2019s aunt that defendant tried to suffocate the baby with a pillow. She told a 911 dispatcher that defendant slapped Christopher\u2019s daughter Marie and tried to suffocate the baby. She told a deputy sheriff that she saw defendant try to suffocate the baby with a pillow, that she told defendant not to do that, and that defendant told her the baby was a bitch, the father was a bastard, and she did not want the baby any more. She told a TV news crew that she saw defendant with a pillow over the baby\u2019s face and that defendant hit Marie in the face when they tried to pull her off the baby.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">At trial, Christopher testified that she did not personally observe the incident, that she just related things other people told her, and that her statements to defendant\u2019s aunt, the 911 operator, the deputy sheriff, and the TV news crew were lies. Several times she testified she did not see defendant hold a pillow over the baby\u2019s face. Once she testified she did see defendant do that.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">Christopher thought of defendant as her friend at times, her close friend at times, and not her friend at all at times. She did not want to testify. She still cared for her and just wanted her to get help for her drinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">(b) <em>Testimony of Other Witnesses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b768-11\">Upset and crying, Christopher told defendant\u2019s, aunt that defendant tried to suffocate the baby with a pillow. She told her that defendant slapped Marie in the face after she and Marie tried to stop her. She told the 911 operator that defendant hit Marie and tried to suffocate the baby. She told defendant\u2019s aunt and the 911 operator that defendant was intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-12\">Christopher told a deputy sheriff that she saw defendant holding a pillow over the baby\u2019s face with both hands. She said she told her not to do that. She said defendant told her the baby was a bitch, the father was a bastard, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>and she did not want the baby any more. She never told the deputy sheriff she just repeated things other people told her.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">A deputy sheriff who was a certified emergency medical technician observed the baby had shortness of breath and somewhat flushed cheeks. He handed her to an ambulance paramedic who arrived a few minutes later.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">(2) <em>Defense Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">After Marie and defendant\u2019s mother confronted defendant about her drinking, defendant angrily screamed that she was going to leave with the baby so she could live her life as she wished. Marie and defendant\u2019s sister held defendant down while defendant\u2019s brother-in-law took the baby out of her arms.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">Defendant said she was upset with the baby\u2019s father and called him \u201csorry\u201d and \u201cworthless\u201d for getting sent back to Mexico. She pushed Marie, who thought she was too drunk to care for the baby, but did not hit her or put a pillow over the baby\u2019s face.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">An ambulance paramedic took charge of the baby. Once the ambulance was enroute to the hospital a few minutes later, he examined her and found no evidence of cyanosis or trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">(1) <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">(2) <em>Trial Counsel\u2019s Performance with Regard to the Prosecutor\u2019s Testifying in Her Own Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b769-13\">Defendant raises three ineffective assistance of counsel issues with regard to the prosecutor\u2019s testimony and argument. First, she argues her trial attorney should have objected to the prosecutor\u2019s testimony before she ever took the stand. Second, she argues her trial attorney did not competently cross-examine the prosecutor. Third, she argues her trial attorney should have objected to the prosecutor\u2019s argument in which she expressed her personal belief, as both advocate and witness, in defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>(a) <em>The Record</em></p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">\n<em>(i) The Key Prosecution Witness\u2019s Testimony About Her Conversation with the Prosecutor</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The first evidence of a conversation the prosecutor had with Bonnie Christopher just before the preliminary hearing came out during cross-examination of Christopher by defendant\u2019s trial attorney. Christopher testified the prosecutor told her she \u201ccould get arrested\u201d if she were to fail to do something she characterized first as \u201cgetting] in there and say[ing] all this stuff,\u201d then as \u201csay[ing] what I know what I said on the paper,\u201d then as testifying to the \u201cstatements, the truth that was on the policeman\u2019s report,\u201d and finally as \u201ctelling the truth.\u201d She testified she felt somewhat threatened by what the prosecutor told her. Nevertheless, she acknowledged she lied at the preliminary hearing when she testified defendant held the pillow above, not on, the baby\u2019s face.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">On redirect examination, the prosecutor questioned Christopher about that conversation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-8\">\u201cQ. . . . And, when you came to court and you first approached me, do you remember where we sat and briefly talked before the preliminary hearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-9\">\u201cA. Outside in the hallway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-10\">\u201cQ. Do you remember what you said about the prospect of having to testify against [defendant]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-11\">\u201cA. Yes, I said I didn\u2019t feel like\u2014I don\u2019t want to testify against her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-12\">\u201cQ. Okay. And, do you remember what I told you when you told me that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-13\">\u201cA. No. All I remember is you told me if I didn\u2019t say, you know, that I could get arrested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-14\">\u201cQ. Did I tell you\u2014did I remind you that as a witness you. have an obligation to tell the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-15\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-16\">\u201cQ. And did I also say that you understand there are consequences that follow from not telling the truth? Do you remember me saying\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Alk\">\u201cQ. \u2014exactly that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHl\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axc\">\u201cQ. I have never used the word you might be arrested. I consequences for not telling the truth. said there were</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXY\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Trial Attorney]: Objection, counsel is testifying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adf\">\u201cThe Court: It is sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFF\">\u201cBy [The Prosecutor]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVJ\">\u201cQ. Do you remember me telling you there were consequences that could follow if a witness does not tell the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Av4\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A61\">\u201cQ. Did you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6D\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abr\">\u201cQ. You heard me say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFP2\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWj\">\u201cQ. Did you in some way determine or believe that that was a threat?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEo\">\u201cA. Like I was thinking of being arrested, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaFa\">\u201cQ. So that\u2019s how you understood what I said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASS\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">\n<em>(ii) The Prosecutor\u2019s Testimony About Her Conversation with the Key Prosecution Witness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Immediately after an unreported sidebar conference, the prosecutor put on the record her intent to call herself as a witness to testify in \u201cnarrative fashion\u201d as she understood \u201cthe court\u2019s ruling\u201d permitted her to do. She stated another attorney from her office would \u201cstand in\u201d while she testified. The only objection defendant\u2019s trial attorney made was to the \u201cnarrative fashion\u201d of her testimony. The trial court overruled that objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>On direct examination, the prosecutor testified about her conversation with Christopher just before the preliminary hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-4\">\u201cI was assigned to handle this case prior to the preliminary hearing. I met Bonnie Christopher in connection with this case on the day of the preliminary hearing, May 17th, the second floor of the Municipal Court building, where she indicated to me that she did not want to testify against her friend [defendant]. And I indicated to her\u2014it became apparent to me she was reluctant to testify. I told her that her obligation was to tell the truth. And I also told her that did she understand\u2014or I just asked her, do you understand that there are consequences that follow if you don\u2019t tell the truth. And that was the extent of our conversation as far as that goes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-5\">\u201cI never told her that she had to testify consistently with the police reports. And I never told her that she would be arrested if she didn\u2019t testify consistently with the police reports. I told her to tell the truth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">On cross-examination, the prosecutor elaborated on her conversation with Christopher:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-7\">\u201cQ. [Defendant\u2019s Trial Attorney]: Did you talk about the police report with Mrs. Christopher? [f] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [10</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-8\">\u201ca. no. no... <em>m</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-9\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>What did she tell you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-10\">\u201cA. She told me she didn\u2019t want to testify against her friend [defendant]. She felt bad for [defendant]. She didn\u2019t think she needed to be in jail. She thought that she needed help. That is what she told me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-11\">The record shows that although the prosecutor\u2019s investigator was available she made no effort to involve him, either to witness her conversation with defendant or to talk with her himself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-12\">\u201cQ. [Defendant\u2019s Trial Attorney]: Did you make any notes of your conversation with her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-13\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-14\">\u201cQ. Was anybody else privilege [sz'c] to that conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-15\">\u201cA. It was just she and I sitting next to each other on a bench. There were other members of Ms. Donaldson\u2019s family standing in the hallway waiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>for us to get a courtroom, but they were not sitting with us in the conversation. And then Ms. Christopher\u2019s daughter also approached me and spoke at length with me. And I had her speak to my investigator so that he could document what she had to say.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Defendant\u2019s trial attorney broadened the scope of his inquiry. He asked the prosecutor whether she believed in the police report. His first attempt did not bear fruit, as the trial court sustained the alternate prosecutor\u2019s objection, but his second attempt did, as the alternate prosecutor did not object:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-6\">\u201cQ. [By Defendant\u2019s Trial Attorney]: And you believed that police report, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-7\">\u201c[Alternate Prosecutor]: Objection, relevance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-8\">\u201cThe Court: It is sustained, [i] . . . [f]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-9\">\u201cQ. Did you read her the police report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-10\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-11\">\u201cQ. Okay. So she hadn\u2019t read the police report yet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-12\">\u201cA. I have no idea whether she read it or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-13\">\u201cQ. You didn\u2019t give it to her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-14\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t do that, no. [^] . . . [f]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-15\">\u201cQ. Well, what you believed was you had an authentic police report and a witness that was suddenly waivering <em>[sic] </em>on you. Isn\u2019t that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-16\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-17\">\u201cQ. Did you disbelieve the police report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-18\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-19\">\u201cQ. You believed the police report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-20\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-21\">Continuing to cross-examine the prosecutor, defendant\u2019s trial attorney again broadened his inquiry. In the absence of an objection by the alternate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>prosecutor, he elicited the prosecutor\u2019s personal opinion about the credibility of Christopher\u2019s statements to the police:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-4\">\u201cQ. ... A few moments ago you testified that it didn\u2019t occur to you that maybe the police reports were false because Bonnie Christopher had said false things to the police to begin with. And that now outside\u2014but then outside the hall of the preliminary hearing examination she didn\u2019t want to get up and testify to that because it was, it was untrue. You have already said that did not occur to you. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-6\">\u201cA. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-7\">\u201cQ. Okay. So operating under that assumption, you made statements to her about\u2014you made a statement to her about there are consequences if you don\u2019t tell the truth. But it never occurred to you at that time when you said it [sic] maybe she lied the first place to the police and maybe she was afraid of having to do the same thing on the stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-8\">\u201cA. I didn\u2019t believe then and I don\u2019t believe now that Bonnie Christopher lied to the police.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-9\">By the time defendant\u2019s trial attorney had finished his cross-examination of the prosecutor, he had elicited evidence of her personal belief in the credibility of the only percipient witness who ever gave inculpatory information to law enforcement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">\n<em>(in) The Prosecutor\u2019s Argument About Her Own Testimony and About Her Personal Belief in Defendant\u2019s Guilt</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b774-12\">Like defendant\u2019s trial attorney\u2019s cross-examination of the prosecutor, the final moments of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument exposed the dilemma of advocate as witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-13\">\u201cI said it on the stand, but now I will say it to you as arguing this case, I believe, based on the same evidence that is before you in this case, that this woman placed that pillow over her baby\u2019s head on April 30th. She is guilty of felony child endangerment. And I am asking you to return a verdict of guilty of felony child endangerment. Thank you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-14\">Defendant\u2019s trial attorney did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s expression of her personal belief, as both advocate and witness, in defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>(b) <em>The Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">(i) <em>The Prosecutor as a Witness in Her Own Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Pursuant to the judiciary\u2019s historic deference to reasonable legislative control of the practice of law, the State Bar has adopted a rule of professional conduct that prohibits, with few exceptions, a lawyer from acting as both advocate and witness (Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 5-210 (rule 5-210)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-7\">\u201cA member shall not act as an advocate before a jury which will hear testimony from the member unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-8\">\u201c(A) The testimony relates to an uncontested matter; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-9\">\u201c(B) The testimony relates to the nature and value of legal services rendered in the case; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-10\">\u201c(C) The member has the informed, written consent of the client. If the member represents the People or a governmental entity, the consent shall be obtained from the head of the office or a designee of the head of the office by which the member is employed and shall be consistent with principles of recusal.\u201d (Rule 5-210.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">One of the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct (Model Rules) likewise prohibits that practice and permits only a small number of exceptions (ABA Model Rules Prof. Conduct (4th ed. 1999), rule 3.7(a) (ABA rule 3.7(a)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-12\">\u201cA lawyer shall not act as advocate at a trial in which the lawyer is likely to be a necessary witness except where:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-13\">\u201c(1) the testimony relates to an uncontested issue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-14\">\u201c(2) the testimony relates to the nature and value of legal services rendered in the case; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-15\">\u201c(3) disqualification of the lawyer would work substantial hardship on the client.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-16\">The American Bar Association Model Code of Professional Responsibility, which as predecessor to the Model Rules served as the national standard of professional conduct from 1969 to 1983, similarly tightly circumscribed the practice of a lawyer\u2019s acting as both advocate and witness (former ABA Model Code Prof. Responsibility, EC 5-9): \u201cOccasionally a lawyer is called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>upon to decide in a particular case whether he will be a witness or an advocate. If a lawyer is both counsel and witness, he becomes more easily impeachable for interest and thus may be a less effective witness. Conversely, the opposing counsel may be handicapped in challenging the credibility of the lawyer when the lawyer also appears as an advocate in the case. An advocate who becomes a witness is in the unseemly and ineffective position of arguing his own credibility. The roles of an advocate and of a witness are inconsistent; the function of an advocate is to advance or argue the cause of another, while that of a witness is to state facts objectively.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">Although California has not adopted the Model Rules, a State Bar rule of professional conduct expressly permits consideration of ethical rules other jurisdictions and bar associations adopt. (Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 1-100(A); <em>General Dynamics Corp. v. Superior Court </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1164, 1190, fn. 6 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 876 P.2d 487]; <em>Cho v. Superior Court </em>(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 113, 121, fn. 2 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 863].) Especially where there is no conflict with the public policy of California, the Model Rules serve as a collateral source for guidance on proper professional conduct in California. <em>(State Comp. Ins. Fund v. WPS, Inc. </em>(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 644, 655-656 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 799].)</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The foundations of the prohibition against a lawyer\u2019s acting as both advocate and witness lie in due process (ABA rule 3.7(a), Legal Background): \u201cThe prohibition against a lawyer serving as advocate and testifying as a witness in the same matter is essentially aimed at eliminating confusion over the lawyer\u2019s role. This confusion could prejudice one or more of the parties or call into question the impartiality of the judicial process itself. As an advocate, the lawyer\u2019s task is to present the client\u2019s case and to test the evidence and arguments put forth by the opposing side. A witness, however, provides sworn testimony concerning facts about which he or she has personal knowledge or expertise. The very fact of a lawyer taking on both roles will affect the way in which a jury evaluates the lawyer\u2019s testimony, the lawyer\u2019s advocacy, and the fairness of the proceedings themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The prohibition against a lawyer\u2019s acting as both advocate and witness \u201cis a necessary corollary to the more fundamental tenet of our adversarial system that juries are to ground their decisions on the facts of a case and not on the integrity or credibility of the advocates.\u201d <em>(United States v. Prantil </em>(9th Cir. 1985) 764 F.2d 548, 553.) The enforcement of that prohibition \u201cis more than just an ethical obligation of individual counsel\u201d but rather \u201ca matter of institutional concern implicating the basic foundations of our system of justice.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">Within the criminal justice system, the prohibition against a prosecutor\u2019s acting as both advocate and witness addresses \u201cthe concern that jurors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>will be unduly influenced by the prestige and prominence of the prosecutor\u2019s office and will base their credibility determinations on improper factors. (U.S. v. <em>Edwards </em>(9th Cir. 1998) 154 F.3d 915, 921.) \u201cThat counsel should avoid appearing both as advocate and witness except under special circumstances is beyond question.\u201d <em>(United States v. Morris </em>(7th Cir. 1983) 714 F.2d 669, 671.) The maxim \u201c \u2018justice must satisfy the appearance of justice\u2019 \u201d reflects the \u201cespecially acute\u201d need for public confidence in the administration of justice where the testifying attorney represents the \u201cprosecuting arm\u201d of government. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Johnston </em>(7th Cir. 1982) 690 F.2d 638, 643.) Judicial condemnation of the \u201cpractice of serving as both prosecutor and witness\u201d has deep roots not only in English and American law but also in Roman law. <em>(United States v. Birdman </em>(3d Cir. 1979) 602 F.2d 547, 551.)</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">\u201cCombining the roles of advocate and witness can prejudice the opposing party\u201d and confers on the opposing party \u201cproper objection where the combination of roles may prejudice that party\u2019s rights in the litigation.\u201d (ABA Model Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 3.7, com., p. 361.) \u201cA witness is required to testify on the basis of personal knowledge, while an advocate is expected to explain and comment on evidence given by others. It may not be clear whether a statement by an advocate-witness should be taken as proof or as an analysis of the proof.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Both Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 5-210 and ABA rule 3.7(a) set out exceptions to the prohibition against a prosecutor acting as both advocate and witness. The first is the \u201cuncontested issue\u201d exception. As the commentary to rule 3.7(a) notes, the \u201cambiguities in the dual role are purely theoretical\u201d if the advocate testifies to an uncontested issue. (Rule 3.7(a), Legal Background.) The prosecutor\u2019s testimony about the credibility of the only witness who ever gave inculpatory information to law enforcement is the antithesis of the \u201cuncontested issue\u201d exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">The second exception, testimony about \u201cthe nature and value of legal services,\u201d is likewise patently inapplicable. (Cf. Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 5-210, ABA rule 3.7(a).) The theoretical rationale for that exception is instructive nonetheless. \u201c[A]s the judge has firsthand knowledge of the matter,\u201d the commentary to rule 3.7(a) states, \u201c \u2018there is less dependence on the adversary process to test the credibility\u2019 \u201d of testimony about the nature and value of legal services. (Rule 3.7(a), Legal Background.) Here, on the other hand, the jury as the finder of fact at the very heart of the adversary process heard the prosecutor\u2019s testimony on a topic about which the judge had absolutely no firsthand knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 5-210 and ABA rule 3.7(a) have different third exceptions. Rule 5-210 allows testimony by a lawyer \u201cconsistent with principles of recusal\u201d if the head of the office consents. (Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>5-210.) Nothing in the record shows the requisite consent. The \u201csubstantial hardship\u201d exception in rule 3.7(a) allows testimony by a lawyer if disqualification \u201cwould work substantial hardship on the client.\u201d (ABA rule 3.7(a).) The client whom the \u201csubstantial hardship\u201d exception protects is, of course, the client of the testifying attorney, not the client of the opposing attorney. Neither exception applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Case law articulates an exception neither Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 5-210 nor ABA rule 3.7(a) codifies. Although acting as both advocate and witness \u201cis a situation to be avoided if possible,\u201d a prosecutor can do so \u201cin extraordinary circumstances and for compelling reasons, usually where the evidence is not otherwise available.\u201d <em>(United States v. Johnston, supra, </em>690 F.2d at p. 644.) After testifying, however, the prosecutor should \u201cwithdraw from any further participation\u201d in the case. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 645.) To withdraw after impeaching a witness is one remedy the American Bar Association\u2019s Project on Standards for Criminal Justice suggests if a prosecutor interviews a prospective witness outside the presence of a third person. (ABA Stds. for Crim. Justice (3d ed. 1993) std. 3-3.1(g).) The other is to forgo impeachment: \u201cUnless a prosecutor is prepared to forgo impeachment of a witness by the prosecutor\u2019s own testimony as to what the witness stated in an interview or to seek leave to withdraw from the case in order to present the impeaching testimony, a prosecutor should avoid interviewing a prospective witness except in the presence of a third person.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s conversation with Christopher outside the presence of a third party created an \u201cunfortunate\u201d but resolvable dilemma. <em>(United States v. Vereen </em>(D.C. Cir. 1970) 429 F.2d 713, 714.) Doubts \u201c \u2018should be resolved in favor of the lawyer testifying and against his becoming or continuing as an advocate.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 715, fn. 3, quoting former ABA Model Code Prof. Responsibility, EC 5-10.) Although \u201cpersonally to withdraw without any trial delay, substitute an associate as counsel, and then to take the stand\u201d is a \u201cmanifestly appropriate\u201d remedy, the lack of an objection by defendant\u2019s trial attorney failed to force that issue to adjudication by the trial court. <em>(United States v. Vereen, supra, </em>429 F.2d at p. 715.)</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">A prosecutor in another \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d case interviewed a witness outside the presence of a third party about the accused\u2019s pending forcible rape, oral copulation, and unlawful sexual intercourse charges. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guerrero </em>(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 441, 443-445 [120 Cal.Rptr. 732].) The witness told the prosecutor he had informed the accused of the victim\u2019s age, but at trial he testified he had neither disclosed her age to the accused nor informed the prosecutor the contrary. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 443-444.) With <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>no defense objection, the prosecutor took the stand and impeached his testimony. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 444.) The prosecutor did not withdraw from the case after testifying. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 443-444.)</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Finding a \u201c \u2018good deal wrong\u2019 \u201d with the prosecutor\u2019s acting as both advocate and witness, the Court of Appeal nevertheless inferred from guilty verdicts on the two charges on which the victim\u2019s age was irrelevant that the error was harmless. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guerrero, supra, </em>47 Cal.App.3d at p. 444.) In the case at bar, in stark contrast, the Attorney General acknowledges the prosecutor\u2019s challenge to Christopher\u2019s credibility was \u201chighly relevant\u201d since her pretrial statements were the \u201cheart of the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d That record fulfills Guerrero\u2019s prophecy that \u201cwe readily envision circumstances in which the testimony of a prosecutor might present issues of constitutional magnitude.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">In neither testimony nor argument should a prosecutor express a personal belief in a witness\u2019s credibility or in an accused\u2019s guilt. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>McKoy </em>(9th Cir. 1985) 771 F.2d 1207, 1210-1211.) Especially if witness credibility is crucial, a prosecutor\u2019s expression of a personal belief in a witness\u2019s credibility or in an accused\u2019s guilt can jeopardize the fundamental fairness of the trial. (See <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Molina </em>(9th Cir. 1991) 934 F.2d 1440, 1445.) If the jury in the case at bar found credible the prosecutor\u2019s testimony that she believed Christopher did not lie in her pretrial statements (which inculpated defendant), the inference necessarily followed that Christopher did lie in her trial testimony (which exculpated defendant). On that record, the prosecutor\u2019s argument that she believed\u2014as both witness and advocate\u2014that defendant was guilty only intensified the prejudice of her trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">\n<em>(ii) Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">Every criminal defendant has a constitutional right to competent legal representation. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pope </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 412, 424 [152 Cal.Rptr. 732, 590 P.2d 859]; U.S. Const., Amends. VI, XIV; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 15.) To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the accused must show that the trial attorney\u2019s representation was deficient, in that it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and that the accused was prejudiced by the trial attorney\u2019s deficient performance. <em>(Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 668, 687-688 [104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064-2065, 80 L.Ed.2d 674]; <em>People v. Ledesma </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 171, 216-217 [233 Cal.Rptr. 404, 729 P.2d 839].) To establish prejudice, the accused must show that but for the trial attorney\u2019s assertedly deficient representation it was reasonably probable that the outcome of the proceeding would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>been more favorable to the accused. <em>(Strickland v. Washington, supra, </em>466 U.S. at pp. 688, 693-694 [104 S.Ct. at pp. 2064-2065, 2067-2068]; <em>People v. Ledesma, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at pp. 215-218.)</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Errors and omissions of defendant\u2019s trial attorney denied her the right to trial court adjudication of whether the prosecutor should take the stand as a witness, whether certain questions she answered were objectionable, whether she should withdraw from the case afterward, whether certain argument she made was objectionable, and whether the jury should receive ameliorative admonition. Had he raised those issues, the trial court could have exercised its plenary authority to conform the conduct of the trial to the requirements of due process (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 128, subd. (a)(5)): \u201cEvery court shall have the power . . . . [f| . . . [1] [t]o control in furtherance of justice, the conduct of its ministerial officers, and of all other persons in any manner connected with a judicial proceeding before it, in every matter pertaining thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The errors and omissions of defendant\u2019s trial attorney created a reasonable probability of a less favorable outcome than if he had represented her competently. <em>(Strickland v. Washington, supra, </em>466 U.S. at pp. 688, 693-694 [104 S.Ct. at pp. 2064-2065, 2067-2068]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ledesma, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at pp. 215-218.) His representation was both deficient and prejudicial. <em>(Strickland v. Washington, supra, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-688 [104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064-2065]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ledesma, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 171, 216-217.)</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">For the reasons stated, the judgment is reversed and the matter is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">Cornell, J., and Polley, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b769-14\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 916.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b780-9\">Judge of the Tuolumne Superior Court, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
