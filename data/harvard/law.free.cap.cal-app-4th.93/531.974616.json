We conclude that coverage cannot be ruled out merely because the trusses were not rotten. An insurer promising coverage for collapse due to \u201chidden decay,\u201d without limiting the scope of the term to organic decay, is liable on claims for any collapse caused by a concealed process of gradual loss in the strength of building materials, unless other policy terms limit coverage. Under this policy and the circumstances of this case, the insured could reasonably expect coverage for an imminent collapse caused by the weakening roof trusses, unless the failure was caused by defective materials or construction methods.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Stamm Theatres, Inc., and its co-owners George F. Stamm and Mary Ann Bolaceo (collectively, Stamm) sued Hartford Casualty Insurance Company (Hartford), among other defendants. Hartford had sold Stamm a commercial property insurance policy for a movie theater in Antioch, California. Stamm alleged that cracks in the theater\u2019s roof trusses were covered by a policy provision promising to pay for damage \u201cinvolving collapse of a building\u201d caused by \u201c[h]idden decay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Hartford successfully moved for summary adjudication based on a ruling by the trial court that \u201cdecay\u201d is synonymous with rot or decomposition of organic material. The only issue remaining for trial was whether Hartford had wrongfully refused to pay for temporarily shoring up the building while Hartford was investigating the claim. A jury awarded Stamm $114,700 for the costs of shoring, finding in a special verdict that Hartford had promised to pay for the shoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">Stamm appeals, contending the trial court imposed an unduly restrictive interpretation on the policy term \u201cdecay.\u201d Hartford also appeals. It claims the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict, and the trial court committed prejudicial error in formulating the special verdict form and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>responding to a query from the jury. We agree with Stamm that the court\u2019s definition of \u201cdecay\u201d was too narrow, and summary adjudication was erroneously granted. In the unpublished portion of our opinion, we reject Hartford\u2019s claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Stamm\u2019s theater was built around 1948. The policy at issue covered the period from July 1, 1996, to July 1, 1997. The relevant provisions are in a section entitled \u201cAdditional Coverage\u2014Collapse.\u201d They state:</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">\u201cWe will pay for loss or damage caused by or resulting from risks of direct physical loss involving collapse of a building or any part of a building caused only by one of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-9\">\u201c1. The \u2018specified causes of loss\u2019 or breakage of building glass, all only as insured against in this Coverage Part;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-10\">\u201c2. Hidden decay;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-11\">\u201c3. Hidden insect or vermin damage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-12\">\u201c4. Weight of people or personal property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-13\">\u201c5. Weight of rain that collects on a roof;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-14\">\u201c6. Use of defective material or methods in construction, remodeling or renovation if the collapse occurs during the course of this construction, remodeling or renovation, [t] ... [10</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-15\">\u201cCollapse does not included [sic] settling, cracking, shrinkage, bulging or expansion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-16\">The \u201cspecified causes of loss\u201d are \u201c[f]ire; lightning; explosion; windstorm or hail; smoke; aircraft or vehicles; riot or civil commotion; vandalism; leakage from fire extinguishing equipment; sinkhole collapse; volcanic action; falling objects; weight of snow, ice or sleet; water damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-17\">On June 9, 1997, Stamm notified Hartford that ceiling plaster in the theater was falling and cracking. On June 17, an engineer retained by Hartford inspected the building and found it was in a state of \u201cimminent collapse.\u201d The theater\u2019s roof was supported by wooden \u201cbowstring\u201d trusses, with curved top chords, straight horizontal bottom chords, and diagonal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>members running between the top and bottom chords. Several of the bottom chords had cracked completely through where they joined diagonal web members.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">A claims adjuster hired by Hartford, Douglas Bailey, accompanied the engineer on the June 17 inspection. Bailey, the engineer, and George Stamm discussed the need for shoring up the ceiling. George Stamm testified that Bailey made a telephone call to Hartford, then told him Hartford had \u201cauthorized\u201d the erection of shoring. Shoring was installed on June 19 and 20, 1997. Hartford\u2019s regional claims adjustor for large first party property damage claims, Allen Holland, visited the theater on June 19. Holland testified that he orally advised George Stamm that the shoring might or might not be covered. On June 19, Holland took over the claim and left a message for Bailey to close his file. Bailey did not get the message until the next day. Earlier on the 20th, before he learned he had been relieved, Bailey placed a phone call to the contractor in charge of the shoring. Bailey\u2019s notes of the call stated, \u201ctemporary towers begun at authorization of A1 Holland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">George Stamm signed a work authorization form on which the contractor had written, \u201cthere may not be insurance coverage. If no coverage owner agrees to pay.\u201d George Stamm testified that since Hartford had already authorized the shoring, he understood he would not have to pay for that, although coverage for the damage to the roof was still in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">On August 4, 1998, Hartford denied coverage for the failure of the roof trusses. The shoring was still in place, at a monthly cost of $4,800.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The parties asked the trial court for a pretrial ruling on the meaning of the term \u201chidden decay.\u201d The court decided that \u201cdecay\u201d is \u201csynonymous with the words rot and decomposition. Rot or decomposition is the destruction of organic matter as a result of bacteria, fungus, insects, vermin or like action.\u201d The court also noted that decay is often the result of water damage. Hartford\u2019s motion for summary adjudication was premised on this definition. For purposes of the motion, Hartford conceded that the roof of the theater had collapsed. (See <em>Doheny West Homeowners\u2019 Assn. v. American Guarantee &amp; Liability Ins. Co. </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 400, 406 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 260] [collapse coverage applies to both actual and imminent collapse].)</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">Hartford noted that both of Stamm\u2019s experts said they saw no evidence of decay in the roof trusses. Joshua Kardon, Stamm\u2019s structural engineer, attributed the failure of the trusses to the increased load created by a partial reroofmg, to repeated cycles of elevated temperatures over the years which degraded the strength of the truss members, and to the presence of knots in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>the bottom chords. Kardon identified the degradation due to temperature differences as the primary factor. He had inspected the theater and saw no evidence of decay, which to him meant rot caused by some microscopic agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Hartford also relied on the conclusions of Stephen Quarles, a wood scientist retained as an expert witness by Stamm. Quarles had not inspected the theater himself, but he reviewed Kardon\u2019s work and the reports of Hartford\u2019s engineers. Quarles did not believe that temperature fluctuations alone were a factor, but placed primary responsibility for the collapse on cycles of high and low humidity which, over time, eroded the ability of the wooden trusses to withstand their load. Quarles placed secondary importance on the presence of knots, and acknowledged a nominal amount of overloading. He stated that \u201cas a wood person\u201d he defined \u201cwood decay\u201d differently than the dictionary. To him, it meant \u201cfungal degradation of the wood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Hartford\u2019s structural engineers, Patrick Buscovich and Kenneth Smetts, jointly produced a report concluding the collapse was caused by \u201coverstress in the bottom chord members in comparison to their axial load capacity.\u201d Hartford characterized this finding as one of \u201cdesign defect\u201d (though it did not rely on the policy provision covering collapse due to \u201cdefective material or methods in construction ... if the collapse occurs during the course of this construction\u201d). These engineers had inspected the trusses and found them clean and dry but cracked, with no apparent fungal growth, mold, insect damage, or wet or dry rot.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">In its opposition to the summary adjudication motion, Stamm noted that Buscovich and Smetts conceded the trusses complied with all building regulations in effect when the theater was built. In view of that fact, and the fact that the trusses had borne the load placed on them for 49 years, Stamm argued the collapse could not be attributed to a design defect. Stamm pointed out that the trial court\u2019s ruling on the meaning of \u201chidden decay\u201d included invasion by water as a factor that may cause decay. Stamm contended this element of the court\u2019s definition was satisfied by Quarles\u2019s conclusion that cycles of moisture and dryness in the wood had caused it to lose strength.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">In its ruling granting summary adjudication, the trial court rejected Stamm\u2019s arguments, stating \u201cmoisture in the air is not a foreign agent as humidity is a natural condition.\u201d The court noted \u201cthe policy excluded shrinkage or expansion which ostensibly results from moisture in the air.\u201d The court reiterated that decay means the destruction of organic matter by rot or decomposition, and concluded \u201cthe reaction of the wooden roof trusses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>at the theatre to heat and moisture in the air that existed from the time of construction onward is a wear and tear factor and not a catastrophe of the type that the policy is intended to cover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">1. <em>Summary Adjudication Was Improper</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">We review the trial court\u2019s grant of summary adjudication de novo, to determine whether the moving and opposing papers show a triable issue of material fact. <em>(Maxconn Inc. v.

[Citation.] If the policy language \u2018is clear and explicit, it governs.\u2019 [Citation.]</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">\u201cWhen interpreting a policy provision, we must give its terms their \u2018 \u201cordinary and popular sense,\u201d unless \u201cused by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] We must also interpret these terms \u2018in context\u2019 [citation], and give effect \u2018to every part\u2019 of the policy with \u2018each clause helping to interpret the other.\u2019 [Citations.]</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">\u201cA policy provision is ambiguous only if it is susceptible to two or more reasonable constructions despite the plain meaning of its terms within the context of the policy as a whole. [Citation.] The court may then \u2018invoke the principle that ambiguities are generally construed against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist (i.e., the insurer) in order to protect the insured\u2019s reasonable expectation of coverage.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Palmer v. Truck Ins. Exchange </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1109, 1115, italics omitted [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 647, 988 P.2d 568].)</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">\u201c \u2018[I]f the terms of a promise are in any respect ambiguous or uncertain, it must be interpreted in the sense in which the promisor believed, at the time of making it, that the promisee understood it.\u2019 [Citations.] This rule, as applied to a promise of coverage in an insurance policy, protects not the subjective beliefs of the insurer but, rather, \u2018the objectively reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>expectations of the insured.\u2019 [Citation.] Only if this rule does not resolve the ambiguity do we then resolve it against the insurer. [Citation.]</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\u201cIn summary, a court that is faced with an argument for coverage based on assertedly ambiguous policy language must first attempt to determine whether coverage is consistent with the insured\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations. In so doing, the court must interpret the language in context, with regard to its intended function in the policy. [Citation.] This is because <em>\u2018language in a contract </em>must be construed in the context of that instrument as a whole, and in the circumstances of that case, and <em>cannot be found to be ambiguous in the abstract. </em>\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Bank of the West v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1264-1265 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545], italics in original; see also <em>Mez Industries, Inc. v. Pacific Nat. Ins. Co. </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 856, 869 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 721] [\u201cAn insured will not be able successfully to claim coverage where a reasonable person would not expect it.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Stamm contends the policy term \u201cdecay\u201d is broadly synonymous with deterioration, connoting a decline in strength or soundness. If ambiguity arises from the narrower connotation of \u201cdecay\u201d as rot or decomposition, Stamm claims the ambiguity must be resolved against Hartford, under the settled principles stated above. This argument is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">\u201cIn seeking to ascertain the ordinary sense of words, courts in insurance cases regularly turn to general dictionaries. [Citations.] [%| Likewise, courts in noninsurance contexts turn to general dictionaries when they seek to ascertain the \u2018ordinary\u2019 meaning of words used in a statute. [Citations.] [Tf] Indeed, courts in both insurance and noninsurance contexts regularly use the phrase \u2018ordinary dictionary definition [or meaning]\u2019 as if \u2018ordinary\u2019 were synonymous with \u2018dictionary.\u2019 [Citations.] ... It is thus safe to say that the \u2018ordinary\u2019 sense of a word is to be found in its dictionary definition.![<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]\u201d <em>(Scott v. Continental Ins. Co. </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 24, 29-30 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 566].)</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">Stamm correctly points out that dictionaries define \u201cdecay\u201d broadly as gradual deterioration, and also more narrowly as decomposition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>organic matter. Most dictionaries give the more general definition first.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the context of this property insurance policy, we note at the outset that the \u201crot\u201d definition adopted by the trial court excludes the deterioration of such common inorganic building materials as cement, brick, stone, and steel. This immediately suggests an unduly narrow limitation; a reasonable insured could surely expect coverage if an imminent collapse was brought on by hidden decay in such materials, which cannot \u201crot.\u201d While \u201cdecay\u201d as applied to wooden components may first bring to mind the notion of \u201crot,\u201d the broader connotation of gradual loss of strength is also an ordinary meaning of the term, and is fully consistent with the intended function of the policy term \u201chidden decay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Hartford argues that the broader definition of \u201cdecay\u201d \u201cis circular as virtually all structures that collapse do so because of a decline in structural strength or soundness.\u201d However, not all collapses are due to a <em>gradual </em>process of deterioration. The \u201cspecified causes of loss\u201d in Hartford\u2019s collapse coverage include numerous potential causes that clearly do not amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>to \u201cdecay\u201d in the broader sense: \u201cFire; lightning; explosion; windstorm . . . aircraft or vehicles; riot or civil commotion; vandalism; leakage from fire extinguishing equipment; sinkhole collapse; volcanic action; falling objects; weight of snow, ice or sleet . . . .\u201d Furthermore, many signs of decay are obvious and thus would never fall within the policy\u2019s coverage for \u201chidden decay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Hartford also insists that a broad definition of \u201cdecay\u201d would transform the policy into a maintenance agreement. We disagree. The coverage provisions at issue come into play only when a building is in a state of collapse, well beyond the point at which ordinary maintenance would be called for. Moreover, maintenance is typically performed on detectable forms of deterioration, not on \u201chidden decay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">In its pretrial ruling defining \u201chidden decay\u201d as rot or organic decomposition, the trial court reasoned that other parts of the policy suggest no coverage was intended for \u201cnatural decline.\u201d The court noted the policy exclusion for damage caused by \u201cwear and tear,\u201d and the specification that collapse does not include settling, cracking, shrinkage, bulging or expansion. The court decided that a broad reading of \u201cdecay\u201d would render those provisions meaningless. It stated, \u201c[mjore importantly, a reading of the policy as a whole makes it clear that the general tenor of the policy is coverage for catastrophe or calamity and not to provide for loss simply caused by either the passage of time or the use of inferior building materials.\u201d We are not persuaded by this reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">If Hartford did not intend to create a reasonable expectation of coverage for collapse due to \u201cnatural decline,\u201d it could have used a term other than \u201cdecay.\u201d More limited terminology was certainly available to the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">The exclusion for \u201cwear and tear\u201d does not impose or imply a restriction on the coverage for collapse caused by \u201chidden decay.\u201d The \u201cwear and tear\u201d exclusion is immediately followed by an exclusion for damage caused by \u201crust, corrosion, fungus, <em>decay, </em>deterioration, hidden or latent defect or any quality in property that causes it to damage or destroy itself.\u201d (Italics added.) There is also an exclusion for \u201c[cjollapse, except as provided below in the Additional Coverage for Collapse.\u201d Obviously, Hartford\u2019s collapse coverage was not meant to be limited by the generally applicable policy exclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">The meaning of the statement in the collapse coverage provisions that \u201c[cjollapse does not included [sic] settling, cracking, shrinkage, bulging or expansion\u201d is not immediately clear. It is difficult indeed to imagine a building collapsing without any of these symptoms appearing. The only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>reasonable interpretation of this language is that <em>mere </em>settling, cracking, shrinkage, bulging or expansion is not enough\u2014there must also be an actual or imminent collapse of the structure. <em>(Doheny West Homeowners \u2019 Assn. v. American Guarantee &amp; Liability Ins. Co., supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th at pp. 405-406.) Therefore, this provision does not militate against a reasonable expectation of coverage for imminent collapse caused by cracking resulting from hidden, gradual deterioration.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">We agree with the trial court that the collapse coverage contemplates a catastrophic or calamitous event\u2014the actual or imminent collapse of a building will always meet that description. But the policy clearly includes causes of collapse that typically occur gradually, such as \u201c[h]idden insect or vermin damage,\u201d and \u201cwater damage.\u201d \u201cHidden decay\u201d in the form of a gradual loss of strength in wooden timbers is not so different in kind from these causes as to deviate from the intended scope of Hartford\u2019s collapse coverage. Moreover, the collapse of Stamm\u2019s theater cannot be attributed simply to the passage of time. Stamm\u2019s wood expert, Stephen Quarles, believed the roof trusses gave way because of deterioration at the cellular level caused by the migration of water molecules in and out of the wood over the years, as the ambient humidity level fluctuated. It was not unreasonable for Stamm to expect coverage for \u201chidden decay\u201d caused by such progressive physical deterioration, given the dictionary definition of \u201cdecay\u201d as gradual deterioration to a weakened state.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Finally, the trial court\u2019s reference to \u201cinferior building materials\u201d properly relates to concerns addressed in the policy provision covering collapse caused by defective materials or construction methods, but only if the collapse occurs during the course of construction. However, Hartford did not seek summary adjudication based on that provision, probably because its application would involve triable issues of fact. As Stamm pointed out below, its theater conformed with all applicable building regulations when it was constructed, arid the building had stood for 49 years. Quarles acknowledged that knots in the wood were a contributing factor, but assigned primary significance to the gradual loss of strength caused by humidity changes. Coverage under Stamm\u2019s all-risk first party property insurance policy depends on whether a covered risk was the efficient proximate cause of the loss. <em>(State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Von Der Lieth </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 1123, 1131-1132 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 183, 820 P.2d 285, 30 A.L.R.5th 786]; <em>Pieper </em>v. <em>Commercial Underwriters Ins. Co. </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1008, 1018-1020 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 551].) If the trial court meant to suggest that the collapse in this case was caused by defective materials, it erred by predetermining an issue of fact that was not resolved by the parties\u2019 moving and responding papers.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>\u201c[W]e cannot escape the rule that words in an insurance policy are to be construed in their ordinary sense, even if that sense provides a definition a little less tidy than some litigants, and perhaps the courts, might desire. When ordinary people do not understand the meaning of a word .... [t]hey turn to a dictionary.\u201d <em>(Scott v. Continental Ins. Co., supra, </em>44 Cal.App.4th at p. 30, fn. omitted.) Stamm, after consulting any dictionary, would have good reason to be optimistic about its insurance coverage in this case. Hartford could have limited its collapse coverage for hidden deterioration to damage caused by organic decomposition. Its choice of the general term \u201cdecay\u201d is the source of any ambiguity arising from the coexistence of the broader and more limited definitions of the word. \u201cBecause the insurer writes the policy, it is held \u2018responsible\u2019 for ambiguous policy language, which is therefore construed in favor of coverage.\u201d <em>(AIU Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 807, 822 [274 Cal.Rptr. 820, 799 P.2d 1253].)
