B.; for his agency he was to receive compensation, to be liquidated in a manner pointed out in the agreement. Property to a considerable amount was recovered. The value of the plaintiff\u2019s services was certified at $4817,84, and he brought this action to recover the amount thereof. The declaration demanded $9635,68, and contained two counts; the first setting forth the special agreement, averring that the plaintiff had devoted time, services and money to the business, and recovered a large estate for the intestate, and that he was ready and willing to give the security provided for, <em>but no such security was required of him; </em>it set forth the liquidation of his compensation at $4817,-84, and demanded that sum in the first count. The second count was on a <em>quantum meruit, </em>demanding a like sum of $4817,84. The plaintiff had a verdict of $7000. The defendants moved for a new trial, which was\u2014granted, on the grounds, 1. That the plaintiff had not proved that he had <em>offered the security </em>stipulated in the contract; 2. That the verdict was for a sum greater than was demanded in either count, and that he cannot recover on both, Willes, 65 ; 5 Co. 22, b.; and 3. That the verdict was not warranted by the evidence.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
