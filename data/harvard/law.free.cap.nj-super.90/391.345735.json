A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Ax5\">Plaintiff local union appeals from the involuntary dismissal of its action to collect a fine levied upon defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Defendant, a member of Division 1478 of the Amalgamated Association of Street, Electric Bailway and Motor Coach Employees of America (Amalgamated), was employed as a bus operator by Somerset Bus Co. Inc., Mountainside, New Jersey. On May 23, 1963 a fine in the sum of $50 was assessed against him for infraction of union rules (violation of a union order prohibiting members of the local from entering the dispatcher\u2019s office and answering telephone calls). Upon his failure to pay, the present action was instituted in the Middlesex County District Court to recover the amount of the fine. In granting defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, the trial judge ruled that the subject matter of the controversy was preempted by the Labor Management Delations Act of 1947, as amended, 61 <em>Stat. </em>136 <em>et seq., </em>29 <em>U. S. G. </em>\u00a7 141 <em>et seq., </em>particularly \u00a7\u00a7 157 and 158(b), hence the court was without jurisdiction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">When an activity is <em>arguably </em>subject to \u00a7 7 or \u00a7 8 of the act, the state as well as the federal court must defer to the exclusive competence of the National Labor Belations Board if the danger of state interference with national policy is to be averted. <em>San Diego Bldg. Trades Council, etc. v. Garmon, </em>359 <em>U. S. </em>236, 79 <em>S. Ct. </em>773, 3 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>775 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>(1959). In the instant case the activity involved was not arguably subject to either section referred to. Neither defendant\u2019s union membership nor his employment status was in any wise involved. He continued to be employed by the bus company in the same capacity as before. The matter was \u25a0one purely internal to the union. <em>International Ass\u2019n of Machinists v. Gonzales, </em>356 <em>U. S. </em>617, 78 <em>S. Ct. </em>923, 2 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>1018 (1958); <em>Local </em>100, <em>United Ass\u2019n of Journeymen and Apprentices v. Borden, </em>373 <em>U. S. </em>690, 83 <em>S. Ct. </em>1423, 10 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>638 (1963); <em>Local No. </em>207, <em>Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Bridge, etc. Workers\u2019 Union v. Perko, </em>373 <em>U. S. </em>701, 83 <em>S. Ct. </em>1429, 10 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>646 (1963); see Annotation, \u201cFederal Labor Relations Acts as affecting state court jurisdiction of suits between member of labor union and union,\u201d 10 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>1200 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">We hold, therefore, that in the narrow field with which the court was concerned, jurisdiction was not preempted and the court was vested with jurisdiction to determine the controversy. <em>United Auto, etc. Workers of America C. I. O.-A. F. L. Local 756 v. Woychik, </em>5 <em>Wis. 2d </em>528, 93 <em>N. W. 2d </em>336 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1958); compare <em>Retail Clerks Local </em>629 <em>v. Christiansen, </em>67 <em>Wash. Dec. 2d </em>29, 406 <em>P. 2d </em>327 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The judgment is accordingly reversed and the case remanded to the county district court for trial on the merits, subject to the defenses, other than preemption, which have been pleaded by defendant. We express no opinion as to the merits of those defenses.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
