J. S. </em>2A:44-20 <em>et seq., </em>and that Rapp was a \u201cgarage keeper\u201d within the statutory definition, <em>N. J. 8. </em>2AT4-20. He admittedly was in the business of welding and diesel service and had a fixed place used in his repair business, which included repairs to tractors such as that herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">It follows then, as Judge Camarata correctly ruled in the Essex Corinty Court, that defendant\u2019s garage keeper\u2019s lien was inferior to the lien of plaintiff bank on this tractor held by virtue of the prior conditional sale agreement properly re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>corded and assigned to it, as specifically provided by <em>N. J. S. 2AA4-21.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">The garage keeper\u2019s lien act contains no definition of a \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d but see <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39 :1-1, the Motor Vehicle and Traffic Act, <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>39:10-2, the Motor Vehicle Certificate of Ownership Law, <em>N. J. 8. </em>2A:127-1, a section of the criminal law, and <em>N. J. 8. </em>2A:171-1.2, the Sunday Law, in which the definition of a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d would embrace a motorized tractor and \u201call vehicles propelled otherwise than by muscular power, excepting such vehicles as run only upon rails or tracks.\u201d The \u201crails or tracks\u201d in the exception evidently refer to the conventional type of rails and tracks upon which trains run, or upon which the now obsolete street cars formerly ran. <em>Kolankiewiz v. </em>Burke, 91 <em>N. J. L. </em>567 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1918). See, too, <em>Lambert v. Southern Counties Gas Company of </em>Cal., 52 <em>Cal. 2d </em>347, 340 <em>P. 2d </em>608, 611 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1959), holding that a self-propelled caterpillar tractor equipped with a bulldozer blade was a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d within the terms of the California Vehicle Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Finding that defendant was entitled to a statutory garage keeper\u2019s lien under a statute which expressly subordinated that lien to the lien created by a prior properly recorded conditional sale agreement, defendant\u2019s claim to a common law artisan\u2019s lien and priority by virtue thereof lacks validity. Uniform Commercial Code, <em>N. J. S. </em>12A:9-310; <em>B. C. S. Corp. v. </em>Frick, 19 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>129, 18 <em>A. 2d 560 (D. Ct. </em>1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
