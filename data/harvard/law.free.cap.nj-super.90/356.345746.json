Plaintiff knew the substance of the information sought by the interrogatories, insofar as persons connected with the tavern, like Ilendley, were concerned. Moreover, the testimony adduced was in effect cumulative of other evidence in the record, and was to some extent helpful to plaintiff. There was no mistaken exercise of discretion by the trial court, although the court could well have tided the other way.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">We are further of the view that the trial court ruled correctly in denying plaintiff\u2019s request for an instruction to the jury that defendant was required to prove the decedent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>contributory negligence \u201cby clear and convincing proof,\u201d in consequence of <em>N. J. S'. </em>2A:81~2 <em>(L. </em>1960, c. 52) (Dead Man\u2019s Act). The statutory requirement that the plaintiff sues in a representative capacity means in a capacity representative of the decedent or his estate. The nominal party in a wrongful death action, as here, is not a representative of the decedent but of the statutory class of beneficiaries of the action. The Dead Man\u2019s Act is therefore not applicable. We express no opinion on the broader question whether the act applies at all in negligence actions. See <em>Buska v. </em>Aquinaldo, 84 <em>N. J. Super. </em>577 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
