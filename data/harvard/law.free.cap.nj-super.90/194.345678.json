S. 11:15-2 </em>calls upon the Commission to enumerate in its rules the reasons which shall be considered \u201cjust cause\u201d for removal of an employee in the permanent classified service after completion of his working test period. <em>Civil Service Rule </em>59 was promulgated pursuant to that mandate; one of the causes for removal is \u201c(c) Incompetency or inefficiency in the service or incapacity due to mental or physical disability.\u201d Appellant challenges the rule, claiming that mental incapacity \u201cis incongruous in the setting of <em>Rule </em>59 and does not constitute just cause for removal, absent some showing that the employee is incompetent or inefficient in the performance of his duties.\u201d We do not agree. The Legislature gave the Commission the task of filling in the details of what constitutes \u201cjust cause.\u201d It has attempted to do so in order \u201cto secure for government * * * efficient public service in all its many functions\u201d \u2014 the primary object and purpose of the Civil Service Act. <em>Borough of Park Ridge v. Salimone, 21 N. J. </em>28, 44 (1956). One can imagine of little that is more destructive of the public service than having a mentally affected person care for the recreational needs of mentally disturbed patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">Appellant also claims that the appointing authority abused discretion in denying his request for a leave of absence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>from March \u00a39 to September 18, 1983. His application was turned down by letter of April 25, 1963, stating that unless he reported for work by May 3 he would be separated from service under <em>Civil Service Rule </em>59. When he did not return, he was sent a preliminary notice of disciplinary action on May 17, fixing May 22 as the date of hearing. <em>Civil Service Rule </em>65 gave appellant 20 days to appeal the disapproval to the Commission. He failed to do so and therefore must be considered as having foregone his right. We note, incidentally, that the claim of abuse of discretion in denying his request for a leave is raised for the first time on appeal. In any event, we find no such abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">We find no merit in appellant\u2019s further contention that he was not given a fair hearing before the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Appellant also argues that the evidence did not support the finding of mental incapacity. The Commission\u2019s conclusions and order are supported by substantial credible evidence on the whole of the record. See <em>Campbell v. Dept. of Civil Service, </em>39 <em>N. J. </em>556, 562 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\"> We need not consider the contention, made in passing, that appellant could not be removed under <em>Rule </em>59(c) because his disability was work-connected. He never sought review of this claim by application to the Commission. See <em>N. J. S. A. </em>11:14-2 (second paragraph). We view the claims of harassment on the job as exaggerated, or perhaps even imagined. But that aside, there is no proof that such harassment was the cause of appellant\u2019s disability; his medical expert was not certain as to the etiological factors which brought on the condition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
