J. 8. A. </em>34: 15-43, without respondent\u2019s right to reimbursement therefor, under <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>34: 15-40, from monies received by the employee from a third-party tortfeasor. The Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation ruled that respondent had no right to reimbursement. On appeal, the County Court held otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">We conclude that the judgment of the County Court must be affirmed, essentially for the reasons expressed in the opinion of Judge Schulman, reported at 85 <em>N. J. Super. </em>586 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1964).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
