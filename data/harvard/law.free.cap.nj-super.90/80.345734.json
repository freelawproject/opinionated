We find no merit in defendants\u2019 contention that enforcement of a wage assignment under <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>17:10-18, part of the Small Loan Law, violates the provisions of <em>N. J. Const., Art. </em>I, <em>par. </em>1, and <em>Art. </em>IV, \u00a7 VII, <em>pars. </em>7, 8 and 9, and the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>tution. Nor is their argument that the county district court was without jurisdiction sound. This is not a case of a wage assignment relating to a future contract of employment, in which case the claim for relief would be purely equitable. 6 <em>Am. Jur. 2d, Assignments, sec. </em>46, <em>p. </em>229 <em>et seq. </em>(1963). The assignor was an employee of defendants at the time he executed the wage assignment and when it was served; and the fact that there subsequently was a brief break in his continuity of service did not defeat the effectiveness of the assignment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
