Thompson died domiciled in Essex County, New Jersey on June 13, 1960 and his will, dated April 28, 1960, provided in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-12\">\u201cFifth: I g-ive, devise and bequeath to my wife, Helen Lapp Thompson, if she survives me, <em>an amount equal to fifty percent of my entire estate. </em>The within gift to my wife shall be payable twenty percent one year after my decease, twenty percent two years after my decease, twenty percent three years after my decease, twenty percent four years after my decease, and twenty percent five years after my decease.\u201d (Italics ours)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-13\">Decedent\u2019s estate greatly increased in value between the date of his death and the date when the executor was to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>distribution. The Essex County Court, Probate Division, construed the above testamentary provision to mean that decedent\u2019s wife, who survived him, was entitled to \u201cfifty percent of the value of the estate of said testator determined as of the date of distributions to her and not as of the date of the testator\u2019s death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The executor appeals from the County Court judgment so construing the above provision. It maintains that the use of the word \u201camount\u201d indicates an intent on the testator\u2019s part to create a <em>general </em>legacy, and not a specific one, thus requiring calculation of the <em>quantum </em>of the legacy by the designated formula as of the date of testator\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The will also bequeathed to the wife all of decedent\u2019s household furniture, furnishings, jewelry and automobiles. There were several legacies payable to other named beneficiaries, \u201cwithout interest,\u201d at such time as the executor and trustee, in its discretion, might determine, \u201cbut within five years after my decease.\u201d The residuary estate was then given to the trustee \u201cto pay the net income therefrom to my wife, Helen Lapp Thompson, during her life, in monthly installments, beginning on the first day of the month next following the date of my death.\u201d Upon the wife\u2019s death, the income was payable to decedent\u2019s mother-in-law during her lifetime. The trustee was given discretionary power to invade the <em>corpus </em>of the trust to maintain the standard of living of the wife and mother-in-law. Upon their deaths, the trustee was directed to use the balance for designated charitable purposes.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">\u201cA general legacy is defined as a bequest of personal property payable out of the general assets of the testator\u2019s estate rather than from specific property included therein. * * * A specific legacy is defined as a bequest of personal property <em>in specie </em>and not payable from other assets of the estate. * * * It may be all or part of the specified property or fund. * * * In the absence of provision to the contrary, specific legacies of property carry with them all accessions and accretions thereto after the testator\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Busch v. Plews, 12 N. J. </em>352, 356 (1953).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>As stated, in 4 <em>Page on </em>Wills, \u00a71599, <em>pp. </em>552-3:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">\u201cA general legacy, other than a gift of testator\u2019s entire estate or a fraction or residue thereof does not carry income and profits before it is due * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">A gift of all of testator\u2019s estate, or a fraction thereof, or the residue thereof, passes all income and increment not otherwise disposed of * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">In the instant case, if the testator had devised and bequeathed 50% of his entire estate to his wife, that would have been a specific devise and bequest, and she would have been entitled to all accretions thereto after the testator\u2019s death and until the time of distribution. But, as the trial court herein properly concluded, the bequest in paragraph Fifth was in the nature of a general legacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\"> Notwithstanding this finding of a general legacy, the trial court observed :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-9\">\u201cThis court is not interested in labels as to whether the legacy was specific or general and seeks to ascertain the plan and purpose of the testator as gathered from the language of the entire Will and the attendant circumstances. <em>In re Armour [Estate], </em>11 N. <em>J. </em>257, 269 (1953).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">Of course, the testatorial intent is of great importance but, at the same time, \u201c[i]t is elementary principle in the construction of wills that the controlling consideration is the effect of the words as actually written rather than the actual intention of the testator independently of the written words.\u201d <em>In re Armour\u2019s </em>Estate, supra, 11 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>271.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">The trial court stated in its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-12\">\u201cIn the case at bar, the decedent saw fit to leave his wife <em>a fraction of Ms estate </em>rather than a specified dollar sum thereby distinguishing the eases cited by the executor.\u201d (Italics ours)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">That was not entirely accurate. Testator did not leave his wife \u201ca fraction of his estate.\u201d He gave her an \u201camount equal to fifty percent of my entire estate.\u201d \u201cEntire estate\u201d evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>dently referred to its gross value, -without regard to diminution thereof resulting from the other provisions of the will. The language employed by the expert scrivener of this will shows an awareness of its technical legal effect. The distinction between giving \u201cone-half of my estate\u201d and \u201can amount equal to one-half of my estate\u201d is well recognized in estate planning.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-4\">\u201cWhen a legacy is given to a surviving spouse based on a formula, such as \u2018an amount equal to one-half of my adjusted gross estate,\u2019 such legacy is presumably intended to be a pecuniary legacy requiring the computation of the exact number of dollars. Since the adjusted gross estate will be based on the values in the federal estate tax return, any fluctuation in the values of the assets of the estate between the values determined for federal estate tax purposes and the values on the date of distribution should not affect the number of dollars to which the wife is entitled. If the assets increase in value, the residuary legatees will benefit; if they decrease, the residuary legatees will bear the shrinkage. If the testator does not want this result\u2014and in an inflationary period he may wish his wife to benefit from increases in asset values\u2014the gift to the surviving spouse can be a fractional share of the residuary estate.\u201d PLI monograph, \u201cDrawing Wills,\u201d by Schwarzberg and Stocker (April 1963 <em>ed.) p. </em>63.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-5\"> <em>In re McDonnell\u2019s </em>Will, 45 <em>Misc. 2d </em>57, <em>256 N. Y. S. 2d </em>149, 151 <em>(Surr. Ct. </em>1965), expresses the rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">\u201cThe language employed in fixing the share of the widow refers to an \u2018amount\u2019 which term, in the absence of other provisions indicating to the contrary, has been held to signify a fixed dollar amount or to create a pecuniary type legacy, which legacy does not share in subsequent appreciations <em>(Matter of Gilmour\u2019s Estate, </em>18 <em>A. D. 2d </em>154, 238 <em>N. Y. S. 2d </em>624).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-7\"><em>Gilmour\u2019s Estate </em>recognizes the narrow but well-established distinction between a pecuniary formula clause, usually indicated by words such as \u201can amount equal to,\u201d evidentiary of a testator\u2019s intent to give a fixed amount, and a residuary formula clause, giving a percentage or fraction of the estate. In the former, the widow is not entitled to share in the appreciation of security values to the date of distribution and does not suffer by reason of any shrinkage thereof. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>latter, the widow would share in appreciation and depreciation of the value of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">The provision in the will directing that \u201cthe within gift to my wife\u201d shall be payable at the rate of <em>20% </em>per year over a five-year period, beginning one year after testator\u2019s decease, further indicates an intent to give her a fixed amount, rather than fluctuating sums. The executor has paid the widow the installments due for the years 1961, 1962 and 1963 in cash, totalling $134,643.26. This money was paid out of the general funds of the estate. The executor has never earmarked or segregated the assets to meet the total bequest to the widow. The executor has also paid the widow all the income due her under the trust provision of the will, so that income is not an issue before us. She gets ail of the income for life under the residuary trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">We conclude that the trial court erred in interpreting the bequest in paragraph \u201cFifth,\u201d first noted above, to mean an amount equal to 50% of testator\u2019s entire estate as of the time of distribution. It is our opinion that a proper construction of this clause limits the general legacy provided for therein to 50% of testator\u2019s entire estate as valued at the time of death and without regard to the appreciation in value between the date of death and the date of distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Eeversed and remanded for entry of an order in conformity herewith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
