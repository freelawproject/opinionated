FRANCIS G. BAKER, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b56-5\">Superior Court of New Jersey Appellate Division</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b56-6\">Submitted January 3, 1966</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AR\">Decided January 6, 1966.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b57-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Before Judges Goldmahit, Eoley and Collester.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b57-9\"><em>Mr. A. Leon Kohlreiter, </em>assigned counsel, appeared for appellant <em>(Mr. Heyman Zimel, </em>on the brief).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b57-10\"><em>Mr. Archibald Kreiger, </em>Assistant Prosecutor, appeared for respondent <em>(Mr. John G.

J. 8. </em>2A:94-1) and larceny <em>(N. J. 8. </em>2A:119-2), tried to a jury, found guilty and sentenced. He appeals. The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-12\">Defendant claims error in the charge on the subject of his prior convictions. The court instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-13\">\u201cThe defendant has offered himself as a witness and has testified in his own defense. He has admitted prior convictions of crime. This evidence has been offered and received merely for the purpose of affecting his credibility as a witness. You must consider such prior convictions for the sole purpose of determining his credibility as a witness and for no other purpose whatsoever. Only after doing so and determining whether and to what extent, if any, these convictions do affect his credibility may you give credibility to his testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-14\">Defendant now claims that the last sentence of this charge was prejudicial. Since trial counsel voiced no objection to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>charge as given, defendant\u2019s present contention is projected as plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">The last sentence appears to have been taken from our opinion in <em>State v. McNair, </em>59 <em>N. J. Super. </em>453, 458-459 (1960). We consider that part of the opinion as an inaccurate statement of applicable law. It should not have been included in the charge; instead, the trial judge could have told the jury that \u201cHaving done so, you may or may not conclude that his credibility was affected thereby.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">However, we conclude that there was no plain error, in light of the entire case. Defendant was caught red-handed by a police officer while coming out of a luncheonette, to which he had gained access by breaking through the glass in the front door and then rifling the cash register of $20.35 in coins. He later confessed to the crime but refused to give a written statement. Defendant was clearly guilty, and if the language of the criticized sentence was ill chosen, we nonetheless do not perceive plain error which affected defendant\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Defendant next claims error in the charge with reference to his alleged oral confession because the jury should first have been instructed to decide whether he had, in fact, made such a confession. The judge clearly charged the jury on the issue of the voluntariness of the oral confession which had been testified to by the detectives. <em>State v. Von Atzinger, </em>81 <em>N. J. Super. </em>509, 514-515 <em>(App. Div. </em>1963); <em>State v. Wolf, </em>44 <em>N. J. </em>176, 193-194 (1965). Defendant did not object to any testimony regarding the oral confession. Instead, he denied the confession when he later took the stand. The trial judge did not tell the jury that the confession was in fact made, or that defendant denied making it. That dispute was one of fact for the jury to determine among other factual conflicts, and the court gave adequate instructions as to the jury\u2019s function in that regard. We consider the matter to have been fully covered in the general instructions, so that looking at the charge as a whole, it is clear that the disputed fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>question of whether the confession was made was never taken from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">Defendant attacks the trial court\u2019s reference to his refusal to give a written statement after allegedly having made an oral confession. He admits the instruction to have been a true statement of the law hut claims it was prejudicial in the context of the case. We have re-examined the record and the charge and do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Defendant next claims that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and must be set aside because of mistake on the jury\u2019s part. We find the point without merit, for the record establishes that defendant\u2019s guilt was proved beyond question.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Finally, defendant claims that the oral confession was inadmissible under <em>Escobedo v. State of Illinois, </em>378 <em>U. S. </em>478, 84 <em>S. Ct. </em>1758, 12 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>977 (1964). He concedes that <em>State v. Daley, </em>45 <em>N. J. </em>68, 73-74 (1965), is against him. And see <em>State v. Ordog, </em>45 <em>N. J. </em>347, 362 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
