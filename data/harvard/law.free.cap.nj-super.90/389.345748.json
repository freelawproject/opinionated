Appellant\u2019s only showing at such a hearing, he says, would be that he has become rehabilitated since he committed the offences in question. That fact, however, would not affect the operation in these circumstances of <em>R. S. </em>ll:23-2(d) which disqualifies for appointment to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>civil service position one who has been guilty of \u201cinfamous or notoriously disgraceful conduct.\u201d See <em>Vanderwart v. Dept. of Civil Service, </em>19 <em>N. J. </em>341 (1955). Absent any extenuating circumstances, we hold that driving a motor vehicle while on the revoked list or while intoxicated constitutes conduct within the statutory proscription.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">We do not agree with appellant\u2019s argument that the statute is inapplicable unless the \u201cdisgraceful conduct\u201d is of a nature such as to indicate unfitness to perform the duties of the particular public position involved. No such limitation is set forth in or to be implied from the statutory language. Nor do we read the <em>Vanderwart </em>case, supra, to hold that such a relationship must necessarily appear in order for the statute to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">We find it unnecessary to decide whether appellant\u2019s \u201cundesirable discharge\u201d from the Army bears upon the issues herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
