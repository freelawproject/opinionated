Having concluded that the appeal raises a question of Georgia law that is both determinative of th\u00e9 case and about which this Court had substantial doubt, we certified three questions to the Supreme Court of Georgia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1250-21\">(1) Under the facts of this case, and in the light of the Final Judgment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>Order \u2014 in the Underlying Suit \u2014 approving of and authorizing and directing the implementation of the terms of the settlement agreement, is Piedmont \u201clegally obligated to pay\u201d the $4.9 million settlement amount, for purposes of qualifying for insurance coverage under the Excess Policy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1251-4\">(2) In a case like this one, when an insurance contract contains a \u201ceonsent-to-settle\u201d clause that provides expressly that the insurer\u2019s consent \u201cshall not be unreasonably withheld,\u201d can a court determine, as a matter of law, that an insured who seeks (but fails) to obtain the insurer\u2019s consent before settling is flatly barred \u2014 whether consent was withheld reasonably or not \u2014 from bringing suit for breach of contract or for bad-faith failure to settle? Or must the issue of whether the insurer withheld unreasonably its consent be resolved first?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1251-5\">(3) In this case, under Georgia law, was Piedmont\u2019s complaint dismissed properly?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1251-6\"><em>Piedmont Office Realty Trust, Inc. v. XL Specialty Ins. Co., </em>769 F.3d 1291, 1295 (11th Cir.2014).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1251-7\">Relying on its decision in <em>Trinity Outdoor, LLC v. Cent. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>285 Ga. 583, 679 S.E.2d 10 (2009), and on the \u201cunambiguous\u201d terms of the insurance policy at issue in this case, the Supreme Court of Georgia instructed us that, under Georgia\u2019s law, \u201cPiedmont is precluded from pursuing this action against XL because XL did not consent to the settlement and Piedmont failed to. fulfill the contractually agreed upon condition precedent.\u201d <em>Piedmont Office Realty Trust, Inc. v. XL Specialty Ins. Co., </em>297 Ga. 38, 771 S.E.2d 864, 866 (2015). As a result, the Supreme Court of Georgia determined per Georgia law that \u201cthe district court did not err in dismissing Piedmont\u2019s complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 867.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-10\">We are grateful for the help. Based on this definite response to our certified questions, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Piedmont\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"AaZ\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1251-8\"> The facts for this appeal are set but in our initial opinion. <em>See Piedmont Office Realty Trust, Inc., </em>769 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
