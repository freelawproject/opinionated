That under the laws of Florida, one of the privileges acquired by reason of registration by the Florida Securities Commission as a dealer in securities is the right, upon compliance with provisions set forth in the statute, to renew said registration from year to year; that the provisions upon which this right of renewal is predicated are as follows: (1) a written application for renewal must be filed with the Florida Securities Commission not less than thirty nor more than sixty days before the first day of the ensuing year; (2) the written application for renewal must be accompanied by payment of the fee prescribed by statute; that the statute specifically provides that if these conditions are not complied with, the applications for renewal \u2018shall be treated as original applications\u2019; and that a true and correct copy of a circular letter, dated November 1, 1943, and received from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Florida Securities Commission is hereto attached, marked Exhibit B, and by reference made a part hereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-4\">\u201c7.

Wednesday, January 26, 1944, in the office of the State Treasurer, at the Capitol, in Tallahassee, Florida, and you are hereby required to appear at said hearing and show cause why the Florida Securities Commission should not deny said application on the ground that said applicant has demonstrated its unworthiness to transact the business of a dealer in governmental securities in the State of Florida.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-16\">\u201cBy order of the Florida Securities Commission this fifth day of January, A. D. 1944, at Tallahassee, Florida.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-17\">J. Edwin Larson</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-18\">J. Edwin Larson, Chairman</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiB\">Florida Securities Commission</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-19\">\u201cAttest:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-20\">Juanita Forbes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnV\">Secretary</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>\u201c10. That the action taken by the respondents, as evidenced by the order above quoted, more than five weeks after the filing of the written application of the relator for renewal of registration as aforesaid, and only then after the relator had dispatched a telegram inquiring about said renewal of registration, constitutes an attempt on the part of the respondents to evade full and complete compliance with the peremptory writ of this Honorable Court in this cause; that the registration peremptorily commanded by this Honorable Court was nothing less than a full and complete registration entitling the relator as registrant to all of the privileges incident to such registration, including the privilege of renewing said registration upon compliance with the statutory conditions hereinabove set forth; that in denying to the relator the right to renew upon performance of said conditions, the respondents are to that extent failing to comply with the peremptory writ heretofore issued by this Honorable Court, as aforesaid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">The motion was set down for hearing before us on the 17th day of January 1944. Thereupon, motion was presented with argument of counsel for the respective parties and duly considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Our conclusion is that the law of this case follows our opinion and judgment in the case of State ex rel. Kennedy v. Knott, 123 Fla. 295, 166 So. 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">It, therefore, follows that when our peremptory writ of mandamus issued as stated, supra, it carried with it all the benefits which flowed from the issuance of the permit therein required and that the Relator thereby became entitled to all rights accruing under the provisions of Sec. 517.12 Fla. Statutes, 1941. Under this statutory provision, the Relator, upon complying with such statute, was entitled to the issuance of a renewal certificate as of January 1, 1944.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">The premises considered, it is now ordered, adjudged and decreed that the respondents, James M. Lee, J. Edwin Larson and J. Tom Watson as and constituting the Florida Securities Commission, do forthwith issue unto the said The Crummer Company, a corporation organized and existing under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>laws of the State of Delaware, its renewal certificate certifying that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-5\">\u201cThe Crummer Company</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai2\">First National Bank Building</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH\">Orlando, Florida</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-6\">\u201cIs Registered with the Florida Securities Commission As A Dealer Pursuant to Section 11, Chapter 14899, Laws of Florida, Acts 1931, As Amended, Having Complied with the Requirements of Said Law, to Sell:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">\u201cSecurities issued by a Public Commission, Board of Officers of the Government of the United States or of any State, Territory or Insular possession thereof, or of any municipality located therein, or of the District of Columbia, or of the Dominion of Canada, or of any province thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9j\">This Order, however, is without prejudice to the said respondents to at any time proceed in the manner prescribed by law to vacate and cancel the registration of the said The Crummer Company for any legal ground or cause occurring either prior or subsequent to the issuance of the certificate herein required to be issued and not set at rest by our peremptory writ of mandamus issued herein on November 29, 1943.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b47-9\">BROWN, CHAPMAN and ADAMS, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
