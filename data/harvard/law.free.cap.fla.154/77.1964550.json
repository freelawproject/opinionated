The declaration alleged that defendant was a resident of the State of Michigan. The Circuit Court quashed the attempted service because the declaration did not allege that the defendant was a nonresident at the time of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">It is necessary, therefore, for us to determine whether the plaintiff must allege the nonresidence of defendant at the time of the accrual of the cause of action in order to procure service of process under this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">The statute rests upon the principle of agency and the relationship exists only where defendant is a nonresident. It is, therefore, indispensable that the record show the nonresident status at the time the cause of action accrues.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">The petition for mandamus is denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b102-12\">BUFORD, C.
