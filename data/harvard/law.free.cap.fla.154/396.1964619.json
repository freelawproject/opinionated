J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">From a full and careful consideration-of the transcript of the evidence in this case, I am definitely convinced that the weight of the evidence showed that appellee was guilty of adultery as charged by appellant and that, therefore, she is not entitled to a decree for either alimony or for suit money.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">I, therefore, reach the conclusion that the decree should be reversed with directions that decree be entered in favor of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">So ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b421-12\">BROWN, THOMAS, ADAMS and SEBRING, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b421-13\">TERRELL and CHAPMAN, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b421-14\">CHAPMAN,</author>\n<p id=\"ayb-dedup-0\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b421-15\">This is an appeal from a final decree entered by the Circuit Court of Palm Beach County, Florida. The final decree awarded (1) a divorce to the wife; (2) permanent alimony to her in the sum of $350.00 per month; (3) counsel fees and court costs. The appellant (husband and defendant below) perfected an appeal here. We have read and studied all the testimony; the briefs have been read and cited authorities examined and able oral argument has been heard at the bar of this Court, and the Court being now fully advised as to the proper decree or judgment to be entered in the premises; it is upon consideration ordered and decreed that the final decree appealed from should be and is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-16\">Counsel for appellee (the wife) by petition filed here seek an additional allowance as counsel fees for professional services rendered here.
