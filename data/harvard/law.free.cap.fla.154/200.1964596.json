Williamson, reported in 153 Fla. 357, 14 So. (2nd) 712, with modifications, and we said: \u201cIt is our conclusion that the decree should be affirmed, without prejudice to the-appellant (Mrs. Gladys G. Williamson) to apply, prior to the expiration'of the eighteen months\u2019 period provided for in the decree, . . . for an order requiring additional payments of alimony to be made by the appellee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>On October 20,1943, Gladys G. Williamson filed a petition in the Circuit Court of Palm Beach County, Florida, seeking an award of additional payments of alimony\u201d over and above the payments awarded \u201cby the terms of the final decree in sufficient amount to enable her to support herself in the manner to which she is entitled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The chancellor below denied a motion to dismiss the said petition of Gladys G. Williamson and said order is challenged here by petition for interlocutory writ of certiorari. These issues were placed at rest by our opinion and judgment in the case on appeal. The door was left open so that she may enter, within the eighteen months\u2019 period, and apply for additional payments of alimony to be made after the expiration of the eighteeen months. She is not precluded from applying, within the eighteen months\u2019 period for additional sums with which to defray costs of medical treatment or a surgical operation upon her body, \u2014 the merits of the application to be considered upon the showing made.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The petition for an interlocutory writ of certiorari is hereby granted and the order dated November 24, 1943, is quashed. The petition of Gladys G. Williamson for temporary alimony and attorney\u2019s fees in this Court in the case at bar are each denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b225-8\">BUFORD, C.
