The speed of appellant\u2019s truck was about twenty-five to thirty miles per hour. Appellant\u2019s truck collided with an oncoming truck in which one Shaller was riding. Appellant\u2019s truck was on the left side of the highway and traveled a distance of about one hundred feet before coming to a stop. Appellant\u2019s truck was badly wrecked and Shaller and four other persons were killed in the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">The law requires that a motor vehicle shall be operated at an appropriate rate of speed and with due regard for the existing weather conditions or other hazards confronting the driver. See Sec. 317.22, F.S. \u201941, F.S.A. Negligence is a relative term and whether the appellant was giulty of culpable negligence was a question for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-11\">Our conclusion is the evidence is sufficient to sustain the verdict. See Franklin v. State, 120 Fla. 686, 163 So. 55; Williams v. State, 147 Fla. 91, 2 So. (2nd) 301; People v. Emmons, (Calif.) 299 p. 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-12\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b57-13\">BUFORD, C. J., TERRELL and CHAPMAN, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
