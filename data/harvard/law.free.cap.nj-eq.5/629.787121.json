White, $10,000, to be paid to her as soon as practicable after his decease, or, with interest from that time. He then gives several other money legacies. He then makes specific bequests of furniture and other articles of personal property. He then says that he wishes his bank stock to make a part of his dear aunt\u2019s legacy, as it will give her less trouble in collecting.^ The will then provides thus: \u201c Item\u00bb \u2014After all my just debts are paid, and the expenses of fulfilling this my last will and testament, I give and bequeath all the remainder of my property, both real and personal, to be equally divided among my four cousins (naming them.) Item. \u2014 I wish that the house I have lately purchased of C. M. Campbell, valued at $4000, to be part of' my dear aunt\u2019s legacy, and that, in the division of her portion, my Trenton bank be calculated at $40 per 'share, and my Easton bank at $30 per share.\u201d And, by a codicil to his said will, he gave to his aunt, Ann P. White, in fee simple, a lot of woodland (describing it), containing fifteen acres, and all the plate in his house, and some other articles of personal property; and also gave by the codicil, three other money legacies, one of $200, one of $50, and one of $75\u2014</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b631-11\"><em>Held, </em>that the lands devised in the residuary clause of the will were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>chargeable, in aid of the personal estate, with the payment of the legacies, but that the personal estate being insufficient to pay the legacies, they must abate.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b632-5\">This case is reported in 3 <em>Green\u2019s Chan. </em>343.
