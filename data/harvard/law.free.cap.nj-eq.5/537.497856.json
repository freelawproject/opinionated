Some time after the filing of said bill, a person calling himself Abraham Williamson, and representing himself to be the soil and administrator of William Williamson the younger, deceased, and to he \u2022\u2019a citizen of the state of Kentucky, came to New Jersey, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>claimed tho'amouut of the monies recovered of Benjamin Johnson by the said Asher Williamson, and then in his, -Asher\u2019s, hands. In conversation with said Abraham Williamson, I told him, at several different times, that he, complainant, had filed a bill in chancery for the recovery of a part of the money collected by him, Asher, on- the above stated execution against, complainant; and that complainant said that that judgment had boon taken for the whole amount of William Williamson, junior\u2019s, share of William Williamson, senior\u2019s, estate, and that Samuel Williamson, the executor of William Williamson, senior. had paid, in his lifetime, to William Williamson, junior, the amount of his share of the monies arising from the first sale of William \u2019Williamson, senior\u2019s, estate; and that be, William Williamson, junior, had given Samuel Williamson a \u2022receipt for it, which had not been allowed in making up that judgment. Deponent, at Abraham Williamson\u2019s request, produced the receipt and showed it to him. He admitted the signature to it to be the hand writing of his father, and several times said he would go to Asher and get him to allow the amount of said receipt, and pay it back to complainant. At one time deponent recollects he (Abraham Williamson) came id him and got him to make out a statement of the amount of said receipt, and said ho would go to complainant and pay him' back. This was in 1827. He said then that the whole of the monies collected by Asher Williamson upon said \u2019 execution against complainant would bo coming to him. Some time shortly after <em>this, ho, </em>Abraham Williamson, came to deponent again, saying he had lost the statement above' mentioned, and wanted deponent to make him another. Deponent got the papers in the cause, took out the receipt; and made another statement for him. This was done in Mr. Saxton\u2019s office, he,-Abra \u25a0 ham Williamson, sitting by. all the time. A short time after this I understood that the parties were to have a meeting at Mr. Saxton\u2019s office, to try and settle the matter, upon a certain day fixed by there. They met accordingly. Mr. Saxton being ab - sent, they wished me to get the receipt and ascertain the amount duo on it. I got the papers, and upon examining them the receipt was gone. I fold them I could not find it. He, Abraham Williamson, then said he was willing to pay the amount of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>receipt to Johnson, complainant, but that the receipt must first be produced; Deponent then mentioned to him that he, Abraham Williamson, had a statement of the amount of the receipt, and that' he could as well settle the matter by that as by the receipt itself.- His only reply was, \u201c produce the receipt.\u201d He' said he would not- settle unless the receipt was produced. In speaking of a settlement with complainant, at different times since, I have heard him say, let them produce the receipt and he would pay it. At other times, \u201c they can\u2019t produce the receipt.\u201d From the whole conduct of said-Abraham Williamson, at the time they met at Mr. Saxton\u2019s office to settle, a:nd after-wards, he, deponent, has been induced to believe, and does believe, that he, Abraham Williamson; had stolen the receipt at' the time deponent made the last statement of the amount of it' for-him. Deponent has made search for-the receipt since, and-has not been able to find it. Thinks the receipt was given for' about \u00a3130. Deponent says the application of the said-Abraham-- Williamson for statements of the amount of said receipt' were made by him in-the absence- of Mr. Saxton from his office,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AyD\">January 11th, 1831, <em>William H. </em>Johnson, sworn on the part of the complainant, saith: He is the son of complainant. He recollects that at the time of the first sale of his father\u2019s property, by virtue of the execution in favor of William S. Pennington, Governor, &amp;e., his father was much surprised at the amount st\u00e1ted to be due upon the execution. He thoughtit was1 too high, and that' after the second sale Ire (father) went to one Abraham- R. Sutphen to get him to come with him to Saxton\u2019s to try and recover back a part of the money that had been collected at that sale. Recollects that his father went to different-places, at different times after this, to look for a receipt given-by William-WiHiamson, junior, to Samuel Williamson,-executor of William Williamson, senior, .and that he, deponent, went at request of his father to different places and persons to look for it, and could not find it. That finally deponent, Abraham Gu-Mck, complainant, and Abraham R. Sutphen, came to Mr. Sax-ton\u2019s office. Mr. Saxton proposed to them that they had better go-to-William Maxwell, esquire, and search among the papers of G. G. Maxwell, esquire, for it. Deponent and father went together to- Mr. Maxwell\u2019s. He, William Maxwell,, looked-foi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>the' paper, but could not find it. He said he thought probable' that it might be at Mr. Clark\u2019s office, among papers in his charge. Mr. A. Wurts and deponent then went to Mr. Clark\u2019s office, who \" was absent, and had left his key with Mr. Wurts, and after' searching awhile we found a bundle of papers' relating to William Williamson\u2019s estate. We brought the bundle to Mr. Sax-ton\u2019s office, and upon examination found in it the receipt inf question, the same we had been looking for. The amount of it deponent does notrecollcet exactly, but he is sore it was for more than \u00a3100. Deponent\u2019s father and Mr. A. R.

R. </em>Suiphen, sworn on the part of the complainant, saith: He is acquainted with the parties in the cause. Recollects hearing, at the time of if, of the first sal\u00e9 of complainant\u2019s property, at the suit of'William S, Pennington, Governor, upon execution. Conversed with complainant about the time ; recollects that he complained of the large amount of the judgment; that he said it was security money, but' deponent does not remember the conversation distinct-' ly. Complainant, however, has frequently expressed to deponeat that he was disappointed by that judgment; that it was for a much larger sum than he had expected, and that there was some mistake in making it up; that a certain payment should have been credited in making it up that had not been' credited, but what payment or for what sum deponent does not now recollect. Deponent recollects going,' at-complainant\u2019s request, in company with Abraham Gulick, to one Abraham Terhufte\u2019s, in the county'of Somerset, where Samuel Williamson died, to examine his papers, and see if there was not a receipt or some paper among them that would show the amount of monies paid out by him, as executor of William Williamson, senior, deceased. Mr. Terhuae\u2019s family showed us all the papers (as they said) of Samuel Williamson; we examined them, \u25a0 but-found nothing relating-to the matter we were inquiring into. We returned and informed complainant; be appeared to be sur-' prised at the information, and seemed to think that they had' destroyed the paper. Complainant was still very anxious to-search for and find the paper, and appeared to' be very certain1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>that there had been such 'a paper, and that it must be in existence yet unless it had be\u00e9n destroyed. Some time after, this deponent was in the office of Peter I. Clark, esquire, and seeing Mr. William Maxwell\u2019there'\u2018drop some papers upon the floor in1 pulling out a pocket-book from his pocket, he; deponent, picked up some of them, and7saw upon them the name of Samuel-' Williamson, deceased; he informed complainant of th\u00e1t circumstance, and told him\u2019that \" he rath\u00e9r thought the'paper in--' question, if in existence1 yet,' must be in his, Maxwell\u2019s office. The bundle of papers that Mr. Maxwell dropped from his pocket were taken up by persons present,' and left in the possession of Peter I. Clark, esquire. After this,' deponent, complainant and his son, William H. Johnson, and' Abrahain Gulick came to\u201d Flemington in company, to see Mr; Saxton Ea\u00f1d' make further' search for the paper in question. Mr. Saxton- advised us to' make further seach for the paper, and upon depon'ent\u2019s mentioning again the circumstance of his seeing the papers dropped' by Mr. Maxwell, it was concluded to go'there, and to Mr. Clark\u2019s\" office. Mr. Saxton suggested, that Mr.\u2019Clark was'gone fr&amp;m home, and that they had better apply to Mr. Wurtsj'-with whom Mr. Clark had left the key of his office. William H. Johnson1 and Abraham Gulick went accordingly, and after some time\u201d' returned with a bundle of papers relating to Samuel William- ' son\u2019s business, to Mr. Saxton\u2019s office. The bundle was' exam-' ined by Mr. Saxton, and the paper in question found in' it, and \u2019 r\u00e9\u00e1d'in deponent\u2019s presence, purporting to be-'a receipt from Wil-' liam'Williamson to Samuel Williamson, executor of William; Williamson,.-deceased, for monies paid by him. The amount\u2019 about-5 \u00a3-180; don\u2019t' recollect exactly. \u25a0 Deponent, recollects that' . thereupon' Mr. Saxton advised the-filing of the bill in chancery' by deponent1 and complainant, iff order to recover back the' amount of that receipt: Deponent recollects conversing with \u25a0 Ashter Williamson about' the matter, after the bill was filed by Mr. Saxton ; he, Asher,' tbld deponent; at the time, that he was 1 satisfied and really beli\u00e9ved that the amount'of that\" receipt\u2019 ought to- be repaid to complainant, but' that he could not do it.' He,' Asher; at the time made an estimate of the' amount of it, \u25a0 and1,' deponent thinks, made it over $1000, he thinks'about' $1100'.\u2019- He; .Asher, said he was whiling- to pay complainant ths\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>amount of the receipt, but be did not, want the lot to he sold which he had bought at the sale of Samuel Williamson\u2019s property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-4\">On the 19th day of January, 1832, it being alleged that the complainant had departed this life since the commencement of this suit, intestate, and that administration, &amp;c., had been granted to John T. Neely and'William II. Johnson, upon, whom tire interest of the said decedent in the matters in question in this case hath devolved, it was thereupon ordered by Chancellor Vroom that this suit be revived at the suit of the administrators as complainants against the said defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-5\">May 12th, 1832, <em>Nathaniel Saxton, </em>sworn on the part of the plaintiff, being shown, the paper mnrked'Exhibit A. in this case, deposeth and saitli, that lie was present and saw Peter Williamson, the releasor, sign and deliver tire same, and this deponent subscribed his name as a witness thereto; that it was executed on the day it beers date, and previous to the examination of the said Peter Williamson as a witness in this case. The deponent farther saith, that about the month of September, 1822, shortly after the first sale of Benjamin Johnson\u2019s property, on the execution at the suit of William S. Pennington, late Governor, <em>Sec., </em>against Benjamin Johnson, survivor of Samuel Williamson, deceased, the said Benjamin Johnson applied to the deponent to know if he could not be relieved against that sale, which he alleged had been made at a great sacrifice. ,He at the same \u2022time expressed great surprise at the amount demanded on the execution being so large\u2014^upwards of $,22GQ. He stated that the judgment and execution were for monies claimed by Asher Williamson, as administrator of William Williamson, deceased, for said William Williamson\u2019s share of the monies arising from the sale made by Samuel Williamson, executor of William Williamson the elder, of a farm of the testator\u2019s, under the direction of the court of chancery, and for which ho (Johnson) had become security for the said Samuel Williamson, but he did not know the amount that was due; that ho had understood that Samuel Williamson had made a payment to William Williamson, in his lifetime,,on the amount, but that before this action was brought Samuel Williamson had removed to the county of Somerset and died there, and left no executor, and no person had administered as he knew of; and Ire knew not where <em>Xo </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>find any,papers or vouchers to prove the payment or show the amount really due. That he had also heard that about th.e time of the commencement of the suit against.him, Asher Williamson had said,that there was .only about $1100 or $1200 due from Samuel Williamson, as executor of William Williamson, deceased, to.him, Asher, .as administrator of William Williamson the.younger, deceased, on .his share of the estate; from yvhich-he expected that Asher knew the amount actually due, and intended .to claim no .more ; .and in consequen.ce of these circumstances he did not appear ip make .any defence in the action. That deponent inquired into the circumstances of the sheriff\u2019s sale of Johnson\u2019s property,.which, in consequence of an irregularity in advertising, was abandoned ; and a second sale made in May, .1823, which satisfied the judgment. Johnson then wished deponent to .take some .measures \u201eto recover back \u25a0from Samuel Williamson\u2019s estate, if any could .be found, the monies-he-had been compelled .to.pay as his security, or to re-die ve.him ..against this judgment, and recover .back from Asher Williamson the amount paid over and above what was actually due. Deponent advised -him to take out letters of administration of the estate of Samuel Williamson, and also to go to one Terhune, in Somerset county, where it was said Samuel Wil? \u25a0li\u00e1mson had died, and search for some receipt or vquoher to show the payment made by Samuel Williamson to William-Williamson'; that about 10th June, 1823, Benjamin Johnson, Abraham B. Sutphen, Abraham .Guliok and William H. Johnson camp to deponent\u2019s office to consult farther on the subject, and informed .him that they .had searched for, but had not been able to find any receipt .from William.Williamson. Deponent then advised them to go to William Maxwell\u2019s, and search among .the papers of George ,0. Maxwell, esquire, who had done business for Samuel Williamson in .his .lifetime. One of .the company went to Mr. Maxwell\u2019s, but returned without finding any thing. <em>It </em>was then proposed by some one, deponent don!t' recollect who, to search at the office of Peter I. Clark, .esquire, and .one of the company, deponent thinks it was William H. Johnson, went, and after a. short time returned with a bundle of papers of Samuel Williamson\u2019s, relating to the estate of William Williamson, deceased. Upon opening this bundle and examining the papers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Ave found among them the receipt or acquittance under seal, .\u2022from William Williamson to Samuel Williamson, .executor of William Williamson, deceased, bearing date the 2d day of April, 1792, for \u00a3131 10s., in full for his share of the legacy under the will of the said William Williamson, deceased. This receipt was signed <em>\u201c </em>William Williamson,\u201d and attested by two subscribing witnesses, one of whom deponent recollects was Peter Williamson, with whose hand writing deponent was acquainted, and whose signature.he recognized. The body of the .receipt appeared to be in the same hand writing.as the receipt of John Hull and Margaret his wife, marked Exhibit B. in this case; it bore the same dale, and deponent thinks was attested by the same witnesses. Upon finding this receipt, deponent advised the filing \u00a9f a.hill in chancery,.which,.after procuring other documents and information,-he prepared. At the time of preparing the bill he had this receipt of William Williamson before him, and intended to describe it, and believes he did describe it truly in the bill. This bill was filed on or about the 6th March, 1824, in the .names of Abraham R. Sutphcn, administrator of Samuel Williamson, deceased, and Benjamin Johnson, complainants, against Asher Williamson and others, defendants, tp which a plea and demurrer was filed by Mr. Richard Stockton, solicitor for Asher Williamson. After argument of the demurrer, deponent had several conversations with Asher Williamson on the subject of the suit. In those conversations Asher objected, strenuously, against that .part of the bill which sought a review of the former decree, and to set aside the sale of a lot of land sold as the property of Samuel Williamson, and .bought by him ; but made no objection to the relief sought against, the judgment obtained by him against Benjamin Johnson. As to that, he said he knew that the receipt, (alluding to the said receipt of William Williamson to Samuel Williamson, executor, &amp;c.) was right; that Johnson ought to have the money back; that if the bill had been filed for that only lie would have made no objection to it; that he was willing to pay that money back to Johnson if he would be justified in doing so. That deponent informed Asher that he would amend the bill so as to confine the object of it to the recovering back of the money overpaid by Johnson, and did amend the bill in the shape in which i\u00ed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>.now appears; that depcijent informed Asher that-he-liad amended-the bill in that way,:and suggested that Mr. Stockton, his -solicitor, could put in.an answer admitting the facts as they \u2022really were, and upon .that the cause could be-heard and a proper decree made. That Asher assured this deponent that he would write to Mr.-Stockton and authorize him to proceed in -such a way that . Johnson might get back the money overpaid, if it could be done, so-that he, Asher, .would be justified in paying it; that it was right that-Johnson should have it, .and he \u25a0would as lieve pay it.to Him as any body if he was safe in so doing. That deponent mentioned these conversations .to Mr. Stockton, but a long time elapsed without Asher\u2019s calling upon \u2022him; that Mr. Stockton at length wrote to Asher, and this deponent delivered the.letter, on the receipt of which Asher.promis,*ed that he would go and .see Mr. Stockton on the subject, but deponent never heard that\u2018he did. After Mr. Stockton\u2019s death, about 25th March, 1828, deponent gave Asher notice to appoint another solicitor; but no answer having been put in, on or about the 12th July, 1828, an order to produce proofs was obtained ; after which Asher still proposed putting in such an answer that Johnson might get his money. Deponent farther saith, that sometime after.the commencement of the suit, a person calling himself Abraham Williamson, who claimed to be the son and .administrator of the said William Williamson the younger, came to this country and called on deponent for information respecting the..estate of William Williamson, deceased. Deponent informed him what he knew about it, and that there .was money in Asher Williamson\u2019s hands belonging to the estate of William \"Williamson, deceased, which he had recovered of Benjamin Johnson, but that there was a,mistake, that Asher had recovered more than was due, and the present suit was depending to -recover it back. lie asked deponent to let him see the receipt of William Williamson, his father, as he said ; deponent show - ed it to him, and read it to Him ; he said it was right, whatever .His father had received ought to be paid back if it had not been allowed. He called on deponent frequently and conversed on the subject, and finally proposed that he would settle with Johnson and pay him back the money himself, and then proceed against Asher for the whole amount he had received. He pro <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>posed compromising it, and paying something'less than the full amount due Johnson, and wished deponent to oettle it with him. which deponent declined doing, and proposed that he and Johnson should meet at deponent\u2019s office and settle it, which he agreed to, and a day was appointed; and he requested deponent to make a calculation, which deponent, promised to do, hut did not make the calculation or show him the receipt at that time. After he was gone'deponent made a calculation ; he believes the paper Exhibit F. to be the calculation he made. At the time of making the calculation he had the receipt of William Williamson the younger before him, and believes the dale and amount of the receipt to be truly stated in that calculation. After making it he put up the receipt among\u2019other receipts in a bundle of papera in the case, and pot them in his paper case, and gave Johnson notice of the time of meeting. Deponent went'from home, he thinks to attend court at Trenton, and did not return on the day of the proposed meeting' until in tile afternoon ; he found Benjamin Johnson and Abraham 11. Sutpheu at his office, and was informed that Abraham Williamson had been there, but that Mr. Bartles could not find the receipt, and w illiamson had refused tc do any thing. Deponent then searched, but it was not in the bundle, and he has never been able to find it since. Deponent is entirely ignorant of what has become of it, but is satisfied that it must have been surreptitiously taken out of his office in his absence; that it is lost and cannot now' be found;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-4\">On the 8th of April, 1833, on a statement of the' facts as is-set forth and alleged in an order of this court made by Chancellor Yroom c.n the 19th January, 1832, it was, on the' 8l,h of April, 1833,- ordered and directed by Chancellor Seely, that the said order of the 19th January be confirmed as fully as if the same was made at this date, and that this suit be and do stand revived and continued by and in the names of the said John-T.

That after-wards, to wit;-on the' 15th day of October. 1827, the Chancellor' ordered that-' the complainants'have leave to amend the bill of' complaint in this cause by striking out the names of Abraham' R.

That in the said suit on the saidbilkof review, this deponent and the said William Williamson and Cornelius Williamson had-employed Richard Stockton, es-' quire, their solicitor and counsel. That Richard Stockton died sometime in the month of March, 1828, as this deponent hath been-informed; That this deponent hath no recollection of ever seeing his solicitor* after the opinion- of the' court was delivered. That when the opinion was delivered, sustaining the plea and demurrer, Mr. Stockton- told him to go home and rest easjr,-that he would not be further-troubled with that suit, and that- it was at an end and that he was clear of it. That he never knew of any order to amend until on inspecting the files'of -this court' this day he discovered it. That no amended copy of the complainants\u2019 bill has ever'been served on him. That no subpoena-in the above suit has ever been served on him. That some time* after the death of' Mr. Stockton a notice was served on him warning him. to appoint a solicitor in his place; but as the osi~ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>ginal suit was at an end, as he conceived, and he had never any knowledge of any new suit by striking out the names of one plaintiff and two defendants, and a considerable p'ortion of the original bill, he was ignorant whether he could be considered his solicitor in-tbe new suit; nevertheless, he applied to Gar - ret D. Wall and Alexander Wurts to do what was necessary for him. That since that time he has supposed the suit at an end, never having heard any mor\u00e9 of it, more especially as Benjamin Johnson, the complainant,' hath since died. That no order reviving the suit' has ever been served on him. That about three weeks ago he was informed by Mr. Wurts that a decree had passed against\" him in this case, and that it was referred to a master to take an account. That he immediately called on him, brought to his recollection the fact of his having given him a fee in the case, and that he believes that from some misconception between him and Mr. Wall in respect to who was to act as-the solicitor, neither of them entered an appearance for him-in this suit.- That on examining the proceedings in this cause it appears that the decree was signed on the 12th July, 1828, but not filed until the 29th January, 1829. That the complainant produced-documents, &amp;c., in which it is alleged that a subpoena in this ease was served on this deponent, which is not true. It is- also alleged that a copy of the amended bill in this case had been served on Mr. Stockton, but it is not alleged that the-costs\u2019were either tendered or paid to him. That in the term of January, 1832, it appears that the suit was ordered to be revived in the names of William H. Johnson and John T. Neely, administrators of Benjamin Johnson, and that on the 8th April, 1833, the ssid order was confirmed. Aad this deponent further saith that neither of the said orders were nerved on him. That-in the term of July, 1033, a decree was made against this defendant, in-his absence and without notice. That he hath never bad notice of taking any depositions aad that he believed that the said suit was ended. And this deponent is advised that the said proceedings are irregular. And ibis deponent-further saith that he is advised by his counsel that he hath &amp; good defence to make in this-case; that he is an administrator acting'as trustee for others, and ought to make defence. That ho is wholly ignorant-of the receipt stated <em>in </em>said MU, o\u00ed-bis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>personal knowledge, and that'lie is ignorant of the hand wri-\" ting of William Williamson, his intestate, and never saw said\u2019 receipt or acknowledged or admitted it to be genuine or correct and has no reason tb believe that it is. That he never heard-that any such receipt was pretended to have been given or any payment to have been made, (except as the same may be stated\u2019 in the answer of Samuel Williamson,-which he did not credit,)' until after he had obtained judgment, in the name of William' S. Pennington, against tire said Benjamin Johnson, and after the money was raised by execution. That he never believed or admitted that the said money was paid, or receipt given, or' in-existence or lost, as stated in the said bill, and that according' to the best of his knowledge and belief, the said money men-' tioned in the- said receipt was never paid to the said William4 Williamson, his intestate. That he cannot on inquiry ascertain that he was-in this state at or about the time it is stated to have been'given.

And this defendant insists that it is apparent from* the statement of the complainant, that he voluntarily slept over the defence now set up until he was awakened by discovering that this defendant had purchased his property at the first sheriff\u2019s sale, notwithstanding his fraudulent conveyance to his children, and all his efforts to place his property beyond the reach of a judgment would fail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-4\">And this defendant- further saith,- that the complainant, before this defendant caused an action to be brought against him upon the bond so as aforesaid given to William S.

And this defendant avers, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>at the- time of the entering the judgment in the case of the said William S. Pennington,- Chancellor, &amp;c., against the said Benjamin Johnso'n, and the issuing of the execution thereupon, and the payment and receipt of the money thereon, as stated in the bill of complaint and this answer, this defendant did not know, other than as is- herein before stated to have-been alleged in <em>the </em>answer of the said Samuel Williamson, to the bill of complaint of this defendant and others against him, as--is set forth in the bill of complaint of the complainant; and'.he did not believe that the said Samuel Williamson had ever-paid any part of-the monies due to the said William-Williamson; nor does he know or believe, o\u00ed had he.heard, to his remembrance, that the said Samuel Williamson-had, or pretended to have, any receipt or acquittance therefor; and this defendant-verily believed that-the allegation in the answer aforesaid, of the payment to William Williamson, was equally untrue and unsupported by- evidence as the allegation of-a similar payment t\u00f3'Cornelius Williamson, the- father of this defendant, contained in the same answer-;, and he never took any measures, or did any act,-or uttered-any speech, which could mislead or deceive the complainant-in relation to-the said payment or receipt in any manner whatever, or prevent him from making any inquiries or defence he-might see proper; or induce him-to suppose that lie-claimed less than the whole- amount of-the proceeds of the- sale- and net rents of the said, farm,- upon the footing of the decree of October, 1813, coming to the share o-f the said William Williamson. And this defendant avers that the said judgment set forth in the bill of complaint, and referred to in this answer, is still in force, no ways reversed or set aside; that the matters in\u25a0 controversy, and the real substantial parties* were the same, and the whole merits-of the case as stated in \u25a0 the complainant\u2019s bill might have been fully, heard, tried and determined in the said action, and that the said judgment therein was obtained fairly and without fraud, covin-or misrepresentation, or-the taking of any undue advantage; and that-no evidence has come to the knowledge of the complainant since the-said commencement of-the said action in which the said-judgment was obtained, respecting, any of the facts alleged in-the said bill,- which he might-not have obtained and produced by the use of due and ordinary diligence in da<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>fence to'the said action; and this defendant insists upon the said judgment, and claims the same benefit thereof as if he had pleaded the same in this eause. And this defendant, for the reasons and under the circumstances aforesaid, is advised and insists that the said complainant is not entitled to any relief against this defendant touching the matters complained of in the said bill; and also insists upon the said laches and negligence of the said complainant, and claims the full benefit thereof, as if the same had been pleaded also.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-3\">He denies that the complainant had not access to the papers of the said Samuel Williamson, or that he could not have found the papers of the said Samuel Williamson in relation- to the said claim, or any documents or vouchers to enable him to contest or to make any defence against the same, or to create a personal representative of the said Samuel Williamson to investigate the state of his affairs, as well before as after the entering of the said judgment against the complainant, by the use of common and ordinary diligence and the appropriate inquiries and means for the purpose; all the parties and witnesses residing in the neighborhood of the complainant, and it not being pretended that any papers were concealed or suppressed from him, or that any witnesses denied or withheld their knowledge when applied to in relation' to any matter touching the same. And this defendant being entirely ignorant of the means used by the complainant to obtain information' and papers respecting the pretended payment of Samuel to William Williamson, other than what is stated in his bill of complaint, neither admits nor denies what is stated by the complainant in his bill for that purpose; nor does lie know any thing in respect to the said pretended receipt from William Williamson to Samuel Williamson for &lt;\u00a3131 10s., bearing date the 2d day of April, 1792', nor has he ever seen any such-receipt; nor does he believe that'the said William Williamson ever received the said sum of money or any part thereof, or ever signed any such- receipt or acquittance, or ever was in the state of New Jersey at the time it- bears date, he, the said William, having left New Jersey before the revolutionary war; and he has been informed and believes that the said William Williamson never could write his same or read writing. And this defendant knows nothing of the loss or mi\u00bb \u25a0 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>laying of the said pretended receipt, and, therefore, does not admit any such loss or mislaying; and hopes that the complainant may be compelled to make strict proof thereof, inasmuch as such pretences are easily made, and such would be the mode resorted to if a pretended receipt should be set up.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-4\">He denies that, to his knowledge or belief, he obtained the said judgment and execution \u2022 against the complainant for a larger sum than was actually due, by any such fraud, deceit, concealment or surprise as is pretended in the said bill, or by any fraud, deceit, concealment or surprise whatever; or that the complainant had not the same means in his power to obtain the said receipt, if any such existed, and to prove the said payment and ascertain the amount thereof, as he has since discovered, by the use of the same diligence' and means as he subsequently used. And he insists that all the allegations contained in the said bill, in respect to this defendant having heard ef such payment being made, or seen the said acquittance and discharge, and well knowing of the same being given, or admitted that there was only a balance of ten or twelve hundred dollars, or-declarations that he intended to claim no more, as is pretended in the said bill, is utterly and entirely false.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-5\">He says that after the Sling of the present bill, and in March, 1828, Richard Stockton,, his solicitor and counsel, died, having before his death told this defendant, when the decision was made by the Chancellor on the plea and demurrer, to go home, \u2022and that he would not be further troubled with this matter. That after the death of the said Richard Stockton, and without any previous-notice to this defendant, to his recollection or belief, on the 29th- day of January, 1829, and without the payment of any of the costs, which was the condition precedent for the leave to amend ordered by the court, an order was illegally and' upon false allegations obtained for the complainant to make proof of the allegations, in the usual form. And this defendant avers that he was never served with any order, or warned to appoint a solicitor in the place of his deceased solicitor, Richard Stockton, to his recollection or belief; and he supposed that suit was ended. That on the 19th day of July, 1832, an order was made suggesting the death of Benjamin Johnson, the complainant, and- reviving the suit in the name of his administrators, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>present complainants. That this order was never served upon this defendant, and was wholly illegal, there being no statute authorizing such a revival, and the only mode of revival then lawful being by bill of revivor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-4\">That on the 7th day of October, 1829, the deposition of Peter Williamson was taken, without any notice to tliis defendant; and on the 7th day of May, 1832, his deposition was again taken without any notice to this defendant. That on the 11 tlx day of January, 1831, the depositions of Charles Rallies and William H. Johnson were taken ; and on the 13th day of the same month, the deposition of Abraham <em>T\u00ed. </em>flutphen was taken, without notice to this defendant; and on the 12th day of May, 1832, the deposition of Nathaniel Saxton was taken, and all the said depositions were filed on the 16th day of July, in the same year. That on the 12th of February, 1833, an act of the legislature was passed, authorizing a revivor by rule in the case of the death, of a sole complainant, upon the terms and in the manner stated in the said law. That on the 8th day of April, in the same year, an order was made to confirm the previous order to revive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-5\">And this defendant insists that the said order to revive, and the order to confirm the same, were wholly illegal and void, and all the depositions taken in the intermediate time were illegally and unlawfully taken, and the depositions ought not to be heard in this case. That on the 20ih day of July, 1833, an interlocutory order was made, referring it to Alexander Wurts, one of the masters of this court, to take an account, and on the 18th day of July, 1834, an order was made substituting Andrew Mil - ler as master, instead of the said Alexander Wurts; and on the same day. this defendant, having been informed, accidentally, of the said proceedings, and never before having had the slightest idea but that the said suit was ended, made an affidavit, and applied to the court and obtained an order for the, complain \u2022 ants to show cause why the said decree and all proceedings should not be set aside or opened. On the 15th day of October, 1838, an order was made that this defendant should bring on the argument of the rulo to show cause at tho next term, or that it should be discharged.- And on the 22d day of January, 1839, an affidavit was made of the service of a copy of the before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>mentioned rule, and an order made discharging the said rule to show cause, on the same day. On the 4th day of September, in the same year, a report was made, and on the 12th day of October, in the same year, a decree was made, -which was opened in the ,term .of July last, and this defendant permitted to answer ; as by the said several proceedings, to which this defendant begs leave to refer, .will more fully and at large appear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-3\">And he insists that the said proceedings .were and are void; in the first place, because the complainant had leave to amend only on condition .of paying costs, which he never paid, or took any measures to .pay; in the second place, that he never warned this defendant to appoint a solicitor in the place of the said Richard Stockton, or gave this defendant any notice of the said proceedings, although he lived .within five miles of the residence of the solicitor of the complainant. In the third place, the suit abated on the death of the complainant, and the order for revivor was utterly void; and the order subsequently made to confirm the same was also void, as not pursuing the act and not ^.mending the complainant\u2019s bill and order .on defendant to an\u2022swer the same; and the order discharging the rule to show cause was irregular, and all the subsequent proceedings ought to have been vacated and set aside. And he saith, that the money which he recovered of the said complainant belonged to him as administrator of the said William Williamson, who died intestate in the state of Kentucky, leaving issue, Abraham, William, Richard, John, Samuel, Cornelius, Margaret Wilson, Mary Smoot, and Micha Bailey, his next of kin. That the said Abraham, in his own behalf and holding letters of attorney from some of .the other heirs of William Williamson the younger, issued a citation in .the orphans\u2019 court of the county of Hunter-don, returnable in the term of October, 1824, to show cause why his letters of administration should not be revoked, and obtained a de.cree to that effect, and to the term'of February, 1825, issued a citation out of the game court for this .defendant to account, and the said proceedings are still pending; Nathaniel Saxton, the solicitor for the complainant, being the attorney of the said Abraham Williamson, and thus harassing this defendant with a double and conflicting claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-4\">And he further saith, that, while the said proceedings were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>pending against him, at the instance of the said Abraham Williamson, by his attorney, Nathaniel Saxton, and when he supposed that the suit in chancery, instituted by the complainant, was ended, he endeavored to free himself from the other demand, and accordingly, on the 28th day of September, 1831, he paid to the said Micha Bailey and Thomas Bailey her husband, (which said Micha was one of the children of the said William Williamson the younger,) her full distributive share of the said estate, and took their receipt therefor; and on the 30th day of September, in the same year, he paid to Mary Smoot, another child of the said William, the full amount of her distributive share, and took her receipt therefor; and on the 2d day of March, 1833, he paid to Joseph Williamson, the attorney in fact of the said Abraham Williamson, William Williamson, Richard Williamson and John Williamson, and of Perry Weakley, administrator of Samuel Williamson, Cornelius Williamson and Margaret Wilson, the other children of the said William Williamson, and next of kin, and took his receipt for their several distributive shares. ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-4\">And he further saith, that at the time he made the said payments of the distributive shares to the said Thomas Bailey and Micha his wife, Mary Smoot, Abraham Williamson, Richard Williamson, John Williamson and William Williamson, and Perry Weakley, administrator of Samuel Williamson, Cornelius Williamson and Margaret Wilson, severally, he fully believed that the suit so as aforesaid instituted against this defendant, by the said complainant, was ended, and was wholly ignorant that it lay in waiting to be sprung upon him as soon as the contest with the heirs and distributees of -the said William Williamson was ended.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-5\">And he further saith, that the said Thomas Bailey and Micha his wife, Mary Smoot, Abraham Williamson, Richard Williamson, William Williamson and John Williamson, and Perry Weakley, administrator of the said Samuel Williamson, Cornelius Williamson and Margaret Wilson, or their legal representatives if any of them he deceased, severally, ought to be, but are not, made parties to the said bill; and he claims the same benefit as if he had pleaded such want of parties in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>The order for closing testimony was enlarged from time to time, on application of complainants, until thirty days from the 11th November, 1842.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-3\"><em>Peter Williamson, </em>whose deposition was taken ex parte on the part of the complainant, being called' by the defendant, for the purpose of cross-examination, being duly sworn, saith, I shall be 79 years old on the 24th of July next. My uncle William removed from New Jersey before my recollection. He was at my father\u2019s a long while ago; I forget whether I was married or not. It was after my grandfather\u2019s death. My grandfather died before my,recollection. I don\u2019t know exactly whether it was before my father sold my grandfather\u2019s property or not. I was grown up. It was said he came up to get money of my father, as executor of my grandfather. I don\u2019t know whether he got money the first time or not; whether he got the money the first or second time he came I cannot recollect; but I once wrote a receipt. 1 don\u2019t know how long it was between the first and second time he came. I think he lived in Virginia when he came the second time; never brought any of his f\u00e1mily with him, but came alone both times. When he came the first time, I lived in Amwell with, my father, and don\u2019t know but I did the second time. _ I lived with my father one year after my marriage. I think 1 was married in my 22d year: my first marriage. I then movedlo Six Mile Run, near Brunswick. 1 lived there two years; then went to my father\u2019s, and in two or three weeks moved on the old homestead farm. I lived there a considerable time; don\u2019t know whether I lived there when it was sold by master Linn. It is thirty-three or four years, I think thirty-three years, since I moved away from the homestead. All this I could tell exactly if at home. When my uncle William came the second time I lived on the old place, the old homestead. I remember this by the fact that he went with me at that time to\u2019grandmother De Hart\u2019s burying. My grandmother\u2019s- name was Micha; she was buried at Six Mile Run. I think my uncle William was in about a month, but can\u2019t be positive as to the time. He staid at my father\u2019s the principal part of the time while he was in. I should not like to be right sure whether the receipt I spoke of -was given the first or second time; nor do I remember the sum, nor whether I saw any mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>ney paid. The receipt was for his legacy. I wrote the receipt, uncle William signed it. There was some little dispute about it by my father. 1 wrote a receipt first. My father did not like it, and stated his objections; it was burnt, and he told me how I should write it. Uncle William signed or made his mask. He sat by when I read it; am not sure whether he signed or made his mark, think he signed it; am not sure whether he could read writing or not, but he looked at it as if reading a considerable time. John Hull, who married my aunt Margaret, was present at the time; nobody but us three and aunt Margaret and uncle John were present at the time; I don\u2019t now remember of any body else being present at the time. I read the second receipt aloud in the presence of uncle William and the others. This took place at John Hull\u2019s house. I asked my father, at his own house, which is 4| miles from the homestead, why the business could not be done at home. He said it could not, but must be done at Hull\u2019s; that uncle Bill would be there. Uncle Bill was not present at this conversation between me and my father. John Hull lived on a lot which I believe belonged to his wife, aunt Margaret, about a half mile from the homestead. The receipt was given after the funeral of Micha De Hart. I think the receipt was in full of unde William\u2019s share of grandfather\u2019s estate. There was money handed about, but I do not now recollect the amount. Don\u2019t know that uncle William owed father any thing, or that father ever paid him any tiling before father took the receipt home. Don\u2019t know that \u00cd ever saw it afterwards. There has been- great inquiry for it. If I have ever seen it since, I have forgotten it. I never showed it to Asher Williamson. I could not show it for I <em>hadn't </em>it. Never, that I know of, told Asher Williamson that such a-, receipt had been written by me and signed by my unde William. Don\u2019t know that I recollect the amount of the receipt., \u2019'\u00a1.\u2019here was no other receipt given or payment made at that time1 nor about that time that I know of. If there was-1 should have' wrote it, but I didn\u2019t. Aunt Micha Williamson-lived with moat the old homestead at the time of the receipt.- I expect she had a money legacy left to her by her father; was never pro - sent at any payment to her by my father. I recollect on one occasion hearing aunt Micha growl; at her so\u00ae who lived with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>her, and who had bought a horse with money obtained from-her. She said that money would soon be gone, and I supposed she alluded to the legacy from her father. Father did not pay any money that I remember to aunt Margaret or uncle Hull the day of the receipt from uncle William; nor do I recollect to have seen any money paid by my father to either of them for her legacy. They might have paid it a hundred times and I not been present. I never drew a receipt that I remember from John Hull and Margaret his wife to my father as executor of my grandfather for her legacy. I think if I had I should remember it, but do not remember it. I never witnessed such a receipt. I don\u2019t know of any other receipt than that from uncle William on the day that was given. At the time uncle William' got the money, uncle John lived in Virginia, as was said. He was in after the second visit of uncle William. I remember' that perfectly well, because he borrowed a book of me which he promised to return, but never did'. Don\u2019t rerhember how long it was after uncle William was in that uncle John came. Can\u2019t recollect whether it was about- that time or some' two or three years afterwards. I was once at uncle William\u2019s and uncle' John\u2019s in Virginia. They lived not far apart, I guess it was-before he, uncle William, was in. It might have been after the first time. I Went there to spend money, as-my father said. It was the. second year after I was married. I went there to see the country. Can\u2019t tell what part of Virginia if was. I understood uncle William moved away from Virginia afterwards, bufe \u2022whether he did move,- and where he did move,-1 do not know.The grave-yard where grandmother Micha De Hart was-buried, is a mile below the present church, towards Brunswick,between-the turnpike and the old road. I expect the time of her death' appears upon her grave-stone. Don\u2019t recollect being at Joseph Kughler\u2019s tavern- in- \u00c1mwell, Wit-h my father and Asher Williamson, respecting the estate of my grandfather. Don\u2019t- know that I ever recollect seeing William Maxwell; esquire, with my father and Asher Williamson at Kughler\u2019s; if I did I have forgotten it. Don\u2019t recollect any thing about that receipt having been exhibited to Asher Williamson at Kughler\u2019s. I think- if I-had ever been present when that receipt was exhibited I should now remember it. It was disputed one spell whether there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>a receipt at all or not. Benjamin Johnson asked me about it, and I told him I recollected it perfectly \u25a0well; and then Johnson and myself made a search for nearly a day among my father\u2019s papers, but could not find it. I told Sir. Johnson I was sure there was such a receipt. This was some time after my father\u2019s death. Don\u2019t know that X ever had a conversation with Asher Williamson, at Pennington or elsewhere, about said receipt. Don\u2019t remember being examined as a witness in the chancery suit between my father and the heirs of my uncle Cornelius. X don\u2019t remember being examined before James Linn. I remember being in Pennington once, but don\u2019t remember what took place. X am of opinion that Uriah Bonum came to uncle John Hull\u2019s while we were settling that business. I knew him; it was said <em>that </em>Bonum lived in Kingwood, not a great u'ays, two or three miles from the old place. He was considerable older than me. He is not living now. I know 1 lived on the homestead place several years, don\u2019t remember how many. 1 moved away from it before the war; can\u2019t tell whether I lived on it till it was sold by master Linn or not. I might have made this all out by writing I have at home, if I had a little notice. I moved from the place to Flemington, and kept a tavern two years belonging to John Yan Middlesworth. Then X bought a house at llicefield, in Somerset county, about 2| miles from Flagtown. I got a license and kept a tavern at that house two years. I wont to Ricefield in 1812. X moved from llicefield to Amwell, where John Hill now lives ; I lived there a year, and then went down to the river, near John Phillips\u2019s mill, below Lambertsville. I staid a year at Phillips\u2019s mill, then went to John Knowles\u2019s, about a mile from the river, where I lived a year; I then went to the place where I now live, where I have been ever since. X think it is ten years next spring that I have been there, but I am not right sure. There was no farm to the tavern at llicefield. I gave $1450 for it. I got part of the money from my father to pay for it; can\u2019t say how much; guess somewhere about half of it. All this X could tell if X was home-Never got any money from him since or before. How my father's property was at his decease is more than I know : hut think there was more due to me if it had been divided; but we-<em>never </em>could find his will ;\u2022 he made a will I know. He died <em>at </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Abraham Terhune\u2019s, near Princeton, and I always thought they knew what became of the will. Abraham Terhune married my sister. My father lived at Terhune\u2019s two years, more or <em>less, till his </em>death. Don\u2019t know what property he had when he went to Terhune\u2019s. I don\u2019t remember that I ever told Asher Williamson that I was present at any payment from my father to uncle William, or of any such paymentif I did I have forgotten it. There are many things asked me now which I do not remember.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-4\">And in answer to questions put on the part of the complainants, the witness further saith, (being shown a paper marked Exhibit B.) the signature Peter Williamson \u00e1s a witness on the paper is my signature. Don\u2019t know Uriah Bonum\u2019s handwriting, but expect that signature is his hand-writing, or it would not be there. The body of the paper is my hand-writing, and so is the name of Margaret Hull. She' made her mark, not being able to write. I don\u2019t know that I have any recollection of the occasion when that paper was made. I guess it was not at the time uncle William gave his receipt at John Hull\u2019s. I remember that I made a mistake in the date. I wrote it the first day of the month ; father said it was the second, not the first, and I immediately made the alteration. The paper was executed the very day it bears date; -I saw John Half sign it, and Margaret Hull make her mark.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-5\">And in answer to questions put on the part of the defendant, the witness further saith; the receipt marked Exhibit B. was made at John Hull\u2019s house.

Can\u2019t tell whether Bonum was there by accident, or whether he was sent for at the signing of Exhibit B. I remember well what- Bonum said at' that time. Aunt Margaret was growling at the amount. Bonum said to her, you ought not to growl, it was not the fault of the executor; her father had done it, Bonum, I think, was present when uncle William gave his receipt, but can\u2019t be certain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-6\"><em>Abraham R.

I took out letters of administration of the estate of Samuel Williamson, deceased. I was not at all related to him; was not a creditor, nor had any concern or interest iti the estate. It is so many years ago, I do not recollect at whose instance I took out the letters; I believe it was at Benjamin Johnson\u2019s request. Can\u2019t say who paid the expenses of the administration. I have not got the letters, and do not know where they are. I was a very distant relation of Benjamin Johnson\u2019s, so far that I am not able to say what the relationship was. Don\u2019t recollect any thing of authorizing a bill to be filed for me as administrator of Samuel Williamson, against Asher Williamson and others. Don\u2019t recollect ever feeing counsel in the matter. It appears to me that there was a little estate of Samuel Williamson; it was a trifle any how, and I don\u2019t recollect now what it was. I never knew the hand-writing of William Williamson, the brother of Samuel, or of Peter Williamson, the son of Samuel, or Uriah Bonum ; never saw any one of them write. I saw a receipt purporting to be given by William Williamson to Samuel Williamson, executor of William Williamson, deceased. I don\u2019t recollect the exact sum; it was in pounds, and was over an hundred pounds. Don\u2019t know whether it was genuine or not; I thought it was, it appeared so. The receipt was for a hundred and thirty some pounds. I saw the receipt in 1827 or 1828, I think, but can\u2019t be certain as to the time. I think something has passed between Asher Williamson and me about the receipt, but what it was I .cannot say. Don\u2019t recollect that Asher Williamson ever admitted to me that the receipt was genuine, or that he had any knowledge of it. I recollect hearing Asher Williamson say that if they could find such a receipt he would be willing to pay it, provided he could be clear in so doing; he said he didn\u2019t believe there was such a receipt. I cannot tell when or where this conversation was, or whether any person was present. I knew Peter Williamson by sight for some time; I know nothing about his character for truth and veracity.

I believe Mr. Williamson is allowed to talk a little at random, as some of the rest of us do sometimes. I have frequently heard his general reputation for truth and veracity doubted, but with what propriety I cannot say. I lived, till this spring, between six and seven miles from the old homestead farm of William Williamson, and about \u00f1ine miles from Flag-town, and eleven and a half miles from Eicefield, and not more than six miles from where he, Peter Williamson, has lived the last ten years. We lived in the same township during the Iasi ten years, until the township was divided about three years ago. That division threw me into Raritan, and left him in old Am-well township. Since last spring I live within about four miles of him. I have known him thirty-five, certainly\u2014perhaps forty years. This has been his reputation with some people during the whole time I have known him.

That case was on his application for a pension from the United States as a revolutionary character. Henry Gulick, Williamson\u2019s brother-in-law, was the man who said Williamson had sworn falsely, and he knew it.- He said they were boys together, and he knew Williamson\u2019s statement was not so.

Mr. Clark received Williamson\u2019s pension for him at Trenton, as he told me on the way up. I do not know that I could name any other person who expressed the same opinion; hut whenever I have heard any one talk about it, they have always expressed the same opinion. I do not know that Henry Gulick ever saw Williamson\u2019s affidavit for a pension.

Don\u2019t recollect whether there was a decree revoking the letters or not. All the time which I mentioned on my former examination, during which Abraham Williamson was at the office of Col.

He finally concluded to take it. This was a few days before we came away. John Williamson came on with us as far as his son John\u2019s, where the-writings were executed. There was no contention about John Williamson\u2019s share of his father William Williamson\u2019s estate at this time. I believe the lawsuit was pret,ty much ended at this time. I recollect William Williamson, the brother of John Williamson, being in the state of New Jersey, from the state of Virginia, about fifty years ago. I have frequently heard the Williamson family speak of William Williamson\u2019s being -here as I have stated. I recollect seeing Abraham Williamson here about the year 1827. This Abraham Williamson was the son of William Williamson, the brother of John, and .came from the state of Kentucky. Heard Abraham Williamson say, when he was here, that there was a receipt from his father William to Benjamin Johnson, for a part of his share of his father William Williamson\u2019s estate. I am unable to say with certainty who this receipt was from, or to whom it was given ; but that it was in favor of Benjamin Johnson, and was in the hands of Mr. \u00abSaxton, and that he had destroyed it. Have \u2022heard Abraham Williamson tell this story very frequently.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"195\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b605-4\"><em>Olhniel Lake, </em>a witness produced on the part of the complainants, being duly sworn, sakh: My grandmother and defendant\u2019s father were brother and sister.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"196\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b605-5\">The complainants here .offer evidence of \u00abthe declarations of defendant\u2019s father, defendant himself, his brothers and himself, and it is excepted to so far as \u00abrelates to the declarations of defendant\u2019s father and brothers. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"197\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b605-6\">Witness says, it was always a talk amongst defendant and his father and brothers that Samuel Williamson, from the proceeds of the first sale, had paid to the boys one hundred, and to the girls fifty pounds, except Cornelius, who it was said would not receive anything. I mean the proceeds of the sale of the old homestead of William Williamson, the father of William and Samuel Williamson. It was also talked that receipts had been given for these shares. After this suit was brought I heard the defendant say, that these receipts ought to have been brought in before, when they settled. Among the receipts there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>was one talked of for \u00a3100 given by William to Samuel Williamson. After the death of Cornelius Williamson, the father of defendant, the receipt last spoken of -was talked about, and I have heard it talked of scores of times. I can\u2019t say how soon after the death of Cornelius Williamson I first heard this receipt talked about. It might have been ten years or two years. I* had heard of this receipt before this suit was brought. I ean\u2019t say positively that I ever heard defendant say anything about this receipt till after the suit was brought, and I can\u2019t say that I did not'. I don\u2019t recollect that I have ever heard defendant say anything about the payment of \u00a3106 by Samuel Williamson to William Williamson. I have heard defendant\u2019s brother William speak about it, and I don\u2019t doubt I have heard defendant speak about it, but I can\u2019t recollect. It was always talked of so amongst the family. I never heard it denied. Shortly after the death of defendant\u2019s father, there was a good deal of talk between my family and defendant\u2019s about the payments to the heirs of old William Williamson\u2019s estate.- I mean about the payments of \u00a3100 to- the boys, and \u00a350 to the girls. Abraham Williamson, the son of William Williamson the younger, was here from the state of Kentucky, a year or two before the court-house in this county was burned in 1826-27. He said he was here to receive his father William\u2019s share of his grandfather William Williamson\u2019s estate, and he said he had a power of attorney for the purpose, and that he was the administrator in Kentucky of his father\u2019s estate. He said that his father had received \u00a3100 of his brother Samuel Williamson of the estate of William Williamson the elder and had given a receipt for it. And he said he would deduct this out of his father\u2019s share and settle with defendant. The suit was then pending between Benjamin Johnson and defendant. In <em>a </em>conversation between Abraham Williamson and Benjamin Johnson, Abraham Williamson said, my father has received the \u00a3100 from Samuel Williamson, and has given a receipt for it, and he was willing to deduct that out of his.father\u2019s share. Johnson said it was more than \u00a3100. Williamson said it was but \u00a3100, as he had always understood' from his father, and the receipt would speak for itself. Some three or four months after this, Abraham Williamson came to my house, and in conversation said, Mr. Johnson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>lias lost his claim now, but, if you and I were in Flcmington, behind Bonnell\u2019s big shed,'under a big stone, I could show you a paper that would tell all about it. I understood him to refer to this receipt. I remarked to him1 that whether he had got this receipt honestly or dishonestly he ought to tell no man, for he might get into a deal of trouble by it. I never before this time heard that this receipt was lost. I never heard its existence denied till after this. He would sometimes say that Mr. Bardes liad destroyed it, and sometimes that Mr. Saxton had destroyed it; and that Mr. Saxton would accuse Mr. Bardes of selling it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"198\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-4\">And being cross-examined on the part of the defendant, says: llis wife and children were present during the conversation of Abraham Williamson at his house, as he has stated. When I told him that he ought not to tell any man about the receipt, he made no reply. I recollect of bearing William Williamson, brother of defendant, talk about the payment aforesaid, to the' heirs of William Williamson, and I don\u2019t recollect distinctly of hearing any other one of the family talk about it; but 3 have no doubt I have heard defendant talk about it, and I have never beard it denied. I have heard defendant say, since the suit was brought, that if there was such a paper it ought to have been produced at the time of the settlement. I don\u2019t recollect of ever hearing defendant say any thing else than this about this payment or receipt. \u00cd have heard William, defendant\u2019s brother, talk about it, at my father\u2019s office. I think that Cornelius Williamson, the father of the defendant, died more than thirty years ago. I might have been fifteen years old at the time. I shall be fifty-one years of age the 19th January next. For aught I know defendant and I are on friendly terms. I believe we generally speak when we meet Some years ago we had some disputes, and we had a trial at law, and I don\u2019t know whether it is settled yet or not. We have not had much intercourse since this dispute. I don\u2019t recollect distinctly of ever hearing Cornelius Williamson, the father of the defendant, talk about the payment to William Williamson and the receipt for \u00a3100 ; but heard him say the heirs were all paid but him, and he would not have any if he could not get more. I don\u2019t recollect particularly of hearing any of defendant\u2019s brothers besides William talk about this payment or receipt. I have heard Wil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>liam talk about it more than any of the rest. I never heard William say that he knew of his own knowledge that such a receipt had been given by his uncle William. I don\u2019t mean to say that I ever heard any of the family say that they knew that such a receipt had been given. I have heard my grandmother talk more about it than any body else. I never heard Abraham Williamson deny that such a receipt had been given by his father, but after he told me the story about the stone behind Bonnell\u2019s shed, he'said if they had such a receipt let them produce it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"199\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-4\">In April, 1848, the cause was heard in the court of chancery, before William Pennington, Chancellor, and in July, 1843, an interlocutory decree was made as follows: \u201c It appearing to the court that Samuel Williamson,- the executor of William Williamson the- elder, deceased, in the pleadings in this case mentioned, on the 2d'day of April, 1792, paid to- William Williamson- the younger, in the pleadings also mentioned, the sum1 of 15131 10s. for his share of the proceeds of the first sale' of the real estate of the said William Williamson the elder, deceased^ made by the said Samuel Williamson, deceased, as in the pleadings mentioned, for which said payment a receipt and- acquittance, bearing date on th\u00e1t day, was made and given by the said William Williamson the younger to the said Samuel Williamson, executor as aforesaid, as-in the pleadings mentioned :- And- it farther appearing to the court that the said judgment recovered in the supreme court of this state,- on the 27th day of February, in the year of our Lord 1822, in the name of William S.

That the widow lived on the premises until she died, which was in December, 1787. Cornelius, the oldest son, never proved the will, but Samuel did prove the same, on the 16th June, 1774. That on the 11th March, 1789, two years after the death of his mother, Samuel offered the farm for sale at auction, having given previous notice of such sale; that Cornelias and several of the brothers were there, but refused to <em>bid; </em>that Samuel directed his own son Cornelius to bid, and he did bid, for the farm, forty-two shillings the acre. Samuel, the executor, did not then strike it off; but, for want of a better offer, on the 9th of August, 1792, he conveyed the farm to his said son Cornelius, who, soon after, re-conveyed the farm to his father Samuel. That the farm, according to the ancient deeds, contained only 290 acres; but upon a re-survey was found to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>contain about 90 or 100 acres more. That the testator\u2019s son Cornelius took possession of the excess, claiming it as heir-at-law. That Samuel Williamson, the executor, paid the legacies ; that his brother Abraham had died intestate and without issue; and that on the 2d April, 1792, ho divided the residue of the amount of sale of the said farm, at forty-two shillings an acre, into four equal parts, being \u00a3127 5s. each; and having retained one share for himself, he, on that day, paid to his brother William Williamson \u00a3131 10s. for his share, and took his receipt and acquittance therefor in full. That on the 30lh September, 1793, he paid his brother John in part, and on the 3d of October he paid him the balance, and took his receipt: and that he afterwards, as he alleges, settled with his brother Cornelius for his share, leaving the disputo about the surplus land unsettled. That the said Cornelius afterwards died, leaving a will, and leaving six children, viz.: William, Cornelius, Asher, Joseph, Bernice, Patience and Micha. It further appears, that on the 20th November, 1809, the said children of Cornelius, the brother of Samuel, filed a bill against Samuel, to set aside the sale made by him, and for aft account. The case recites this bill, and the answer of Samuel to the same, which was put in on the 10th July, 1810, and the proceedings thereon; by which it appears, that on the 11th of September, 1811, Chancellor Bloomfield decreed that the solo by Samuel was fraudulent and void ; that the whole farm should be re-sold by him, under the direction of a master; that the sale should be reported to the court, and the proceeds should be brought into court; that the master should take an account of rents and profits from the 11th March, 1789, when Samuel took possession under his own sale, <em>&amp;c. </em>That on the 24th October, 1812, the master reported that the rents and profits which ought to be charged to Samuel amounted to $2760; and that he ought to he allowed for improvements $505. Exceptions wove filed by Samuel to this report, in March term, 1813. On the \u2014 day of .\u2014, A. D. \u2014, Samuel Williamson, under the direction of the master, sold the entire farm for the sum of $7923 31; which being brought into court, the cause came on to bo heard before Chancellor Ogden, upon the equity reserved, in September, 1813; and on the 22d October, 1813, the Chancellor made a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>decree, that the master should pay, out of the monies in court, to the representatives of Cornelius, the son of the testator, William Williamson the elder, the one fifth part of the sum of $10,178 21, the aggregate amount of the sales last aforesaid and of the rents and profits reported by the master, after deducting therefrom \u00a3100 given to the two daughters, and \u00a3100 given by the testator to his son Abraham, with interest from 1792, when those legacies were paid by Samuel, and after deducting also $173 80 for the master\u2019s fees] and that the master should pay over the residue, after deducting the complainant\u2019s costs, to the said Samuel, to be by him disposed of according to the will of his father, upon his giving bond with security, &amp;c. A re-hearing was then moved for and granted. It took place in June, 1814, before William S. Pennington, Chancellor, who, on the 11th June, 1814, decreed that the sum of $523 33, which had been allowed to Samuel for money paid to his brother Cornelius as his share of the proceeds of the first sale, should be stricken out, so as to increase the sum due to Cornelius by that amount, and make it $1744 88, instead of $1221 55; and confirmed the decree in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">By the decree of William S. Pennington, Chancellor, made in June term, 1814, the share of William Williamson was fixed at $1744 88. For this sum, with interest from the date of that decree, Asher Williamson, as administrator of William Williamson, recovered judgment against Benjamin Johnson, and raised the whole amount on execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">By the decree of William Pennington, Chancellor, the above sum was too much by the amount of \u00a3131 10s. paid by Samuel Williamson to William Williamson on the 2d April, 1792, with interest ther\u00e9on from that time to the 25th June, 1814, the date of the decree of the first Chancellor Pennington.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The account will, then, stand thus:</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">25th June, 1814. Amount of share then decreed to be due William Williamson, $1744 88</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Deduct from that, 1st, \u00a3131 10s. equal to $350 66 Interest at 7 per cent, from 2d April, 1792, to 25th June, 1814, 22y. 2m. 23d. 545 67</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">------- 896 33</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">Shows the decree was too much by $848 55</p>\n<p id=\"b615-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>As therefore Asher Williamson, as administrator of William Williamson, sued for and received of Benjamin Johnson $848 55 too much, with interest from the 25th June, 1814, Johnson is entitled to recover back that sum, with interest from that time to the 3d October, 1843, the date of master Beading\u2019s report. The account will then stand thus:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">Amount of excess decreed by Chancellor William S.

It is established beyond all doubt by the testimony of Mr. Saxton and Mr. Bartles. Their testimony was given at a time when the facts and circumstances stated by them must have been fresh in their memory.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">That that writing was surreptitiously abstracted from the office of Mr. Saxton, 1 am fully convinced; at any rate it has been destroyed or lost beyond recovery, and therefore its non-production fully accounted for. I am equally well satisfied it was genuine, and <em>not a </em>forged or spurious instrument; and if so, we are bound to believe that the money mentioned in it was actually paid by Samuel Williamson, according to the tenor of the writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">It is admitted by the defendant, at least it cannot be denied for the record proves it, that he obtained a judgment against Johnson for the whole amount of William Williamson\u2019s share of his father\u2019s estate, without any allowance for this disputed payment. It is equally true that the defendant obtained the whole amount of that judgment, with interest and costs, by a aale, under execution, of what (at least between him and Johnson) was Johnson\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>It follows, then, that the defendant actually received, as administrator of his uncle, William Williamson, \u00a3131 10s. more than he ought to have done, with interest upon it from the time it became due from his uncle Samuel to his uncle William Williamson, up to the date of the judgment, with interest, again, upon the aggregate amount from that time until he received the money from the sheriff; and, consequently, that the defendant, in fact and in conscience, now owes to Johnson the sum of \u00a3131 10s., with such accumulated interest upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-3\">Johnson now seeks to recover back this money; and conscience at once asks, why should he not ? The answer to this question has been given us in the shape of various objections, which have been taken and pressed with great learning and ability by the defendant\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Before 1 proceed, however, to consider these objections, I cannot refrain from noticing the fact, that for all that appears, the defendant has the money yet, or has applied it to his own use; at least I see no evidence on the record that he has ever paid one dollar of it to the children of William Williamson. If so, he may, in a court of equity, be fairly considered, as to this excess of payment, a trustee for Johnson ; and if he pays <em>it to </em>him under the direction of the chancellor, he is in no danger of being compelled to pay it over again to the children of his intestate, William Williamson.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Nevertheless, this court cannot affirm this decree and compel the defendant to pay back the money to Johnson, unless we can do so upon sound and safe principles, settled and recognized, or at least clearly within the powers and attributes of a'court of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">What, then, are the objections urged by the defendant\u2019s counsel ? They are as follows:\u2014\u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">1. That Johnson has no <em>locus standi </em>in court. He had no\u2019 title or interest in the lands which were sold for the satisfaction of the judgment. He had conveyed the lands to William H. and Clarissa .Johnson, his children, in fee, for the fraudulent purpose of defeating the judgment creditor. That that conveyance, although void as against the plaintiff in execution, was valid and effectual to all intents and purposes, in law and in equity, as against him; that if an excess of money had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>raised by the sheriff on the execution, he must have paid it to William H. and Clarissa Johnson, and not to their father: and, consequently, he has no title to any of the money recovered on that judgment, even if the judgment was for more than it ought to have been. That if there was an error in the judgment, as that judgment was paid by the children, they and not their father were the persons who ought to have come here to get it back. That if he was now living and the defendant was ready and willing to refund the money, he could not safely pay it to Johnson, but would be bound to pay it to his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">The argument is plausible, but not sound. In the first place^ if it was a fraudulent conveyance the children were parties to that fraud, and could have no better standing, at law or in equity, to recover back that money, than their father had. Ergo, the defendant may retain the excess of the judgment, and the sheriff might have retained the surplus money which arose on the salo. The statement of this result is a sufficient refutation of the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Suppose a judgment clearly shown to have been obtained by fraud, or admitted to have been given by mistake, for twice as much as it ought to have been, would a court of equity refuse relief to the defendant, because he was a bad man and had conveyed away his property to defeat his creditors? Would the court say to him, you are a bad and dishonest man, and therefore we wont help you: we wont relieve you against a plain mistake, or even a judgment obtained against you by the grossest fraud ? I think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">When a man comes into court to get hold of property which by his own fraud or injustice has <em>got </em>into- the hands of his adversary,, or his title to which is founded in fraud or injustice, a court of equity will not hear him. It is sufficient to say this is not such a case. The maxim cited by counsel, does not apply to it: a court of equity will not inquire into- a man\u2019s character before it will relieve him against fraud, accident or mistake, unless by his own dishonest or unjust conduct he got himself into\u00bb the difficulty he wants the court to get him out of.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Cut again: Whether that conveyance from Johnson to luschildren, was a fraudulent one or not, is not a materia! issue in-this cause. The plaintiff in the judgment got his \u00a1money, sate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>whether the conveyance was fraudulent or not, is of no consequence to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Again, whether fraudulent or not, Johnson, was bound by his covenants to his children, and was responsible over to them.. He conveyed the premises, whether with or without consideration, to his children, <em>legally subject </em>to that judgment, and therefore was legally liable over to them. Admitting, therefore, that they, as owners of the land which had been sold to satisfy the judgment, might, in the lifetime of their father, have come into equity to get bask the excess; they cannot do it now; for they have recognized their father\u2019s right to the money by making themselves complainants in this suit, and have thereby estopped themselves from ever claiming the money in their own right. I am, for all these reasons, of opinion that there is nothing in this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\"><em>2. </em>It is objected, that the order to amend was on payment of costs and serving a copy of the amended bill gratis;. that t/his was a condition precedent and was never performed, so that, in fact, the defendant considered the suit as at an end, and that his counsel told him, when the chancellor pronounced his opinion sustaining the plea and demurrer, that there was an end of the suit, and he might go home and would never hear any more of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">As to what his counsel may have told him* it can have- no-influence here. He and his solicitor and counsel were in court when the decree was pronounced; and the order- for leave to amend was embodied in the very decretal order sustaining the plea and demurrer. They had notice, then, that the suit was not at an end ; for the decree does not dismiss- the bill out of court, but on the contrary, in its very terms, retains it in court, with leave to the complainant- to amend it. It was the duty, then, of the defendant to attend to it, and follow it <em>up; </em>and if the complainant did' not pay the costs, amend his-bill and serve a copy within a reasonable time,, he should have applied to the chancellor for a final decree dismissing the bill with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">As to the- non-performance of the condition precedent, paying fcost-s, &amp;c., it was a mere irregularity, of which the party should have availed himself at the time; but he actually waived it by subsequently applying for leave to answer, and by putting in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>an answer to the amended bill. Instead of doing that,, ho ought to have moved the chancellor to dismiss the amended bill, on the ground that no costs had been paid and no copy served. Ah to the defendant\u2019s having no knowledge of the suit being still in court and of the bill having been amended, it is untrue, unless Mr. Saxton has sworn grossly and wilfully false. But how can the defendant make such an assertion, when, by his own affidavit, he has admitted, and, in fact, expressly stated, that before Mr. Stockton\u2019s death he received notice to appoint another solicitor <em>1 </em>That he afterwards as expressly denied it in his answer cannot relieve him : hut serves-only to weaken our confidence in other matters sworn to by him in his answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">3. The third objection is, that the suit had abated by the death of Johnson, and the order made by Chancellor Vroom that <em>it </em>stand revived in <em>the </em>names of the present complainants was a nullity. Coupled with this exception, it was insisted that the deposition o\u00ed\" Mr. Saxton, mads after that order of revival, and before the subsequent one made by Chancellor Seely, must be ruled out, as extra-judicial, or <em>coram non judice, </em>there being no suit then depending in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">If I am not mistaken, the deposition of Peter 'Williamson, if not of others on the part of the complainants, stands in the game category, and was taken under the same circumstances. But, however that may be, .it is a full and complete answer to the whole of this matter, that it is too late for the defendant to complain of it. l;i the first place, instead of applying to the chancellor to open the decree and he permitted to answer, and to cross-examine the witnesses, he ought to have moved the chancellor to open the decree, and to declare the suit abated by the death of the complainant; or to set aside all the proceedings which had taken place after the death of the complainant and before the revival of the suit by the order of Chancellor Se\u00e9ly, as <em>coram non judice </em>and void. Secondly, the defendant must be considered as having waived this irregularity by putting in an answer to the bill, taking testimony in the cause, and cross-examining witnesses that had been sworn and examined on the part of the complainant. And thirdly, if he wanted to get rid of the deposition of Mr. Saxton, the defendant ought, to have moved the chancellor, before the cause was heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>upon the pleadings and proofs, to expunge that evidence as unduly and irregularly taken. If that had been done, the complainant might have re-examined Mr. Saxton before the hearing, and removed the difficulty. But, surely, the chancellor did not intend, by giving the defendant leave to cross-examine the witnesses that had already been examined, to give him an opportunity of making his election among those witnesses, and then on the hearing of the cause to exclude the deposition of Mr. Saxton or of any other witness, sworn under like circumstances, that he chose not to re-examine. This would, in effect, have been to permit the defendant to play a trick on the complainant, and practice a fraud on the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">It is said, however, by counsel, that Mr. Saxton\u2019s affidavit was a mere voluntary one, upon which no perjury could be assigned. But I am not so clear that the proposition is true. A cause was pending in court, <em>under the decretal order </em>of the chancellor; and however irregularly so, the witness was sworn in that cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">I am of opinion that the decree appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Nevius, Whitehead, Randolph and Carpenter, Justices, and Porter, Schence, Speer, Robertson and Spencer, Judges, concurred with the Chief Justice.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"220\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b620-7\">The President</author>\n<p id=\"Akj\">dissented. And, having prepared no written opinion at the time of the decision of the cause, has furnished the reporter with the following statement of the grounds of his dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">1st. The executor, in conveying to his son, In August, 1792, was guilty of a fraud. The attempted sale and conveyance have been decreed to be fraudulent and void ; and the case stands as if no such conveyance had ever been made. The \u2022money, then, which it is alleged William Williamson received from Samuel Williamson, was not a part of the proceeds of a \u2022sale of the real estate, but Samuel Williamson\u2019s (he was the \u25a0executor) own money. All that can be said is, that William Williamson received from Samuel Williamson money for which \u00a1Samuel Williamson in his own right, not as executor, might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Slave maintained assumpsit. But his remedy was lost by lapse of time. Samuel Williamson cannot be relieved from this position unless a benefit can be permitted to result to him as executor from h\u2018is fraudulent act as an individual. This cannot be permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">And in point of iact, the money, if any was paid to William Williamson, was not money of the estate, but Samuel Williamson\u2019s own money; for the deed to his son was not then made, and was not made until four months thereafter. It is probable that Samuel Williamson did not feel safe in his contemplated fraud in executing a deed to his son, unless he could first induce William Williamson to receive, as on a sale represented to be \u2022consummated, his share of the consideration money of the pretended sale, in full of his share of the estate. I cannot consent, in aid of a fraud -doer, to construe such an ad vance of money \u2018by Samuel Williamson to be an advance of money by him as executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">I think it more consistent with every consideration of policy, and with the firmness with which courts of equity set their faces against fraud, more especially against fraud in executors, that Samuel Williamson shall suffer the loss of the money which, in 1792, he risked in such a venture, than that William Williamson\u2019s estate or Asher Williamson should now be obliged to pay .$2256, with interest thereon from October, 1843.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Twenty years elapsed from the time when the '$350 is said \u00a1to have been received by William Williamson from Samuel Williamson to the time when the lands of the estate were sold under the direction of a master, the court of chancery having so ordered in view of the fraud which had been committed or attempted by Samuel Williamson; and the proceeds of the sale were deposited in the court of chancery, by order of that court; and was afterwards ordered to be paid to the executor, on his giving bond, with surety, for the performance of the trust reposed in him by the will of his testator.. The bond was given, with Benjamin Johnson, the present complainant, as surety, and the proceeds of the sale, after certain deductions, were thereupon paid to the executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">It seems clear to me that, neither in law nor in equity, can any allowance be made to the executor or to his surety, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>money which Samuel Williamson, twenty years before, had fraudulently and of his own money put into the hands of William Williamson.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">2d. The decree in this case has been reached by allowing the executor, or Johnson as his surety, interest on the $350 fraudulently given by Samuel Williamson, in April, 1792, to William Williamson \u00e1s his full share of the estate. This, also, I think erroneous. It would be oppressive and ruinous, after a great lapse of years, to charge a man with interest on money which he received as his own; and was, therefore, at liberty to spend as his own; and there is no principle on which such charge can be sustained. If my first objection to the decree could be overcome, the most that equity could require would be, that what William Williamson received from Samuel Williamson should be deducted from the amount of the share which, after the fraud was exposed and remedied, was found to be actually due from the executor to William Williamson. Samuel Williamson was in possession of the lands from March, 1789, to March, 1812. All that can be required is that, the $350 shall relieve the executor from the rents and profits, as far as it will go. William Williamson never agreed to receive this money in a way to charge him with interest for it; and under the circumstances of this case, no implied \u00a1agreement by him to pay interest for. it can be raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">On the 2d April, 1792, William Williamson received from Samuel Williamson, - ' - - - $350 66</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Samuel had then been in possession of the lands three years and twenty days. William Williamson\u2019s fifth of the rents and profits for that time, at the animal rent fixed by master Linn, is ... 68 75</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Samuel\u2019s actual advance was only - - $281 91</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">At September, 1804, William Williamson\u2019s fifth of the rents and profits had repaid Samuel this ^$281 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">William Williamson\u2019s share of the rents and profits, from September, 1804, to March 11th, 1812, when the executor delivered up possession, seven years and six months, is $168 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>The lands were sold, under the direction of a master, for ------- $7923 31</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Deduct the allowance made for improvements, ------ $505 00</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Also the legacies, and the interest on them for twenty years, (which interest, if chargeable upon the lands at all, was a loss inflicted on those interested in the lands by the fraudulent conduct of the executor,) 1280 06-</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Also the account of master Linn for superintending the sale,' $173 80; also said</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">master\u2019s commissions on the money paid into court, $69 24(both which last items of expense grew out of the fraud of the executor,) 243 04'</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Deduct also the costs of the complainants in the suit in which the sale by the executor was decreed to be fraudulent, (which costs also grew out of the fraudulent conduct of the executor, and ought properly to be charged upon him, and not upon the fund,) 2021 23\u20142230 <em>27</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">Net proceeds of the sales, after all deductions, $5693 04</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">William Williamson\u2019s-fifth of this balance is $1138 61 interest on $1138 61, from March 11th, 1812, <em>to</em></p>\n<p id=\"AiE\">February 27th, 1822, the date of the judgment against Johnson, 9 years, 11 f months, 793 67</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">Wm. Williamson\u2019s share of the rents, &amp;c., as above,. 168 7&amp;</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">Due the William Williamson share at the1 time the ------ judgment was entered, - $2101 03</p>\n<p id=\"b623-14\">The judgment was for $2251 78, only $1.50 more than the result of the above calculation. If we should strike out the allowance made in the above calculation for interest on the legacies, and the expenses of the sale under the direction of a master, and the costs of the suit in which the fraudulent sale by the executor was set aside; all which are, by reason of the fraud of \u25a0 the executor, more- properly chargeable upon him than upon the fund, the amount due William Williamson at the time of iuo judgment will be found to be nearly $1.00 more than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>amount for which judgment was entered. It is certainly true that all these extraordinary charges upon the fund have been, induced by the fraudulent conduct of the executor; and the loss which William Williamson, or those who are entitled to his share sustain thereby is greater than the loss which the executor or his estate would sustain by being obliged to pay the amount of the judgment recovered against his surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Nothing is denied to the executor in the foregoing calculation but interest on $281 91, from April, 1792, to September, 1804;. a very trifling injury, for he was receiving $22 50 of the $281 9beach successive year, in William Willi\u00e1mson\u2019s share of the rents and profits; and interest is properly denied to him; he cannot on any principle be allowed interest on money which he fraudulently induced William Williamson to receive as his share of the .estate, when his share was many times greater. Is the executor to be permitted to charge the estate with all the expenses, and the interest on the. legacies, and the costs consequent upon his fraud and the delay induced thereby in settling the estate, and yet ask interest on the sum which he advanced for the purpose of effecting his fraudulent design; a small sum, indeed, when advanced, but which, with interest from 1792 .to the time of the decree in chancery, compounded as in master Reading\u2019s report,, amounted to more than the whole amount of the judgment recovered for the share of William Williamson.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The oppressive result of an affirmance of this decree on the one hand, and the very slight injury, if any injury at all, that can be complained of on the other side, if matters are left to stand as they were placed by the judgment, are considerations which constrain me to refuse my assent to an affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">I cannot imagine that any member of the court could consider the executor himself entitled to any relief. The consideration that the complainant was a surety for the executor has, I have no doubt, influenced the mind of the court. But, if the principal has no legal or equitable defence or right, by reason of a fraud committed or attempted prior to the time when the bond with surety was given, can the surety have any such defence or right? If the principal was not entitled to. interest on the money fraudulently advanced by him long before the bond with surety was given, can the surety be entitled to have such in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>tcrest allowed in his favor ? I think not. An executor\u2019s giving security after a past fraud cannot cure that fraud in favor either of the principal or of the surety. And surely the conduct of this surety has not been such as to induce us to resort to constrained reasonings, or to compound with sophisms, in his favor. This leads me,</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">3dly, To another objection against affirming the decree to which, as it seems to me, no satisfactory answer has been given. It is this: While the suit against Johnson was pending, and before judgment had been recovered therein, Johnson, without consideration, and for the purpose of defeating the object of the suit, conveyed all his real estate to Ms son and daughter. This divested him- of all title to or interest in the lands, as much so as if he had received a full consideration therefor. He could not, by any proceeding on his part, recover back the land, or any part of it: nor, if a judgment was recovered against him for too much, in the suit which the conveyance was intended to defeat, and the creditor levy upon and sell the land, on the ground that, the fraudulent conveyance of it did not put it beyond his reach, and the fraudulent grantees buy the land at the sheriff\u2019s sale and pay the judgment, can the fraudulent grantor have the aid of a court of equity to recover back the excess of the judgment over the true amount for which it should have been entered. To allow him to do this would be to allow him to recover a part of the proceeds of the sale of the land which he had fraudulently conveyed, and of all interest in which he had fraudulently divested himself, when he would not be allowed to recover back the land or any part of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Johnson can derive no aid from the fact that his deed to his children contained a warranty against incumbrances. There was no incumbrance at the time the conveyance was <em>made; </em>the judgment had not then bean recovered. Nor has he paid the judgment, unless a court of equity can be willing to say he has paid the judgment because he fraudulently conveyed away his property for the purpose of defeating a creditor of the end and object of his suit. 3 confess I am unable to yield to the course of reasoning which the Chief Justice has adopted in answer to this objection. And I am quite as unable to imdergiand the precise meaning of the Chief Justice <em>hi </em>saying that <em>uUe </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>(Johnson) conveyed the premises to his children legally subject to the judgment, and was therefore legally liable over to them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">I do not see that this surety can reasonably ask a court of equity to depart from settled and most salutary principles to relieve him from the effects of his own fraud. The claim of the complainant, in the most liberal view in which it can be presented, may be stated thus: A surety for an executor, believing that the executor, who was dead,, had in his lifetime paid and taken a receipt for a portion of a elaim existing against him, but being unable to- find the receipt, makes no defence to a suit against Mm, the- surety, but, for the purpose of defeating the creditor, before judgment is entered, fraudulently conveys all his property to his <em>children; </em>judgment is afterwards entered, and execution is issued thereon and the ski\u00bb recovered is raised by a sale of the lands conveyed to the children ; the receipt is afterwards found and it thus appears that the judgment was for too much. Will a court of equity decree to the fraudulent grantor the amount of the receipt ? Suppose that after the fraudulent conveyance the receipt is discovered and the judgment is thereby prevented; would a court of equity decree the reconveyance of the lands to the fraudulent grantor ? In my judgment an affirmative- answer to either of these questions cannot be- reached by sound reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Again, the decree is against <em>Asher Williamson, </em>and1 the amount q\u00a3 it is ordered to be raised out of the goeds and chattels, lands and tenements of <em>Asher Williamson. </em>The judgment was recovered by him and the amount thereof was- received by him as the. administrator &amp;c. of William Williamson.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">There was an allegation in the first bill that Asher Williamson, before he obtained letters of administration of the personal estate of William Williamson the younger, deceased, purchaseg from the- heirs of the said William, or some of them, their claim against the executor, Samuel. If it had been shown that Asher had purchased the rights of the heirs of William Williamson, the decree, if right in other respects, might have been against Asher. personally; but no proof of such purchase appeared ; and the second bill contained no such allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">I think the decree should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
