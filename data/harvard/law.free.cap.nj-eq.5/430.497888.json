Reckless, being indebted to <em>\u201c </em>The Commercial Bank of New Jersey\u201d on four promissory notes, drawn by said Reckless, and indorsed, respectively, by another person, and discounted by the said bank, being renewals of previous notes of long standing, \u25a0for the better securing the same, and as collateral security, therefor, on -the 5th March, 1841, executed his bond to the said bank, conditioned for the payment of $3600, the amount of said four-notes, and, to secure the payment of tlie sum mentioned in -the condition of the said bond, executed, with his wife, the.mortgage set forth in the hill: that the mortgage was acknowledged by J. <em>W. </em>Reckless and wife, on the day of its date, and was registered on the 24th March, 1841. That after -the execution of the bond and mortgage, they were delivered to the complainants. That ,J. W. Reckless, or some person for him and in his name and by his authority, under the plea or pretence of procuring the assignment of a certain policy of insurance on the premises, to the complainants, and the assent qf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>the insurance company to the assignment, shortly after the delivery to the complainants of the bond and mortgage, procured them from the complainants, with the full understanding and belief of the complainants that they were to be returned to the complainants, when the object for which they were taken was' accomplished. That the mortgage was returned to the complainants ; but that .Reckless, at all times thereafter, refused to-deliver up the bond to the complainants ; and that the bond remains in the possession or under the control of Reckless.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-3\">The complainants charge that the bond was actually deliver-ed to them with the mortgage ; and insist that their rights are not affected by the detention of the bond ; and further insist, that \u201c as the mortgage was given as security for the payment of the notes, to the amount specified in the mortgage and bond, their right in such- security is good and perfect, independently of the bond, which was not the evidence of the debt, but merely designated the amount for which security was given.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-4\">J. W. Reckless, in his answer, admits his indebtedness outlie notes; and says, that on the 5th March, 1841, and for several weeks previous, he was- sick and confined to his house and bedroom, and that during his iilness he was applied to' from time to time and importuned' by the bank to secure the notes by a bond and mortgage on property at Amboy; which he repeatedly refused to- do, because he had no property except what he acquired by his marriage, and which, by an agreement with his wife before marriage, ho was bound to convey in trust for her. That being debilitated in mind and body by his sickness, he was so far overcome by the importumticG- of the hank that he had a bond drawn up, of the description mentioned in the bill, and also the mortgage mentioned in the bill, and which is now in the complainants\u2019 possession; and that on the said 5th March, 1841, Judge Potter came to his room-where he was confined, and he executed the bond in the presence of the said judge, and he and his wife executed the mortgage and acknowledged it before the said judge; but that neither the bond nor the mortgage was ever delivered by him, or by his authority, to the complainants or to any person for them; and that the bond has never been out of his possession. That im - mediately after the bond and mortgage were signed, ho dots'?*<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>mined in his own mind never to deliver them, for the reason that the1 property embraced in-the mortgage was the property of his wife, and\u2019 was agreed to be secured to her, as before stated ; and that be never did deliver them. That a'few days after the mortgage was signed, his son Anthony, at the request of the said defendant, took the mortgage out of his possession,- and went with'it to the clerk\u2019s office for the purpose of procuring a certificate of s'earch ; and, as he is informed by Anthony and verily believes, Anthony took the mortgage to the clerk\u2019s' office, and left it there with the direction to have a search made as to incumbrances on <em>the </em>property; and that, without his knowledge or authority, and; as he is informed and believes, \u25a0 without the knowledge, direction or consent'of Anthony, the\u2019 complainants procured the mortgage from the clerk\u2019s office: and that they obtained possession of it without his consent or know-' ledge, and contrary to his wishes and intentions. That neither \u2019 he, nor any person by his authority, ever called at the bank and procured the mortgage or bond for the purpose mentioned in the-bill. That Anthony went to New-York, after the bond and mortgage were signed, and without having the mortgage,to obtain a renewal of an old policy of' insurance on the premises, taking the old policy with him, and did obtain the renewal; and that he is informed by Anthony and verily believes, that Anthony never obtained the mortgage from the bank for that or any other purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-3\">Mary Ann Reckless, the wife of Joseph W. Reckless, answer-ing for herself, says, that she signed the mortgage with her husband, at the time and place and in the manner stated by him; that she'never knew of any delivery of the bond and mortgage to the complainants or any person for them; and that she knows no matter or thing variant from the facts stated by J.

Reckless in the answer, or in any way inconsistent therewith ; and that she knows no additional fact concerning the execution or delivery of the bond and <em>mortgage.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-4\">Joseph W. Reckless, further answering, says, that since the date of the bond and mortgage, the complainants have sued and obtained judgments on the said several notes, and issued executions, and caused the property described in the mortgage, with other property, to be levied on and advertised for sale; and' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>that his wife and her trustee exhibited their bill in this court, claiming the property by virtue of the trust deed referred to ia the bill, and obtained an injunction restraining the complainants from selling the property under the said executions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-3\">The defendants admit, that on June 11th, 1842, they conveyed the premises to Nathan Sattcrthwaite, and say that before their intermarriage, the said Mary Ann was seized in fee of the premises, and it was agreed between them, previous to their marriage, and that it was'the agreement on which the marriage contract was entered into, that all the property of the said Mary Ann, real and personal, should be conveyed to a trustee, upon such trusts as would secure the' same for her use, and beyond the control and free from the debts and liabilities of her said husband; and that' the conveyance to the said Nathan was made in pursuance of the said ante-nuptial agreement, upon certain uses and trusts, and subject to certain powers and limitations mentioned in the deed, (referring to the deed.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-4\">A replication was filed July 22d, 3 844.

A bond being produced by J. W. Reckless and shown to the witness, marked Exhibit 1 on the part of the defendants; he says it is signed in the liand-writing of his father, J. W. Reckless, and is the bond referred to ia the mortgage; that he was present when the bond and mortgage were signed by his father; they were signed at his father\u2019s house, in Amboy, he thinks about ten days or two weeks after they boar date. His father ivas then confined to his house by sickness, and had been for two or three weeks; he was not confined to his room at the time ho signed the bond and mortgage. During his sickness he had been confined to his room, but not to his bed. After they were signed he took them into his possession : they were delivered to him by his father. He placed them with his private papers in a small trunk; and in the course of two or three days he took the mortgage to New-Brunswick, for the purpose of showing it to the clerk as a description of the property on which he wished to get a certificate that it was unincumbered. Previous to taking it to New-Brunswick he did not show it to any one.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>When he took the mortgage to New-Brunswick he left the bond in the trunk. He gave the mortgage to Mr. Booraem, the clerk, in New-Brunswick. He gave no instructions to have it recorded. He was never authorized or directed by his father'to have it recorded. He does not know why the clerk recorded it. When he\" saw the clerk, the next day, he asked him for the certificate and mortgage; the clerk gave him the certificate, and said he had left the mortgage in his offi\u00e9e to be recorded; which he said was probably done. He told the clerk he was very sorry he had had it recorded,\" as he, the witness, did not intend to have had it done.' The clerk said ho supposed witness wanted it recorded, and therefore he had it done. This conversation' took place in the street, in New-Brunswick, near Stelle\u2019s hotel. He took the certificate homo, and thinks he sent it to the president of the bank, through Mr. Arnold ; but is not certain of it. After this conversation with the clerk, he did not inform his' father what had been done; not immediately; he informed him \u25a0 of it in the course of three or four weeks.- His father found the mortgage was gone, and made inquiry about it, and witness-informed him. His father disapproved of the mortgage being-recorded. He never got the mortgage from the clerk. His father told him he had better try and get the mortgage. After the bond was signed witness never took it out of bis father\u2019s house. At that time he knew it was not necessary to have a bond recorded. Previous to the signing of'the bond and mortgage, witness had a conversation with some of the officers of the bank, in reference to having a bond and mortgage executed.\" These officers were the cashier, and Mr. Bruen, one of the directors. Witness had made arrangements with them to give the bank a bond and mortgage and fake up certain notes which the bank held against his father. The amount of the notes corresponded with the amount of the mortgage. The notes were to he given up when the bond and mortgage were delivered to the bank. There was no agreement as to the bond and mortgage being left there as collateral security. Witness never delivered the bond to the bank or any of its officers. His father never authorized hinnso-to do unless the bank would give up the notes at the time it was delivered. The bond and' mortgage are in witness\u2019s hand-writing. Witness here desires \u2022 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>to correct a previous pari of life deposition ; and now soys the bond and mortgage were signed at or about the time they bear date. His father was sick a great deal about that time: and witness attended to his business generally.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-3\">On cross-examination, he saya, that his father, when he signed the bond and mortgage, was well aware of what he was doing; he knew the contents of them. Witness took the mortgage to the clerk\u2019s office for the. p\u00e1rpese of having a search made, and far that purpose only. Be asked for a certificate that there was do incumbrance on the property described in the mortgage. lie did not speak of it as his father\u2019s or mother\u2019s. \u2019I\u2019he search was. not made at Ids father\u2019s request, but at the request of the president of the bank. The president requested \"witness to have the search made. Mr. It. JSruen was president. Witness said nothing to his father about having the search made. Ho doss not think he told his father he had had a search made, till the conversation took place about the mortgage being recorded. He fe not certain that in the conversation with the clerk, the clerk said the mortgage was probably recorded; he thinks the clerk said so. When lie got the certificate he asked the clerk for the mortgage. The reason why he did not get the mortgage was because'it-was at the clerk\u2019s office, and be supposed that when lie went home the arrangement with the bank might be carried out. The arrangement between his father and the bank, of which he speaks, was completed when he left the mortgage in the clerk\u2019s office. His objection to having the mortgage recorded was, lie did not think it was his business to have it done, fie intended to give it to the bank and get the notes, and let the bank have it recorded. After the mortgage was recorded it, belonged to the bank; and he supposed they would give him the notos, as the mortgage was then in the cleik\u2019s office. Me does not know how long the mortgage was in the clerk\u2019s office, tie never sent or went for it. lie does not know who got, it from the office. He delivered the search, through Mr. Arnold, to the bank, because he wished the president of the bank to see it. Be thinks neither the president nor any of the officers of the bank ever told Sum they were satisfied. The search was procured for the bank. After it was procured, and the mortgage loft at the rierk\u2019G office, he had n con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>versation -with the cashier relative to the matter. 'He told the cashier the mortgage was-recorded in the clerk\u2019s-office, and that he would like to give the bond \u25a0 to- the bank and take up the notes. The cashier said he would talk with the president about it. It was-some days before witness-got an answer from the president, whether he would give up the notes or not. The cashier-said the president was unwilling to give up the notes, as the mortgage was. intended only as collateral security. Witness told him that was not the understanding on his part; he thought the bank intended-to give up the notes; he did not think it was right. Witness did not ask-the cashier for the mortgage at the time; he does not recollect asking any officer of-the bank, at that or any other time, for the mortgage. He did not tell Mr. Nichols, or any other officer of \u2019the bank, at \u2022 that or any other time,, that he would get the mortgage from the office. He does not know why-..he did not-at that time ask for the mortgage. He considered it at that time as belonging-to the-bank. Before the bond and mortgage were signed, he took, either them, or the ones from which they were copied, to the bank, for inspection ; he thinks they .were left in possession of the bank two or three days. He took a policy of insurance also to the bank, either .at. that or some other time. He afterwards called for these papers, and the cashier, Mr. Nichols, gave them-to him. He took them home to his father\u2019s house. A part of the arrangement between his father and-the bank, was, that a policy of insurance should be given on the mortgaged premises. Such a policy was made out by the North River Xnsuranc\u00e9 Company of New-York, for the amount mentioned in -the mortgage. It was shown to the bank and taken from them again. He does not,think it was ever given to the bank to keep. He thinks, but is not certain, that it was shown to the bank about the time .when the bond and mortgage were- made. At .the time the mortgage was given, .the bank was talking about commencing suits against his father. .He does not know that-they had given his father notice of it. He does not recollect that, he was ever \u25a0present at any conversation between his father and Mr. John Arnold in reference to the notes. When he left the mortgage with the clerk he did not notify him not to deliver it to any ..other person. When he met the clerk in the street and asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>him about the certificate and mortgage, the clerk had the certificate with him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-3\">On re-examination on the part of the defendants, he says, that when he stated, in his cross-examination, that the arrangement was completed - between his father and the bank, he meant nothing more than that the terms of the agreement were completed. When he says he considered that the mortgage belonged to the bank, he does mean to say he thinks the bank ought to have it, - but only that it legally belonged to the bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-4\">On further cross-examination he says, that after he was told by the cashier that the bank would not give up the notes, he did not say to the cashier that lie considered the transaction at an end.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-5\">James A. Nichols, the cashier of the bank, sworn on the part of the complainants, says, that the notes in question were discounted at the bank, for the accommodation of Reckless; they had been running for a considerable time. The notes described in the bill are renewals of former notes. He says that the mortgage was given as collateral security for the payment of the notes. That Mrs. Reckless called on witness, and wished to know if the bank would not take a mortgage for $3600, to secure the amount due on the notes, and until Mr. Reckless should be able to raise the money to take up the notes. Witness directed her to Mr. M. Bruon, that ho might lay the proposal before the board of directors. Mrs. Reckless met Mr. Bruen just below the banking house; and subsequently the board decided to take the mortgage. At this time, the proposal was that the mortgage should bo given on the homestead, in Am-boy. -Afterwards she proposed to give it on the property described in the mortgage. Witness knows that a bond was executed by J. W. Reckless to the complainants; he has seen it; had it in his possession as cashier of said bank. It was given to witness as such, by A. Reckless, son of J. W. Reckless. Witness has not the bond now in his possession; nor has the bank. The bond and mortgage and a policy of insurance on the pro - perty, were given together to witness, by said A. Reckless, at the bank, and as cashier of the same. The papers above mentioned were all executed at. the time of said delivery. Witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>thinks he saw the.mortgage before execution; thinks the mortgage, or a rough .draft of it, was presented-to the bank before execution, to see whether it was correct, and the bank were satisfied with them. After this they-were returned to A. Reckless by witness, for the purpose of having them recorded and that the policy of insurance might be transferred to the bank. ' The bond was handed over at the same time, witness being under the impression that it was necessary torecord the bond as well as the mortgage. The president directed that Mr. Reck.less should he at the trouble and expense of recording the papers as well as preparing them. Neither the witness nor the hank have ever had possession of the bond or policy since. The bank obtained possession of the mortgage from the.clerk\u2019s \u2022office. J. W. Reckless, -at the time of the preparation and delivery of said .papers, was confined to his house by sickness, during which A. Reckless acted-for him -in this matter. Witness does not'know that Mr. Reckless ever absolutely refused to return the bond. Witness sent to&gt; the clerk\u2019s office for the mortgage; thinks the'bank was about foreclosing at that time. It -was a-long while before it was sent for. The bank did not pay \u25a0the fees for recording,. to the \u2022 knowledge of witness. Witness, during the time-the mortgage-lay at the-clerk\u2019s office, supposed \u25a0the bond was there with it; not during.'the whole time, howev,\u00abr, because he was informed it was not; was so informed by A. ..Reckless; up to which time he supposed it to be with the mort-gage at the clerk\u2019s office. The permission of the insurance .company to transfer the policy.to the bank was obtained by Mr. Reckless, or some one for him. The policy, at the time \u2022witness had it, had a \"blank assignment on it not filled up; it being .necessary to obtain the permission of the company for this purpose. The date of the said permission was March 15th, 1841; that of the policy being March 8th, 1841. Witness obtained his knowledge of the -fact of permission being granted and the date thereof, from inspecting the books of the company in New-York. Witness did not see the policy in New-York. It was a part of the understanding, and a condition on which the mortgage was taken by the bank, that the property should be insured, and the policy assigned to the bank. The bank never paid any premium for insuring the property. Joseph W. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Reckless and his wife, in February, 1841, gave another mortgage on the property then belonging to Mrs. R.; gave it to witness ; a bond was given at the same time; both arc now in witness\u2019s possession. Witness had a conversation with Mr. Satterth waite in regard to the mortgage mentioned in the bill. Mr. Salterlhwaite, as trustee for Mr. Reckless and his wife, asked witness if the bank would wait and let the mortgage lie, provided he would pay up the back interest and pay the future interest as it became due. Witness stated to him that there were other amounts due the bank from Mr. Reckless, and that, witness thought, it would be necessary to make some arrangement about that before the bank would consent to wait. Mr. Sattorthwaito replied that he had nothing to do with any other debts; that he had only to treat about this mortgage. The conversation was in the street; it was commenced by Mr. Satlerlhwaite. He was then attending to some repairs about the property described in the mortgage. Witness thinks it was in the summer before last, (1842.) This conversation was objected to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-5\">On cross-examination he says, he got Ids mortgage recorded, lie does not, recollect whether he took it to the clerk\u2019s office himself or sent it; rather thinks he sent it, a few days after if was delivered to him, and before the papers for the bank were left with him. Witness believes he sent both bond and mortgage to be recorded. Thinks he got them from the office by sending an order for them. He never had taken a bond and mortgage from any person before that, either for himself or for the bank. He mentioned to the president of the bank that he' had delivered the papers to A. Reckless. Thinks the president told him to deliver the papers to A. Reckless for record ; is satis-* lied lie told the president he had delivered the papers to A. Reckless to be recorded, and the policy to be assigned. The president expressed no surprize that witness had delivered the bond. Witness required no receipt from A. Reckless. He expected the policy to be returned as soon as it should be assigned. He made inquiry after the papers about three mouths after-wards, it might have been; made the first inquiry of A. Reckless. Thinks the question was asked by some one of the directors whether witness had re-obtaiued the papers. Witness remained perfectly easy during these three months, in relation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>t'o the papers, because he presumed that the bond and mortgage were at the clerk\u2019s office, and the policjr at the office' in New-York. A. Reckless w\u00e1s to return the policy to witness. When A. Reckless took the bond with the mortgage for record, he did not say he wanted the bond for record; but witness thought it was necessary. A search was made previous- to executing the mortgage. He thinks he informed the complainants\u2019 solicitor as to the means by which A. Reckless obtained the bond, in order to enable him to draw the bill. A.- Reckless, at the time of the negotiation, lived with his father, in- Amboy. He left soon after, for Monmouth. The first time he saw him after his return from Monmouth, witness conversed with him respect1 ing the papers. Witness introduced the subject. He thinks the complainants\u2019 solicitor read the bill of complaint to him, the witness. As witness recollected them at that time, the facts stated therein were correct. Mr. Reckless, during this transaction, was in embarrassed circumstances. The directors felt uneasy respecting some of these debts; they were desirous to secure them. He has understood that the property embraced in the mortgage formerly belonged to John Patrick, the first husband of Mrs. Reckless. He first discovered it was unnecessary to record a bond in New-Jersey from Mr. Paterson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-3\">Being re-examined in chief, he says, time was given to Mr. Reckless, and the mortgage in question taken, in order that Mr. Reckless might be enabled' to raise the money; Mrs. R. then stating that to sell the property at-that time would be a great sacrifice. The property of Mr.' Reckless was considered by the officers of the bank, at the time of executing this bond and1-mortgage, sufficient to pay all his debts. The understanding- of the bank and Mr. Reckless was, that the bank- should retain the notes- also, and that the bond and mortgage were taken as collateral security. Thinks the bank would not have consented to take the bond and mortgage in lieu of the notes. He never would have re-delivered the papers to A. -Reckless unless under the supposition that they- would be returned in good faith. He had at that time every disposition to believe that the agreement would be carried out and the papers returned in good faith. On satisfaction of this mortgage, witness, as cashier, would have delivered up the notes to Mr. Reckless.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Being again cross-examined, he says, that when he says' that the property of Mr. Reckless was considered, at the time of executing this bond and mortgage, sufficient to pay ail J. W. Reckless\u2019s debts, he means all his property, as well derived from his wife as otherwise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-3\">Matthias Bruen, sworn for complainants, says, that while walking in the street, at Amboy, about the time of the giving the bond and mortgage in question, he was met by Mrs. Reckless, who said she had just been conversing with Mr. Nichols, who had referred her to witness. He asked her what her object was. She replied that they had bad.notice that the notes held ' by the bank against Mr. Reckless were to be put it enit. Witness said it was so: that they had been running a long time, and that the directors had resolved to bring the business to a close. She appeared to be in great trouble, and said she hoped witness would not press the thing. He answered that the board had no desire to do any thing unreasonable; to which she said she would secure the claim of the bank. Witness asked her in what way. She answered, by giving a mortgage on her own-property, or property that once was hers. Witness sakl he understood the property then belonged to her husband; that she had made it over to John Reckless, and he to his father, of same date. Witness then said he would lay the case before the board ; that he was but one of the board ; and they would determine what to do. He did lay the circumstances before the board, at their next meeting, and they agreed to take a bond- and mortgage as collateral security for the notes due, and to suspend prosecution on the notes. He had a conversation with A. Reckless. He told witness he would have all the papers executed, and would leave them with the cashier. At the time of this conversation, Mrs. Reckless proposed to give a mortgage on the homestead, which the bank preferred ; but Mrs. Reckless afterwards asked the bank to take the mortgage on the premises described in the mortgage. The bank at first did noS think favorably of the proposal to take any mortgage; thinking the notes had been too long running; and witness himself was opposed to it; but Mrs. Reckless appealed to his feelings and wept, and he convented and so did the bank, to accomodate her <em>and </em>not blj&amp;piiE\u00edk \u00cdJ. i?M3 \u00bftifia lififik fi.fifififiU <em>ID </em>Afi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>proposal, it was understood expressly that the notes were to be retained by the bank; and the bond'and mortgage were.as additional security. \u25a0 Such was the understanding, not only of Mr. Reckless and wife, but also of some of the endorsers on the notes. The bond and mortgage would not have' been accepted if the condition-had been that the notes were to be given up.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-5\">On cross-examination, he- says, he is not a stockholder in the bank; that he parted with his stock on the- Wednesday or Thursday before the day of his examination.

Being shown the mortgage, he says the indorsement of registry on it is in his hand-writing. He does not recollect who left the mortgage with him ; but, from the indorsement on itr he knows it came into the office on the 24th March, 1841.- He supposes it was brought to the office for record, or he should not have recorded it. He does not remember that it was brought to the office by A. Reckless; cannot say who brought it. He has no recollection that A. Reckless ever asked him for a certificate of incumbrances on the property mentioned in the mortgage, or any other property of J. W. Reckless. It is not usual for him to carry in his pocket- certificates of search that he has made. Unless requested otherwise, he leaves them in the office to be called for. He does not remember how long the mortgage remained in the office after it was recorded; nor does he know how it was taken out. He is under the impression-that he sent the mortgage to the cashier of the Commercial bank, at his request expressed in a letter-; yet he may be mistaken, as the cashier had a mortgage of his own in the office about the same time, given to-him by the same parties who executed the mortgage\u2019 to the bank. ' He does not know who paid for recording the mortgage to the bank. He should not have recorded the mortgage unless he had understood, at the time it was left in the office, that, it was to be recorded. He does not remember; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>that he was ever notified not to deliver the mortgage to the bank., If be had received such a notice, he should not have delivered it without an investigation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-5\">A certificate of the secretary of the North River Insurance Compaq, that on the 15th March, 1841, consent was given by that company for the assignment of <em>the </em>policy to the Commercial Bank, was admitted in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-6\">It was also agreed by and between the solicitors that certain judgments obtained by the complainants against i.

W. Reckless, or some person for him and in his name and by his authority, under the plea or pretence of procuring <em>the </em>assignment to the complainants of a policy of insurance on the premises and the assent of the insurance company to that assignment, procured the bond and mortgage from the complainants, with the full understanding and belief of the complainants that they were to be returned to the complainants when the object for which they were taken, was accomplished ; that the mortgage was returned \u2019to the complainants, but that J. W. Reckless at all times thereafter refused to deliver up the bond to the complainanio.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">From this statement we should conclude that the matter of insurance, and of the assignment of the policy to the complainants, wore no part of the arrangement contemplated by the parties; that the bond and mortgage had bees delivered.to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>\u00a1and received by the complainants absolutely and finally; that :the transaction as contemplated was completed ; and that J. W. Reckless, or some person for him,'by a pretence, cheated the \u2022bank out of the possession of the bond and mortgage, and afterwards returned the mortgage to the bank, but refused to deliver up the bond to them. The cashier of the bank, sworn as a witness for the complainants, says that the complainants\u2019 solicitor read the bill of complaint to him, and that, as he recollected them at that time, the facts therein stated were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-3\">The testimony of the cashier is the only evidence produced in support of the allegation in the bill of the delivery of the bond and mortgage; and if it stood uncontradicted it would be very meagre evidence of a delivery of the papers, in the legal .sense of the word, and in the sense in which the word is used in the bill, even by the son, and much more insufficient evidence of such a delivery by the authority of the grantors. The \u00a1statement, made by the cashier in his testimony is essentially variant from the case uiade by the bill; and the effect of this vaiiance is not avoided by his saying, in his testimony, that the facts stated in the bill were correct as he recollected them .at the time the complainants\u2019 solicitor read the bill, to him. Instead of an absolute delivery of the bond and mortgage, and the subsequent obtaining of the possession of them by the mortgagor or his son on a pretence, and the return of the mortgage to the complainants, which is the case made by the bill,, the cashier, when sworn in the cause, shows that it was a part of the understanding, and a condition on which the mortgage was to be taken by the bank, that the property should be insured and the policy assigned to the bank; that the papers were returned by him, the cashier, to Anthony Reckless, for the purpose of having them recorded and that the policy of insurance might be transferred to the bank; that the president of the bank directed that J. W. Reckless should be at the trouble and expense of recording the papers as well as preparing them ; and that the hank, afterwards, obtained possession of the mortgage \u25a0from the clerk\u2019s office, .without asking the consent of the mortgagors, or either of them, or any person acting for them, J. W. Reckless having possession of the bond, and he, or his son acting for .him, having long before refused to deliver the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>This is-a.remarkable failure of testimony to support the case .made by the bill. Aud if we could give to this testimony all the weight it would be entitled to if the hill (prepared on advisement with this witness as to the facts, as he himself states,) had stated the facts as they are stated by the cashier in his testimony, the testimony is insufficient to show a completion of the arrangement and a delivery of the papers thereupon. If the .papers were ever in the- cashier\u2019s hands after they were -executed, they were in com p\u00edete, according to t.bc cashier\u2019s own .account of what the arrangement was; the policy had not been transferred ; and all the papers were handed back to A. Reckless for the purpose of having them completed, by the procure.ment by the mortgagor of a transfer to the bank of the policy of insurance, and, the cashier says, to he recorded ; the president having directed that J. W. Reckless should be at the trouble and expense of recording the papers.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">It \u00a1=eems to me it would be to indulge in great latitude in aid of the bank, the complainants in the cause, and who are therefore to make out their case affirmatively, to say that, notwithstanding the papers were so handed back to A. Reckless for such purpose, and with such directions, the previous possession of the papers by the cashier is now to be considered as a pos-session on an absolute and final delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Again, whether the arrangement was that the bond and mortgage were to be substituted for the notes, or were to be merely collateral security, it was an arrangement which J. W. Reckless might make or decline to make, at his pleasure, and on such terms as he pleased. And if the papers were handed back to him, with a requirement that he should have them, or the mortgage, recorded at his own .expense, he was at perfect liberty to decline doing so, and to refuse to deliver the papers. Nay, if he had afterwards sent the mortgage to the clerk\u2019s office to be recorded, yet unless he left it with the clerk with such directions as would amount to a delivery to the bank, he could at any time take back the mortgage from the clerk and refuse .to deliver the papers, either with or without reason. The arrangement contemplated was purely voluntary on his part.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The case made by the bill is not sustained. And the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>stated by the cashier in his testimony, are not sufficient, in my judgment, to show a delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">But if a delivery could be affirmed by the court on the testimony of the cashier- uncontradicted, it is but the testimony of a single witness, in opposition, to the positive denial of the answer. And so far from finding-circumstances equivalent to another witness, in corroboration of the allegation of delivery, the circumstances, and the general features and outline of the case, are strongly in corroboration of the answer. And, beyond this, -the testimony of the cashier, if he means to say there was a delivery, in the legal sense of that word in this respect, is contradicted by the very person who, the cashier says, gave the papers to him, and to whom he returned them.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">It was -said on the argument on the-part of the complainants, that there were discrepancies between the answer of the defendant and the testimony of A. Reckless; and the court was asked, for that reason, to disregard the answer altogether, and-to give no weight to its denial of -delivery. I see no greater discrepancies between the answer and the testimony of A. Reckless than there are between the bill and the testimony of the cashier. Besides, discrepancies in.incidental-matters between the answer and a witness called to support it, cannot overcome the denial of the answer of the material allegation of the bill. And in this case, the material allegation of the bill denied by the answer, that is- to say, the delivery, is contradicted by the witness called in support of the answer, \u25a0 the person who is alleged to have made the delivery, and thus the denial of the delivery made in the answer is supported. The zeal of counsel might prompt the idea that both the answer and the witness in support of it should be disregarded in this case;.but the court cannot see any thing in the case to call for such a sacrifice; much less to make such a sacrifice on the testimony of a single witness for the complainants,-giving, in his testimony, an essentially different version of the case from that given in the bill drawn under his advisement-as to the facts. I know of no reason for giving to the testimony of a witness standing in the position of this witness, any more potency than is allowed to the testimony of any other single witness in opposition to an answer. But in this case the court is asked to break down, not only the answer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>but the testimony of a witness in full support of it, on the single testimony of the cashier of the bank. I do not see that the complainants can reasonably expect this.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\">Next, the bank allege, in their bill, that the bond and mortgage were to be given as collateral security for the notes. And, as the case stands, it would be necessary for the bank to sustain this position affirmatively if they could have prevailed on the other point.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Now, the recital of the mortgage is as follows: !\u00a3 Whereas Joseph W. Reckless, of the first part, is justly indebted&gt;to the said party of the second part in the sum of three thousand six hundred dollars, secured to be pair! by a certain bond or obligation bearing even date with these presents, in the penal sum &amp;c., conditioned for the payment of the said first mentioned sum of three thousand six hundred dollars, on or before the 5th day of March which will be in the year of our Lord 1842, with lawful interest from the date thereof, to be paid half-yearly, &amp;c.\u201d The bond and mortgage were dated March 5th, 1841. Ail absolute bond, then, was drawn for three thousand six hundred dollars, and a mortgage to secure the bond. Nothing was said about the notes, or that the bond and mortgage were merely additional security, cither-in the bond or in the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">There was no obligation resting on Reckless to give a bond and mortgage at all. The bank had the notes and indorsements on which they loaned their money. And no object or motive can be perceived to induce .Reckless to give a bond and mortgage for the amount due on the notes, except that of relieving his indorsers, by taking up the notes. It is hardly conceivable that Reckless would be willing to give an absolute bond and mortgage for three thousand six hundred dollars, full and complete evidence of indebtedness to that amount, beyond the amount of the notes, and leave the notes with the bank, and subject himself to the hazard of proving or failing to prove that they wore for the same debt. No prudent man would do so in a transaction with an individual: and we are not to presume that Reckless, or any other person, would have more confidence in a corporation than in an individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">'Witli these remarks in view, we shall not be surprised to find that the effort on the part of the bank to sustain the position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>they take oh this part of the case is weak, and the testimony\" on which they rely entirely unsatisfacloiy.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\">The bill, after stating the notes, says, that, for the better\" securing the same, and as collateral security therefor, J. W.Reckless executed his bond for three thousand six hundred dollars, the amount of said notes, \u00bf-nffi the mortgage in question,to secure the\" bond and the bill says, the,complainants insist that <em>\u201c </em>as the mortgage was given as security for the payment of the notes, their right in such security is good and perfect independently of the bond, which was not- the evidence of the debt, but merely designated the amount for which security was\u2019 given.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">The testimony on'the part of-the complainants may be sufficient to show that the bank intended to get the bond and mortgage and retain the notes too; but it is insufficient to show that Mrs. Reckless consented to such an arrangement, and stili more' insufficient to show that J. W.-Reckless consented to it. The two portions-of the testimony relied on by the complainants to show that Mrs. Reckless consented to such an arrangement are as follows. \u2022 The cashier says, that Mrs. Reckless called on him, and wished to know if the bank would\" not take a mortgage to secure the amount due-on the notes, and until Mr. Reckless should be able to raise the money to take up the notes.Does the cashier mean to say that the last clause, \u201c to take up the notes,\u201d was the language of Mrs. Reckless? And if it was, and the\" whole sentence together is to be taken, from the language of a woman in distress, to mean that a bond and mortgage were to be given as collateral security for the notes, yet the bond and mortgage were not so drawn ; and there is nothing to show that she consented to the delivery of an absolute bond and mortgage, making no reference to the notes. Matthias Bruen, in his testimony, says, that Mrs. Reckless, in her conversation with him, appeared to be in great distress, and said that she would secure the <em>claim </em>of the bank. These are the only two clauses in the testimony on which the allegation of the complainants, that the bank were to have this absolute bond and mortgage, and retain the notes too, and that Mrs. Reckless consented to it, rests. Their insufficiency for such a purpose is, if eoesas fo me, apparent</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>But what is the testimony relied on to show that J. W. Reckless ever consented to such an arrangement ? It is as follows. The cashier says, the understanding of the \u2019bank and Mr. Reckless was, that the bank should retain the notes also; and <em>that </em>the bond and' mortgage were taken as collateral security. Where did the cashier get his authority for saying that it was the understanding of Mr. Reckless that the bank should retain the notes <em>1 </em>Mr. Reckless was confined to iris house by sickness during the whole period of the negotiation, and until it was broken off; and it is not pretended that the cashier saw him wiriiin that period. Matthias Brucn, in his testimony, says, that at the time the bank acceded to the proposal, it was understood expressly that the notes were to be retained by the bank, and tlie bond and mortgage were as additional secHiity. By whom was it so understood ? This witness has before said tb^fcMrs. Reckless proposed to him that she would secure the claim-of the bank; that lie told her ho would lay the case before the board ; that he did bo, at their next moating, and they agreed to take a bond and mortgage as collateral security for the notes. It is apparent that, thus far, the witness says nothing more than that when Mrs. Brio proposal to <em>secure ihe claim </em>of the bank was laid before the board, <em>ihe board </em>agreed to fake a bond and mortgage as collateral security for the notes. There was nothing in the nature or language of Mrs. R,!s proposal to bind her, even if she had been a. single woman, by the agreement of the directors among themselves, to take a bond and mortgage as collateral. That was not the proposal of Mrs. Reckless. The witness then proceeds with this general remark: \u201c Such was the understanding, not only of Mr. Reckless and wile, but also of some of the indorsers on the notes.\u00ae Now, considering the confinement of Mr. Reckless by sickness, and that it does not appear that this witness ever spoke with Mr. Reckless on the subject, it is aching too much to ask the court to decree on such testimony, (it relating, too, to a time <em>prior </em>to the drawing of the mortgage,) that Reckless consented is deliver, and did deliver, an absolute bond and mortgage,, making no reference to the notes, and consented also to leave the notem and the indorsements thereon- with the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">But again, if such could have beers the original understand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>ing of J. -W. -Reckless, before the papers were drawn, yet he . was under no obligation to carry out such an arrangement. . It will -not be contended that a bill would be sustainable to compel the performance' of such an agreement; and the mortgage, when afterwards drawn, being drawn simply to secure a bond, mentioned therein, J. W. Reckless not only had the right to say, but a regard for his own interest required him to-say, that the bond and mortgage, as drawn, should not be delivered unless the notes were given up. - And J. W. Reckless being sick, and his son attending to his business for him, it was the duty of the son to refuse to deliver the said- bond and mortgage unless the notes were given up; and he swears he did so refuse,- and I can see no reason for doubting it; It was his duty to refuse unless otherwise directed by his father, and of this there is no proof. And yet, in a case in which the complainants must have been well aware that a delivery of the papers could not have been compelled by the court, the court is asked to decree, on the evidence in this cause, that the papers were actually delivered ; and that the mortgage, taken by the complainants from the clerk\u2019s office, long after the refusal of the son, acting for his father, to deliver the bond, (the bond, the principal instrument, being still in the possession of J. W. Reckless,) shall be decreed to be a valid security independent of the bond. I venture to say that no such decree was ever before asked on such testimony as is presented tou the- court in this case. _ .</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\">It-seems there were other debts due from J. W. Reckless to-the bank, besides the amount secured by these notes with indorsers- This may account for the desire of the bank to get the bond-and mortgage in the shape in which they were, and retain the notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">It Was said in the argument, that the possession of the mortgage was presumptive evidence of its delivery. -Whether the possession of a mortgage given to secure a bond, the bond remaining in the possession of the obligor, and he refusing to deliver it, would be any evidence of the delivery of the mortgage, is a question which it is not necessary to consider in this case. The possession of a deed by the grantee named therein, and the possession of a bond and mortgage by the obligee and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>mortgagee, would be <em>prima facie </em>evidence of due delivery. But I am unable to perceive that the possession of a mortgage obtained from the clerk\u2019s office, without the consent of the mortgagor, and after he had refused tQ deliver the bond to secure which the mortgage was drawn, has any potency whatever, or is entitled to any consideration'as evidence of a due delivery of the mortgage. The rule, that possession is presumptive evidence of delivery, has no application to such a state of things.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">If it be asked why J. W. Reckless left the mortgage so long at the clerk\u2019s office, the answer is plain. He had possession of the bond, the principal instrument; and had, as the bill states, and as A. Reckless, who attended to this business for J. W. Reckless, testifies, refused to deliver it. Could it be imagined that, under such circumstances, the bank, or their cashier, would send to the clerk\u2019s office and get the mortgage. But 1 think it may be asked, with much more significancy, why the bank pursued the -coarse they did. After the refusal to deliver the bond, a long time, the cashier says in one place, three months ire says in another place, elapsed before he sent to the clerk\u2019s office for the mortgage. The bank, certainly, could not have expected that possession of the mortgage so obtained, after the refusal to deliver the bond, would be sufficient evidence of the delivery of the mortgage. And that they did not so expect, the bill itself shows.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The bill says nothing of their getting the mortgage from the clerk\u2019s office; but says the mortgage was returned to the complainants ; and the bill is framed entirely on the'charge that both bond and mortgage had once been delivered, absolutely, and that they were afterwards obtained from the bank on a pretence, and that Reckless afterwards refused to deliver up the bond. It has been before shown that the case made by the bill is not sustained. And the bank themselves seem to have had little confidence in the ground which, at a very late period, they assumed in the bill. They prosecuted the notes, obtained judgment, and caused execution to be issued and to 'be levied \u2022on these very premises. It was said in argument, on the part of the defendants, and not denied, that it happened that another execution, issued on a judgment obtained by another creditor of J. W. Reckless, was recorded an hour or so before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>.execution in favor of the bank. The cause was argued for the .defendants by counsel in behalf of a judgment creditor other than the bank, which shows that his execution was ahead of \u25a0that of the bank. It was not till after this state of things oc.curred that the bank filed their bill in this cause. It seems to me that the course pursued by the bank betrays an evident want of confidence in the idea that there had been a delivery .of the bond and mortgage, or that their obtaining the mortgage from the clerk\u2019s office would help their case. And this want of confidence is apparent in the bill, and in the testimony of the cashier and Mr. Bruen.</p>\n<p id=\"AKT\">The fact that the mortgage was recorded cannot, under the .circumstances of this case, aid the complainants. To consti.tute a delivery, even of a deed, a single instrument having no .connection with any .other, the grantor must part, not only with the possession, but with the control of the deed, and de.prive himself of the .right to .recall it: <em>Dev. Eq. </em>14; <em>C. W. Dud. Eq. </em>14.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">If a deed be left by the grantor for .registry, the mere registration is not equivalent to a delivery. To make the leaving a deed, by a grantor, .with the clerk for registry, a good delivery to the grantee, it must be left by the grantor, or by his autho.rity, for the grantee: <em>Rice's Eq. </em>244.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">If, then, the mortgage was left with the clerk, by <em>J. </em>W. Reckless or by his authority, for the express purpose of bein'g recorded, which is denied both by -the answer and by the testimony of A., Reckless, who handed the mortgage to the clerk, \u2022yet there is no evidence that the grantor left it, or authorized it to be left with the .clerk for the grantees, and that the grantor intended to part with the control of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Delivery is essential to a <em>deed; </em>and as the mortgage was taken from the clerk\u2019s office by. the bank, or by the cashier for them, it is for the complainants to prove that it was left with the clerk in such manner and with such directions from the grantor as to amount to a delivery to them, or for their benefit, and authorize them to take it from the clerk: 5 <em>Masons C. C. R. </em>60. There is no such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">It will not be claimed that J. W. Reckless could not have taken the mortgage from the clerk\u2019s office. Were any such .di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>rections given to the clerk, when the mortgage was left with him, as would authorize him\u2019to refuse to\u2019return it to the person who gave it to him, or to J. W. Reckless? Certainly not. And the bond, to secure which the mortgage was drawn, was, when the mortgage was handed to the clerk, in the possession of J. W. Reckless or of his agent, and delivery of the bond was afterwards refused, and refused before the bank sent to the clerk\u2019s office for the mortgage. And in a case like this the bank could acquire no right whatever to or in the bond and mortgage until an absolute and final delivery of them. I. W. Reckless or his wife, might object at the last moment to deliver them, either with or without a reason; and if they ever were willing that the bond and mortgage as drawn, should be delivered and the bank retain the notes, they were at liberty to change their mind at any time before the completion of the arrangement by a final delivery of the papers, .and to refuse to deliver them. There was no consideration binding them, or obligation resting upon them, either to substitute the bond and mortgage for the notes, or to give them as additional security for the notes. It was a matter resting simply in their will, and they could .change that will at the last moment. I do not see that it is possible that the.registry of the mortgage, under such circumstances, can afford the least aid to the complainants.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\">It is not a case of money advanced on securities claimed to have' been delivered. The bank have still the securities on which they lent their money. They sustain no loss by not being able to avail themselves of this bond and mortgage; they simply fail to obtain additional or substituted securities for a loan previously made on securities good, or thought by them to be good, when the loan was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">It is unnecessary for me to make any observations as to the admissibility of the testimony of Mr. M. Bruen; or any animadversions upon it, or on the position in which his cross-examination places him. Taking his testimony as it is, the case, in my judgment, is clearly with the defendants. The bill must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Decree accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
