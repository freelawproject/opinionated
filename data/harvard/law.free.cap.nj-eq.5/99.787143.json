A father had recovered a judgment against one of his sons, and caused an execution to be issued thereon and put into the hands of the sheriff. After the son\u2019s death, the father signed a writing at the foot of the execution, in these words: \u201cI hereby discharge J. W. Caldwell, sheriff &amp;e., from all liability whatever of the above-stated execution, the defendant being dead, and no further proceeding required on the same.\u201d The father afterwards died intestate, and there was a balance of his personal estate, for distribution, of about \u00a1\u00a1&gt;14,000, exclusive of the amount of the said judgment.

At the December Term, 1842, application was made to thaA court to decree and settle the distribution of the surplus. The three grandchildren claimed a full seventh, in right of their deceased father. This was resisted by the surviving children, on the ground that James, the deceased son, had, as they claimed, been advanced by the intestate in his lifetime. A judgment in favor of Michael Allen, against his son James, for $700 debt and $5 costs, was entered in the Common Pleas of Gloucester, on a bond and warrant of attorney, on the 15th of June, 1835. Execution was issued on this judgment, and put into the hands of the sheriff of Gloucester, in the lifetime of James. After the death of James, Michael Allen signed a writing at the foot of the execution, in these words: \u201c 1 hereby discharge J. W. Caldwell, sheriff, &amp;c., from all liability whatever of the above-stated execution, the defendant being dead, and no further proceeding required on the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-6\">Certain notes given by James to his father, of dates prior to the bond and warrant, and against which the statute of limitation had run, were exhibited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-7\">The Orphans\u2019 Court, after hearing testimony, decreed that distribution of the said surplus be made in equal seventh parts; one-seventh to each of the six surviving children, and the remaining seventh to be divided equally among the children of the deceased son James.

Ch. </em>506; 2 P. <em>W. </em>560.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b105-10\">The Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"ABn_\">No money or other property was ad-</p>\n<p id=\"AdJ\">vanced by the father to James, as an advancement, in form. Whatever he let James have, he took his note or obligation for; he put it in the shape of a debt from James to him. The testimony on the part of the surviving children, even if all admissible, is of entirely too indefinite a character to establish an advancement, it was not claimed, I think, at the bar, that proof of mere parol declarations of a father, that he had fully advanced a child, would be sufficient. See <em>Toller </em>397; 1 <em>Atk. </em>407.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">The counsel for the appellants rely, first, on the notes given by James to his father. A note given by a son to the father is not, of itselfj evidence of an advancement by the father. It is evidence of indebtedness by the son. The amount of the note may be recovered back from the son, either by the father, in his lifetime, or by his personal representatives, after bis decease; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>but no part of an advancement can be recovered back. The very object of the father in taking the note should be presumed to be, to avoid the inequality which would result, if his personal estate at his death should be insufficient to give to each of his other children an equal sum. It is not a <em>gift; </em>the father does not divest himself of the property. This is not opposed to the case of <em>Wanmaker </em>v. <em>Van Buskirk, </em>in <em>Saxton </em>688. The opinion of the Chancellor in that case, that the amount of the bond was an advancement, was founded on the peculiar circumstances of the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">It was contended that the notes exhibited in this case should be considered as advancements, because they are outlawed. If nothing appeared but the fact that these notes were found among the papers of the intestate after his death, and that they were all outlawed, and could not therefore be made available as debts, it might be a serious inquiry what would be the proper presumption; whether the presumption of payment, arising from lapse of time, or the presumption that the father omitted to collect them, or have them renewed, on the ground that he was willing the son should retain the amount as an advancement. But, in my view, it is not necessary to discuss that question in this ease. Under the admissions and acts of the intestate, .it would certainly be unsafe to declare that the whole amount of these notes should be considered either advancement or debt. It appears that, shortly before James went to the South, he assigned notes to his father, in part payment of what he owed him. He also gave a bond to his father for $700, and a warrant of attorney for the confession of a judgment thereon ; and judgment was entered thereon accordingly. There is no evidence that the bond was given on a new or separate advance of money. The transaction has the appearance of a settlement between them of the amount due from James, and the confession of a judgment for the amount. I am unwilling to consider the notes as evidence, either of advancement to Jam\u00e9s, or of debt due from him to the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">There can be no doubt that James, in his lifetime, and his estate, after his death, was indebted to his father, the intestate, in the amount of the judgment. If this debt had been released by the father to James, in his lifetime, it might, perhaps, be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>considered an advancement. <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>Wetherell, </em>2 <em>Sim. and Stu. </em>254. But it remained a debt from the estate of James to his father, at the father\u2019s death. The endorsement made by Michael Allen on the execution, discharging the sheriff <em>\u201c </em>from all liability whatever of the execution, the defendant being dead and no further proceedings required on the same,\u201d did not dis \u2022 charge the debt, so as to entitle James\u2019 children to an equal seventh of the surplus, exclusive of the amount of this judgment debt. And this discharge of the sheriff was not an advancement to James, for James was then dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">Eor the purpose of settling the distribution, the amount of this judgment debt should have been added to the said surplus <em>; </em>and should form a part of the distributive share of the three grandchildren, who represent their deceased father, James. The decree of distribution made by the Orphans\u2019 Court, was made without respect to this judgment debt; and the children of James were decreed to be entitled to an equal seventh of the surplus, though that surplus did not include the judgment debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">I think the decree is erroneous. The Orphans\u2019 Court should have added the amount of the judgment, with interest thereon to the death of Michael Allen, to the surplus found by the account of the administrator as <em>stated; </em>and have decreed that one-seventh of the whole sum be paid to each of the surviving children; and that the judgment against James be satisfied, and the residue of the money in the administrator\u2019s hand be paid to the children of James, equally among them. A decree to this effect will be made by this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
