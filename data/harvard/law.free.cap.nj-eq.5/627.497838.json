D. </em>Vroom,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2-\">in pursuance of a rule heretofore taken to show cause &amp;c., now moved that the appeal be dismissed for want of jurisdiction in this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b627-10\">Mr. Yroom referred to tho 9th section of the Old Constitution; and said that it had always been held that no appeal lay to the governor and council from the court of chancery, or from the prerogative court, until- by an act of the legislature an appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>was given from the court of chancery; but that to this day no appeal from the ordinary had ever been brought. He cited 4 <em>Griff. Law Reg. </em>1178, 1179, 1185.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-4\">He adverted to the supplement passed February 24th, 1820, to the \u201c act relative to dower;\u201d the 7th section of which supplement gives an appeal to this court from any sentence or decree of the .surrogate general made under the authority of the said supplement; and insisted that the said 7th section was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-5\">He adverted to article 6th, section 1st, of the New Constitution. The judicial power shall be vested in \u201c a court of errors and appeals in the last resort in all causes as heretofore;\u201d and admitted that this increases the difficulty and importance of the question.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The appeal was dismissed by the whole court, except the president, who, being chancellor and surrogate general, declined voting. See note.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Note. Is there any reason why the legislature cannot give to the ordinary or surrogate general jurisdiction over a new subject matter, and give an ay., peal from his decrees in reference thereto ?</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
