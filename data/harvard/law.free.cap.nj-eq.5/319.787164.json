BENJAMIN GEROE AND WILLIAM I. STAGG.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b321-4\">1. On a sale of land by a fiduciary, he cannot buy, either directly or through another.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b321-5\">2. Proofs on which it was determined that one to whom land was struck off at an executors\u2019 sale bought for the executors.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-6\">The bill states that on the 18th of May, 1843, Daniel Ge-roe died, leaving a large personal and considerable real estate, and leaving a will dated December 15th, 1836, by which, after bequeathing his personal estate, he gave to his wife the house and lots where he then lived, as long as she should remain his widow, and to his son, Benjamin Geroe, the mountain lot in fee ; and the remainder of his real estate to his three children, Peggy, wife of Cor n el i u s W inter; Caty, wife of William I. Stagg, and his son Benjamin, equally, in fee, to be divided or sold as two out of the three could agree; and appointed said Stagg and Benjamin Geroe executors of the will, who proved the will. That in the fall of 1843, the complainant Cornelius Winter, and the defendants, Benjamin Geroe and William I. Stagg, met for the purpose of dividing the real estate, when they, the said defendants, requested the complainant to make a division thereof into three parts, and that the complainant thereupon divided it accordingly, as equally as he could ; but inasmuch as he, the complainant, thought that one of the parts was more valuable than either of the others, he proposed that the person who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>should take that share should pay to each of the others $66.66, to equalize the shares; and that while they were so together, the complainant being desirous of making a division amicably, offered that the other two should each choose a share, and that he would take the remaining one. That Stagg then chose a share, but that Geroe then refused to choose a share and declined making such division; and that since that time, Stagg and Geroe have made no further attempt to divide the lands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-5\">That Stagg and Geroe, as executors and devisees, afterwards advertised the lands for sale at public vendue, on the 18th of January, 1844, at the house of John C. Ackerson, innkeeper in Manchester, Passaic county. That the complainants, Winter and wife, not believing that Stagg and Geroe, after the said proposition made to them by Winter, would sell the property, did not attend the sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-6\">The bill charges that Stagg and Geroe, to deprive the complainants of the property and get the benefit thereof to themselves, did, on the said day, strike off to one J. J. Goetschius, who attended the sale as their agent, a part of the lands, and did, with the wife of said Stagg, execute a deed to Goetschius for four lots, (describing them,) being parts of said real estate; which deed purports to be given by the said Stagg and Geroe, as executors as aforesaid, and Caty, wife of said Stagg, and as devisees under the said will. That the deed is dated January 20th, 1844, and purports to be for the consideration of $1035. That Goetschius, with his wife, did thereupon, on the same day, execute and deliver to the said Benjamin Geroe a deed for the first and third, of the said lots, purporting to be given for the consideration of $600, and a deed to Stagg for the second and fourth of said lots, purporting to be given for the consideration of $465; and that said deeds are both quit-claim deeds, without any covenants. That the said sale was made to Goetschius as the agent of said Stagg and Geroe, and that he conveyed the property to them in pursuance of an agreement made previous to the sale to him. That the sale was made at about half the value of the land; and that the same was so arranged by Stagg and Geroe, for the purpose of getting complainants' right n the property at less than its fair value, and in fraud of the omplainants. That no money was paid by Goetschius but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>that the sale to him, and the price mentioned in the deed to him, were intended to deceive the complainants, and induce them to believe that the sale was <em>bona fide.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-5\">The bill prays that these deeds may be declared to be void, and that Stagg and Geroe may be decreed to convey the property to such persons as the court may direct, or to convey one-third part thereof to the complainants; and that the property may be sold or divided under the order of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-6\">The defendants put in their joint and several answer. The answer, so far as it is necessary to state it, says that one lot was struck off' to Alyea, and three lots to Goetschius. That the bid of Alyea was then and there declared by him to be for the benefit of Goetschius, who then and there signed the conditions of sale and received a deed for the four lots. It denies that the sale was fraudulent and intended to injure Winter and wife, but alleges that it was made in good faith. Denies that the property, so as aforesaid sold to Goetschius, was sold to him as the agent of the defendants, or either of them ; or that Goetschius attended the sale as such agent; and denies that the part bid off by Alyea, and by him transferred to Goetschius, was sold to him or Goetschius as such agent; or that Alyea attended the sale as such agent; and says there was no agreement. express or implied, between Goetschius and Alyea, or either of them, and the defendants, or either of them, or any person on their or either of their behalf, that Goetschius and Alyea, or either of them, should give to the defendants, or either of them, or to any other person, the property by them purchased at the sale, or any part thereof, or that the defendants, or either of them, should take such property from them, Goetschius and Alyea, or either of them. It denies that the said sales and conveyances were made pursuant to any agreement entered into prior to the public sale, and denies t-hat the property was sold at public sale at a very low price, at about half its fair value, though they admit that they considered it cheap at the pric\u00e9s for which it sold.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-7\">The substance, of the testimony is as follows:</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b323-8\">C.

(It was here admitted by the parties that the property bid off by Alyea was conveyed by this witness, Goetschius, to Geroe.) The witness says it seems to strike nim that something was said to him, by Stagg and Geroe, on the day of sale, about their taking the property, but does not remember what was said; does not remember refusing to let <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number><em>them have </em>it; when they came to him, on Saturday, after the sale, at his store, the deed or deeds were already drawn, find were brought there to be executed; they paid him no more money for the property than he gave ; he did not pay anything for the drawing or acknowledging of the deeds; Stagg and Geroe paid or gave him a small compensation for his trouble \u2014two dollars; he thinks he would have gone to the sale if Stagg had not spoken to him about it, but is not positive; he did not ask any compensation, but they gave him two dollars; the deeds were brought to deponent\u2019s store by Stagg and Geroe, to be executed by him ; he does not exactly remember whether the two dollars were given to him or his wife; it was his intention they should go to his wife; <em>it was </em>entirely gratuitous.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b326-5\">David J.

It is within the principle, that on a sale by a fiduciary, he cannot buy either directly or through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>another. The question raised and argued is, whether from the bill, answer and proofs in the cause, it appears that the defendants, Stagg and Geroe, who made the sale, did, through another, buy the property themselves. It is a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">If the answer is to be taken as a full denial, (perhaps the imperfection which is discoverable in it was not intended,) I think it is overcome by the testimony on the part of the complainants and the corroborating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The sale was made on the I8th; on the 20th the deed to Goetschius, and the deeds from him to Stagg and Geroe were made and delivered. They were all prepared by the defendants, and taken to Goetschius\u2019 store to be executed by him. Two dollars were given to Goetschius or his wife for his trouble, and nothing passed between Goetschius and the defendants after the sale, till the deeds were given.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">These are all strong circumstances. The bill is supported by the testimony of Van Wagoner, called for the complainants; and the testimony of Goetschius, though called for the defendants, is clearly and strongly in support of the bill. The credit of Alyea, called for the defendants, is impaired by a discrepancy in his own testimony, and by the testimony of Henry M. Speer, sworn for the complainants, who says that in conversation with Alyea, shortly after the sale, he told Alyea that Myers would give him $150 for his bargain; that Alyea said nothing at that time in answer. That at another time, he asked Alyea if he had bought for himself, and he answered no, he had bought for them ; meaning, as witness understood it, Stagg and Geroe.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">I think this is a case which calls for the judgment of the court in support of a principle which the policy of the law requires should be strongly maintained. It would \"be of dangerous tendency to be lax in the application of this principle. It would encourage cunning and dissimulation, and a resort to unworthy devices to cheat the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">The sale will be declared void.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">Reversed <em>on question not raised before the </em>Chancellor, 1 <em>Hal.
