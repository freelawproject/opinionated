It states, <em>that on the 24th o\u00ed </em>May, 1836, one John De Groot sold and conveyed to the defendant David D. Demarest, the premises described in the bill, and that Demarest gave to De Groot his bond of that: date, for $5000, part of the purchase money; and also with his wife, gave to De Groot the mortgage set forth in the bill, on the premises so sold and conveyed, to secure the payment of the bond. That the mortgage was recorded in the clerk\u2019s office of Bergers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>county on the 28th of May, 1836. That on the 3d of November, 1838, De Groot applied to the complainant to buy the bond and mortgage, representing it to be a purchase-money mortgage, and a first lien of record on the premises, and ample security for the money mentioned therein.- That the complainant, confiding in these representations, and being willing to purchase the bond and mortgage, De Groot thereupon, by assignment of that date, in consideration of $5000, to him paid by the complainant, assigned the same to the complainant. That on searching the records, preparatory to filing the bill, the complainant first learned that-' there was on record a mortgage of the same premises, given by Demarest and his wife to the defendant Elizabeth Boyd, for $2000, purporting to bear date the same 24th of May, 1836, and to have been registered the 26th of that month. The bill claims, that the last mentioned mortgage is subsequent to the complainant\u2019s in fact and in law; and charges that Elizabeth Boyd took her mortgage with full notice of the mortgage of De Groot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-5\">The answer of Elizabeth Boyd states, that before the day of the date of the mortgage to De Groot, Demarest applied to her to lend him $2000, stating that he was about to buy the premises from De Groot for $9000; that he was to pay $4000 of the purchase money- down; that he had but $2000 in cash, and that if she would lend him- $2000, De Groot would agree that she should be secured by the first mortgage on the premises, and that De Groot would take a mortgage subsequent to hers for the remaining 5000 dollars of the purchase money. That on these conditions she agreed to loan Demarest the 2000 dollars, to be secured by the first mortgage on the-premises. That De Groot agreed with her agent, appointed by her to conclude the loan and take the security, that if she would loan the 2000 dollars, he would; on receiving 4000 dollars of the purchase money, accept for the residue of the purchase money a mortgage subsequent to the mortgage to be given to her at the same time; stating, that unless he could get 4000 dollars of the purchase money in cash, he could not procure a release of the elairn of the Receivers of the Washington Bank on the premises-.. That thereupon, it was agreed by De Groot, Demarest and her, that she should loan the 2000 dollars to Demarest; that this sum, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>with 2000 dollars more to he paid by Demarest, should be paid to said Receivers to procure a release from them to De Groot, and that on the delivery of the release, De Groot was to convey the premises to Demarest, and that thereupon Demarest and his wife should secure this defendant by the first mortgage on the premises, and after that should give De Groot a mortgage on the premises for 5000 dollars, the residue of the purchase money. That in pursuance of said agreement, she, on or about the 24th of May, 1836, lent and advanced to Demarest the 2000 dollars: which with 2000 dollars more advanced by Demarest, was paid to the said Receivers; whereupon they delivered their said release to De Groot, who thereupon executed and delivered to Demarest a deed for the premises; and thereupon Demarest gave his bond to this defendant, dated the said <em>24th </em>of May, 1836, conditioned for the payment of 2000 dollars, with interest, on or before the 1st of May, then next, and a mortgage of the premises of tire samo date, executed by him and his wife, to secure the same. That said bond and mortgage were delivered to her, in the presence of De Groot, before the bond and mortgage set forth in the complainant\u2019s bill were executed or delivered to De Groot; and that De Groot, after the mortgage to him was executed and delivered, signed a writing indorsed on this defendant\u2019s mortgage, by which he acknowledged that the mortgage of this defendant was prior in point of date and lien to the mortgage to him, and was to be first paid ; and that for greater certainty, and that the priority of this defendant\u2019s mortgage might be manifest to all, the said De Groot agreed not to deposit his mortgage in the clerk\u2019s office for registry until some day after -this defendant\u2019s mortgage should be so deposited. That the -execution of her mortgage was duly acknowledged on the day of the date thereof, and was received in the clerk\u2019s office on the 25th of that month, and was duly registered by the clerk. That she has no knowledge of the assignment to the complainant, of the said mortgage to De Groot, nor of the representation made at the time thereof, by De Groot to complainant, except by-the complainant\u2019s bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-3\">The defendant Demarest, in his answer, states, that the mortgage to Elizabeth Boyd was given to secure 2000 dollars loaned by her to him, to pay De Groot on the purchase of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>premises; and that he and his wife, by an arrangement and the express consent of De Groot, and in his presence, executed and delivered to Elizabeth Boyd the said mortgage to her, before the execution and delivery of the mortgage to De Groot; and that this 2000 dollars was paid by him to De Groot, as part of the purchase money for the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-5\">And this defendant, by way of defence against the mortgage to De Groot, in the hands of the complainant, denies that the assignment thereof to the complainant was in consideration of 6000 dollars paid by complainant to De Groot; but says, the said assignment was made in pursuance of a usurious contract between De Groot and the complainant, by virtue of which the complainant loaned and advanced to De Groot, partly in money and partly in securities for money a large part of which proved worthless, 4500 dollars; for which De Groot assigned to the complainant the said bond and mortgage, and also guaranteed and became personally responsible, by writing under his hand, to the complainant, that the complainant should recover and receive from said bond and mortgage the principal sum of 5000 dollars, with interest at six per cent.; and that said 4500 dollars wras advanced to De Groot by the complainant, in money and securities as aforesaid, upon the said contract and agreement that De Groot should assign the said bond and mortgage and guarantee the same as aforesaid; and claims, that thereby the said contract and assignment were rendered usurious and void; and says that De Groot has notified him of the circumstances under which said assignment was made, insists that said assignment is usurious and void, and claims said bond and mortgage as his own property, as if no assignment thereof had ever been made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-6\">Both mortgages were acknowledged on the day of their date, before A.

O. Zabriskie, esquile, who drew and witnessed the execution of both bonds and mortgages, and before whom both mortgages were acknowledged, and who was also one of the Receivers of the Washington Bank-; and by the writing signed by De Groot and indorsed on the mortgage of Elizabeth Boyd. There can be no doubt that under these circumstances the mortgage of Elizabeth Boyd is the prior lien. Though the mortgage to De Groot was for a part of the consideration money for which he sold the premises to Demarest; yet he might agree that -Demarest should first execute and deliver to another, a mortgage on the same premises, and that such prior mortgage should -be first recorded. If by collusion between Demarest and Elizabeth Boyd, a mortgage had been made by Demarest to her without De Groot\u2019s knowledge, and for the fraudulent purpose of interposing a prior lien, a court of equity would relieve; but here, the arrangement was made by De Groot\u2019s express consent, and was, to the knowledge of De Groot, the inducing cause or reason of the loan by Elizabeth Boyd t.o Demarest. It would be a fraud on her, to permit De Groot, t,o postpone her claim ; nor can her claim be postponed in favor of De Groot\u2019s assignee. Her mortgage was first recorded; and it was so recorded by the consent and agreement of De Groot.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The evidence of Lewis B. Cobb, that when the assignment by De Groot to complainant was made, De Groot produced a paper purporting to be a certificate of the clerk of Bergen, setting forth that the mortgage assigned was the first and only mortgage, if at all competent, could not avail the complainant. That paper was taken away by De Groot, and is not produced in evidence. But if the clerk gave any such certificate, it could not affect the mortgage of Elizabeth Boyd, if it was contrary to the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Demarest, the mortgagor, sets up in his answer, that the assignment to the complainant of the De Groot mortgage <em>wm </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>usurious. That De Groot, when he made the assignment, gave :his personal guaranty, by writing under his hand, to the complainant,.that the complainant should receive from the said bond .and mortgage the whole sum mentioned therein, and interest; \u25a0that this guaranty made the assignment usurious, and that no decree should be made dn favor-of the complainant. No such guaranty appears in the written assignment, and no proof of \u25a0any guaranty is made in the cause. The counsel for Demarest .contends, that the allegation to that effect in Demarest\u2019s answer ;is sufficient proof of the fact, unless disproved by testimony on the part of the' complainant. This position cannot be maintained. A replication was filed. The complainant proves and .produces the mortgage and an assignment thereof to him, in \u2022which no guaranty appears; and the defendant \"gives no evidence whatever of the allegation in his answer. The cases cited by the defendant\u2019s counsel from 1 -Green, cannot be supposed to sanction the idea that, under such circumstances, the allegation of the answer is sufficient -to establish the fact of usury. If a complainant sets down his cause for hearing on bill and answer, the answer is evidence of the facts set up in defence-; but matters respecting which no inquiry is made by the bill, and which are set up in the answer in avoidance or in bar, are denied by the replication, and must be proved <em>aliunde.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">There is no proof, therefore, before the court, of the guaranty, on the allegation of which the defence of usury is set up.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">This makes it unnecessary to consider, whether the principle adopted by our supreme court in the case of <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Brittan, </em>in reference to usurious indorsements of commercial paper, would be applicable to this case if the guaranty was proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">A decree will be made for the sale of the premises, to pay, first, the mortgage to the defendant, Elizabeth Boyd, and next, the mqrtgage held by the complainant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
