Halsted, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-7\">There are mortgage creditors, judgment-creditors, and simple contract creditors. The question is-as to the manner of distributing the fund in court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-8\">The receivers were authorized to-sell not only the real estate, but the franchises. The franchises were not included in the mortgages, and could not be sold on execution. The real estate and franchises were all sold together at one bid, for $50,000. The receivers report in a previous report, that the real estate was worth only $11,060. This report was -confirmed. We have therefore $39,000 derived from a sale of the franchises, not available to the mortgagees. How is this to be distributed ?\u2022 The judgment of the Trenton Bank is prior to all the mortgages, and is for $17,000; and this takes all the real estate; for that was valued at only $11,-000. The property mortgaged, therefore, is swept away by that judgment. A fund arising from the sale of the franchises, and not bound by the mortgages, is in court for distribution. Have the mortgages a priority on that fund <em>1 </em>or have the judgment creditors a priority ? or are these assets equitable assets, distributable, <em>pro </em>rata, among creditors of all classes ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-9\">He contends they are legal assets, and that the judgment creditors are entitled to priority. In this state, an equity of redemption may be sold at law, and therefore is legal assets. The English rule, then, does not apply here. Judgment debts are the only debts entitled to preference here. Our law knows no distinction in favor of more specialties, The real estate, then, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>being swept away from the mortgagees, they have only their bonds left, and the -judgments are entitled to priority over them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-3\">For the purposes of this argument 'he admits, that the aet authorizing the sale free from incumbrances was constitutional; but says the legislature .gave no rule for distribution; that they could not have intended to change priorities, and deprive the judgment creditors of-their priority. If the legislature intended <em>to make the </em>proceeds equitable assets, they would have directed distribution among -all the creditors, rateably.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-4\">The Smith and 'Corrigan judgments -were obtained before the \u2022bill was filed on which the decree .in this case was made; .and the decree does not authorize a sale free from incumbrances. So far as -a mortgage is a lien <em>in rem </em>-it has a preference-; no further. But in reference to funds derived from other sources, judgment creditors are preferred by the very terms of the statute under which the bill in this case -was filed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-5\">The judgment creditors might have filed a bill in -this court to subject the franchises to the payment of their judgments-; and on filing their bill they would have obtained \u00e1 preference. The franchises could not be sold, either -under a decree of this court or under a judgment at law. The legislature made -them liable, and did not give character to -the proceeds of the sale of them, either as legal or equitable assets. Pie contends that they are legal assets, and that-the judgment creditors have priority; \u2022that a judgment is a general lien on all property, including what cannot be levied on. The mortgagees have no standing here in reference to the proceeds of the sale of the franchises.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-6\">Next. Certain leases came into the hands of the receivers, and they received rents on them. How are these rents to be distributed ? They arose from the lands bound by our executions. There is no pretence that they are equitable assets. The mortgagor would have received the rents. The receivers took -them for the benefit .of the mortgagor and his creditors. \u25a0They are legal assets, and go to the judgment creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-7\">Next. When the Sertorie property (seventeen acres south of the Assunpink) was purchased by the Company, it was subject to the Hargous mortgage of $3,300. He contends this is not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>debt of the Company ; and that the holder of the mortgage is not a creditor of the Company ; and that the purchaser at the receivers\u2019 sale is liable for it to Hargous. That the act under which the receivers sold, authorizing them to sell free from incumbrances, intended only incumbrances created by the Company. The purchaser at the receivers\u2019 sale bought subject to the mortgage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-4\">Mr. H. cited, 1 <em>John. Ch.

G. Potts, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A94\"><em>On the </em>14th of October, 1843, the receivers made a report, that the debts amounted to $120,000; that the rents unassigned were $4,779 ; and that the value of the real estate was $11,100. November 6th, 1843, the court made an order directing the receivers to sell all the real estate and the franchises. On the 16th of February, 1844, before the sale was made, the legislature passed an act authorizing the receivers to sell free from incumbrances. The receivers sold accordingly ; and the whole property was sold together for $50,000. The receivers then made the report from which these appeals have been taken.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>In that report .the (receivers adopted this principle, that the judgments and mortgages are liens on the whole fund, and are entitled to priority according to their respective dates.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-3\">It is contended, that the $50,000 is the product of two different kinds of property, viz. the real estate, valued at $11,100, and the product of the sale of the franchises, $39,000; and that the judgments \u00a1are entitled to be first paid out of the proceeds of the franchises, and that the mortgages are only entitled to the $11,100. This he opposed. He does .not go into the doctrine of legal and equitable assets; .believing that the contest will be settled before reaching that question. If the property sold was subject -to the mortgages, the product of the sale is so subject, and the report is right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-4\">By the act of incorporation, the Company have power to convey their .property, with the privileges granted by the act. By the terms of the mortgage,-the Company mortgaged the land, race-way, water, and the right to take water from the Delaware.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-5\">A power to convey includes a right to mortgage: <em>Saxton, </em>18. The mortgages,'then, are liens,, not only on the lands, but on the privileges, and on .the right to improve and make profit of the works. The decree authorized the sale of the lands and all the rights, privileges and franchises of the Company ; and the act of February, 1844, authorized the sale of the real estate, franchises and works.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-6\">The report of the receivers, valuing the real estate, is no authority here. It cannot be true, because the receivers state the annual rents are $8000. They must have excluded the raceway, as mere land covered with water, and worth nothing as such. It cannot be supposed that $11,100 was the value of the Company\u2019s property. Debts to the amount of $120,000 were Incurred upon it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-7\">The error is in classing the franchises as personal property. The things granted by the act, were, 1st, To exist as a corporation ; 2d, To improve, &amp;c. and draw water from the Delaware to make a water power. The first class of franchises are political, and cannot be sold. The second class are property franchises, and may be sold, and were sold. The act of 1844 created a new company, by a new name. The political franchises of the old company were not destroyed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>If t.he purchasers at the receivers5 sale bought the political franchises of the-old company, then they must be the old company, and are liable for its debts. The second class of franchises are property franchises, and these passed by the sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-3\">The estate sold consisted of the lands, race-way, water, and rights appurtenant to the estate, and necessary to its enjoyment. And this wras nothing more nor less than the estate mortgaged. These rights and privileges had been used; the dam was erected, the head and tail races made, and the water drawn ; and the mortgages were of the property, and these improvements, and the right to draw the water. It, cannot be doubted that this was the idea of the mortgagors and the mortgagees. The language of the mortgages is as broad as possible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-4\">This class of franchises may be sold; and if the legislature think the principle of succession necessary, they may give the purchasers the political franchises. If a toll-bridge be mortgaged, and sold under the mortgage, would not the purchaser acquire the right to take toll ? In reference to the property in this case, the whole value of it is the right to take the water, and the improvements made for the purpose of taking it, for use as water power.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-5\">By the franchises authorized by the legislature to he sold, property franchises only are intended. If this be so, the $50,000 is the proceeds of the property mortgaged, and is to be distributed among the mortgage and judgment creditors, according to their respective priorities. The property, as it stood at the-time of the sale, was the product of the moneys borrowed ok these mortgages. The mortgagees lent the money to construct the work and acquire the water power.- Shall they have the; security of a dry ditch only ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-6\">There never was just such a fund in court to he distributed. We shall meet with a sea of difficulties if we attempt to travel the road pointed out by the opposite counsel. That counsel says there are two funds; one real, <em>i. e. </em>lands$ the other per - sonal, <em>i. e. </em>franchises. And the foundation of this distinction-is a loose saying in the report, that the real estate was worth only $11,100.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-7\">The property on which the canal is was taken by appraisement, and the amount of the appraisement is $35,000. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>are no data by which the court can solve the question, how much of the $50,000 was bid for the land, and how much for the works and property franchises. The object of the legislature in granting the act of incorporation, was to create a public work; and by the act of February, 1844, directing the sale, and constituting a new company, they intended to preserve it entire. Its value was as an entirety.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-3\">It may be asked, if the mortgages embraced all the land and the property franchises, why was it necessary for the legislature to interfere? Answer: Here is a title novel in its character. A question might arise among the bidders, whether the purchaser would get the right to keep up the dam, &lt;fcc. and draw water. If a doubt existed, the creditors would suffer. This was a sufficient reason for the legislature to interfere and provide for the sale of the property franchises. These are, in terms, expressly included in the mortgages; and the $50,000 is the proceeds of the mortgaged premises.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-4\">It was next insisted by the opening counsel, that the rents received by the receivers were legal assets, and belong to the judgment creditors. We admit they are legal assets ; but say, 1st, That the incidental expenses have exhausted them: 2d, If they were in court, they would be applicable; first to pay the Bank judgment; the Bank being both a mortgage and judgment creditor prior to the Cadwallader mortgage, the rents should go to the Bank judgment, in aid of the claimants under that mortgage; the judgment of the appellants being subsequent to that mortgage. 3d, The Stryker judgment is prior to the judgments of the appellants, and would take the rents; and the holder of it is not here complaining.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b240-5\">P. <em>D. Vroom,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AT5\">in behalf of the Hargous mortgage, now held by McCall, and of the' purchasers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-6\">The McCall mortgage was an incumbrance on the property when it was purchased by the Company, and the money due on it was a part of the purchase money. The Company became bound to indemnify the vendor. They paid the interest to the spring of 1842.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-7\">The receivers reported this as an incumbrance on the property at the time of the sale, to be first paid.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>It is objected, 1st, That it is not the debt of the company, but the personal debt of the mortgagor; that the bond is not extinguished. 2d, That the company boughs only the equity of redemption; and that the receivers sold nothing more, and sold subject to this mortgage. ,</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-3\">He answers, 1st, This was the property of the company. The fee was theirs; as much as if they had bought it free from incumbrance and then put a mortgage on it. And the receivers reported it to the court, the creditors and the public, as a part of the real estate of the company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-4\">2d, The order for the sale was, to sell the property of the company. Before the sale was made, the legislature, for obvious reasons, interposed, and directed the sale to be made free from incumbrances. The title to be given to the purchasers was to be free from incumbrances. The terms of the act are, \u201c as good a title as the company had, free from incumbrances.\u201d Not, from incumbrances made by the company, but from ail incumbrances. Now, what title had the company ? If it was a fee, that title passed free &amp;e. If the act had said nothing of the title to-be given the question might have come up. But the power and language of the legislature reaches over all the objections. Was not the, property sold free from Incumbrances made by the company? On what principle? Simply because the legislature ordered it to be so sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-5\">The purchasers bought the property on the terms mentioned In the act. Are they to pay this mortgage in addition to what they bid ? The act gives one rule as to all the mortgages. It would be a surprise, not to say a fraud on the purchasers, to charge them with this mortgage. The act was not necessary to sell the property. The object of the act was to give confidence to bidders; to sell the whole property and title; and to give the, purchasers a title free from all incumbrances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-6\">This view does no injustice to the appellants; for if sold subject to the mortgage, the property would have brought so much the less. If the property had been sold by the sheriff, or by the receivers without the act, grave questions would have arisen. But the act removed all difficulties. Were the bidders to inquire who put on the incumbrances ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-7\">There is no dispute that- the property covered by this mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>gage is worth more than the mortgage on it. It is put down by the receivers as part of the realty, at $ 10,000.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-3\">This mortgage was .the debt of the company in respect of that land. The authorities on the other side do not alter the equitable rights of the,parties. True, the company did not become the legal debtorbut they were in equity bound to indemnify the mortgagor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-4\">It is not a question made-by McCall, whether the legislature could take his fund, or the land mortgaged to him. McCall submits, and comes here for his portion of the fund. Has he not a right to come here and say he will take the money ? If McCall had filed his bill against the purchasers, a question might have arisen whether the legislature could direct a sale free from his mortgage: But he foregoes it and comes <em>here; </em>and the value of the land being more than equal to his mortgage, he is entitled to the amount of his mortgage. By this construction no one sustains loss; and it was for the benefit of the after creditors that the property should be sold in this way.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-5\">Mr. Yroom spoke also to the first question argued by Mr. Potts, and concurred in his views. He said also, that if the property had been sold simply under the mortgages, the purchasers would have taken all the property, dams, embankments, &amp;c., and the right to use them, the same as the company had the right; and could enjoy it all without being incorporated. The old company would still exist, but their property would be gone.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-6\">The act conferred new political franchises on the purchasers. The purchasers hold their political rights under the act. But if it should be supposed they hold their political rights under the sale made by virtue of the act, how much more was bid on that account? The question is answered by asking how much it would cost to get an act of incorporation. He presents this alternative view, but submits that the view taken by Mr. Potts is the correct one.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-7\"><em>Mr. Halsted, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b242-8\">The Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"Anc\">The mode suggested by the counsel for the appellants for ascertaining the product of the sale of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>franchises, cannot he adopted. The tract <em>of </em>seventeen acres, south of the Assunpink, was valued by the receivers at $10,000, and all the rest of the real estate of the company at only $ 1100. it is evident the receivers valued the land occupied by the canal, race-ways, and their banks, as mere land. The canal and race-ways cost the company some $75,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\">Is there any other mode of ascertaining the product of the sale of the chartered rights, as distinct from the proceeds of the sale of the real estate? Certainly none. The product of the receivers\u2019 sale, therefore, is an entire fund, of one character. They are not equitable assets, distributable <em>pro ra\u00eda among </em>creditors of all classes. The counsel on both sides admit they are to go to the mortgage and judgment creditors according to law. The difficulty is as to the legal priorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Several of the mortgages cover the whole property of the company, and several cover only separate parts of it. It is clear, that so long as the sale stands, and the decree confirming it, it being a sale of the whole property together for an entire sum, it is impossible to adopt any other order of priority than the dates of the respective incumbrances. The receivers might, possibly, have sold in such parcels as would have enabled them to give to each incumbrancer 'his share \u201c according to law,\u201d in reference to the liens on the different parts and on the whole and the dates of the liens. But the race-way and the franchises appurtenant thereto could not be sold separately with any propriety, nor the canal and rac-e-ways sold in parts. The legislature, therefore, in directing that the several creditors should receive their respective shares of the proceeds &lt;! according to law,\u201d could not have understood these words to have the meaning before referred to. As the sale was made, and contemplated by the legislature to be made, there was no law remaining according to which the proceeds of the sale could be distributed, but tlie law of priority in date of incumbrance. All other law is absolutely precluded and excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">On this part of the case, therefore, the decree confirming the sale is the law of the case; and no rule of distribution exists except the one adopted by the receivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The next subject of inquiry is No. 4 in the report of the receivers. The lessors, the .company, assign the rents to accrue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>on certain leases, as security for the payment of their notes. \u2022Does this constitute a lien on the fund in court for the amount of the notes, in preference to subsequent mortgage and judgment creditors ? I cannot see that it does. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b244-3\">No. <em>5 </em>in the report of the receivers is a claim of the same kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Next, 'the rents received by the receivers go to the judgment creditors. The Trenton Bank has the first judgment, which is a lien on the. whole fund in .court, as well the proceeds of the receivers\u2019 sale as these rents.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Next in priority of date is a mortgage, whose lien is only oil the proceeds of the receivers\u2019 sale, and not on these rents.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Next in priority of date is a judgment creditor, whose lien is also on the whole fund in court, including the rents. The fund in court exclusive of the rents, is sufficient to pay the bank judgment and part of the mortgage. Is it the duty of the court to apply the rents to the payment of so much of the bank judgment, in aid of the mortgage, and in prejudice of the subsequent judgment creditor?</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">It is so claimed on the part of the mortgagee. I think not. The equity of the mortgagee is not more than equal to that of the subsequent judgment creditor; and between equal equities the court does not interfere.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">The next inquiry relates to the Hargous mortgage, now held by McCall, on seventeen acres of land south of the Assunpink, through which the race-way runs. This mortgage was on the property when the company bought it. It is contended by the counsel for the appellants, that the purchaser at the receivers\u2019 sale bought subject to this mortgage, and that it should not be paid out of the proceeds of that sale. It seems to me, that the legislature, by the act of February, 1844, intended that the purchaser at the receivers\u2019 sale should take the property of the company free from all incumbrances whatever. That McCall might compel the payment of the bond by Hargous, the obligor and mortgagor, notwithstanding the act and the sale under it, would make no difference in this court. In that case Hargous would be let in upon the fund for the amount paid by him. There may be something extraordinary in the nature and provisions of the act of February, 1844; but our present inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>relates simply to the distribution of the fund; and we have nothing to do but to carry out what seems to be the intention of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">The exception to certificates for interest upon interest, to holders of claims under some of the mortgages, is allowed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
