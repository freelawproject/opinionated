Pratt, Elias Freeman and David Jones, and Joseph B. Nones, complainants, stating the foregoing facts; and stating further, that Pratt had been endeavoring to effect a loan, to pay off the said judgments against the Hamburgh Company and the other debts of the said Company, and that, to give him an opportunity to do so, the sale under the said executions had been adjourned from time to time, and stood adjourned to December 5th, 1838. That progress had been made in-the negotiation for a loan, and he had assurances that the money would be raised in three or four weeks. That under these circumstances, fearing that a sale might be forced, Pratt applied to some of his friends in New-York, who determined4o send a person with him to attend the sale, with authority to buy the property, if it became necessary. That accordingly, on the said 5th of December, 1838, Pratt went to Hamburgh, and that Aaron B. Nones accompanied him, with authority and with the means to purchase the property, if no agreement could be made between Pratt and the creditors of said Company. That on the morning of the said 5th of December, 1838, and just previous to the hour of sale, Elias L\u2019Hommedieu and Joseph E. Edsall, on the part and in behalf of the creditors of the Hamburgh Company, most of whom were then present to attend the said sale, proposed to Pratt \"that some arrangement should be made that would be mutually beneficial to all parties concerned, and that, to effect such arrangement, they would undertake to raise money enough, by mortgage upon the property, to appropriate $2000 for the purpose of carrying on the business of the Company and to pay off all the creditors; that they had had an interview with David Ryerson, Esq., and that he had offered to procure a loan of $30,000, or of whatever sum, not exceeding that amount, might be required for the purposes aforesaid; but that the said loan could only be obtained on condition that the property should be sold, and some person become the purchaser of the said ore bed, (the Clinton Company\u2019s mine farm,) and the property of the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Hamburgh Company; for that under the sale the title could be better perfected, and rendered free from all question, doubt, or incumbrance; and that as soon as the said loan was effected, the property should be re-conveyed to the said Hamburgh Manufacturing Company or to Pratt. That in view of this proposition, and to give time for reflection, the sale was adjourned, by consent of all parties, to the next day; that on the next morning, a meeting of the said creditors and Pratt took place, Ryerson being present, and Joseph E. Edsall, in the presence of all parties, then stated again the terms of the proposed arrangement ; and that Ryerson then stated that he could procure the said loan, and that as soon as the property was sold, the money should be advanced to the purchaser, to be secured by mortgage on the property, on condition' that the creditors then present would execute an agreement, that, in proportion to their respective claims that should be satisfied out of moneys raised on the mortgage, they would be responsible to the mortgagor for any-loss ho might sustain on account of said loan; to which; conditions the said creditors assented. That Pratt then accepted the said proposition; and it was agreed that the property should be sold under the said arrangement, and that immediately after the sale, in order to secure the possession to Pratt,- and a re-conveyance of the property as soon as the loan should be effected, L\u2019Hommedieu should execute a proper instrument for the re-conveyance of the property to Pratt, and also a lease1 for the same; and by consent, the sale was then adjourned to take place at Newton, on the 7th December, 1838.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-4\">The bill then states, that on that day, and for the purpose of carrying out the arrangement before stated, the said creditors of the Hamburgh Company entered into articles of agreement among themselves, (being the articles before stated.) The bill then states the sales by the sheriff as before stated. That the property of the Hamburgh Company and the1 ore bed of the Clinton Company, so sold, were worth, at a low cash valuation, $100,000. That in November, 1838, Joseph E. Edsall and L\u2019Hommedieu had each given a written appraisement of the said Clinton ore bed, estimating its value at $50,000. That atibe time of the. sale, there were persons present who were ready\" to bid a large amount, and particularly for the ore bed; bu\u00a3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>they were informed by Joseph E. Edsall and L\u2019Hommedieu and others interested, that the sale was made under an arrangement between the said Company and the creditors; and in consequence thereof they were induced not to bid on the property. That the aggregate amount due to the said creditors of-the Hamburgh Company who signed the said agreement, was about $17,000 ; that of that sum L\u2019Hommedieu was a creditor of said Hamburgh Company for about $140. That Edsall held two mortgages on a part of the Hamburgh property, and a mortgage on the Clinton Company\u2019s ore bed; and pretended to have a claim against the complainants the Hamburgh Company for two or three thousand dollars, for expenses and services in procuring the charter of the said Hamburgh Company, &amp;c.; but the items of said account he would never render to the said Company or to Pratt, and always insisted that .the amount of his said claim should be allowed, without the production by him of any bill of particulars for the same; but which the complainants the Hamburgh Manufacturing Company and Pratt always refused to do, or to admit the justice of any such amount as said \u25a0 Edsall claimed. That Edsall was a large dealer with the complainants the Hamburgh Manufacturing Company, and became largely indebted to them, and to an amount nearly if not quite sufficient to satisfy his mortgages, and any other just demand he had against the Company. That at the time of said sale, the complainants the Hamburgh Manufacturing Company, were in possession of the said property belonging to them, and were preparing for blast. That immediately after the sale,- Pratt, being desirous to secure the possession of the property in order to carry on the business, urged upon L\u2019Hommedieu and Edsall the immediate execution of the agreement to re-convey, and also of the said lease; and with the view of ascertaining the amount of the accounts of the respective creditors of the Hamburgh Company who had signed said agreement, had effected a settlement of their respective amounts with all or most of them, except said Joseph E. Edsall, whose claim remains unascertained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-4\">The bill then states the lease from L\u2019Hommedieu to Pratt, and the agreement between L\u2019Hommedieu and Pratt for the conveyance of the property to Pratt; as before stated. That the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>said $30,000, mentioned in the said agreement to convey, was only a nominal sum, named as sufficient to cover the objects contemplated by the said arrangement, to wit: to put Pratt in funds, to the amount of $2000, to carry on the works and pay off all the debts ; and as the amount of the debts had not been fully ascertained, it was thought best to borrow $30,000, and use enough of it for the purposes aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-3\">The bill states, that the said writings were executed with the expectation, on the part of Pratt, that they would, in a few days, be cancelled, as they were all based upon and entered into, on his part, relying upon the loan to be made by the said Ryerson: and that with that expectation and understanding, the said creditors did, by their said agreement signed by them, agree to execute to the lender of the money their respective bonds, as stated in their said agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-4\">The complainants further state, that the $1500 stipulated in the lease to be advanced by L\u2019Hommedieu to Pratt, to put the furnace into blast, was inserted instead of the $2000 contemplated in the agreement of the said creditors for that purpose, \u25a0with the consent of Pratt; but that neither L\u2019Hommedieu nor any of the said creditors advanced any thing whatever to put the said furnace into blast. That Pratt went on with his own means to do so; and while going on with the said work, applied from time to time to L\u2019Uommedieu, Edsall and Ryerson, for the completion of the said arrangement, and the loan of money to effect it; and was continually promised that the money should soon he advanced, and every thing satisfactorily arranged, according to the understanding of the parties, until, at length, Ryerson told Pratt that the money would not be advanced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-5\">The complainants further slate, that while Pratt was proceeding, as aforesaid, to put the furnace into blast, and after ascertaining that the arrangement made at the said sale would not be carried into effect, ho made arrangements in New-York for money sufficient to pay off the said creditors, and requested L\u2019Hommedieu to go with him to New-York, to have the papers executed; that while on his way to New-York, in company with L\u2019Hommedieu, he was arrested on a recognizance of bail, and confined at Newark.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>The complainants state, that they are informed and believe, that while Pratt was thus in confinement, L\u2019Hommedieu and Edsall called a meeting of the creditors who had signed the said agreement, and proposed that they should take possession of the property, and themselves carry on the business of the said company; that all the creditors, except L\u2019Hommedieu and. Edsall, declined doing so,, and remonstrated against any such proceeding under such circumstances; but thafrL\u2019Hommedieu and Edsall, notwithstanding, determined themselves to take possession of the property. That on or about June 10th, 1839, they went into the office on the premises, where all'the books of the Company were kept, they, or one of them, breaking through the windows, the door of the office being locked; and then went to the tenants who occupied the dwelling-houses on the property of the complainants \u201c The Hamburgh Manufacturing Company,\u201d about ten in number, and turned out of doors the families and furniture of such of them'as would not agree to become tenants under them; and that in this way the said L\u2019Hommedieu and Edsall took possession of the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-3\">The bill further states, that when L\u2019Hommedieu and Edsall took possession as aforesaid, there was a large quantity of charcoal and of wood cut, and of ore raised, besides other personal property of various kinds, on the said premises, consisting of furniture belonging to the office, also mules, oxen, horses, wagons, carts, sleds, coal, implements for raising ore, cutting wood and working the blast, owned by the complainants \u201c The Ham-burgh Manufacturing Company\u201d and Pratt, or in their possession under lease and agreement with the owners thereof, all of which the said L\u2019Hommedieu and Edsall took possession of and converted to their own use; and that ever since the said 10th of June, 1839, they have been in possession of the said property, and of the rents and profits thereof, and have cut and sold wood, and raised and sold ore, and have made two blasts on said premises, and are now in a third blast; and have, as the complainants are informed and believe, cleared out of the first blast upwards of $15,000, and out of the second more than $10,000, after paying all the expenses thereof; being more than sufficient to pay all the debts of the said Hamburgh Company.; and that the said L\u2019Hommedieu and Edsall have rendered no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>account, but have refused to do so ; and that the claims of the said creditors remain unsatisfied, except a few which L\u2019Hommedieu and Edsall have purchased, at one half, and some at one quarter of the amount thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-4\">The complainants further state, that they have frequently, through Pratt, applied to L\u2019Hommedieu and Edsall to account, &amp;c. and to appropriate the proceeds, rents and profits, to pay off the said creditors of \u201c The Hamburgh Manufacturing Company,\u201d according to the agreement under which L\u2019Hommedieu purchased and took the sheriff\u2019s deed; and the balance, if any, to pay over to the complainants, some or one of them; and for L\u2019Hommedieu to re-convey the premises to the complainants, some or one of them; the complainants offering, and now offering, if on the taking of such account there should not be found funds sufficient in the said defendants\u2019 hands to pay off the said creditors, to advance enough to make up the deficiency.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-5\">The bill prays an account of all and every the said estate and effects of the complainants \u201cThe Hamburgh Manufacturing Company\u201d and Pratt, taken possession of by L\u2019Hommedieu and Edsall, and of the rents, issues and profits of the said real estate; and that the said deed to L\u2019Hommedieu may be declared a trust deed, and the rights and interests of the complainants under the same be declared and secured ; and that an account may be taken of the respective debts due from the complainants \u201c The Hamburgh Manufacturing Company\u201d to the said creditors, respectively; (they are all made defendants :) and that the same may be paid under the direction of this court, out of the said rents, issues and profits; and if it shall appear that the rents, issues and profits, and other receipts of the said Edsall and L\u2019Hommedieu, .exceed the said debts, they may be directed to pay to the complainants such excess: and that L\u2019Hommedieu and Edsall may surrender and convey the.said premises to the complainants, or such person as .they shall appoint, free from all incumbrances made by them, and deliver up to the complainants all title deeds, &amp;c.; and that the complainants may have such further relief, or such other relief in the premises, as the circumstances of the case may require.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-6\">L\u2019Hommedieu and Edsall put in their joint and several answer to the bill; the substance of which, so far as necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>the consideration of the case, is as follows. They admit that 'Pratt made various efforts to prevent a sale of the real estate of \u201c The Hamburgh Manufacturing Company\u201d under the said executions against them, and procured adjournments of the sale from time to time; and that he may have.made efforts to negotiate a loan upon the said property, to pay off the judgments and other debts against the said Company; and may have procured searches of the title, and certificates of competent persons as to the value of the property; but what success he met with in his efforts, or what assurances he may have received, these defendants say they are ignorant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-3\">They admit that on the 5th of December, 1838, the day the sale of the Clinton mine tract was to take place, Pratt came to Hamburgh in company with Aaron B.

They admit that they and a number of other creditors of the Ham-burgh Company, were present, to protect their interests; but deny that on that, or any other occasion, they told Pratt that they would undertake to raise money enough by mortgage upon the property, to appropriate $2000 for the purpose of carrying on the business of the Company and to pay off all the creditors, or that they had any assurances from David Ryerson such as the. complainants have represented in their bill, that he would or could procure a loan of $30,000, or whatever sum, not exceeding that amount, might be required for the purposes aforesaid, but that said loan could only be obtained on condition that the property should be sold and.some person should become the purchaser of the said ore bed and the property of the Hamburgh Company, or that, as soon as the said loan could be effected, the said property should be re-conveyed to the Hamburgh Company or Pratt, or that in the mean time the said property should continue in the hands of Pratt, or that at any other subsequent \u2022 meeting .of the said creditors, these defendants, or any other of the said creditors to their knowledge, ever proposed any arrangement, or that any arrangement was at any time proposed, to the knowledge or belief of these defendants, by which any trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>whatever was to be created in any person, in favor of Pratt or <em>\u201c </em>The Hamburgh Manufacturing Companyor that the sale of the Clinton mine tract was adjourned, on the said 5th of December, upon any such arrangement or understanding with Pratt, or that on the next morning JRyerson stated in the presence of Pratt and these defendants and other creditors, that he could procure the said loan on the conditions in the bill mentioned, or on any other conditions, or that there was any assent of the creditors to any such conditions, or any agreement that a sale should be made under any such arrangement as <em>the </em>complainants have alleged, or that L\u2019Hommedieu should purchase under any such agreement or arrangement, or should execute any re-conveyance or lease to Pratt, founded on any such agreement or arrangement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-4\">They say that the sale of the Clinton mine tract, under execution in the hands of said sheriff against the Clinton Company, having been adjourned from time to time, until the said 5th of December, and -the whole of the real estate of the Hamburgh Company being also advertised under executions in the hands of said sheriff against the Hamburgh Company, and these defendants and the other creditors of the Hamburgh Company deeming it important to the security of their claims against the Hamburgh Company, that the Clinton mine tract, whence the Hamburgh Company derived their principal supply of ore, should be purchased in for the benefit of the Hamburgh furnace, and the creditors of the said Company despairing of Pratt\u2019s being able to raise funds or make any arrangement for the payment or security of their debts, and having large claims against the said Hamburgh Company, sometime in November, and several weeks previous to the time appointed for the sale of the said mine tract, held a meeting lor the purpose of consulting together as to the best means of securing their debts; and that it was then agreed among the said creditors, that if the said mine tract and the real estate of the Hamburgh Company should bo sold on the said executions, they would appoint one of their number to purchase the same, for the benefit of such of the creditors as should become parties to the agreement, in case no person should, at such sale, offer a sufficient sum to pay the incumbrances and secure the creditors; and that at that meeting, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>the creditors settled upon most of the principles of the articles of agreement afterwards-executed on the 7th of December, and which is set out in \u00a1the complainants\u2019 -bill. They say that neither Pratt, nor the Hamburgh Company, were known in the said arrangement, or had any part or interest in it; but that it was an arrangement determined -upon and-entered into by these defendants and the other -creditors who 'became parties to it, solely on their own account and for their own protection and benefit, and induced solely by the belief that the said Company and Pratt were utterly insolvent. That .the .debts and incumbrances then existing against the Hamburgh Company, according to the best of the knowledge and belief-of these defendants, exceeded $30,000; and that the debts of'the Clinton Company which existed at the time as liens on the said mine tract exceeded $10,000:; and that, as-the principal value of the Hamburgh property and of the said mine tract, depended upon its being all kept together, and used for the purpose of manufacturing iron, it became a matter of the last importance to the creditors to prevent its being sold in separate parcels, or for other purposes; as \u25a0such an event must necessarily have resulted in a great sacrifice of the property, -and consequently in a.great and almost total loss to the creditors, the Hamburgh Company and Pratt being without any other means to discharge the said debts, to the knowledge or belief of these defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-3\">They say, that at some one or more of the meetings of the creditors of the Hamburgh Company, held previous to the sale, David Ryerson was present, and was consulted by some of said creditors as to the possibility, in case the property should be purchased for the benefit of the creditors by one of their number, of raising, by loan to be secured on the same, money sufficient to satisfy their claims, provided they would agree to indemnify the lender against all losses, should the property, on a sale thereafter to be made, not bring the amount; that Ryerson offered to make an effort to procure a loan of $30,000 for that purpose, and expressed the hope that he should be able to effect such a loan, and did make efforts, as these defendants believe, to do so, but wholly without effect; but these defendants deny that he ever gave them, or the creditors, or Pratt, in their presence, or to their knowledge, any promise that he would, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>assurance that he could raise the said sum, or any other sum, upon the property and security aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-3\">They admit that such articles of agreement by and between the subscribers thereto, creditors of the Hamburgh Company, as are set out in the complainants\u2019 bill, were made and executed between them, on the 7th of December, 1838, the day of the date thereof; but they deny that said agreement was made or executed under any agreement or arrangement between them and Pratt, or for the purpose of carrying out any arrangement or agreement between them, or in the expectation that the said sum of money would be immediately raised, or with the understanding that the said property was to be re-conveyed to Pratt, or that a lease was to be executed to him immediately after the sale; but that on the contrary, the meaning and intent of the said agreement is fully and entirely expressed therein, and that it expresses all that was understood between the parties, as far as the knowledge or belief of these defendants extends.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-4\">They admit that L\u2019Hommedieu became <em>the </em>purchaser of the Clinton mine tract, at the sheriff\u2019s sale thereof, for $4041, subject to all prior incumbrances; and that on the 14th of said December the said sheriff sold all the real estate of the Ham-burgh Company, and that L\u2019Hommedieu became the purchaser thereof, for $285, subject to all prior incumbrances; and that deeds were delivered by the sheriff to L\u2019Hommedieu.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-5\">L\u2019Hommedieu says, he bought the Clinton mine tract and the Hamburgh property by virtue of the powers and instructions, and for the sole purposes set forth in the said agreement of December 7th, and for no other purpose whatever; that he acted as the agent or trustee of the creditors, as therein particularly named, and for none others; that there was not any understanding or agreement between himself and Pratt, or between himself and any other person or persons, that he was to hold the property, or any part of it, in trust for Pratt or the Ham-burgh Company, or for their or either of their use or benefit, or for any other purposes than those expressed in the said articles of agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-6\">They deny that the Hamburgh property and the Clinton ore bed were worth $100,000, or that there were any person or persons present at the sale or sales aforesaid, to the knowledge oi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>belief of these defendants, who were ready to bid a large amount, either for the ore bed or for the Hamburgh property, and were prevented from bidding in consequence of the information of the arrangement among the creditors; but they say, that at the time of the said sales, many of the creditors doubted the propriety of buying in the property for the amount of'the incumbrances, and considered its utmost value below $30,000 <em>; </em>and that these defendants and the other creditors were then, and since have been, willing to sell the whole property, including the mine, for that sum. That since the said sales, they have offered the whole property to Pratt for $29,000, though they had expended $2000 on it; and that they would be glad noW to sell the property for $30,000; and that they believe that the full value of the property, subject to the incumbrances and debts embraced in the said agreement, was given for it; and as to the ore mine tract, they say it was bid up to within one dollar of what it was struck off for, by Joseph H. Pettis, secretary of the Hamburgh Company, as these defendants believe.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-3\">They admit, that sometime previous to the sale of the Clinton mine tract, they gave some such certificates as to its value as the complainants have charged; that Pratt called on them on one occasion, when he was making efforts to borrow money on the property, and represented to them that he had had the ore bed examined by scientific miners, who had bored the ridge throughout, and found the bed inexhaustible; that from these representations, not having much personal knowledge of the matter themselves, and supposing Pratt\u2019s representations of the extent of the ore to be true, and knowing that ore could then be raised from the mine at fifty cents a ton, they signed the said certificates; but that' they soon after ascertained that said representations' were untrue, that the said ore was far from being so extensive, and that the same is now so far exhausted, that for the ore they have recently procured from that mine, they have been obliged to pay, at least, three dollars a ton.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-4\">Edsall says, that at the time of the execution of the said agreement, he held two mortgages on part of the real estate of the Hamburgh Company, and a mortgage on the said Clinton ore mine; that the mortgages on the Hamburgh property, with interest, then amounted to about $6500, and that he had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>claim against the Hamburgh Company of about $3000: but he denies that the said claim was for services and expenses in procuring the charter of the Company, or that he ever refused to furnish to the said Company, or to Pratt, the particulars of said account; but says, that the said claim was for coal, wood, and other goods and personal property sold and delivered by him to said Company, and for work and labor done and money ad - vanced to and for the use of said Company, at their request; and that the same was admitted by Pratt, in an agreement of November 29th, J837, as a1 valid and existing debt due from said Company, and set down as such by Pratt\u2019s consent, among the debts to be secured by a mortgage to Abner Jones;

but he says, that1 upon a conference with the creditors, and at the solicitation\u2019of Pratt, and under the influence of the representations made by him that he could yet raise money to carry on the works and pay off the creditors of the Company, a majority of the said creditors advised this-defendant to execute a lease of \u2018the property to Pratt, and to enter into a contract for the sale of the premises to him* for\" $30,000, and that a lease and contract of sale Were accordingly made and delivered to- Pratt,- as the same are set out at large in the complainants?; Bill; and he'denies that the said sum was merely nominal, and' named as being more than sufficient to cover the objects of starting the furnace and paying the debts; but that it was the sum for which the creditors and' he were willing to sell the property to him, though below the actual amount of the claims by about $2000;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-3\">L\u2019Hommedieu denies that the lease and' agreement were executed with the expectation of their being cancelled; or that \u25a0they were based on any expectation of a loan to be- effected by or through Ryerson; but says that, at the time they were executed, it was distinctly known by the parties that a loan could not be obtained through Ryerson ; but Pratt insisted, that if he could get such lease and agreement, it would enable him to <em>go </em>on with the business, and finally complete the purchase ; and the creditors, not being willing to attempt to carry on the works on their own account, preferred any plan which appeared to promise success and put the works in operation, .rather than abandon them to ruin, and that the covenants binding Pratt ta go on with diligence, under penalty of forfeiture, were inserted to secure that end.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-4\">These defendants say that, after the making of said lease andf agreement, Pratt left Hamburgh, and furnished1 no means, nor did any thing towards putting the furnace in. operation; but suffered the property to be idle and every thing to go to, ruin\u00bb<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>That the furnace dam was swept away, and no efficient efforts or preparations made to repair it. They deny that Pratt applied to them or either of -them, for means to carry on the works; nor was he kept in suspense by these defendants; nor did he get up any ore, or put the furnace in blast, or procure wood or ore during anytime after he received said lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-3\">L\u2019Hommedieu admits that in April, after the lease and agreement, Pratt being in Hamburgh, and this defendant being desirous of satisfying himself whether there was any probability that Pratt would be able to go on, or comply with the agreement, he started with Pratt for New-York, to see the persons who Pratt alleged proposed or were willing to advance him money ; and that on the way Pratt was arrested, and was detained at Jersey City; and this defendant went over to New-York, with a letter from Pratt <em>-io </em>his friends. That this defendant delivered the letter to the persons to whom it was addressed, one of whom, he thinks, was Abner Jones, but they refused to do any thing for Pratt; and he was taken to Newark jail; and in August following, took the benefit of the insolvent laws, making an assignment to Freeman and Iones, in which are embraced about 600 shares of Hamburgh stock, and the said lease, and from 600 to 1200 shares of the Clinton stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-4\">These defendants say, that from the time of the lease to that of the arrest, the property was unoccupied, the dam, in the mean time, mostly carried away, &amp;c., and the whole property rapidly going to decay ; and the creditors and these defendants apprehended that the whole works would he ruined; and at the instance of some of them, D. Haines and R. Hamilton went to Newark to see Pratt, and learn his views, and what he expected to do. That Pratt told them he had given up all idea of being able to do any thing with the property, that he relinquished all claim to the same, that the creditors -might take posses- , sion, and might as well have done so before, as he had abandoned all idea of doing any thing in the matter for some time previous.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-5\">These defendants admit they called a meeting of the creditors, after Pratt had been confined in jail, and that most of them met, and that it was proposed they should put the works in repair and go on ; but the majority objected to engage in it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>and many of them declared they would sooner lose their claim than encounter the risk; and it was then proposed that a few of the creditors should join and .carry on the business; and it was finally agreed that some such arrangement should be effected, if it could be brought about.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-3\">And these defendants deny that the creditors except said defendants, opposed the possession of the property being taken out of regard to any supposed rights of Pratt, who had forfeited all right under his lease, by neglecting to proceed to put the property in order and carry on the works, and by abandoning the same to ruin, in express violation of the covenants of the lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-4\">They say, that all prospects of Pratt\u2019s doing any thing being ended, the said Edsall having a mortgage on the furnace tract, and being a holder, to a very large amount, of the claims under which the property had been sold, entered into and took peaceable possession of the property, about the time in the bill stated, in his own right, as mortgagee; and the defendant L\u2019Hommedieu, afterwards, as purchaser at said sheriff\u2019s sale and trustee for the creditors, and as holder of the Jones mortgage, entered, peaceably, on the premises not included in the mortgage of Edsall, and also of the Clinton <em>mine; </em>and that the defendants afterwards agreed to unite in putting the property in repair, and the furnace in blast, and in carrying on the business. They deny that the creditors objected to their taking possession ; but insist that, as far as they know, they acted in conformity with the wishes and desires of said creditors. They deny turning out tenants of Pratt or taking such forcible possession as the bill charges; but say that the premises were abandoned by \u2022Pratt; that he had forfeited his right under the lease, and had expressly declared to the accredited agents of the creditors, that he relinquished all pretensions of claim to the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-5\">They deny that, when they took possession, there was a large quantity of charcoal, wood, ore, or personal property of various descriptions, or mules, &amp;c., belonging to complainants, or any of them, on the same ; but say, that all the personal property which had been owned by the Hamburgh Company had been before sold by the sheriff and constables, and that most of ,the teams, &lt;fcc., and other property had been bought by Edsall; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>and since being in possession, they have obtained their ore for the blasts from the mine, and have cut some wood on the premises ; but most of the wood and coal they have got from lands of Edsali, or other of the furnace property, or of other persons. They admit they have now on hand some pig-iron, coal, ore, wood, mules, &amp;c.; but deny that any of them belong to the Company, or Pratt, or were procured by their means ; but say they have, ever since being in possession, carried on the business wholly with their own means; and that, at their own expense, they rebuilt the dam, at an expense of $2500, put up a coal-house, rebuilt part of the doom, and made other extensive erections and repairs, and bought all the necessary personal property to enable them to carry on the works, and keep them in operation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-5\"><em>They </em>deny that they have cleared from the first blast upwards of $15,000, and out of the second more than $10,000 ; but say that the proceeds of the business have not, as yet, met the outlays and expenses of carrying it on, and paid a fair compensation to the defendants for their trouble and investments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-6\">They deny that they ever have refused to account with the creditors of the Hamburgh Company, or that they have ever been called on to account by them ; but say they are ready, and have always been ready, to account with the said creditors, under the said agreement of December 7th, 1838.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-7\">They deny that Pratt has frequently applied to them to account, as the complainants state in their bill; but admit that in July last, (the answer was filed in March, 1842,) Pratt called on Edsali and wanted him to exhibit an account of .their business, as trustee and agent of said Pratt or the Hamburgh Company, and that Edsali told Pratt that neither he nor the Ham-burgh Company had any thing to do with the property, or business, or had any right to any account whatever; and that Pratt, about the same time, called on L\u2019Hommedieu, and made some like demand, but he, L\u2019Hommedieu, being sick, referred him to Edsali.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-8\">They deny that they took possession fraudulently, or in violation of any agreement or lease, or against the express wish of the creditors; and deny that the complainants have any interest, in or Haim to said property, or any part thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>The defendant Daniel Haines also put in his answer. He admits that the sales were adjourned from time to time at the request of Pratt, who alleged he was .-negotiating a loan, to pay the executions. That while said real estate was advertised, some of the creditors of the Hamburgh Company became fearful it might be sold to their prejudice, - and their claims be lost; as a few of the large creditors might unite'to the injury of the smaller ones; and they suggested that all the creditors should unite in the purchase of the property, for their common benefit. To this some assented, and some declined unless the works could be carried on without their embarking in making iron. It was then suggested that the premises might be .rented out, or perhaps sold at private sale, and the loss of a large part of the claims prevented; and while the matter was a subject of discussion and reflection among the creditors, some person, not distinctly recollected, but he thinks Brown and Lewis, or one of them, came to the office of this defendant, and stated that Pratt, or some one he would appoint, would probably be lessee, if the creditors should buy the premises; and afterwards Pratt, or some one on his behalf, not now recollected who, asked this defendant if an arrangement could not be made, by which the creditors should buy the property and lease it to Pratt. This defendant said he thought it might be done. The sale, however, was adjourned ; but from these suggestions, the creditors pretty generally concluded that it would be to their advantage to buy the property, particularly as they considered that the value of the Hamburgh property would be greatly increased by the addition of the Clinton ore bed ; the Hamburgh ore bed being then esteemed of little value. But the terms of purchase, and what disposition should be made of the property, was left undetermined} and was the subject of conversation from time to time, for several weeks before the sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-3\">On the 5th of December, 1838, the day fixed for the sale of the Clinton property, on this defendant\u2019s being informed that the sale was adjourned to the 6th, and that some arrangement between the said creditors was likely to be made, and that his aid was desired, he left Newton and went to Hamburgh. The whole business was then discussed, and David Ryerson informed the creditors, in the hearing of this defendant,, that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>come there to aid the creditors, and that he would make the attempt to raise, by loan, the money to buy the property and satisfy the liens on it; and $30,000 was thought' sufficient. Ryerson stated openly to the creditors, and he believes in the hearing of Pratt, or of some of the persons acting with him, that he did not know that he could raise all the money ; that he could, perhaps, furnish part himself, and would go to NewYorlc and see what he could do there; that it might be necessary for him to go to Pennsylvania for it; and that he would do all in his power to effect the loan. It was then again suggested that Pratt, or some one named by him, would take a lease, to which the creditors generally assented, if they became the purchasers, and if they could agree on the terms of the lease. It was then also proposed, that Pratt should have the privilege of baying the property, on payment to the creditors of their claims and expenses; whereupon a negotiation was entered into between some of said creditors and Pratt, as to the terms on which he would lease the premises, and to give time for consideration, and a proper understanding of the matter, the sale of the Clinton property was adjourned to the 7th of December, at Newton. Pratt and many of said creditors went to Newton, and the terms on which the said creditors would become the purchasers, and how they should\" dispose of the property, were fully discussed among the said creditors. There was a variety of propositions, and a diversity of opinions, occupying all night, and to twelve o\u2019clock next day; this defendant and Mr. Hamilton acting as counsel for the said creditors. The result was the agreement between the said creditors, dated December 7th, 1838, stated in the complainants\u2019 bill. The terms of the said agreement were settled by the said creditors among themselves, and not between them and Pratt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-3\">Pratt was not, to his knowledge and recollection, present with the said creditors during the said negotiation among themselves and some of the creditors refused to make any agreement with him respecting the property. But this defendant admits it was generally expected and believed, that Pratt would become the lessee, or, as a creditor said, Capt. Pratt was to have the refusal of the lease, on the terms agreed on by the said agreement among the creditors; and in that expectation, Pratt was oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>casionally consulted as to the terms of the said agreement between the said creditors, which was to contain the terms of any future lease; and Pratt made several suggestions in relation to it, he and his counsel occupying another room in the same house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-3\">That this defendant signed the said agreement as a creditor; his claim was then about $113; afterwards reduced to $40, on an account stated January 4th, 1839. That at- the time of making the said agreement, the said Company were further indebted to him as assignee of Mr. Longwell, in $85, and also in $126,- the amount of a claim of Henry Darrah against said Company, assigned to him ; which claims were repeatedly recognized by the said Company, and their president, Pratt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-4\">That he acted also as attorney for six other creditors of the Company, (naming them,) John L. Adams, since deceased, being one of them, and he also signed said agreement in their behalf; and thereby this defendant and those for whom he acted became interested in the said real estate afterwards purchased by L\u2019Hommedieu, under the authority and instructions of the said agreement. He admits that the other parties signed the said agreement, as in the bill is stated, and thereby became interested in the said real estate so bought by L\u2019Hommedieu. He does not know what was the expectation of the said creditors about the money being raised immediately, and their debts <em>paid; </em>but for himself, as well as he can now recollect, he may have hoped- that the money would soon be raised ; but did not expect that more would- be raised than to pay off the purchase money and incumbrances.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-5\">He admits that, pursuant to the terms of said agreement, L\u2019Hommedieu, as trustee of the said creditors, and not of Pratt, bought the Clinton property, for $4041. That Nones was present at the sale, but for what purpose he came, and what money he had with him, or whether he or any other\u2018person -would have bid more, under any circumstances,- or whether any person was deterred or hindered from bidding, by any person, by persuasion, threats or otherwise, he does not know; but some two or more persons besides L\u2019Hommedieu bid at the sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-6\">He admits that L\u2019Hommedieu, as such trustee of the said creditors, and under the said agreement, afterwards bought at, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>the sheriff\u2019s sale, the real estate of the Hamburgh Company. That the property so bought by L\u2019Hommedieu was and is very valuable; but as the value depends on the extent of the ore beds and many adventitious circumstances, to fix a certain value might be regarded as speculation. But he was and still is willing to relinquish all his claim to and interest in the property, on being paid his claim; and he believes most, if not all the said creditors are like minded. He does not know, and has no certain means of ascertaining, the amount of the debts of the Hamburgh Company: but it was understood among said creditors, and he thinks by the officers of said Company, that the Hamburgh Company\u2019s debts, together with the purchase money of the Clinton property, and the prior incumbrances against both properties, would amount to between $28,000 and $30,000; and he has since seen a statement, supposed to be correct, amounting to more than $32,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-3\">Soon after the sale, at the request of L\u2019Hommedieu, he prepared a lease to Pratt, the terms of which were intended to he in conformity with the agreement of the said creditors, and the instructions therein to L\u2019Hommedieu. There was not, to his recollection and belief, any unnecessary delay therein; but on one or more occasions, some of the creditors having urged the settlement of all the claims, and particularly of Edsall\u2019s, before any lease should be executed, he stated that to Pratt, and urged the speedy settlement of all the accounts, and that of Edsall among the rest; and he admits that Pratt called on him, several times, about the said lease, and perhaps urged its execution ; but thinks Pratt called rather for the purpose of settling the terms of the lease and the articles for the sale of the said premises, than of urging their execution; and Pratt saw and knew that L\u2019Hommedieu, the trustee, was obliged frequently to confer with the said creditors about the terms of said lease and of said agreement, and that much time was necessarily consumed in the preparation of them; and this defendant thinks, that after the drafts of said lease a ad articles of sal\u00ae were made, one or both were taken by Pratt, to submit to his counsel; and that he returned the same with some written observations and suggestions on theta, by James Spear of Paterson, who was consulted by PrafL</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>He admits the lease and articles of agreement were the same as stated in the bill. That Pratt, or some person with or under him, made the necessary arrangements to carry on the works; but on what funds or credit he'cannot state; nor does, he know whether any advances- were made by L\u2019Hommedieu under the said agreement. That no money was raised by Ryerson on the said property ; but- he has been informed by Ryerson, that he made great exertions to do so, and failed. That this defendant, at the request of the said trustee and of some of the creditors, applied to several capitalists for a loan, but they all declined ; and he-believes every reasonable effort was made without success. That L\u2019Hommedieu and Pratt- set out to go to New-York/to make some arrangements about the said property, and that Pratt- was arrested, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-3\">He was present at a meeting of some of the creditors, at Ham-burgh, to consider what disposition should be made of the said real estate, Pratt having, as they believed, failed to fulfil the terms of said lease, and forfeited the same, the dam and works being in a state of dilapidation, and exposed to great danger; and some one there proposed that the creditors should take possession, and put the works in operation. Some objected, on different grounds; but all the creditors, except a few, objected to involve themselves in the hazard of that business, and some said they would rather lose their claims; and he thinks Edsall said, all the creditors would be too many, but with four or five he could name the business might be driven with advantage; and this defendant stated to said creditors, that whatever might be their right to the possession, it would not be liberal to Pratt, in his then unhappy situation ; and thereupon the said creditors requested this defendant, who was going to Trenton, to call on Pratt, and ascertain his views and prospects in relation to the performing his contracts for the said property. That on his return from Trenton, being in company with Robert Hamilton, he invited him to go with him to see Pratt, and they went;, and this defendant stated to Pratt that the creditors were anxious to know what he meant to do with the said property, and that it needed attention, and that some of the creditors had proposed to take possession and carry on the works. Pratt said he was-willing the creditors should take possession, and wished they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>had done so long before: that he had given up <em>all hope of </em>doing any thing with it, and that he freely gave up all his right to it, and hoped the creditors would he able to make their money out of it. This defendant told the creditors, at Hamburgh, of the result of his interview with Pratt; but he does not now recollect of any further proposition being made to take possession of the property ; but about that time, or a few days after, he heard that Edsall was in possession of the whole, or some part of it, claiming it as mortgagee in possession; and, soon after, he heard that L\u2019Hommedieu had entered into partnership with Edsall; and he was afterwards told by L\u2019Hommedieu that it was so. And this defendant then reminded L\u2019Hommedieu, that he was the trustee of the creditors, and might and perhaps would be held responsible for the use of the property; and suggested to him the propriety of so keeping his books of account as to be able to render a satisfactory account, if required, lie has no knowledge of the manner or precise time of Edsall and L\u2019Hommedieu, or either of them, taking ppssession: nor of the personal property then on the premises; nor what profits have been realized from the furnace, except that during the first blast made by Edsall and L\u2019Hommedieu, be heard them say their business was very profitable; and he has since heard them say that their second blast was not profitable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-4\">He says, that after Pratt was liberated, he came several times to Hamburgh, with divers persons who, he said, were desirous of buying the property and works, and on those occasions the creditors, or such of them as could conveniently be assembled, were called together, and propositions were made by Pratt for the purchase ; and on some or all those occasions, the creditors so assembled have stated to Pratt, that they would ask no more than to be paid their debts and expenses: and that if he would negotiate a sale, he could have the benefit of all he could get over; and at other times the creditors, or some of them, have offered to make, for his benefit, a liberal discount from their claims, if be could effect a sale; and that in all such negotiations, Pratt did not, to the knowledge or belief of this defendant, assert any right or interest in the premises; but, as this defendant then thought and still thinks, relied entirely on the liberality of the said creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>And this defendant submits himself to the judgment of the court; and if on the whole case, a trust in L\u2019Hommedieu for the use of Pratt shall result and be decreed, he prays an account, and that L\u2019Hommedieu, as trustee of the said creditors, may account for the rents and profits of the furnace and real estate, and pay to the said creditors the amounts due them, by a short day -; or-that the premises may be sold, and the said creditors paid out of the proceeds, in their order of preference.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-3\">The common replications were put in.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-4\">January 20th, 1843, Decree pro confesso, was entered against all the defendants except Elias L\u2019Hommedieu, Joseph E.

Nones. </em>He believes the ore bed was advertised to be sold on the 5th of December, 1838. Joseph E. Edsall and Elias L\u2019Hommedieu were present on that day; Edward W. Pratt was also there ; also -Daniel Haines, Robert A. Linn, Robert Lewis and Joseph M. Brown. The sale did not take place on that day, but was adjourned. He understood from Edsall and L\u2019Hommedieu and several other creditors, that the sale was adjourned in consequence of an arrangement .entered into between the creditors and Pratt, respecting the sale of the property. He made no secret of why lie went. It was generally known and understood there, why he did g'o. He was asked by several if he came to purchase the property, and he answered &lt;! yes.\u201d There was, on the day the sale was advertised to fake place, a meeting of persons, said to be the creditors of the Ham-burgh Go. and Pratt, of considerable duration. Edsall and L\u2019Hommedieu were present with the creditors. During that meeting, witness and others were waiting in expectation of the sale. He understood it to be a meeting confined to Pratt and the.credilors. Immediately after that meeting broke up, Pratt submitted .to witness a proposition in writing, said to have been made to him at that meeting. Witness saw Pratt come out of the room where the meeting was held, with the paper in his hand. After the meeting broke up, witness had a conversation with Edsall, L\u2019Hommedieu, and several of the other creditors, respecting what took place at that meeting. Edsall and L\u2019Hommedieu fold witness that they had an understanding with Pratt respect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>ing the sale of the property ; that the sale had been adjourned for a day or two, to give Pratt an opportunity of reflecting upon the proposition. Witness thinks the paper Pratt handed him was in the handwriting of Daniel Haines. He does not know what has become of that paper: he took a copy of it on the same day. Being shown a paper marked Exhibit E. on the part of the complainants, he says, that is an exact copy of the original paper handed to him by Pratt: it is in witness\u2019s handwriting. He had a conversation with Edsall, L\u2019Hommedieu, and several others, respecting the contents of that paper. He stated, prior to the sale, and it was known, that if an arrangement was made between the creditors and Pratt, witness would not bid at the sale. He thinks it was two days after that meeting of the creditors, that the ore bed was sold ; and before the sale of <em>the mine </em>tract, or ore bed, he -distinctly understood that an arrangement had been entered into between Pratt and the creditors, by which L\u2019Hommedieu was to purchase the ore bed. He understood this from Edsall, L\u2019Hommedieu, and others. It was in consequence of that arrangement that witness did not hid on the property. He estimated the property to be worth $100,000. He had conversed with Edsall and L\u2019Hommedieu respecting its value; and in making the estimate relied more particularly upon what Edsall told him, than what any one else told him. When the sheriff sold the ore bed, Joseph H. Pettis, of New-York, was present, and, witness thinks, bid upon it. He does not know why Pettis commenced bidding; but while he was bidding, witness went to him and told him it was foolish for him to hid, for an arrangement had been made with the creditors, and he, Pettis, knew what the arrangement was. Witness interfered and Pettis stopped bidding. Recollects Pratt\u2019s calling Pettis out and speaking to him respecting his bidding, and thinks Edsall and L\u2019Hommedieu were present; that is his impression. The amount of what Pratt said, was, that Pettis \u00a1mpw what the arrangement was, and Pettis\u2019s bidding was only hurting Pratt. At a subsequent day of the same month, the Hamburgh property was sold; and all was sold under the same understanding. Recollects, while he was up there, hearing about a loan for $30,000, to be made on the property. Understood distinctly from Edsall, L\u2019Hommedieu, and others, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>property was to be sold, and L\u2019Hommedieu was to buy it, in order to perfect the .title and enable him to make a mortgage. The sum stated to witness was $30,000, which sum, it was said, would be sufficient to pay off the debts of the company, and to give Pratt $2000 with which to carry on the works. The property was to remain in possession of Pratt, and after the debts were paid, was to be re-conveyed to Pratt. Witness saw David Ryerson there,-and -heard him speak about this loan; but does not remember that it was -in the presence of Edsall and L\u2019Hommedieu. He heard Ryerson speak of it the same afternoon the arrangement was made between the creditors and Pratt. Ryerson confirmed to witness what he had heard from others, that Ryerson was either to loan, or procure a loan of $30,000. Witness has had conversation with Edsall since the time above spoken of. He understood Edsall then, as he had always understood him, that when Pratt complied with the lease, the property was to revert to him. Recollects distinctly of having heard from Mr. Haines, Edsall, and several other of the creditors, that the reason why-the clause for the lease to Pratt was not inserted in the agreement, was because it would show a collusion between Pratt and the creditors to the agreement, and vitiate the sale. Knows that Pratt requested them to execute an agreement to give him a lease and the right of redemption, prior to the sale; and they declined for the reasons witness has stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-3\"><em>Cross-examined. </em>When he went to attend the sale he had about eleven or twelve thousand dollars -with him, and authority to draw for as much more as he wanted : does not know that he could state the -amount nearer. Does not know whether Pratt owed witness\u2019s brother any thing at that time. Believes Pratt owes his brother since that time. Does not know the precise amount; understands it is large. He presumes the reason why Edsall and L\u2019Hommedieu stated to him the object of adjourning the sale was, because the}', as well as others, had heard and knew the object of his being there; as it was talked of, he believes, in the room among the creditors. They each stated it to witness, but whether they were both together at the time, witness cannot say. Others also stated to witness what had been agreed upon at that meeting: he thinks Mr. Haines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>told him the same thing: heard it from Mr. Brown also; and thinks Mr. Holcombe told him the same thing. In conversation with Edsall and L\u2019Hommedieu and Holcombe, and several other creditors whose names witness did not know, who said it was a first-rate arrangement for Pratt, witness said ho would not bid. Pratt was present at some of the conversations. Pettis bid on the property, but whether to an amount exceeding the executions, witness cannot say; his impression is, he did not. At the sale, Pratt called Pettis apart from the place where they were selling; at that time L\u2019Hommedieu was near enough to make a bid ; we were all within a few feet of each other, and he supposes Edsall and L\u2019Hommedieu heard what Pratt said to Pettis, as witness heard it. After She adjournment of the meeting of creditors at Hamburgh, Edsall and L\u2019XXommedicu stated the particulars of the loan, and again at Newton Mr. David Ryerson told witness about the loan. Pratt was present at the time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-3\"><em>Direct </em>examination. Witness distinctly understood at the time, that L\u2019Hommedieu was to purchase the property for the benefit of Pratt and the creditors, and to perfect the title in L\u2019Hommedieu. He was prevented from purchasing the property on account of that understanding; and should have purchased it if it had not been for that understanding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-4\"><em>Franklin </em>Holcombe, for the complainants. 'Was employed and connected with the Hamburgh Co. a portion of the year 1838, as agent for the company. Was living at Hamburgh in 1838, when the sheriff advertised the ore bed for sale ;\u25a0 and was present at the public house where the property was advertised to he sold, when the meeting of the creditors was held there ; and saw Pratt there, Aaron B. Nones, Elias L\u2019Hormnedieu, Joseph E. Edsall, Brown, and other creditors of the company. The sale-was adjourned from Hamburgh to Newton for a day or two. Understood Nones had come there to bo a bidder at the sale ; so far as witness understood, it seemed to be known that Nones was there for that purpose. Understood Pratt and the creditors were about effecting an arrangement, and that was why the sale-was postponed. At the time of the adjournment to Newton,, witness understood that a loan was to be obtained on the property, and a lease was to be given to Pratt. Understood Pratt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>was to have a right of redemption of the property, to be inserted in an article; that L\u2019Hommedieu was to be the purchaser. The amount of loan talked of was $30,000, or so much less as the debts of the company should1 prove to be. Understood L\u2019Hommedieu was to purchase the property in trust, for the purposes mentioned. The facts witness has mentioned were generally talked of among the creditors, Brown, Robert Lewis, Pratt, Edsall, Henry J. Simpson, William Simpson, Francis Hamilton. He had no conversations direct with L\u2019Hommedieu on the subject, but heard him make some statements on the subject. L\u2019Hommedieu stated he had agreed to give a lease to Pratt for the property. Witness has no strong, distinct recollection of it, but his impression is, he saw Edsall in conversation with Nones. Witness was present at the sale at Newton, a day or two afterwards, and understood the sale took place on the terms he had heard of at Hamburgh. He had no conversation with L\u2019Hommedieu on the subject, but had considerable conversation with Edsall at Newton; at which Edsall stated to witness the understanding under which the property was to be sold, and that Pratt had consented to the sale on the terms talked of. Edsall stated, that he and some of the creditors preferred giving the lease to witness, because he was practically better acquainted with the business than Pratt was. Edsall afterwards said, that on consultation with the creditors, his, Edsall\u2019s proposition was rejected, and Pratt\u2019s name put in the lease. Witness understood the principal object had in view in selling, was to secure their claims, by uniting and perfecting the two titles in one person; witness means by the two titles, the Hamburgh and Clinton companies; the ore bed belonged to the Clinton Co., but the Hamburgh Co. derived their ore from it. He does not know that he had any distinct conversation with Edsall as to who was to make the loan, but that was a matter generally understood. Witness understood the loan was promised. Ryerson said, in witness\u2019s presence, he would undertake to procure the loan, if the title could be perfected in one person. He said the money was to be secured by bond and mortgage on the property: the creditors were to unite, in proportion to their shares, in that bond, to guaranty the payment of the money. Witness understood this arrangement prevented Nones from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>bidding at the sale, .ft was considered, that if there was say written agreement between Pratt and the creditors, prior to the sale, it would vitiate the sal\u00ae. It was pressed on the part of Pratt, to have the agreement executed previous <em>to </em>the sale. Witness supposes Pratt <em>to </em>have relied on their verbal promiaeu, and on their honor. \u25a0 Pratt requested witness, a very fem? mi tintes before'the sale, to go and get from the creditors a renewal of their promises <em>\u2019\u00a1 </em>and they began crying the sale before witness had seen them all. He spoke to Joseph M. Brown and William Simpson, when they commenced crying the sale, and witness desisted going to any more. Brown said the- agreement with Pratt should certainly be carried into effect. It was the understanding that the Hamburgh Co. should go on and settle with the creditors, in order to ascertain the amount of the respective debts. Witness and Pratt went on With several of the creditors to ascertain the amount of the respective debts. He believes that Pratt, in the company\u2019s office, in the presence of witness, did call on Edsail for his account. There was considerable talk about EdsalPs account: he said Horace, his son, was making it out. He never rendered his account, to witness\u2019s knowledge.: He said Horace had made it out up to some particular date, and he wanted it examined and passed upon up to that date. Witness thinks Pratt waited at Hamburgh some days for the purpose of getting EdsalPs account; thinks the clerk of the company was\u2019 sent to Edsail to get his account, but cannot say how often. The Hamburgh Co. had a store on their premises, where they sold dry goods, groceries, &amp;e. Edsail had a running account \"with <em>the. </em>company for two or three years; he purchased a pretty considerable quantity of iron from the companyalso a pretty good account for store goods. He was in the habit of giving orders on the store. Oh one of the company ledgers the account against Edsail, witness thinks, was something like $1000: on another ledger there should be an account for a boat load of iron, twenty-five or twenty-seven tons; the iron must have been worth about $30 per ton; there were other charges against him on that ledger ; there was another account for iron\u2019 against Edsail, which should be upon that ledger, for about seventy or eighty tons; Edsail had other iron, at one time abo\u00fct fifty-three or fifty-five tons. Knows the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>fact of Edsall and L\u2019Hommedieu taking possession of the property of the Hamburgh Company. <em>Recollects </em>Pettis\u2019s bidding for the ore bed ; did not hear L\u2019Hommedieu and Edsall say any thing to Pettis about his bidding ; but- Edsall requested witness-' to go <em>to </em>Pettis and stop his bidding; and also requested Pratt to&gt; <em>go </em>to Pettis, and Pratt-' did <em>go </em>and stop his bidding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-3\"><em>Cross-examined. </em>His impression is, Pettis bid the property up to an amount exceeding the two executions; he is-under the impression there were but two bidders, Pettis and L\u2019Hommedieu. From information, he should say Edsall furnished the principal supply of coal for the first blast the company made, and furnished some wood; has heard it said he furnished the company with one team and one wagon, a three-horse team. The company <em>got </em>grain and flour and feed at <em>his mill: The company </em>never made out their account in full against'Edsall, to witness\u2019s knowledge;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-4\"><em>Direct examination. </em>At Newton, the evening before <em>the </em>sale, Edsall proposed an1 arrangement to have L\u2019Hommedieu bid off the- property without any arrangement at all as to the said sale, and to* have three or four join in the arrangement; and requested witness to communicate it to Pratt, and see if he would go into it; said the object\u2019 was to transfer the property and cut off all the other claims-; Pratt -was to come <em>in </em>for a share ; the arrangement was to be effected by breaking up the other arrangement. L\u2019Hommedieu. called witness aside, and asked him if Edsall had made a certain proposition to him, that he thought very well of the proposition and Ke was willing to go into the arrangement. Witness started to communicate it to Pratt, and found lie- had gone to Lawyer Thomson\u2019s; and witness placed himself in a situation by which he supposed he should see him, but missed him; and soon after saw Edsall,who said to witness, I thought you said you\u2019d see Pratt; I have-seen him and spoken to him, supposing you had communicated to him ; the Captain said he\u2019d think of it, bat did not receive-'the proposition very favorably.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-5\"><em>Cross-examination resumed. </em>The proposition of Edsallwas, substantially, that four were to join in the- purchase. \u25a0 On the 24th September, 1838, there was a sale of the personabpropterty of the Hamburgh Co., consisting of teams, wagons, wood,; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>charcoal, <em>See., </em>necessary to carry on the furnace, the furnace then being in full blast. Edsall purchased most of this personal property, and told witness he had made arrangements with the other purchasers, so that he-had control of pretty much all the personal property. Edsall made a verbal arrangement with Pettis and witness, by which they were to have the stock, wood and coal, teams and tools, to carry forward the blast; and that half the iron made, from day to day, was to be delivered to Edsall, until the amount of iron received should equal the amount that he had bought the personal property in for; when the balance of all that personal: property was to be set over to witness individually. Wc proceeded to use the stock and to deliver iron from day to day. Afterwards a written consent was given by witness, that the iron Edsall had received and should receive under that verbal contract, might be applied by him to the credit of the Hamburgh Co. The iron spoken of, as delivered under those agreements, witness supposes amounted to seventy or eighty tons, arid which is the same parcel of iron above spoken of by witness. The written agreement spoken of by witness was brought to witness by Edsall and Hamilton; and that was a consent on witness\u2019s part that Edsall might apply the iron as above described. The paper was presented to witness at Hamburgh, and he signed it, and Hamilton signed it as a witness. Witness and Edsall have not been on sociable terms formerly. He had a suit against me. We are now on good terms. Witness is not sensible of any feelings that would influence his testimony against Edsall.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-3\"><em>Joseph M. Brown, </em>for the complainants. In December, 1838, he was one of the firm of Brown and Lewis; that firm was creditor of the Hamburgh Co. and also of the Clinton Co. at that time; the firm was one of the party to an agreement between the creditors of the Hamburgh Co. The creditors had a meeting, at which witness was present. Pratt was there. Before the property was sold, there was an agreement that it should be set up and sold under an execution which Brown and Lewis had against the Clinton Co. The written agreement was drawn up at Mr. Haines\u2019s office in Hamburgh. Previous to the sale by the sheriff, there was no written agreement with Pratt by the creditors; but as far -as witness understood, Pratt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>had -the right to redeem the property if he complied with an agreement which was to be -executed after the sale. The firm of Brown and Lewis had a judgment against the Clinton Co., and under that judgment an execution was issued, and under that execution the ore bed was advertised to he sold. Witness saw Pratt in New-York; Pratt wished witness-to adjourn the sale. Witness replied that he was only one of the firm of Brown and Lewis, and could not adjourn it without Lewis\u2019s consent; but if he could adjourn it, he would be willing to do so, provided he could be satisfied the money would he paid. Pratt then wished witness-to go to Hamburgh with him; and witness consented-to do so after Pratt had referred him to Morris Robinson, and Silas M. Stillwell, and W. C. Boardman, who gave witness the strongest assurances the money would.be raised by a loan. Witness went to Hamburgh with Pratt in company with Nones. When witness got there, inquiries -were made of him respecting the prospects of raising the money. He replied that Pratt had failed to raise the money, and wanted a still further adjournment, if it could be obtained. Some of the creditors told witness it would be all folly to wait-any longer, as the sale had been adjourned two or three times already. About this time the proposition of Mr. Ryerson was made. Ryerson proposed that, if the property could be so arranged as -to be security to him, he would undertake to raise the money. It was .then suggested, either by some of the creditors, or by Ryerson, or Mr. Haines, that the property should he sold and bought in by L\u2019Hommedieu, for the purpose of perfecting the title in L\u2019Hommedieu, in order that he might make a legal incumbrance on it as security to Ryerson. Witness then suggested, that .in case it was sold, Nones might buy it in. He thinks about this time he was asked by some of the creditors if he knew Nones, who he was, and what he was, and whether he had any thing to buy it in with or not. Witness replied, as near as he recollects, that he knew little or nothing about Nones, except that he had seen him at his brother\u2019s office'a few-times-; and that when about leaving .the office to go to Hamburgh, Pratt and witness stood near the door Of the hall, when witness inquired of Pratt what he was waiting for; who replied that Nones was waiting for his brother to get same money. Mr. <em>J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>B. Nones came in and gave his brother some money, but what amount witness does not know, and then Pratt replied they were ready to go. It was talked over then among the creditors that it might be Nones had the money to buy it; and .then Haines suggested it should be made known to Pratt in some way what Ryerson had proposed to do, and why it was advisable to have the property sold. This was to prevent Nones\u2019s buying the property and frustrating the arrangement. These matters were communicated to Pratt. Witness does not know whether Pratt interfered to prevent Nones from bidding; but Pratt and Nones were talking together ; the sale was then adjourned for a day or two to Newton. Witness supposed the adjournment was made to give the creditors time to perfect the arrangement, because there was but little time left, and it was feared Nones would buy it in. Witness did not understand that Pratt was to remain in possession of the property. L\u2019Hommedieu was to become the purchaser, and take the title and possession of the property, and then he was to make a bond and mortgage to David Ryerson -to secure the payment of a loan ; and L\u2019Hommedieu ivas to give Pratt a lease of the property. Witness understood Pratt was to have the right of redeeming the property, on complying with that lease. Witness had not, and presumes no creditor had, any object in view except to secure their debts. This understanding was had previous to the sale, and to keep Nones from bidding. It was understood that L\u2019Hommedieu was to act as trustee for the creditors. He understood that if Pratt had effected his loan in New-Yorb, the title would have been in Pratt in fee simple, with no incumbrance but the mortgage upon it; but as it was, L\u2019Hommedieu would hold the property, to be deeded back by L\u2019Hommedieu to Pratt, when Pratt complied with the agreement entered into with L\u2019Hommedieu. Edsall and L\u2019Hommedieu have both told witness they were in possession of the property. L\u2019Hommedieu has never rendered any account of his trust, and never offered to do so to witness. Witness called upon L\u2019Hommedieu two or three times to bring the matter to a close. L\u2019Hommedieu offered to buy witness\u2019s claim, and offered him fifty cents; and Edsall also offered to buy at fifty cents. Two years ago this summer, Edsall met witness in Broadway, and offered him twenty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>five cents for -\u2019his claim. At first, witness, when in Broadway, offered to take fifty cents, and Edsall offered twenty-five. At the time of the sale of ;the property, witness had an opinion as to the value of it. He thought if the ore bed turned out as it was expected, it would be -worth $20,000. He formed his opinion from Mr. Fowler\u2019s opinion, who thought if it held out as it looked, it would be worth ten or .fifteen thousand dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-3\"><em>Cross-examined. </em>The;agreement, as witness understood it, was that L\u2019Hommedieu was to buy in the property, as trustee for the creditors, and to raise-money upon it, .if he could, sufficient to pay off the creditors; and witness felt sanguine, from what Ryerson said, that the money would be raised, without any ifs or ands about it. He understood-Ryerson to say, that if a legal incumbrance could be given on the property, he had no hesitation in saying a loan of that kind could be raised; -and Ryerson said, he had about $6000 in \u25a0his hands, and had no doubt he could raise the rest through his friends in New-York. Ryerson expressed his surprise that Pratt had not been able to make the loan. He recollects that a majority of the creditors refused to give Pratt the refusal of the lease in the cohtract drawn up and signed by the creditors. When witness called upon L\u2019Hommedieu, he wished L\u2019Hommedieu to show him a statement of what he had done in relation to settling up the affairs of the Ham-burgh Company. 'L\u2019Hommedieu said they would have to call upon the creditors for an assessment, -to pay up some debts against the property. Witness told L\u2019Hommedieu he wanted him to make out his statement -and bring the matter to a close, and witness was ready and willing to pay his share, in proportion to the debts witness held against the company. Witness does not know that ;the creditors or company had any objections against L\u2019Hommedieu and Edsall\u2019s taking possession of the property and putting it into operation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-4\"><em>Direct examination resumed. </em>Mr. Haines, as counsel for some of the creditors, objected to its being put into this agreement that Pratt should have the refusal of the lease, because, he said, it would show an agreement between the creditors and Pratt, and let in the New-York creditors through the court of chancery.

Is acquainted with Pratt, one of the complainants, and has been since about the time he became connected with the Hamburgh Co. Has done business as an attorney both for and against the said company, and became familiar with their affairs while they were carrying on operations at Hamburgh. After Pratt became concerned in the Clinton Co. he acted as attorney for them, and became familiarly acquainted with their business and affairs. At the instance of Pratt and other persons interested in the said companies, he entered appearances for them in- mostly all the- suits brought against them respectively, in all to which they appeared, except in the suits brought against the said Hamburgh Co. by Joseph E. Edsall and John Givans, in which cases he was-employed for the plaintiffs. Soon after Pratt became interested in the said companies, many suits were brought against them, in which judgments were afterwards obtained and executions issued to a considerable amount, and by virtue of which the sheriff advertised the property of the said companies in the county of Sussex to be sold. The'property of the said Clinton-Co. in the county of Sussex, being a tract called the mine farm, which was adjourned for several months, until December 7th, 1838, at the instance of Pratt, to enable the said company, if possible, to meet the demanda against them, or make some arrangement. The real estate of the Hamburgh Co. was advertised to be sold on the 14th' of December, 1838; and certain5 creditors of the Hamburgh Co. (for some of whom he acted as attorney,) having large demands against said company, and' believing that the said real estate of the said companies would5 be sold by the sheriff, to prevent a sacrifice of the property, and to endeavor to secure their claims against said Hamburgh Co.,entered into an agreement among themselves to buy in the property of the said company, and also the said* mine tract of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Clinton Co., in order to supply the furnace on the said Ham-burgh Co. property with ore; which agreement was finally concluded by the said cr\u00e9ditos, and reduced to writing by me, at their request, and signed by the parties thereto, on the 7th of December, 1838, a copy of which is set forth in the complainants\u2019 bill; he was present when the object and terms of the said agreement were talked over and agreed upon, and signed the agreement- as attorney for one of the creditors; and, so far as his knowledge and belief extends, the said agreement-was not entered into in pursuance .of any arrangement or agreement with Pratt, nor had he any part or interest in the same, either in his own behalf or the said company\u2019s; nor was there any offer or engagement on the part of David Ryerson to procure a loan. Ryerson told the creditors, (who doubted their ability to raise money to effect the purchase and carry oil the business,) that he would-aid them in endeavoring to raise money for that purpose. The creditors, mostly, were averse to\u201ccarryingf on the furnace themselves, and therefore authorized their trustee, in the agreement, to lease the same, and to make sale of the same also, if possible, for an amount sufficient to secure their debts. He recollects at the time that Pratt made propositions as to how he would lease the premises, and wanted the creditors, in case they became the purchasers, to give him the refusal of the same; but the majority of the creditors expressly refused to give him the refusal of the lease, and were at that'time opposed to his having the same, believing, as they said,- that they could get the premises in the hands of a more efficient man. After the property had been bought in by the trustee of the creditors some little time, Pratt assured them that if they-'would give him a lease of the premises and contract for sale, for $30,000, he had friends in New-York who would assist him, and he would be able to raise the money; the creditors, not knowing what better to do with the premises, gave him the lease and contract for sale set forth in the complainants\u2019 bill. From this time on, until D\u2019Hommedieu and Edsall entered into possession of the premises, they were mostly unused and unoccupied. In January, 1839, part of the dam gave way, and the waters carried away part of the floom, and otherwise injured the premises. .The creditors felt alarmed for the safety of the property, but forbore to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>act in the matter until May following, when Pratt was confined in Newark jail; Daniel Haines, Esq. and myself, on behalf of the creditors, went to the said jail and saw him about the middle of May, and inquired of him what he expected to do, and whether he had any objections to the creditors taking possession ; and Pratt then stated to us, that he had given up all idea of doing any thing with the property, and that he relinquished all claim to the same, and said that the creditors might have taken possession before then, for he had relinquished the idea of doing any thing with the property for some time previous. In June following, none of the other creditors being desirous or willing to carry on the furnace, L\u2019Hommcdieu and Edsail, by the consent of the other creditors, as 1 have always understood and believe, commenced patting the furnace in blast, rebuilt the dam, repaired the premises, and have been in possession ever since, Since they have been in possession, 1 have been present at one conversation between Pratt and Edsail, in which Pratt was negotiating for the re-purchase of the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-3\"><em>William W.

In the conversations referred to, L\u2019Hommedieu stated that he was agent for the company and the creditors, and that he had bought the property in trust for the company and creditors of the said company, and that one of the objects of the sale was to secure a loan of twenty or thiz-ty thousand dollars; what originated the conversation was, that witness had a claim of about $100 against the coznpany, and he called upon L\u2019Hommedieu respecting it, who stated that he knew nothing about it, that he .was trustee for the company and the creditors only.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-6\"><em>Cross-examined. </em>Witness is positive that L\u2019Hommedieu ' stated that he was acting as trustee for the company and the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>creditors of the company, as the property, he said, was to <em>go </em>back to the company, if the arrangement between it and the creditors thereof was carried out; witness cannot say what that arrangement was; he understood that Pratt had or was to have a lease of it.

Witness understood from this conversation, that the company was to Slave the property Lack, if they complied with certain conditions.

I recollect being at Hamburgh, at one time, when the property was advertised for sale, and several of the creditors of the Hamburgh Co. were present. It was the day before the mine property was sold at Newton. I went to Hamburgh to attend the sale: the sale did not take place that day, but was adjourned over until the next day, at Newton. My object in attending the sale was to aid, if I could, in any way, the creditors, to get them secured. Several of the creditors about Hamburgh were particular friends of mino. I supposed their claims were in danger. I understood that some arrangements were made amongst tiie creditors, for the purpose of protecting themselves from loss ; and 1 understood that L\u2019Hommedieu was to purchase the property in trust for the benefit of the creditors ; and I understood, or was under the impression, that Pratt was also consulted on the occasion, and understood the arrangements that were made; he was there, and 1 saw him conversing with Edsali, and \u00cd supposed about the arrangements. I understood the adjournment was made for the purpose of enabling the creditors to perfect their arrangements. I know that the creditors talked of making a loan, for the purpose of paying off the debts of the company, and I told them that I would try and assist them in making tlie loan; and I think 1 went so far as to tell some of them, that I thought a loan might he obtained. I am not certain now as to the amount that was required to be raised by that loan ; I think somewhere about $30,000. The loan was wanted for the pur <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>pose of paying debts or demands against the property. When I made the proposition, or suggested the probability of their obtaining a loan, I told the creditors there that I supposed it would be absolutely necessary for them to pledge their own personal responsibility for the amount that would be required, and that they would have to make satisfactory security to the person who should loan the money. I think I never stated in the presence of Edsall or Pratt, or of any of the .creditors, that I would procure the loan for them, or that the money should be advanced as soon as the property was sold. I don\u2019t know that I would have advanced that amount upon the property if I had had it; but I had not any such amount to advance, if I had had a desire to do it. I never made that as a condition, if the property should be sold. I think I never did agree to advance the money to <em>the </em>purchaser of the property, to be secured by a mortgage upon the same, upon the condition that the creditors would execute an agreement to\u201d be responsible to the mortgagee. for any loss that might be sustained on account of the loan, in proportion to their several claims. I am not acquainted with Aaron B. Nones, but I think there was a person of that name at Hamburgh, at the time spoken of, and that 1 saw the same gentleman at Newton the next day, at the sale ; I have no recollection of having had any conversation with him at any time about this business. To my recollection, I never told Aaron B. Nones that I was to loan, or was to procure a loan of $30,000; I think I never told him so; I am very confident I never could have told him that I was going to loan the $30,000 myself, for I had no such sum at my command. I have no recollection of ever having any conversation with Nones upon the subject; I certainly never told him that I would make such loan myself, for I had no such sum to loan. I think 1 stated publicly, in the presence of the creditors and others, and it is probable that Nones was present, that such a loan might possibly be procured, and that I would endeavor to aid them in procuring such a loan. I had no knowledge, at that time, of any money that' could be <em>got </em>for .that purpose. 1 did afterwards,, at the request.of the creditors, make some efforts to get this loan. I went to New-York, and spent some time there for the purpose of ascertaining whether the money could be had or not. Upon reflection, I think, when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>subject of procuring the loan was mentioned, it was understood that Pratt was to receive a portion of it, for the purpose of putting the furnace in blast. I think this was the understanding between the creditors and Pratt, and that some of the principal creditors so informed me. The agreement the creditors had upon the subject was reduced to writing. I am not certain that I saw the writing, but think 1 did ; and that the adjournment was made for the purpose of getting time to prepare the writing. I did afterwards myself loan to L\u2019I\u00edominedieu \u00a73000, to pay on account of the purchase of the property made by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-4\"><em>Cross-examined. </em>In reference to this business, the matters are not strongly impressed upon my memory, for, at the time, I did not suppose I should be called to testify about it, and I find that my memory is not now as good as it formerly was; at the time spoken of, there appeared to be a perfect understanding between the creditors and Pratt, hut as to particulars I cannot speak; I think, however, that it was understood that a part of the money <em>to bo </em>procured was to go to Pratt, oj some other person, for the purpose of carrying on the works, and by that means enable them to pay the debts due from the company ; my impression is, that part of the money to be loaned was to be applied for the purpose of carrying on the -works, and it was the insistment of Pratt that he was to have the management of <em>it; </em>and after some conversation apart, between Edsall and Pratt, I think Pratt insisted or desired that there should he some memorandum of the agreement between them made, and that it should not rest in mere parol; to which I think Edsall replied, that he would have to abide by it as it then was, or something to -that effect. I do not recollect that any reason was given by Edsall at the time. At the time of the sale I understoed that L\u2019Hommedieu purchased the property for the benefit of the creditors, and was to hold it in trust for them until the debts and claims against the company were liquidated and settled. I know nothing of any reversionary interest in Pratt or any one else. I understood that there was a written agreement between L\u2019Hommedieu and the creditors upon this subject; but whether Pratt is a party to it or not I do not know.

I had a conversation with L\u2019Hommedieu before I began to work there for him and Edsall. I carried my claim in to L\u2019Hommedieu, \u2022 against \u00a1the&lt; Hamburgh Co,, to know when he could give me some money upon \u00a1it. I cannot say in how long a time he said it would be before he could give me some money upon it; it was but a short time that he took; he said he expected to receive some money from Mr. Ryerson. I called three or four times, but did not get any money from him. At one time my family was a good ways from here, and I called on him for some, as I calculated to go home, and he said he had not raised the money on the Hamburgh .property that he expected. I asked him if Ryerson did not agree, or was not to advance money to pay on the debt, or -the debts; 1 did not understand whether all or a part of the debts -were to be paid. He said that was the understanding, that Ryerson was to raise some money, or advance some money, but had not done it. I then asked him if he had not the Hamburgh property in 'hand for the purpose of raising money on it. He said he held it as trustee for Pratt and the creditors. He spoke of its being hard times, and wished to know from me if I could tell him where he could find a man that would loan money on the property. I was at Ham-burgh once when Ryerson was there, and heard him say he would advance money to assist in paying the debts.

He cannot say that he is certain his claim will be in a better situation if Pratt succeeds in this suit, than it is at present; he has not seen Pratt very frequently since this suit has been commenced ; but when he has seen him they have <em>spoken </em>about the Hamburgh affairs ; and Pratt has spoken about his rights or claims to the property, and witness thinks he has told him what he knew about it, and-what he could testify to.

Was acquainted with the Hamburgh Co. and transacted business with them when they were engaged in carrying on the works here. <em>(This witness is objected to by the complainants, as being a party to this suit.) </em>At a meeting had by their creditors, at one time, witness thinks it was estimated that the company owed to the amount of $30,000. This was some time before the sale of their property; some three or four months, perhaps. There were several adjournments after the meeting, and before the sales, witness thinks. When the creditors met, they concluded if they could not get the benefit of the mine property, that the property of. the company would not be sufficient to secure the debts, and therefore they appointed L\u2019Hommedieu as their agent, to buy the mine property. There was an agreement, as witness understood, finally concluded amongst the creditors of the Hamburgh Co., that L\u2019Hommedieu should purchase the mine property for their use, and also the Hamburgh property. Witness was one of the creditors, and one of the parties to that agreement. The object of purchasing in that property was, to have the control of it, so as to save their debts. The sales of the property were adjourned several times, and,- as witness understood, at the request of Pratt, who it was said had proposed or suggested that he could procure means that would save the necessity of the sale. Witness does not know that he heard Pratt say this, but at one of the adjournments he heard Pratt say that he had $17,000 in escrow, which would be forthcom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Ing in a little time.

Witnoai tinder-stood at the time, from some persona there, that if the property was purchased in for the use of the creditors, and the title could be made secure, David Ryerson had said he would aid and assist, or do what he could to assist them in procuring a loan for the purpose. Witness thinks he did not hear Ryerson say any thing himself on the subject,. The loan, as he understood, was to be for the amount of the debts, which wao about $30,01)0, Witness does not know that he heard Ryerson say that the personal responsibility of the creditors would bo required to obtain the loan, but that was said by somebody. Witness made up his mind that he would not give his joint responsibility, but would give his own responsibility for the amount be might receive. The object of procuring the loan was, as he uaderstood it, to pay the claims of the creditors, He thinks be understood there was a tease of the property made to Pratt by L\u2019Mommedieu, and a contract for a sale to him of the premises, Witness: thinks he saw the lease; he thinks he was present when it was) made, and there was some difficulty about, it; ho understood that Pratt wattled more of the proceeds resulting from the blast or the works to enable him to carry them on, and less of them to be applied towards liquidating the debts, \"Witness recollects at one time it was proposed by some one, that a lease should be made of the property to Joseph II. Pettis, or to Franklin Holcombe, but to this Pratt objected, staling that they were his hirelings, and he would not consent <em>to </em>it. Witness does not know who were Pratt\u2019s agents after he took the lease; there were several persons there who said they were his agents. It most have been, several mouths after tho lease was made to Pratt, before L-\u2019Hommedieu and Iklsall took possession of the works; during that time they were idle.

Some time before the sale, the creditors began to think they would not get their money. The creditors, before the sale, had several meetings to concert some measures by which to secure their debts. There was finally an arrangement made by them to buy in the property at the sheriff\u2019s <em>sale; </em>the arrangement made was to buy in the mine property with the furnace property. Witness thinks the talk was, that it' was deemed of importance to have that bought in with the other to secure their money, and they appointed L\u2019Hommedieu as- their trustee, to buy in the property for them. Witness was at Hamburgh the day before the property was sold at Newton, and he was also at Newton the next day, when the property was sold. L\u2019Hommedieu was appointed trustee to purchase the property solely for the creditors. Witness never understood that Pratt was to have any interest in the purchase, or any other person except the creditors, to his knowing. The understanding was, at the time, that if the creditors purchased in the property, they would endeavor to raise money upon the property to pay the debts. Witness recollects that David Ryerson ivas at Hamburgh the day before the sale, and said that if the creditors would purchase in the property, he would endeavor to assist them in raising the money, and he spoke of one or two places where he thought <em>the </em>money migh't be obtained. They, the creditors, failed to raise the money. Ryerson said that it would be necessary for the creditors to give their own responsibility to enable them to raise the money. After L\u2019Hommedieu purchased- the property,, witness recollects something about a lease and contract being made out from him to Pratt; he, as one of the creditors, ivas consulted about the terms of it. There were a number of creditors together on that occasion, and consulted upon the subject. Something was said about the prices of the wood and ore that he waste pay, and there was a difficulty also about some money that Pratt wanted the creditors to raise for him, to help him along with ' the works; there was also a difficulty about some money re.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>qu\u00edred by Pratt to be raised by the creditors for him, to aid him in putting the works in operation. At first the creditors refused to raise any money for him, but afterwards we agreed to advance come, but a difficulty then arose as to the way in which it should be paid in ; the creditors were willing only to pay in in small sums, as he went along with the works, and not to pay in the whole amount required by him. It was finally settled, however, and a lease, witness thinks, was made to him by L\u2019Hommcdieu. There was difficulty also, he thinks, about the amount of the yearly payments that were to be made by Pratt, but he cannot state what the difficulty was exactly. There were a good many of the creditors then opposed to driving on the works by themselves. Witness thinks after Pratt got file lease there were some stones drawn there by some of his hands, for the purpose of repairs, but nothing more was done, and the property laid idle through the course of that winter and spring, until L\u2019Uommedieu and Edsali took the possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-3\"><em>Cross-examinalion. </em>'L\u2019Hoimnedieu paid witness fifty cents on the dollar on the amount of his claim ; he gave his note for it. Witness does not recollect whether there was any thing said about a lease to Pratt on the day before the sale; he thinks there was something said about it at Newton, on the day of the sale : it was understood at that time that Pratt was to have a lease of the property; it was so talked among the creditors. Witness does not recollect of any reason being given at that time why the agreement was not then executed ; he does not recollect that Pratt was desirous this should be done before the sale; lie does not know that he was, or was not.

Be thinks that Mr. .Ryerson spoke also at Newton of assisting to raise the .money; he does not know but what it was talked at Newton about raising money for Pratt, to enable him to carry on the works. He thinks all these arrangements were talked over at Newton on the day of the sale. He understood the object of raising that loan was to assist Pratt, so as to enable him to put the works in order. He understood that the creditors were to assist in raising for Pratt the money required to put the works in operation; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>each one was to -pay his proportion. He thinks $1500 was the sum that Pratt wanted. -The money spoken of to be raised by the assistance of Ityerson, was to go to pay off the claims of the creditors, as he understood; that also was talked of at Newton. It was understood, if -this loan was obtained, -that whatever the property sold for, less than -the amount borrowed, the creditors were.to make up the deficiency; the property was to foe mortgaged for the amount borrowed, and if it was not worth \u25a0it, we were to make up the difference.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-3\"><em>In chief. </em>Witness meant, by the loan to assist Pratt, the money that was to he advanced to him by the creditors, as-mentioned in the l\u00e9ase.

He made contracts of purchases for them, and managed their business here. The creditors of the company about then manifested a good deal of anxiety about the safety of their claims; a good many of them considered their money very doubtful; and he heard a number of them so express themselves. After Pratt had the lease, witness thinks he heard it from some quarter, but does not recollect that he heard it from Pratt, that he, Pratt, was to get some man in New-York to purchase the property, and witness understood that Pratt and L\u2019Hommedieu had gone to New-York for that purpose. Witness thinks the balance that was coming'to him from the company was about forty-four dollars. One day he saw L\u2019Hommedieu at the store, who offered fifty cents on the dollar for the claim; witness told him he would take it; he then said he had not the money by him, but would pay in a short time. Witness -never made a transfer of the claim to L\u2019Hommedieu. He thinks he has heard it talked of among the small creditors of the company, that they were afraid of losing their claims entirely, by reason of the many larger claims, which, he understood, many of them, were liens by mortgages, and therefore they were anxious to have the property purchased in, for the common benefit of all. His understanding was, that the smaller creditors were fearful of losing their claims, if a sale of the property was made without some such arrangement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-4\"><em>Joseph Sharp, </em>for the complainants.

David Ryerson was there the first day, but not the second, as witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>recollects. Witness had a mortgage at that time on a part of the property. There was a good deal of talk among the creditors at the time. Witness went into the room, and Ryerson, Edsall, ] JHommedieu and Pratt were all in there together. A little while after Pratt came out, and there was a general talk out in the other room amongst the creditors, and, as witness was concerned, he was talking with them; and it was talked of making an arrangement with Ryerson for a loan, as he understood, of about $30,000; $4000 of the sum was to go to Pratt to carry <em>on </em>the business; and the same time, as he understood it, the money was to go to pay off the general creditors, it appears there was an adjournment, and something was to be done at Newton at the day'to which the adjournment was-made. At the time of the sale witness attended again. Whilst the sale was going on, he was told by the creditors, that it was agreed that L\u2019ilommedieu should buy the property, for the benefit of the creditors and the company ; he was to buy the property, as witness understood, as trustee. Witness had an intention to buy the lot that was subject to his mortgage. He did not buy, because he understood it was to be bought in for the benefit of Pratt and the rest of the creditors, and because Pratt was to have $4000, as witness understood, to go on with, and he was willing he should have it.

Witness was present at several meetings of the creditors after the sale, to consult and determine what disposition to make of the property, as Pratt did not, comply with the lease j these meetings were after Pratt had failed to comply with the article and lease given to him by the trustee. Pratt did not do any thing about the premises towards putting them in operation, after he got the lease; the dam, or a part of it, had in the mean time gone away, and the property was unoccupied. It was while the property was in this situation that the creditors had the meetings spoken of. Witness heard several of them intimate that they would rather lose their debt than have any thing to do with driving the furnace. There was a meeting of the creditors just before L\u2019Hommedieu and Edsall took possession. Witness thinks he heard it reported, by Mr. Haines, or some one else, at that meeting, that he had seen Pratt, and that he had given up all hope of doing any thing. He understood that Mr. Haines had been requested by the creditors to see Pratt. At the last meeting of the creditors before L\u2019Hommedieu and Edsall took possession of the property, the creditors were desirous that they should do so, and appeared to be very anxious that they should go on. WThen they commenced to drive the works they furnished and provided every thing with their own means, and have done so ever since. Witness heard Mr. Abram Walker, who was the agent of Pratt, say the day before he left the furnace, and after Pratt had got the lease, and in the month of February'or March, that he was going to abandon the concern, as there was not any prospect of Pratt\u2019s doing any thing. Walker went from here to New-York. Witness thinks he recollects of Pratt\u2019s representing about the time he got a lease for the property, that he had a man in New-York who would buy the property; the creditors were kept ur suspense for some time by these representations of Pratt that he was making efforts to sell the property and raise money ; he fixed time after time when it would be accomplished, every week or every ftvo weeks that somebody would be up, according to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>his talk.

Resided at Hamburgh while the Hamburgh Company were carrying on business. Was a creditor of the company, as one of the firm of Brown and Lewis ; they owed us at the close of their company concerns, between twelve and thirteen hundred dollars. At the time witness made an assignment of his part of the claim to L\u2019Hommedieu, the whole debt was upwards of thirteen hundred dollars. He recollects a meeting of the creditors in Hamburgh, about the time the mine property was advertised to be sold ; the sale of this property was adjourned from time to time. The claims against the company were, witness believes, generally considered very doubtful at that time; he thinks the debts of the company were estimated at that time to be over $30,000. This estimate did not include the city debts-, but was made up of the debts in the country; it was -made with the assistance of Pratt, or some of the agents of the company. One of the executions, by virtue of which the mine property was sold, was, witness believes, in favor of Brown and Lewis. The creditors were desirous of purchasing in the mine farm in connexion with the furnace, so as. to make them more valuable, and secure -their debts; for the purpose of buying in that property, B\u2019Hommedieu was appointed the trustee of the creditors, as he understood it. After the sale of the property, when the lease was about to be made out to Pratt, witness was consulted as one of the creditors about the terms of the lease; there was also a contract of purchase given to Pratt, as he believes. He does not think that Pratt did any thing at the furnace after he got the lease; the dam went away shortly after. Witness recollects of his professing that he was about to raise money on the property, after he got the lease; and understood from him that be had a man in New-York from whom, he could raise the money. Pratt kept the creditors in suspense during the winter and spring, under the expectation that he would raise money on this property for the creditors. Witness recollects of L\u2019Hommedieu starting to go to New-York with Pratt, to aid him in effecting this arrangement; on his return, L\u2019Hommedieu reported to thS creditors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>that Pratt ivas arrested and confined in jail. The creditors met several times afterwards, to consult what to do with the proper - ty ; the majority of them were averse to embarking in the bu-. siness; witness was strongly opposed to it; he stated at the time that he should prefer losing his debt rather than for the creditors to embark in the business and spend any more money oil the property, and he should be of the same opinion now. There was a proposition made at the time for the creditors to join and carry on the works; witness-never heard any objections to any one who pleased taking the works and going on with them; he himself had none. At this time he should not value this property, including the mine occupied by Edsall and L\u2019Hommedieu, at more than $20,000; he should think it would not sell for as much as that at this time-; he has never considered this property, since the failure of the company, or at the time of the sale, worth $30,000. Witness presumes that any understanding which the creditors had made with Pratt, was carried out with him in the contract and lease made with him, and that they gave him every indulgence, as long as there was any hope of his doing any thing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-3\"><em>Benjamin </em>Hamilton, for the defendants.

The reason why the sale of the said property was adjourned from Hamburgh to Newton, was, that at Hamburgh, on the day the sale was to take place, the creditors and persons interested in the sale, agreed to adjourn it till the next day. There was a good deal of negotiation be \u2022 tween the creditors and the company; there was a meeting on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>that day between the creditors and Pratt, at the tavern in Ham-burgh.

In pursuance of this arrangement the sale was adjourned to Newton, and Mr. Ryerson informed the parties that he -could not effect, the loan; and then further negotiations on the -subject took place; the sale was adjourned there once or twice. It was his understanding, that it was agreed that L\u2019Hommedieu should purchase the property; but in what capacity, whether as trustee or not, he^cannot say, only it is his impression that Pratt was to have a lease of the property back. Witness was anxious, as one of the parties interested, to have Holcombe\u2019s name inserted in the lease with Pratt\u2019s. At the time the sale was to take place, witness asked L\u2019Hommedieu whether the lease was to be made to Holcombe, or to Pratt and Holcombe; and witness being informed that it was to be given to Pratt alone,'he informed L\u2019Hommedieu that, he should then bid on the property; and witness accordingly made two or three bids on it; he was then taken out by some of the parties interested, who stated to him that he was injuring himself and his interests, and from their representations he ceased bidding; he cannot recollect who it was that spoke to him. Witness understood that L\u2019Hommedieu was to buy the property, as well for the benefit of the company as for the creditors, and that Pratt was to have a lease of the same. At the time these negotiations were going on, a question arose whether an agreement to execute a lease to any person, before a sale took place, would be valid, and there was some disagreement, on the subject; the lease, however, witness thinks, was executed after the sale. It was a part of the arrangement at Hamburgh, that L\u2019Hommedieu should buy the property in order that Ryerson should obtain a loan on it, as above alluded to. Witness\u2019s impression is, that during the negotiations at Hamburgh and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Newton, it was understood that L\u2019Hommcdieu was to buy the property for the benefit of the company and the creditors of the company, and that he was to act in a capacity for the benefit of both ; and witness is confirmed in that belief from the circumstance, that on former occasions L\u2019Hommedieu had acted in that capacity. Witness understood at the time, that after the debts of the company were paid, the property was to revert to the company; his impression is, that such was the general understanding among all the parties interested, both the creditors and the company. The sale was made, witness thinks, at Newton, in consequence of a similar arrangement, to that entered into at Hamburgh; but Eyerson not being able to make the loan, the property was sold at Newton, t\u00a9. L\u2019Hommcdieu, both for the benefit of the creditors and the company. The desire appeared among all to be, that the creditors should be paid, and that the company should go on.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b311-4\"><em>B.

That Edsall took possession as mortgagee; and that L\u2019Hommedieu, afterwards, as purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale, and as trustee for the creditors, took possession of the premises not included in Edsall\u2019s mortgage, and also of the Clinton mine farm; and that they, afterwards, agreed to unite in putting the property in repair and the furnace in blast, and in carrying on the business. L\u2019Hommedieu admits he bought the Clinton mine farm and the property of the Hamburgh Company, at the sheriff\u2019s sale, under the powers and instructions, and for the sole purposes stated in the agreement of December 7th, 1838, and as trustee for <em>the </em>creditors therein named. Edsall, then, is accountable for <em>the </em>rents and profits of what he is in possession of; and- unless something has taken place to divest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>the right of the Hamburgh Company and vest it in another, he is accountable to them. And L\u2019Hommedieu holds subject to account as trustee, and to be called upon to convey to the beneficial owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\">But these defendants deny that they, or either of them, are subject to account to the complainants, or either of them, or that the complainants, or either of them, have any right to redeem; and say,- that the persons entitled to redeem, as against Edsall, and to call L\u2019Hommedieu to account as trustee, are certain creditors of the Hamburgh Company, including L\u2019Hommedieu and Edsall, who entered into the agreement of December 7th, 1838,- for the purchase of the property by L\u2019Hommedieu as their trustee, at the sheriff\u2019s sale. This is so, if that sale can be sustained in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">On and before December 7th, 1838, the sheriff of Sussex had in his hands against the Clinton Manufacturing Company a fi. fa. issued out of the common-pleas of Sussex, in favor of Robert Lewis and Joseph M. Brown, for $1008 27, and an execution from chancery, in favor of Nathan Smith, on a decree on a foreclosure bill, dated March 25th, 1836, for the sale of so much of the\u2019 mortgaged premises as would be sufficient to pay the amount of the decree and costs. Under these two executions the sheriff had advertised the Clinton mine farm, containing one hundred and nine acres and fifty-seven hundredths, and the sale stood adjourned to the said 7th of December, 1838. There was due on the two executions, including interest, costs and sheriff\u2019s fees, but about $3500; and the incumbrance on which the decree in chancery was founded was the first incumbrance; so that the purchaser at that sale would get a clear title. Both L\u2019Hommedieu and Edsall had valued this mine farm, about a month before, at $50,000, as appears by certificates under their hands, given in evidence. On this mine farm Edsall held a subsequent mortgage, dated January 10th, 1838, for $4000. This farm was sold, at said sheriff\u2019s sale, for $4041.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The same sheriff had in his hands, at the same time, five executions, on judgments at law, against the property of the Hamburgh Company, on which he had also advertised their property for sale, viz.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>X E.

But how would the purchase of the Clinton Company\u2019s mine help pay the debts of the Hamburgh creditors, if it was bought at its fair value ?</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">This part of the answer further says, that the debts and Incumbrances against the Hamburgh property, to the best of the knowledge and belief, &amp;c., exceeded \u00a730,000, and that the debts of the Clinton Company existing as liens on the Clinton mine tract, exceeded \u00a710,000. What liad the liens on- the Clinton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>mine tract to do with the Hamburgh creditors ? And how is the amount of liens on the Clinton mine tract to account for tho hid at which it was struck' off, it being sold on a decree on the first incumbrance?</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\">Again, as to the Hamburgh <em>lands, </em>the answer says* the debts and incumbrances against the Hamburgh Company exceeded $30,000. What were the incumbrances to which they would be subject in the hands of the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s <em>sale </em>? The answer does not tell us.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The plain meaning of the arrangement made by those of the Hamburgh creditors who entered into the agreement of December <em>7, </em>1838* was, that-the Clinton mine farm was to be bought as a means of securing their debts against the Hamburgh Company ; which necessarily carries the idea that it was <em>to be </em>bought for less than it was worth; and prepares us against surprize from- the testimony showing the means taken to prevent competition at the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The agreement of December <em>7, </em>1838, is signed by L\u2019Hommedieu for himself and as trustee, and by Edsall for himself and William Riggs, and by eighteen other creditors of <em>the </em>Hamburgh Company, by themselves, their attornies or assignees. Edsall held, at the time, a subsequent mortgage on the Clinton mine farm, which would be cut off by the sale. Would he have suffered this mine farm, of the value of which his own estimate was $50,000, to be struck off to another, or to a trustee for these Hamburgh creditors, for $4041, without some arrangement by which his subsequent mortgage was to be provided for? Certainly not. And accordingly, the agreement itself authorizes the trustee, who was to buy at the sheriff\u2019s sale free from this mortgage, to purchase and procure it from Edsall; and authorizes the trustee to raise, by bond and mortgage on the properties to be-purchased, after they should be purchased by <em>him </em>for the said creditors* sufficient moneys to pay the purchase money thereof, and also sufficient to purchase and pay for the two Winslow mortgages and the Sharp mortgage on <em>the </em>Ham-burgh property. And it appears, by an indorsement oh the back of the Edsall mortgage, dated December 10th, 1838, two or three days after the sale of the Clinton property to L\u2019Hommedieu, the said trustee, that Edsall assigned his said mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>gage, and the bond it was given to secure, to L\u2019Hommedieu, for $4220, acknowledged to have been received by him from L\u2019Rommedieu. By this arrangement Edsall was silenced as a bidder, and it carries on its face an admission of these agreeing creditors, that they coaid pay, at least, 68200 for the Clinton inioe tract, and that its value beyond that would he a means of securing\u2019 their debts against the Hamburgh Company. Bat what is the effect, beyond this, of this transaction, on the Clinton Company and its creditors ? It is this: the Clinton Company and its creditors have had their property, valued by two of the very purchasers at $50,000, taken from them, by this arrangement, for $404!, .and this bond to Edsall still remains a debt against them.</p>\n<p id=\"AyJ\">But this was not, all that was done to prevent competition at these sales. What liad been done with and for Edsall could not be relied oa as sufficient, to secure to these agreeing Hamburgh creditors the purchase of the properties of the two companies, at prices suited to their purposes. Something was necessary to he done to induce Pratt to use means to prevent competition ; and the evidence showing what was done for this purpose is so consistent with the occasion and the purposes of these creditors, that there can be no good reason for doubting it. ('flic evidence on tins part of the case is here examined.)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">It is certain that, after the sale, a lease was made to Pratt, for three years,, and a contract entered into by L\u2019Hommcdieu with Pratt, to convey to him the whole Hamburgh property <em>and </em>the Clinton mine tract, for $30,000, by deed of release, with the usual covenants against his own acts. The mortgages which then existed on parts of the Hamburgh property, amounting to $7701 75, were to be considered as part of the said $30,000. And this contract was made by L\u2019Horrnnedieu, who was trustee of all the said property for the Hamburgh creditors who entered into the agreement of December 7th, 1838. This is, of itself, evidence that the lease to and contract with Pratt were made in conformity with an understanding had and made before the sales. But the evidence is clear that there was such an understanding. True, the agreement of December 7th, 1838, did not state in terms, that the lease and contract to convey should bo made to Rratt. It authorizes and diroots the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>trastee to lease .all the Hamburgh property and the Clinton mine \u201c to some suitable competent person.\u201d The reason why Pratt\u2019s name was not inserted is obvious, and is shown by the testimony. The legal adviser saw that it would be putting on the face of the agreement evidence of the arrangement with -Pratt, :to enable these agreeing Hamburgh creditors to succeed in adding the Clinton mine farm to the Hamburgh property, at \u00a1their ow,n price. It is evident from what passed before the sale, that Pratt relied on getting this lease and contract; and he did get them. And it cannot be disguised, under the circumstances and testimony in ,the cause, that he got them in pursuance of .an understanding between him and the agreeing Hamburgh' .creditors had before the sale. The. result, the \u00a1fact -that the \u2022Clintqn .mine farm was struck off to L\u2019Hommedieu for $4041, free from all incumbrances, and all .the Hamburgh property for $285, subject only to .the mortgages, shows it. But there is an .amount of evidence on \u00a1this point that cannot be resisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\">The agreement among the creditors \u2022themselves is one thing. The agreement or understanding;had before the sale) between \u00a1those.creditors and Pratt, is another. The lease and the privilege of .purchasing were to go together: this is shown by the .agreement itself, in which,the Hamburgh .creditors -who signed .it united. And that Pratt .was to be the lessee and have the; .said privilege, and that it was .so understood and agreed before .the sale, \u00a1there.can be \u00a1no doubt. (The \u00a1testimony o.n .this point .is here .examined.,)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The answer of Mr. Haines shows, very plainly I,think, the .same thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The .testimony shows, that it was known among the agreeing Hamburgh creditors, when the agreement among themselves .was drawn, that Pratt\u2019s name could not be safely put in that Writing, and that it was considered that it would vitiate the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">There was good reason for \u00a1the caution .used in not putting Pratt\u2019s natne in the writing, as lessee with the .privilege of purchasing. But lie was to he the .man, and he and the agreeing .creditors so understood it. And .the lease with \u00a1the said .privilege was, accordingly, afterwards executed to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">There was, then, an understanding before the sale, which \u00a1prevented a fair competition at the sale, and resulted in. the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>sacrifice of the property. It ia not necessary to advert particularly to what was said before the sale commenced, and while it was going on, to persons attending the sale, to prevent their bidding. Enough was done and said to effect the object of these agreeing creditors; and it was effected.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\">Under such an arrangement, and in view of the \u2018effect produced by the arrangement, the sale of the Clinton farm was unlawful as against the Clinton Company and its creditors; and the sale of the Hamburgh property unlawful as against the Ham-burgh Company and its creditors. It would not only be disastrous in its consequences, but it would 'be a reproach upon the courts, to allow property to be sacrificed at sales on executions, by means of such arrangements to prevent fair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">It is unnecessary to consider that part of the argument for the defendants based on the idea of Pratt\u2019s abandonment. The sale was unlawful from what passed before the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The Hamburgh property, as before stated, was to be sold on five executions at law, of which Edsall\u2019s was -the oldest. The purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale would get-the property free from the liens of these executions, and subject only to the mortgages. Under the arrangement made between -the agreeing Hamburgh creditors, among themselves, and between them as a body and Pratt, the furnace lot of fifty acres, was struck off at $26 ; the lot. of woodland in Vernon and Hardiston, of seventy acres, at one dollar; another wood lot in Vernon of one hundred and seventy-five acres, at one dollar; another wood lot in Vernon, of fifty-five acres, at fifty-five cents ; another wood lot in Vernon, of one hundred and seven acres, at eleven dollars; another wood lot in Vernon, of forty-five acres, at sixty-five dollars; another wood lot in Vernon, of nine hundred acres, at sixty-eight cents; and a lot in Hardiston, of one and a half acres, on which was a storehouse and other improvements, at $180: so \u2022that the sale of all these eight tracts brought but $285 for the judgment creditors, neither of whom was a party to the arrangement, nor present at the sale, except Edsall; and his debt was, by the terms of the arrangement, to be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Joseph Sharp attended the sale, for the purpose, as he says, of buying the lot on which he had a mortgage, with the view of saving the expense of a foreclosure. He says he did not bid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>\u25a0because he was told at the sale, by the creditors, that it was agreed that L\u2019Hommedieu-should buy the property for the benefit of\u2019the creditors and the company: in another part of his testimony\u2019he says, for the benefit of the creditors and Pratt. He says his chief conversation on the subject was with Robert Lewis, Jo\u00e1eph M. Brown, and William Edsall, all creditors who had signed the agreement,.and none of them having judgments \u2022against the Hamburgh Company. Edsall, too, had mortgages on different parts of the Hamburgh property, and had the same inducement to bid, had it not been for the arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\">The effect of the arrangement and the sale under it, on the Hamburgh judgment creditors, -was, to displace their liens, and substitute for the liens of their judgments, a lien for the book accounts of the agreeing Hamburgh creditors, in the shape of a title in their trustee, L\u2019Hommedieu.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Again, Edsall had the first judgment lien. Would he have allowed all these Hamburgh lands to be struck off to L\u2019Hommedieu at such bids, but for the arrangement that was made? By that arrangement -he was to get the amount of his judgment. By the agreement, the debts of the agreeing creditors, of which he was one, were to be paid out of the lands, including the Clinton mine farm, or out of the money which was to be raised by mortgage on the Hamburgh property and the Clinton farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The' case appears to me to ho very clear against the defendants. They cannot hold these properties against these companies and their respective creditors. Nothing can be done by the court in this suit, and with the parties we have before us in it, in reference to the Clinton mine farm. It cannot go to Pratt. It would be as unavailable to the Clinton creditors in his hands as where it now is. Nor can it go to Pratt\u2019s assignees under the insolvent act, to pay his individual debts. And the receivers of the Clinton Company are not before us in this suit. As <em>to the </em>property of the Hamburgh Company, it will be declared that L\u2019Hommedieu holds it in trust for the creditors and the Company ; and it will be referred to a master to take an account of the issues and profits of the property, and of the debts ; and all further directions will be reserved until the coming in of the master\u2019s report. .</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
