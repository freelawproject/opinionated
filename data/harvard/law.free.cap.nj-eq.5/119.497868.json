Williams, the complainant, and Nathaniel Stevens, since deceased, its-May, 1835, entered into partnership in the hatting business; the business to be carried on in the name of the complainant. On the 1st of January, 1839, the complainant and Stevens came to a settlement of the partnership-business up to that time, on which settlement Stevens was found to be indebted to the partnership in 1541'dollars/ and the complainant to be indebted in 213 dollars. The partnership business continued till the death of Stevens, at St. Augustine, in November 1839. On the 8th of- October,-1839, Stevens, being about to-leave this state for St. Augustine for his health, assigned and delivered to the complainant a bond and mortgage, given by onc William Bodwell to him, Stevens, on which thete was due of prin\u00bbcipal and interest 640 dollars. Stevens died while absent. In-January, 1841, administration of liis goods, chattels, &amp;c. was granted by the surrogate of Essex county, in this state, tc - Philip Kingsley, the defendant. The defendant, as such administrator, brought an action of assumpsit against the complainant, to recover the sum due on the bond and mortgage when the same was assigned to the complainant. The com - plainant, in February, 1843, filed his bill, stating, in addition-to the foregoing facts, that the settlement in January, 1839,-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>was made at Stevens\u2019s house, and that a particular statement thereof was then made, and left with Stevens; that a note of the settlement was made in the books of account of the partnership, and signed by the complainant and Stevens\u2019 at the time, but that said books are in the possession of the widow of Stevens; that when the bond and mortgage were assigned, Stevens owed the partnership more thaii the sum due thereon ; and that it was then understood and agreed, that the bond and mortgage should be collected or disposed of by the complainant, to pay the debts and carry on the business of the partnership, and particularly that a debt of 500 dollars, then due from the partnership to said Bod well, should be discharged from the amount due on said bond. That the complainant, in January, 1840, settled with Bod well, and allowed him his demand against the partnership, towards payment of his said bond and mortgage, and received from him the balance due thereon. That after the death of Stevens, the complainant, as surviving partner, paid all the debts of the partnership, and\" collected debts and disposed of the stock in trade, which was of small value. That the defendant, as such administrator, compromised and settled \u00e1 debt due the partnership from Ransom &amp; Company of New-York, of 386 dollars, besides interest, and received fifty cents on the dollar therefor; and that he may have received other debts; and prays a discovery. That the complainant and defendant are unable to agree on a settlement, the defendant insisting that- the complainant is bound to pay to him the principal and interest-of the said bond and mortgage. That Stevens, at the time of-his-death,-was indebted to the complainant on a note given by him to the complainant, dated May 14th, 1835, payable at ten months, for 500 dollars, and that the same, with the interest thereon, is still due. That on a just settlement of the accounts of the partnership, crediting the estate with the said bond and mortgage, there would be due the estate of Stevens about' twenty-one dollars, without allowing the complainant any thing for his expenses and pains in settling the partnership estate; and that if the said note of 500 dollars, with the interest thereon, be taken into the account, there would be due the complainant upwards of 700 dollars. The bill claims, that the amount due on- the said bond and mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>gage when tile same were so assigned, should be settled With and as part of the partnership accounts, and not be considered an individual debt due from the complainant to the estate of Stevens; and prays an account of the partnership transactions, and of all moneys received by the defendant from the partnership efibets; and that in the mean timo, the said suit at law may be injoined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-5\">The injunction prayed was granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-6\">The defendant put in an answer to the bil\u00ed. The only parts of the answer which need now be stated, are as follows. It admits that in January, 1839, Stevens and the complainant made some settlement or adjustment of their business up to that time ; and that from entries iu one of the books of account signed by the complainant and Stevens, on settlement then made between them, respectively, and the shop, there was due from Stevens 1541 dollars and 60 cents, aad from complainant 213 dollars and 32 cents. That the business was carried on after that settlement, till the death of Stevens; that the books of account relating\u2019 to the business, are in his, the defendant\u2019s, possession; and states, that from the entries in said hooks, up to the time of the death of Stevens, on a fair settlement of the accounts, there is nothing due from Stevens on account thereof. The answer further states, that Stevens, previous to leaving the state, placed in the hands of the complainant the Bod well bond and mortgage, to bo collected by the complainant for his use, and took the'complainant\u2019s receipt for the same, which is now in his, the defendant\u2019s, possession, ready to be produced, &amp;c.; and denies that said bond and mortgage were assigned and delivered to the complainant, to be collected and disposed of by him for ths purpose of paying the debts of the partnership, or carrying on said business;- and denying any agreement or understanding between Stevens and the complainant, that 500 dollars and upwards should be paid of allowed to Bodwell from the1 amount due on said bond and mortgage, or any agreement to that or the like effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-7\">The answer denies that the defendant and complainant were unable to agree on a settlement, and says that on the contrary, they did agree opon a settlement, and that on or about the time of the settlement made by him, the defendant, with llansom da<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Company, the complainant and the defendant settled all the accounts and transactions in relation to said business carried on between the complainant and Stevens ; and that since the said settlement, the eomplainant'Kas admitted that there was no dispute about the said Bodwell bond and mortgage, and that he was to pay the amount received on the same to the defendant, as administrator, <em>Sec. </em>of Stevens. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-3\">The answer says, it may be true that the complainant has in his possession the promissory note made by Stevens, mentioned in the bill, but denies that it\u25a0 is justly owing to the complainant ; that the complainant, in all his transactions with the defendant in relation to the settlement of the business between the complainant and Stevens, never informed the defendant of the existence of said note, or made any claim for the same; and the defendant insists that if any such note exists, it is fraudulent and void, and has long since been paid off and satisfied, and is kept on foot by fraud.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-4\">The defendant says, that after the death' of Stevens, the complainant caused entries to be made in the books, giving himself large credits on account of said business to which he is not fairly entitled; and that on examining said books he, the defendant, has been unable to find therein any credits given to Stevens for the said bond and mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-5\">On this answer, a motion.'was made to dissolve the injunction.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b122-6\">S. <em>R.

That on the 8th of October, 1839, shortly before he left this state for St. Augustine, Stevens assigned and delivered to the complainant a bond and mortgage given by one Bod well to him, on which 64.0 dollars was due, which it was then understood and agreed should be collected or disposed of by the complainant, to pay the debts and carry on tire business of the partnership; and particularly, that a debt of 500 dollars, clue from the partnership to Bodwcll, should be settled; that the complainant settled with Bodwell the said debt, with the bond and mortgage, and received from him the balance. That after the death of Stevens, the complainant paid all the debts of the partnership; and that on a settlement of the partnership accounts, after .crediting Stevens with the amount of the bond and mortgage, there would be due Stevens about 21 dollars, without allowing the complainant any thing for his expenses and pains in settling the partnership business. That Stevens, at the time of his death, was indebted to the complainant, on a promissory note given by him to the complainant, dated May 14th, 1835, payable in ten months, for 500 dollars, which, with the interest thereon, is still due and unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\">The bill prays an account of the partnership affairs, and an injunction against further proceedings in a suit brought by the defendant, as administrator, &amp;c. .of Stevens, against the complainant, to recover the amount which was due on the said bond and mortgage when the same was so assigned to the complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">The indebtedness of Stevens to the partnership in January, .1839, is admitted. How', and for what purpose,-was the Bod-well bond and mortgage assigned to .the complainant ? Was the assignment general and absolute, or was it special? From the language of the bill, I should understand that the assignment was in the usual form, absolute; and that there was an understanding or agreement, not appearing in the written assign<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>ment, that the bond and mortgage should be collected or disposed of for the purposes of the partnership, as stated in the hill. The defendant, having no personal knowledge of the transaction, denies that they were to be so applied; and insists that they were to be applied to Stevens\u2019s individual use and benefit; and says,, that j.ie has in his possession the complainant\u2019s receipt for the same; but he does not set out the terms or the contents of the receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-3\">Th,e tejms of this receipt .might have aided much in the decision of the question now before the court. If it would show that the complainant agreed to account with Stevens, individually, for the proceeds of the bond and mortgage, more should have been said in the answer .about it, than simply, that Stevens took the complainant\u2019s receipt for the bond and mortgage. If the assignment <em>of </em>the bond and mortgage was general and absolute, the receipt must have been taken for some purpose, and that purpose, it is presumed, would be stated in it; and if the administrator founds his denial of the charge, that the bond and mortgage .were to be applied as stated in the bill, on information acquired from the receipt, he should have apprised the court of the terms of the receipt. The mere denial of an administrator having no personal knowledge of a transaction between his intestate and a complainant, is not sufficient to dissolve an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">The bill states, that at the .time of the assignment of the bond and mortgage, Stevens was indebted to the partnership in a considerable sum, and more than the amount due on the bond and mortgage. The answer to this is a denial by the administrator that Stevens, when he left the state, was indebted to the partnership in a considerable sum; and a statement that he, the defendant, has heard and believes, that the complainant, since the granting of letters of administration to the defendant, and since the settlement stated in his answer to have been made between the complainant and defendant, admitted that there was no dispute about the bond and mortgage, and that he was <em>\\o </em>pay the amount he received on the same to the defendant, as administrator of Stevens. This denial is insufficient, and is not qided by the hearsay set up in the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">To the charge in the bill, of the indebtedness of Stevens, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>the amount thereof, to the partnership, at the time of the assignment of the bond and mortgage, the defendant admits that the books of account are in his possession; and says-that from the entries in the said books up to the time of the death of Stevens, on a fair settlement of the accounts respecting said business, there is nothing due from Stevens on account thereof. What are we to understand by the fair settlement the defendant Jjere speaks of? The bill states, that the complainant and defendant are unable to agree on a settlement, the defendant insisting that the complainant is bound to pay him tile principal and interest of the bond and mortgage. The answer says, that the complainant and defendant did agree on a settlement. What was settled ? It appears to me, that the answer, examined in reference to the charges of the bill, is not sufficient to show that this matter of the bond and mortgage was ever settled between them. When the defendant, in his answer, says that he and the complainant agreed to settle all the accounts and transactions in relation to said business, he may mean all the accounts and transactions that <em>he </em>supposed belonged to said business. Did they settle all matters which the complainant claimed to belong to the partnership accounts? Did the complainant <em>then </em>admit that the bond and mortgage did not belong to the partnership business? If he did, it would not have been necessary for the defendant, in his answer, to resort to the statement, that since the settlement the complainant, had admitted that he was to pay to the defendant the amount of the bond and mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\">It is manifest, that whatever may have been said or done at any settlement or attempted settlement, the parties are still at variance as to how the bond and mortgage are to be accounted for; and we are brought back to the inquiry for the terms of the receipt which the defendant say's he has in his possession. Again, if there w-as a Ml settlement between these parties, the posture of their affairs, and particularly the character in which the defendant was acting, would lead us to expect some written evidence of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">In view of the -whole case, I think it would not be a safe exercise of discretion to dissolve the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
