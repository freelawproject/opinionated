He suggested to.Stebbins that <em>the </em>board must adopt a seal. On reflection, he cannot say he was .present when the seal was adopted ; or whether l}e was afterwards told that the seal had been adopted. Does not know that notice was given of the time and place of meeting when the bond and mortgage were executed, or seal adopted. ,He has no personal knowledge of a resolution of the' board .to give this bond and mortgage.; hut at the time it .was done, a .resolution .was produced, and thp secretary, Joseph A. Gaston, was present, directing or authorizing said bond and mortgage to ,be given. Witness supposes this was the original resolution which had passed the board for that purpose. T.he resolution was shown deponent, and the bond and mortgage were executed at the house of Joseph A. Gaston, secretary, in Somerville. The persons present were John I. Gaston, president, Jared N. S.tebbins, a director, Joseph A. Gaston, secretary, and. he thinks, William Packer, another director. The meeting was for the purpose of executing thp bond and mortgage, and the said resolution was produced to satisfy witness that it was correct.

He was a manager (i. e. director) on the 10th of January, 1842, and for the year preceding. Ibbotson and Tan Renselaer lived out of the state. The company were then engaged in putting up the screw factory, foundry and blacksmith shop, and getting other machinery. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>There was a log for the shaft which had laid there six months, partly dressed, and they could not get along any further, for the want of money. At (his time, he had received for work he liad done, between $3000 and $0000, on the notes of Wall and Nevius, given to him by Slebbins; he never got any money from Stebbins. Stebbins, who was agent of the company, at a meeting of the board, slated that there was a debt of about $2000 against the company, and that they could start the works if they could raise $5000 or $0000, besides paying the debt. Through the six mouths prior 1o the 10th of January, Stebbins held out inducements io him to go on with the work, and said he could raise money by a loan on a bond and mortgage of the company. At the time he called us together, about the 1st of January, 18d2, he said he could not raise the money in this way, and that lie would have to give, a higher interest, or pay a premium to raise the money; and then proposed a plan how he could raise the money to complete the works. This plan was, to give him a valid mortgage for the amount they would want. Witness objected to it, on the ground that the company owed him a great deal of money, and that he did not know that they owed Slebbins a cent. Witness did not think it safe to give Stebbins a mortgage. Stebbins assured them it was the only way they could ever got the works going. Through Mr. Van Renselaor, witness was induced to agree to the plan. Van Renselaer said he knew Stebbins could not raise the money the-oilier way, i. e. by a mortgage from the company to the lender, because he would have to give a premium on it; and therefore proposed that the mortgage should he given to Stebbins in his own name, and stated that in that way the money could be obtained. This was Stebbins\u2019s plan, and advocated by Van Renselaer. This was about the 1st of January. John I. Gaston, Stebbins and he, were the only managers present when the mortgage was given, on the 10th of January. Either Stebbins or John I. Gaston called on him, and requested him to meet at Mr. Brown\u2019s office or house, in the evening, at the time the mortgage was given. Witness does not. know that other members of the board were notified to meet. He never had a thought but that this mortgage was given to , \"aise money to pay the debts of the company and start the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>works. Stebbins said the money was wanted to pay $2000 the company owed, and to start the works; and that it would take about $5000 or $6000 to-complete the works. John I. Gaston suggested, that it would take more than $2000 to pay the debts, and therefore the mortgage was made for more than <em>$8000. </em>It was made for $9600. Witness was contractor for building the works, and .a great deal of money was due him. Stebbins -said he wanted to pay Theodore Young some money, and some at New Hope for castings; also a debt due the State Bank .at Elizabeth. Witness never knew there was any money rais.ed on the bond and mortgage to pay the debts of the company. He never got any of it. Not one of the debts named by Stebbins has. ever been paid: they stand just as they were. Through the inducements held out to witness by Stebbins, and letters he wrote to Gaston, he went on with the works and nearly completed them- The inducements named by Stebbins were, that \u25a0he was negociating the mortgage, and would get the money and pay witness for his work. He was finally compelled to suspend his work. The foundry was still unfinished. The millwright came, with four or five hands, .and worked at the mill -two months; they were induced to come by Stebbins. They then stopped, and would not work another stroke. They told witness . they were going to be deceived by Stebbins. They got nothing but about $80, in trade, from Mr. Ste\u00e9le\u2019s store. This he understood from Mr. Young. The castings were left at .Bound Brook, and Stebbins could not get them up, as he could -get no one to work for him ; and there they laid till the next \u2019October. During the time he was negociating in New-York for the money, he said, frequently, there would be gentlemen up to see the works, and wanted us to show them as much as w-e could, and make things as favorable as possible. After this he \u00abtold us there must be one more thing done; there must be \u25a0some resolutions passed to suit Mr. Blauvelt. These resolutions \u25a0were passed, but whether witness was present or not, he cannot say. He wrote to John I. Gaston, that he wanted a certificate from the president of the company, to show that the company owed him the money. At the time the mortgage was executed, witness wanted Stebbins to give him a writing to show to the other persons interested why they had acted as they did, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>that the mortgage was given only to raise money to pay the debts and start the works, and not to pay Stebbins ; for witness never knew that the company owed him any thing. Witness insisted on this at both of the meetings. Stebhins assured him it was not necessary; that he was the agent of the company,- and that what, he did weald be right, lie said he did not want it known that he had taken the mortgage in-his own name; and if he gave a writing he was fearful it would get out. He said ho was the agent of the company, and if it got out among the people that, the money was not' coming to him, he would be censured, and then he would not be able to get along ; but that he wished it kept, still till he got the works started. Witness told him that he, witness, had told Judge Nevius all they had done. Stebbins said he had done wrong, and that he was afraid witness would defeat him in getting the money. Witness-told General Wall, when he saw- him, what they had dons; that the mortgage was given to Stebbins to raise money to pay the debts and start the works. Witness was present at a meeting of the Water Power Company, when Stebbins applied for a lease of water for the Manufacturing Company, and stated that he could not negociate his loan till he got the lease. This was;in June or July, 1842. At the time the mortgage was given, (Stebbins had received from Wall and Nevius $10,500 in notes. He got out of Steele\u2019s store more than $500: so Steele told witness. He received from Gaston between $600 and $700. There is still remaining, debts of the company contracted by Stebbins while he was agent, over $7000. Witness received from Stebhins, as agent of the company, about $4100, in the notes of Wall and Nevius. Stebbins never pretended to witness at the time the bond and mortgage were given, that there was any thing due him from the company, and that there had been any settlement of any account between him and the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-3\">On cross-examination, he says, la January, 1842. and before, John I. Gaston was president of the company. The board of managers, at, their meeting about the 1st of January, 1842, directed that the president should give the bond and mortgage. The amount of it, he thinks, was fixed at, that, meeting; but he cannot say positively. The board of managers, on the day' the bond and mor\u00ed gage were given, adopted a seal for the com <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>pany. He thinks Joseph A. Gaston was present at the meeting\u2019 when the bond and mortgage were 'given. He thinks it was about April court, or at a time that Stebbins stated to him that Mr. Blauvelt was at Somerville to examine the records, that Stebbins wished to get the resolutions passed by the hoard. He does not know that Blauvelt was ever up to examine the records ; but only what Stebbins told him. The resblutions required by Stebbins were passed by the board. Joseph A. Gas-ton was secretary of the board. Thinks it was within, two weeks after the bond and mortgage were executed, that he told Judge Nevius it was done, and stated to him why it' was done. Thinks it was in-the June following that he told General Wall the bond and mortgage had been given. General Wall said very little about it. Judge Nevius was a good deal dissatisfied. General Wall said they had got enough alreadjr in the hands of Stebbins. Wall and Nevius were then large stockholders, and had paid in, between theni, between $10,000 and $11,000 on their stock. No effort was made, to his knowledge, by any one of the company, to recover back the bond and mortgage from Stebbins. We never had an official meeting of the board after the bond and. mortgage were given, till after we found he had used them. He had used them a long time before any of us knew about it. I only knew the debts of the company from acknowledgments and statements made at the meetings of the board, and by the statements of the managers and the president.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-3\">On re-examination. After they bad found out that Stebbins had assigned the bond and mortgage to Van Hook, he, Stebbins, denied to witness and John I. Gaston that he had ever made use of the bond and mortgage, and said he could make no use of them till he could g*et a lease from the Water Power Company. Witness does not know that Wall or Nevius was ever informed that Stebbins intended to use or had used the bond and mortgage for any other purpose than what it was intended for: Witness was present at a meeting when Stebbins applied for a lease of water, when Stebbins blamed General Wall for his not getting the. lease. Stebbins said he could not raise the money on the bond and mortgage without the lease. General Wall then said he could not have the lease, and that he must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>return the bond and mortgage. The company frequently told Stebbins that he was largely indebted to them, and if he had any claims he must present them ; and he would say he was ready for a settlement, that his books were in JNew-York; and when in New-York, he would say they were'in Somerville; and, we never could nor did get a settlement while Stebbins was in the board.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-3\">John I. Gaston, for the defendants. He was president of tho company. Wliat Packer has testified as'to the situation of the buildings and the property generally, is correct. The first he knew of the bond and mortgage, was on the evening the company resolved to give them.. There had been some talk about giving them some time before, for the purpose of raising money for the company. Then he found they had all agreed on giving the bond and mortgage. He was opposed to it himself. He did not wish to incumber the property without giving the stockholders notice. Stebbins then said,- that all we bad done would be lost unless we raised money on bond and mortgage; and that there were many debts that were pressing and must be paid. He then produced a memorandum showing that the company owed him about \u00a710,000 for services, houseurent, &amp;c., and' considerable interest on it; and therefore there would be no danger in giving him the bond and mortgage. The reason he gave why a bond and mortgage should be given to him was, that he could not negoc\u00edate a bond and mortgage to the lender. He said he would be compelled to give a premium on it; but if it was given to him, he could assign it, to some one and give some further security and make it an individual transaction of his own. He said it would enable him to pay the pressing debts of the company and complete the works. That was the purpose, entirely, for which the bond and mortgage were given *s- and not to pay any debt the company owed him: 1 did not, Id.' giving the bond and mortgage, recognize that the company owed Stebbins any thing ; yet at the same time, if he had not made some show that the company owed him. witness would not have consented to give the bond and mortgage. As it ulti - mately turned out, I believe, the company did not owe him one' dollar. In the statement exhibited by Stebbins, he thinks there was no credit given ; the account was nearly all for salary. M\u00a9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>knows there was no credit given- for the notes received from General Wall or Judge Nevius. There never was a settlement with Stebbins and the company; and we could never get a statement of what he had received. He thinks Stebbins had received, in notes of Wall and Nevius, $10,000. The indebtedness of the company at the time the bond and mortgage were given was about $6000; He does riot know what Stebbins had paid out. The whole of the expenditures at that time ought not to have? exceeded $6000. At the time the bond and mortgage were given, Stebbins said the-\"object of the mortgage was to raise money to pay the pressing debts and complete the works. There never' was one dollar raised on the bond and mortgage that came into the hands of the \"company; and I did not, until within a year past, know that1'it had been assigned away by Stebbins. The letters shown\" him, and marked Exhibits A. and B., are in the hand-writing of Stebbins; and were received by witness from Stebbins, during the time he pretended he was negociating the loan. The $1500 mentioned in the letter of January 17th, 1842, is a prior debt against the company, as security for liabilities incurred for the company. Mr. Packer, whose name is- mentioned in the letter marked B., is the William Packer who was contractor on the works. Stebbins said he must raise the money to \"complete the-works, for that he had $30,000, all he had in the world, in the company; and he would be ruined unless he got the works completed. The property mortgaged, being in an unfinished state, and without the use of the water, - and if subject to the mortgage of $9600, was not worth any thing to the stockholders; neither would-it pay the mortgage. Stebbins brought'Yan Hook out to look at the property, sometime during the spring or summer of 1842. Yan Hook stopped at witness\u2019s door, and told witness he had come out to see about loaning Stebbins the \"money on the bond and mortgage. I told him we wanted about $10,000 to set the property going and pay the debts, and that\"Stebbins said that sum would do it; that I considered the property would be worth $20,000 when in operation. I told him the amount of expenses we had been at, about $180,000;. that if he had the money to spare, he could not put it out more safely; that we were anxious to get the money and have-the works in operation.- Yan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Hook said he could furnish the money if he was satisfied with the security; hut that he did not wish to run any risk, as he liad already lost some money on loans made for other persons, lie made several inquiries respecting the value of the property. That is all that passed between us that 1 know. I never made the least intimation to Van Hook, or any other person, that the money was to be raised for the benefit of Stebbins; but always supposed it was for the benefit of the company. Van Hook did not inquire as to the means of the company for completing the works; but I told him, that if we could obtain the money on the bond and mortgage, we would be able to put the works in operation, and that then the property would be valuable. My impression is, that the resolutions offered in evidence were passed before the conversation took place with Van Hook, hut am not positive. <em>By </em>the information witness received from Stebbins, there was no negociation of the bond and mortgage at the time the resolutions were passed. I gave Stebbins such a certificate as he asked for to enable him \u00a1to effect a loan. It was given him for the same purpose the bond and mortgage were given for: to enable Stebbins to make the loan. 1 gave the certificate to aid him in making the loan, and that the bond and mortgage were valid. I never gave Stebbins a certificate that the company had given him the bond and mortgage for any debt due him from the comparry.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-3\">Cross-examined. He does not recollect whether <em>he </em>was present at the meeting of the hoard when the resolutions were passed: but he recollects something about the resolutions, and probably he was present at the time they were passed. He presumes the original minutes are in the hands of the company in New-York. Jbbotson got them of his son, and took them to New-York. He did not convey the idea to Van Hook, or any other person, that the bond and mortgage were given to Stebbins for a debt due from the company to Stebbins. Van Hook made no inquiry about its being for a debt due Stebbins. There was no conversation on that subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-4\">In chief. The resolutions were to aid Stebbins in -the negociation in raising the money on the bond and mortgage for the use of the company. He applied to witness for the resolutions, and said he wanted them to assist him in got-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>ting the money on the bond and mortgage; and they were passed for that purpose; and if any certificate was given by me as president of the company, it was given for the same purpose. He does not know that Stebbins ever paid any money out of his own funds for the use of the company. The company'have never expended any thing at Somerville, except for building and some castings. The expenditure he before alluded \u2022to is $180,000 in stock. The scrip ro be delivered for the Poughkeepsie machinery and patents, depending on them to fulfil.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-3\">Cross-examined. Witness is not a stockholder, and has no interest in this suit. Stebbins was employed by the Somerville Manufacturing Company as their 'agent, at $3000 a year salary and a-house. Thinks it was three .years from the time \u25a0he was engaged as agent till he was dismissed; but he does not know .that he was .engaged in the business of the company more than a third of t.he time. The first year he \"does not think there was much done. There never was any agreement \u25a0between the company and Stebbins varying the first bargain made. There never was a settlement by the company with Stebbins: they never could get 'him to a settlement, or to make a statement. There never was a formal account rendered by him to the company as agent. At the time the bond and mortgage were given, Stebbins presented a statement on a small piece of paper, showing that the company was indebted to him between $9000 and $10,000 for services. There was a minute made in the books of the company ,of the bargain of the company with Stebbins. Yan Renselaer was present when the statement was produced by Stebbins, and it was talked about.; but he does not .recollect that Yan Renselaer said any thing about fit.

Sometime prior to June 25th, 1842, the precise time he cannot say, lie was employed on behalf of Mr. Van Hook, to examine into the title of the property belonging to the Somerville Manufacturing Company, at Somerville, included in said mortgage, with the understand - ing that there was a negoeiation going on between Van Hook and Jared N. Stebbins. He made the examination, and gave a certificate to that\u2019effect. He examined the book of minutes of the company, as if was represented to him. He did not know it to be the book of minutes of the company, any more than that it contained the proceedings of the company; he does not know where he found it. He found on this book a resolution of the board of directors of the company, of an indebtedness of the company to Jared N. Stebbins of $9638. There was also in said book, a resolution authorizing the president of the company to execute a bond and mortgage to Jared N. Stebbins for $9600, on the real- estate of the company.

Being\" shown the bond and mortgagte in controversy, he says he has seen them before. The first time he saw them' was in the spring of 1842; the occasion on which he first saw them, was about the time of the completion of the arrangements between Stebbins and Van Hook. He had been applied to prior to that time, by Stebbins, to negoc\u00edate the bond and mortgage for him. About the last of March or first of April,' 1842, he was applied to by Stebbins to negoc\u00edate the bond and mortgage.- Witness offered it- for dry goods; and offered it to other persons before he offered it to Van- Hook. About the time last mentioned,- he offered the said bond and mortgage to Van Hook for some houses he had-in the third Avenue, New-York. While it was under consideration, he obtained from Van Hook another-offer which Van Hook preferred,- being, some cash and New-York securities. In the fore part of May, witness went and showed Jared N. Stebbins the property contained in Exhibit I., J. M. Mann, master; which resulted in the purchase of the bond and mortgage by Van Hook. Stebbins was to make up the mortgage to $10,000, and make it equal to a ten per cent, mortgage. Van Hook was to give him for it, the five houses and lots contained in said Exhibit I., and the leases, and give him also the benefit of the decree, if the property should not bring as much as the mortgage Van Hook held on the property. The rent which had been kept back for six or nine months in the hands of a receiver, was to go to Stebbins. Van Hook- at this- time held a bond and mortgage on the said property, witness thinks, of $10,000, which was in an advanced state of foreclosure, or had been foreclosed, he does not know which. The sale of the property had not then been made; it was to be sold, and after the sale Stebbins was to get his title through Van Hook. This trade had been agreed upon some weeks before the sale by the master-.- The sale was partly given up once by Van Hook. Stebbins desired the property to be purchased in as low as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>could be. 'Witness took a message from Stebbins to Van Hook, for him. Van Hook, to buy in the property at a small price. The reason why Stebbins wished the property bought in at a small sum was, that the smaller the sum for which it cold, the larger would be the amount left due on the decree, which lie, Stebbins, would be enabled to enforce against Bowen, the defendant in said decree; which balance belonged to Stebbins by the terms of the bargain. This whole transaction took place in the city of New-York. Witness was first applied to by Stebbins ; Van Hook never applied to witness; Van Hook paid one half of the commissions, in consequence of some misunderstanding between Stebbins and Van Hook as to the terms of the bargain; this was done by way of settling the difficulty. Witness looked to Stebbins for his commissions; did not think of charging Van Hook, until Stebbins and be agreed that he. Van Hook, should pay one half. Van- Hook refused to part with the five houses and lots for less than the amount of his mortgage, as they were worth that to him. Witness and Stebbins went together to see the- property, and went through two or three of the houses; this was before the bargain was made. At this time Stebbins was willing, and proposed to witness, to give his bond and mortgage for the said property and decree. Previous to the bargain being closed, Stebbins went to see the property once or twice, as he informed witness, and showed him a memorandum of the income. After paying ground-rent and all expenses, the property rented for enough to make it a seven per cent, matter on $10,000, as it strikes witness; he does not speak positively. Stebbins examined about the rents particularly, to know what would be in the hands of the receiver. Van Hook repeatedly said, in the course of the negotiation, that he would not take less than the amount due on his mortgage. Witness says, if he had owned the property when the bargain was made, in May, 1842, he would not have taken less than $10,000 for it. Since this property has been sold by Van Hook, it has been mortgaged for $8000. Witness has seen the mortgage: saw it this morning in the hands of Edward P. Clark; never saw the mortgage in any other place than in the city of New-York. Being shown a paper marked Exhibit B. on the part of the complainant, he says it is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>true copy from the original, which he could not get out'of the office; they refused to let him have it. Witness has sold and negotiated for the sale of a large amount of real estate in all parts of the city of New-York. During the last five or six years he has been a.\u2019real estate broker in the city of New-York. He has some knowledge of the value of real estate in the city. During the time of this negotiation, and about the close of it, he learned from Yan Hook and Stebbins that they had been over to Jersey, at Somerville, to look at the property on which the mortgage in controversy is. They said they had seten Gaston, the president of the company. Yan Hook did not see the property; had not time. From the time the first trade of the third Avenue property was talked about/ Yan Hook and Stebbins talked of going over to5 Somerville, and whether they did go before the last'trad\u00e9 was introduced or shortly after, witness is not able to say with certainty; but feels \u25a0 confident it' was before the 20th of May; 1842.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-3\">Cross-examined. The property in the\" deed contained in Exhibit I., was sold at public sale. Henry L. Stebbins had nothing to do with tlie negotiation with Yan Hook. About the close of the negotiation Stebbins said the property was to be made to his son, Henry L. Stebbins.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-4\">John S. Blauvelt, for the complainant. In the spring of 1842, he was in the complainant\u2019s office in the city of New-York ; he cannot specify the exact time, but thinks it was the last of April or early in May. Yan Hook stated to witness that Stebbins had offered him a <em>mortgage </em>upon the property of either the Water Power Company or the Somerville Manufacturing Company, and wanted witness to examine the title and ascertain the value of the property. Witness told him he had better-get John M.-Mann to-do it, as he lived some distance from Somerville; that Mann had been clerk-of the county, knew the property, and probably knew the title, and he could get more satisfactory information from him than he, witness, could give him. Yan Hook thought that would be the best way. As the conversation closed, he remarked to Yan Hook that the bond and mortgage being made by a corporation, he had best ascertain, before he took it, if it had been properly executed, and he had better also get a recognition- of the bond and mortgage'' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>by the company as a good and valid bond and mortgage, and that the company had no defence to make against the bond and mortgage, either in law or equity\u2014or something to that effect. Witness.does not recollect that he held any communication with Van. Hook on the subject afterwards, until after the bond and mortgage had been assigned to him ; nor had witness anything todo with the examination of the title or value, or with the negotiation, having referred him to Mr. Mann as his counsel to get the information. Witness was at Somerset court, which is held on the third Tuesday in June in each year, at the term of June, 1842, on the first day ; saw Stebbins there; ho inquired of witness what kind of a resolution of the company Van Hook wanted in relation to the bond and mortgage, so that he, Van Hook, would take it. Witness referred him to Mr. Mann. Stebbins applied again, and may he more than once, and finally witness told him what kind of a resolution be supposed Van Hook wished. Witness may have drawn or dictated a resolution on the subject, but his memory does not entirely serve him. Fie had some conversation, he thinks, but is not certain, with Mr. Mann on the subject of the bond and mortgage. Witness did not then know any thing about the bond and mortgage, or the circumstances under which it was given ; nor did he hear any thing of any difficulty about the said bond and mortgage until several months afterwards, thinks about the middle of the following winter. When witness was at Somerville in June term, 1842, as above stated, he knew the fact that Van Hook had been to Somerville to see and inquire about the mortgaged property; that he had seen Gaston, the president of the company, and that he liad not seen the property, for he told witness so; when or where witness does not recollect. Ft is possible witness may have seen him at Perth Amboy in the latter part of May in that year; he does not recollect to have had any communication with Van Hook about the bond and mortgage, after that above stated as having taken place in his office, for some months afterwards.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-3\">Dudley Selden, for the complainant. He resides in the city of New-York, and has resided there more than twenty years, and is a lawyer. He says he is acquainted with the New-York property described in Exhibit I.. and has known it since 1836 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>or 1837, particularly. There were three adjoining lots, of which \u00a1the premises in said Exhibit is five-sixths, each lot being 25 feet \u2022front by a little.over 1G0 feet deep; they were vacant, and held \u2022under leases from Mr. -Rogers. The agent of the owner of the \u2022leases applied to witness to purchase .them. Witness purchased :his interest in the three lots under said leases, at the rate of $1000 per lot. -The fee simple of the lots at that time were worth from $3000 to $3500 each, free from .all incumbrance. After having .purchased these three lots, witness determined to \u25a0build upon them six houses of twelve and a half feet front, and made an arrangement with the builder, whereby -he, -in connection with Mr. J. Rogers, should build .two of \u00a1the houses on his own account, substantially corresponding, externally, with the four witness .was to build on his own account; witness advancing some portion of -the money, which was to -be secured by a mortgage on .their respective buildings. Under the arrangements six buildings were put .up, occupying the entire front of the three lots. The cost of the four buildings put up on the two lots retained by him was over $8000. He thinks the contract price was either $2000 apiece, together with certain additions not covered by the .contract, or it was $2200 apiece with certain additions. He took a mortgage from Colburn and from Rogers for advances he made to them in building their houses.; \u00a1the amount of .the mortgages he does not recollect; they were probably about two-thirds of the cost of the lot and buildings, .perhaps a little more. The titles to Colburn and Rogers\u2019s lots were made to them, either by his surrendering the lease to .them and they taking out new leases, or by his assigning to them the lease for one of the lots which he held. The said Rogers who became interested in the one half of this one lot, .is wholly .unconnected with the Rogers .who is the original lessor of the three lots; the .one who claimed under witness was Rogers .the architect. About \u00e1 year after witness got the buildings completed, property began .to depreciate in New-York, and gradually declined fo.r about three years. The buildings, he .thinks, were completed in 1837 or 1838; thinks real estate in New-York continued depreciated until the beginning of 1842. He thinks he rented his houses for from $350 to $375, eack j|LQ,Rse.: .thinks he got the first year for some of .these houses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>$400. Shortly after the buildings were completed, he made an arrangement with a Mr. Bowen, then in Europe, and who at that time had certain funds in the hands of witness, whereby the purchasing the lots, the building, the arrangement made with Colburn and Rogers, the letting of the houses, &amp;c. were all deemed to have been made by the said Bowen. His impression is he originally intended the said property for Bowen, and wrote <em>to </em>him on the subject. Witness foreclosed the Colburn mortgage for non-payment, and became the purchaser under the foreclosure, for the benefit of Bowen. Colburn had become embarrassed, and left the city; this was about a year or eighteen months after the buildings were completed. The Colburn house and the four houses built by witness, are included in Exhibit I. \u2022Before witness transferred the leases under direction of Bowen, witness, at his request, -executed a mortgage upon the premises, collateral to Mr. Bowen\u2019s bond, which witness believes was to Mr. Van Hook: witness thinks it was conditioned for $10,000. Being asked what was the value of the premises in 1840, he says, he should think that in May, 1840, such buildings as were put up on these premises could have been constructed for $1750 apiece: and had the leases for the vacant lots been offered to witness at that time, he would not have been willing to have given more than $500 for the leasehold interest in each \u2022lot of twenty-five feet front. He thinks the entire property would have sold for more in 1842 than in 1840. He received .the rents for several years after the buildings were put up, and up to about the time of the sale under the foreclosure of the mortgage that was given to Van Hook, acting therein as the agent of Bowen. The rents of the buildings fell off considerably, and varied from $225 to $275 or $300 for each of the five houses. There were more houses in New-York during the depression of business than there were tenants who usually occupied such houses, to occupy them ; some of these houses were .occupied by two tenants. The rents, during the depression, were not always collected in full. Perhaps if witness pressed hard, he might have got them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-3\">William Packer, for the defendants.

At the time said mortgage was proposed to be given, the company was struggling with pecuniary difficulties which seemed to be insurmountable; the works of the company were suspended at that time for the want of funds; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>manufacturing company had'just commenced its operations.

The question was \"often discussed by the' company as to the mode of raising mon\u00e9y, and as to whether any money could be raised by a loan on the company. Gaston was of opinion that any amount could be raised. Deponent was of opinion it could noth The company was indebted, at the' lime, to several persons; who were pressing for their debts. When the mortgage was given to Stebbi\u00f1s, he gave the assurance that he could raise a sufficient sum to relieve the company from its embarrassments and go on with the works and complete the manufacturing establishment. Deponent consented to the mortgage, to secure the indebtedness of the company to' Stebbi\u00f1s; but would not have consented, bad it not been for the assurance of Stebbi\u00f1s that the proceeds would have been-applied for the payment of the\" debts and prosecution of the works of the company, fie was\u2019 present when the negotiation1\u2019 was going on between the company and Loomis and Lyman,for the property covered by the mortgage; but cannot remember'' the month.

This mortgage recited, that George P. Rogers had, by a .lease dated October 14th, 1837, demised to Dudley Selden, all that lot of land, &amp;c., to hold from May 1st, 1837, for the term of seventeen years, at the yearly rent of $31 50; that Selden, with the consent of George P. Rogers, had assigned the lease to Colburn; that to secure part of the consideration of the assignment, Colburn had executed a mortgage to Selden; that afterwards, on the 27th of November, 1839, the interest of Col-burn in the lease had been sold by a master in chancery, to the said Bowen, by deed dated April 6th, 1840; that Bowen mortgaged to Yan Hook the said unexpired term, and the lease and ail the advantages of renewals and buildings and improvements. The said recited mortgage was only of Colburn\u2019s interest in one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>of the lots. There was -another mortgage of the leasehold interest in two of the.lots,,reciting a lease dated April 26th, 1833, for twenty-one years, yielding for each of the lots the yearly .sum of $63. Dudley-Salden mortgaged the leasehold interest ,in said two lotspo Van Hook. The .property is in Thirteenth Street, Fifteenth Avenue. The bond .and the said two mort\u2022gages were to secure $10,000. The bill .filed in that case states, \u00a1that Jacob Acker has or claims some interest in or lien upon the .said premises prior fo the said .mortgage of Van Hook, the complainant in .that .cause, and prays, among other things, that after satisfying the.priorliens.on said .premises, if any, the complainant .may be paid out of the residue of -the proceeds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-3\">The answer in that case sets up usury, and .states, .among .other things, an assignment by Bowen in trust .for the benefit ,of his creditors, dated June 1st, 1841.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-4\">On the 14th of December, 1841, an order for proofs was \u25a0.made in that case.

If, on' due notice to all the directors\u2019, three only meet, can a majority of them bind the corporation?' It is said in 2 <em>Kent\u2019s Com. </em>293, that there is a distinction taken' between a corporate act to be done by a select and definite body, and one to-be performed by the constituent members. In1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>the latter case, a\u2018 majority of those who appear may act; but in the former, a majority of the definite body must be present, and then a majority of the quorum may decide.' This, the author says, is the general rule on the subject / arid if any corporation has a different mode of expressing its binding will, it arises from the specific provisions \u00f3f the act of incorporation/</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\">The act incorporating this company does not give, specially/ any definite mode of expressing the will of the corporation. It does not say, in words,' that the concurrence of three of the five directors shall be necessary to bind the corporation; nor' that three shall be a quorum. The provisions in this respect differ, in words; in different parts of the act. In two clauses, the words, \u201c or a majority of them,\u201d occur. These clauses authorize the president and directors, or a majority of them, to appoint officers, and to call in installments. Is it intended that when three are duly met, two of them may make'the appointments, and call in installments ?'\u2014or is the concurrence of three of the'five necessary ? I have great difficulty in supposing, that the legislature; when' they say that a majority of the five may' appoint officers- and call in installments, intended that two of the five might do it, if a third should be present1, though he' should vote against it. If in these clauses this was not- intended, was it intended to give a different rule in the other clauses ? The act of a majority of those who, by the charter, have a voice in the corporate deliberations, will bind.- The question is, what shall be considered the act of that majority? Mr. Kyd says, that in different corporations, the manner in which the majority shall be reckoned varies according to the provisions of the charter. Sometimes; the act that is to bind must be sanctioned by the assent of an absolute majority of the body empowered to act; sometimes, it is sufficient if a majority of the body be assembled, and the majority of those assembled agree to the act: <em>Kyd, </em>309.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Which of these rules does this act give ? or does it give different rules for different purposes ? Does it require the concurrence of three voices to appoint an agent, and of only two to make a deed ? Lawrence, justice, in <em>Witherell </em>v. <em>Gartham, </em>6 <em>T. R. </em>592, says, \u201c In general, it would be the understanding of a plain man, that when a body of persons is to do an act, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>majority of that body would bind the rest.\u201d A think a plain man would quite as readily understand, that a minority of the body could not, under any circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\">Without deciding what is the construction of the act in this respect, (for I have disposed of the cause on' other grounds,) I am willing to say, that the experience of New-Jersey in reference to the proceedings of corporations, furnishes strong arguments to her judicial tribunals, to induce them to look narrowly into the powers given by acts of incorporation. But, under both these clauses, not less than three can constitute a board to do a corporate act. Could Stebbins, with two other directors, constitute a hoard to Vote a mortgage from the company to him ? I think not. A member of a corporation contracting with it, is regarded, as to that contract, as a stranger: <em>Ang. and Ames, </em>168, 169; 1 <em>Kyd on </em>Corporations, 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">This brings <em>us to </em>an inquiry of fact in the case. Were there three directors other than Stebbins present, duly assembled, at the meeting or meetings at which the acts necessary to hind the company by this bond and mortgage to him, were done ? It is shown by the testimony 0f Brown and Packer, that at the meeting of the 10th of January, 1842, but three of the directors were present, and Stebbins was one of them. This fact is uncontradicted, unless the minutes are sufficient to overcome this direct testimony, and to show that four of the directors were then present. <em>\u201c </em>The books and minutes of a corporation, if there is nothing to r\u00e1ise a suspicion that the corporate proceedings have been irregular, will be treated and referred to as evidence of the legality of the <em>proceedingsAngel and Ames, </em>407. How'ever regular and free from suspicion on the face of them, they would be but <em>prima facie </em>evidence. I have examined the minutes carefully. The appearance of them is too suspicious to allow them to overcome the testimony of Brown and Packer* It is plain, that at the meeting of the 10th of January, there were but two directors present besides Stebbins. As to the word \u201c board,\u201d as used by the witnesses, it is evident they use it without regard to the question whether a meeting of three directors, including Stebbins, would be a competent board to give a mortgage to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The meeting of Gaston, Packer and Stebbins, on the 10th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>of January, the minutes of which say that a resolution was then passed, ordering the president to sign the bond and mortgage and affix thereto his own seal, which was thereby\" acknowledged and adopted as the seal of the company for- that purpose, was not- a legal board for the purpose of giving- a mortgage to Stebbins: But the affixing the seal of a corporation is a ministerial act, and may be done by a less number than is necessary to constitute s board, if it be done by the direction of a legal board: <em>Angel and </em>Ames, 155; 158, 406. Was there any previous meeting of a legal board for giving a mortgage to Stebbins, at which' the1 affixing the seal to the bond'and mortgage was directed to be done' ? The minutes, as they now appear, show, under a heading of a meeting on the 5th of January, 1842, which states that Gaston; Stebbins, Yan Renselaer and Packer were present, and prior to the heading of the meeting of the 10th, two entries, one directing the president to execute the bond and mortgage and affix thereto a common seal, and the other, stating, that that meeting was then adjourned to the office of George H. Brown, esquire,. January 10th, at 5, P. M. 1842. When these two entries were made, was not shown. The secretary of the company was not examined ; nor did the book of minutes appear at any of the examinations of witnesses ; nor does the witness Brown say, that he saw the book of minutes and these entries in it, at or before the execution of the bond and mortgage. It is obvious that if may have been supposed by some person, at some period before the bond and mortgage were assigned, that such a state of the minutes as would appear to show an adjournment from a former meeting at which three directors, \u25a0 besides Stebbins, were present, might put the question of the validity of the bond and mortgage on a better footing, than if it stood simply on the resolution appearing in the minutes of the meeting of the 10th, the heading of which does not state how many or who were present. A careful examination of the minutes, compared with testimony, has satisfied me, that the entry stating an adjournment from the 5th to the 10th, is not a correct entry ; and that it was made, not on the 5th of January, but at some subsequent time.- [The reasons for this conclusion are here stated.]</p>\n<p id=\"b170-3\">There may 'have been another reason for introducing this-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>entry of adjournment from the 5th to the 10th. The heading of the minutes of the meeting of the 5th, is, \u201cAt a meeting of the board of directors of the company, at the house of John 'I.'orbert. innkeeper, pursuant to notice duly given <em>to said directors </em>respectively, the following persons were presentnaming Gaston, Yan Renselaer, Stebbins and Packer. It may have been supposed that the entry of an adjournment from the 5th to the 10th, would have the effect of making the .meeting of the 10th appear to be a meeting on clue notice. Whether this would he so, if all the directors were not present at the first meeting, is at least doubtful, in reference to business of an extraordinary character. The entry of an adjournment was made for some purpose, and was thought necessary or proper by some person, for some purpose ; but, from the appearance of the minutes, in connexion with the testimony, I think it was not made in accordance with the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\">As to the resolution appearing on the minutes as of January 5th, 1842, directing the president to execute the bond and mortgage and affix thereto a common seal, the book of minutes furnishes no evidence to he relied upon, that it was passed at a, meeting on duo notice, at which three directors, besides Stebbins, were present\u2014no evidence that it was passed by a legal board. And Yan Renselaer, who from the minutes would appear to have been present, says he has no recollection that at a meeting of the board an order was made directing a mortgage to he given to Stebbins. He says ho knows a mortgage was given, sanctioned by the board, and that he consented to it. This does not prove that he was present at the meeting which, he says, sanctioned it; and the consent of an individual director, not sitting in a legal board, is nugatory. If Van Renselaer was not present, then it could only have been sanctioned at a meeting of three, of whom Stebbins was one, for it is shown that Ibbotson was absent, out of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">If I am right in the conclusion to which I have come from an examination of the book of minutes and of the testimony, then the resolution appearing on the minutes as of January 5th, 1842, directing a bond and mortgage to be given to Steffi bins, depends for its efficacy, on a simple entry of a resolution, on minutes of very suspicious appearance, without any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>.statement 'of a meeting of the board, without stating who were present, or the presence of any one, without any proof of notice of the meeting, and without proof aliunde that a board was present, and against the testimony of one of the directors that he has no recollection of such a resolution being passed at any meeting of the board, and against the presumption of the absence of another of the five directors, Ibbotson, arising from his non-residence. It appears to me that it would be going too far, to sajr that such an entry as that of this resolution of January 5th, is binding on the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\">Again, this was a business of an extraordinary character, the mortgaging the real estate of the corporation. Is an entry in the minutes, even if free from suspicion, that the meeting was held on due notice, sufficient evidence of it, if it appears, as it does here, that all the directors did not attend? Indeed, the true reading of the heading under which this was introduced, is, that it was on due notice to the directors who attended.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">On the question, then, whether this bond and mortgage were legally given, so as to bind the corporation, there are several matters about .which I am not satisfied. I am not satisfied that under this charter, the concurrence of less than three affirmative voices out of the five directors, will bind; nor that the meetings which passed the .resolutions of January 5th, and \"January 10th, 1842, were duly assembled; nor that three of the directors besides Stebbins voted for either of them.; nor that Stebbins, with two other directors, could constitute a board to direct a mortgage to be given to him. But as to these matters, I do not give a decided opinion. My view of the case on another ground of defence, has led me to a conclusion satisfactory to my mind, and I shall decide the cause on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The ground of defence now to be examined, is, that the mortgage was giyen to Stebbins as the agent .of the .company, to enable him to raise money for the company, on his representation to the directors that the money needed by the company could not be raised on the bond and mortgage of the company direct to any lender; or after failure so to raise money, and on his representation that he could raise it on a bond and mortgage of the company executed to him, by an assignment of it to some person, allowing the lender a premium or greater rate of inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>est than the legal interest, and that this was the only way in which the money could be raised: and that the mortgage was given under such circumstances (which it is contended are shown in evidence) that to enforce it against the company would be a fraud on the directors and the company ; in short, that as a <em>mortgage </em>of the company to be used by Stebbins against them, it was procured by fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\">If these papers were obtained for the purpose of raising money for the company, and are fraudulently attempted to be used by the party obtaining them, as securities given to him for his own benefit, it will be considered that when he obtained them, and in using the means of obtaining them, he entertained the design of using them for liis own benefit, and that therefore he obtained them fraudulently.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">I am of opinion that the bond and mortgage were not good iu the hands of Stebbins against the .company. He acted as the general and financial agent of the company. (It is not material to the present purpose, to inquire whether such an agent can be legally appointed, and a director can be such an agent.) On the 1st of January, 1841, a resolution appears on the minutes of a meeting at which Gaston, Van Renselaer, Stebbins and Packer are stated to have been present, authorizing Stebbins to negotiate a loan of any sum not exceeding $5000, and to give a, bond of the company and a mortgage on their factory and the lot on which it stands, to secure the payment thereof. On the 23d of August, 1841, a resolution appears, without any heading of a meeting or statement who were present, that J. N. Stebbins, agent of the Somerville Manufacturing Company, is authorized to loan money from the State Bank at Elizabethtown, from time to time, by notes or drafts, provided the liability of said company shall not at any time exceed $1500. On the 5th of January, 1842, two resolutions appear, one, a resolution that a bond and mortgage be executed to the State Bank at Elizabeth, to secure the personal liability of the president and directors of the Somerville Manufacturing Company to said Bank, for money loaned or to be loaned, the sum not to exceed $1500; the other, a resolution \u201cthat the president is hereby authorized and directed to execute a bond and mortgage to Jared N. Stebbins, for $9600. payable in three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>years from date, tire .interest to .be paid annually and every year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\">Each of these resolutions, except the last, shows on its face the object for which the securities mentioned in it are to be given. The last simply authorizes and directs the president to execute a bond and mortgage to Jared N. Stebbins for $9600, without stating the reason or the object or .purpose why or for which it was to be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The first resolution is, that Stebbins negotiate a loan of $5000, on the bond and mortgage of the company to the lender. This mode of borrowing .money failed. Through the course of the year, other means were used for borrowing money, with some success, but not to the amount required ; and on the 5th of January, 1842, the last of the said resolutions was adopted, (supposing for this part of the case .that it was legally adopted,) directing a bond and mortgage to be given to Stebbins, without saying for what reason or consideration ; and Stebbins now claims that this mortgage is a valid security in his hands, and seeks to enforce it against the company. This would be the state of the matter as between Stebfoins and the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Three of the persons who were directors at the time of the \u25a0transaction, have been sworn in the cause\u2014two of them called on the part of the defendants, and the other on the part of the complainant\u2014-in reference to the object of giving the mortgage, and the manner and means in and by which those of the directors who voted for it, were induced to do so. [The testimony on this part of the case is here examined.]</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The closing counsel for the complainant contended, that the amount of the testimony was this; that Stebbins was to raise the money on the mortgage given to him for his debt, and to appropriate some $2000 or $3000 of it to pay the debts of the company, and to make advances as one interested in the company. This explanation is hardly satisfactory. The conclusion I have reached is, that as a bond and mortgage to be used by Stebbins against the company, they were procured by fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">The next question is, will the bond and mortgage be good in the hands of Van Hook, if he be a bona fide holder? The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>case of <em>Barrow </em>v. <em>Bispham, </em>in the supreme court of this state, G <em>Halst. </em>11.9, decides, that the assignee of a bond takes it subject to all the equities which existed against it in the hands of the obligee, and that fraud in the obligee in obtaining it is a good defence against the assignee, though he purchased it for a valuable consideration and without notice of the fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\">This principle may not be fully applicable to this case. These securities, (assuming now that they were legally executed,) were executed to Stebbins, the agent, to enable him to raise money for the company by an assignment of them. If the agent had used them in the manner contemplated, and obtained the money, the company would be liable on them, though the agent failed to apply the money to the use of the company. Can securities made to an agent to be by him assigned to raise money for the company, be resisted, in the hands of a <em>bona fide </em>assignee, on the ground that he assigned them for real estate, for purposes of his own ? I am inclined to think that the rule in 6 <em>Halst. </em>should not be applied in this court, in a case like this, against a purchaser in good faith and without notice. Is the complainant such an assignee <em>1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">First, as to good faith, irrespective of notice. In this inquiry it must be borne in mind, that Stebbins, in the measures taken during the progress of what he called the negotiation, was acting with the knowledge that the mortgage was executed to him' to raise money for the company, and yet, with the design, as-proved by the result, of making it available for his own benefit, I think it cannot, be doubted that he was acting under the conviction that it would be resisted, if attempted to be used by <em>him </em>against the company as a mortgage for his own benefit. His object, then, would be to get it into the hands of one who-should claim as assignee; and to get as much as he could from the' officers of the company to strengthen the claim of the assignee, I think it will be manifest, that the whole course of proceeding1 connected with the assignment, is consistent only with this design on the part of Stebbins, and is inconsistent with the idea that the complainant was a real purchaser in good faith. Noman, acting with sincerity and good faith, would have been satisfied to buy this mortgage and pay for it on the credit of the papers which Stebbins- procured from the president and secretary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>of the company. And' I am clearly of opinion that he never did buy and pay for this mortgage\u2014a' mortgage on a manufacturing site without water power, and to which a lease of water had been refused. The certificates, and suppletory resolutions, of copies of what purported to be resolutions, were procured by Stebbins, and at his instance, with a view to aid the mortgage in the hands' of an assignee for his own benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\">A certificate of John I. Gaston, and another writing signed by him which it is difficult to characterize, and a copy of what purports to be a resolution' of June 28th, 1842, are exhibited ori the part of the complainant. The certificate is dated June 28th, 1842, and is signed John-1. Gaston, without addition, and purports to certify, that a bond and mortgage for $\u00a19600, was given and executed by him to J. N. Stebbins, as president of the Somerville Manufacturing Company, by order of the board of directors, as said amount was due him as agent of the company, and that he knew of nothing that could be brought against said claim in abatement or in any way destroy its validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">The resolution of June 28t'h, 1842, of which a copy is exhibited, signed J. A. Gaston, secretary, is as follows:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\u201cAt a meeting held June 28th, 1842, the following preamble and resolution were adopted.- Whereas a certain bond and mortgage, given by the Somerville Manufacturing Company to Jared N. Stebbins, for the sum of $\u00a19600, bearing date the 10th day of January, 1842, has been this day submitted to the inspection of this board; and the same having been considered and examined: It is resolved, that the said bond and mortgage is a legal and subsisting liability of the said company, and that they have no defence to make to the same, either in law or equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\u201cJune 28th, 1842. J. A. Gaston, secretary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">A letter had been written by Stebbins to Gaston, from New-York, dated March 29th,- 1842, in which he says, he finds obstacles in the way of negotiation; that he wants a certificate from Gaston, as president, that the bond and mortgage is a valid one, given him for the amount due him. On the 28th of June, 1842, he receives the foregoing paper, signed by John I. Gaston, not as president, and stating, not \u201c that the bond and mortgage were' valid, given him for the amount due him,\u201d as requested by the letter, but, that they were given and executed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>to Stebbins, \u201c as said \u00abamount was due said Stebbius <em>m </em>agent of the company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\">If the mortgage bad been given to Stebbins for an amount due him, why was it that Gaston not only omits to sign as president, but falls short of saying what the letter asks ? The truth of Gaston\u2019s deposition, that ho gave the certificate for the same purpose the bond and mortgage were given for\u2014to enable him (Stebbius) to make the loan---to aid him in making the loan; and that he never gave Stebbins a certificate that the company had given him the bond and mortgage for any debt due him from the company, io confirmed by the language of this so-called certificate. Gaston was willing to say as much as he could in aid of that object: but the restraint of the language of the certificate is manifest. The design of Stebbins, before spoken of, is obvious from the language of the letter. In view of the fact, as it appears by the result, that Stebbins was about putting these papers in the hands of an assignee, for a deed to his son of property in New-York, it is plain that he was availing himself of the pressure on the company for mo - ney, to procure from the president what he cupposed might give effect to the mortgage in the hands of an assignee. But Gas-ton, even under the pressing necessities of the company, would not give the certificate asked, though acting under the belief that Stebbins was honestly endeavoring to negotiate the mortgage for money for the company. This certificate is exhibited by the complainant to show good faith in him in taking the assignment. (It will be recollected that the negotiation, as Stebbins called it, which ended in the alleged trade for the New-\"York property', commenced some months before the 28th of June.) Did the complainant require the certificate Stebbins wrote for <em>1 </em>If he did not, then its procurement by Stebbins, and its production now by the complainant, are consistent only with the design of Stebbins before stated and with a want of good faith in the complainant. If it was at his suggestion that Stebbins wrote on the 29th of March, asking the certificate mentioned in that letter, would what Stebbins, after the lapse of three months, procured, have been satisfactory to one proposing in good faith to buy the mortgage ?- Its language was short of what the letter asked, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>it was not signed by Gaston as president; and if what was requested to be certified was true, Gaston could have had no hesitation in giving the certificate in the language of the letter and signing.it- as- president; and besides; the certificate, if given as required, would be no evidence whatever of the fact it, purported to certify. The only object that could have been had in procuring it- was, that it might furnish some evidence of good faith in the complainant in taking the assignment. The resort to such-means, in view of the inquiries he put and of others he failed to put to Gaston, when Stebbins-took him out to Somerville, are little calculated to show his good faith; or to satisfy us that a man-of the business- capacity of the complainant would or did part with his property, and put it out of his control, on the faith of such a paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\">But this letter of Stebbins went further; and said, \u201c The best way is, to copy the resolution on the books, provided there is nothing else in the said resolution.\u201d An entry of a resolution appears on1 the minutes, of the same date with the said certificate, (June 28th, 1842:) it is the entry., a copy of which, signed J'. A. Gaston, secretary, is before given. This entry and the copy of it signed by the secretary, and the above certificate of Gaston; were made for the purpose of removing the obstacles whieh Stebbins said he found in the way of negotiation. Stebbins wanted a resolution \u201cthat the bond and mortgage is a valid one, given-him for the amount due him,\u201d \u201cprovided there is-nothing else in said resolution ;\u201d and he wanted the certificate of the president to- -the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">To show Stebbins\u2019s idea of the way in which things might be done, and the boldness with which he availed himself of the pressure on the company for money, in order to get'from Gas-ton something, which he hoped might make the mortgage good in the hands of an assignee, we have only to- ask how, according to kis-notions;. such, a resolution and certificate-were to be made. Ibbotson- was absent ;\u25a0 Van Renselaer- lived out of the state, a-nd he testifies that- <em>\u201c </em>he knew nothing of the resolutions of the board, or the certificates of the president, in relation to the mortgage, at the time of the transfer to Van Hook, or of the machinery by which said resolutions and certificates were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>obtained which resulted in the negotiation of the mortgage, he not having been present at any of the meetings of the board when the resolutions were passed and the certificates were given and Stebbins was in New-York when be wrote the letter. This left but two of the directors, Gaston and Packer, to comply with the requirements of his letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-3\">How it is that this certificate and entry of a resolution and copy of it wrere not made til! June 28th, does not appear. Three months elapsed before the certificate, such as it was, was given. I suppose the truth to be, that Stebbins\u2019s immediate presence and aid were necessary to procure them; and inasmuch as Yan Hook could not make a deed for the New-York property till after he should get a deed for it under his foreclosure suit, and Stebbins could make no arrangement with any one else to take an assignment of the mortgage, the delay worked no injury to either of them. What would be the effect of the delay on the mind of a person intending, in good faith, to buy the mortgage, is another matter. But the entry of this resolution was at length made, and the copy .of if and the certificate of Gaston, as above given, were procured. The resolution w7as either caused to be entered by Gaston alone, or by Stebbins and Gaston, or at best at a meeting composed of Gaston, Stebbins and Packer. Packer says, be cannot say whether lie was present or not. And if he w7as, it would not be a competent board for the purpose, for the reason, that if it was, then a mortgage to one of five directors might be declared to be a legal and subsisting liability of the company by a vote of that director and one other. But this entry is, in its terms, still less -a .compliance with the request than the certificate of Gaston; and as -to the form of it, it is headed thus: \u201cAt a meeting held June 28th, 1842, the following preamble and resolution were passed.\u201d Who were present at the meeting? where was it held ? by whom was the resolution passed ? It cannot be that the complainant in good faith bought the mortgage on the credit of the papers .exhibited by him in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">Another paper is exhibited on the part of the complainant: it is the one which I have before said it is difficult to characterize ; a writing at the foot of a statement of Stebbins\u2019s account against the company. It is in .the hand-writing of John I. Gas-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>\u2022ton, and reads thus:\u2014\u201c The board of directors having examined the above account, do pass the same, and acknowledge a balance due J. N. Stebbins of $9638 17. Signed by order of the board, Jno. I. Gaston, president.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\">\u201c January 5th, 1842.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">What is the character of this writing ? It does not purport lo be a certified copy of a resolution; but would rather seem to \u2022purport -to be an original resolution, or perhaps more like a certificate of Gaston that such a thing was done. When was it furnished, or sent, or given to Stebbins? There can be no \u2022doubt it -was one of the papers sent or given to Stebbins in compliance with his request in his letter of March 29th, 1842, or \u2022on a similar request further urged by him afterwards; and hence the singularity of its form. The date put to it is not the date at which this writing, or certificate, or whatever it may be Called, was made, but purports to be the date at which what is said in the writing to have been done, was done. The form of -this writing adds another proof that all the exhibits on the part of the complainant were got up long subsequently to the execution of the mortgage, at the instance of Stebbins, to serve bis design; and -that the nature of the transaction between Stebbins and the complainant, as it finally resulted, was different .from that of a bona fide purchase of this bond and mortgage. Does Gaston, by this writing, say, that the board passed such a resolution on the 5th of January, 1842 ? Certainly not. If such a resolution had been passed at that date, and then placed on the minutes, it cannot be imagined that such a non-descript writing as this would have been resorted to; a copy of such resolution, if it had been so passed, made in such a way as to satisfy a man proposing in good faith to buy the bond and mortgage, would have been required and made. The production of such a paper amounts to less than .nothing on the question of the good faith of the complainant. \u201c The board of directors, having examined,\u201d &amp;c. Is this the form of a resolution as it would appear on the minutes? The .very form of this waiting, instead of giving satisfaction, carries plain'and strong marks of suspicion. Who were present when any such resolution was passed ? who constituted, or pretended fq constitute, a board to pass it? and how were they assenv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>bled ? was Stebbins himself one of them <em>1 </em>As to these matters the writing is silent. And, what is quite as singular, Gaston, though produced as a witness in the cause on the part of the defendants, was not shown this writing by the complainant, nor asked when or where any such resolution was passed. Why Stebbins should not have the question asked is sufficiently plain, but why the complainant, if he was a bona fide assignee, having produced this paper to show his good faith, should omit to do so, I am at a loss to understand. The production of these papers, exhibited on the part of the complainant, furnishes no evidence of his good faith in this transaction: in my judgment they disprove it. If he was acting in good faith he would not have relied on writings of such a character, and produced to him by Stebbins, .the man from whom he was to take the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-3\">But it was thought best that Van Hook should seem to have made inquiries for himself, and accordingly he rides out to Somerville with Stebbins. He stops at John I. Gaston\u2019s; does not not go to see the property. Gaston testifies, that Van Hook made no inquiry about the mortgage being given to Stebbius for a debt due to Stebbins; nor any inquiry as to the means of the company for completing the works; nor any inquiry as to the water power, or whether a lease for water could be procured ; nor, though on the spot, does he make any inquiry for the minutes, or as to the action of the board in reference to the giving of the mortgage. Gaston's testimony on this part of the case is as follows: \u201c Mr. Van Hook stopped at my door and told me he had come out to see about loaning Stebbins <em>the money </em>on the bond and mortgage. I told him we wanted about $10,000 to set the property a-going and pay the debts, and that Stebbins said that sum would do it; that 1 considered the property would he worth $20,000 when in operation.\u201d <em>\u201c </em>I told him that if he had the <em>money </em>to spare, he could not put it out more safely; that we were anxious to get the <em>money </em>and have the works in operation. Mr. Van Hook said he could furnish the <em>money </em>if he was satisfied with the security, but that he did not wish to run any risk, as he had already lost some money before on loans made for other persons.\u201d \u201c Van Hook made nevera! inquiries as to the value of the property.\u201d \u201c I never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>made the least intimation to him, or any other person, that the money was to be raised for the benefit of Stebbins.\u201d \u201cMr. Van Hook did not inquire as to the means of the company for completing the works; but 1 told him that if we could obtain the <em>money </em>on the bond and mortgage, we'would be able to put the works in operation, and that then the property would be valuable.\u201d Let it be recollected here that Van Hook claims to recover on this mortgage on the allegation that he gave a deed for <em>real estate </em>for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\">Again, at a meeting of the Water Power Company, said to have been in June or July, 1842, Stebbins said he could not negotiate the mortgage'without a lease of water for the use of the Somerville Manufacturing Company. He had before written to Gaston, saying, \u201c I have found a person who has $10,000 to loan at seven per cent, and will let me have it on the mortgage, provided the property on which it is a lien is worth $20,000; \"but he objects until I get some certainty for water without any question ; he does not like any chance of a law-suit. It must he a first mortgage. This can be got along with, either by paying up the $1500, or keeping it back, as we shall hereafter agree upon.\u201d This letter was produced on the part of the defendants. It shows the design of Stebbins. The mortgage would be of no value without a lease of water. Then i\u00f1 June or July he still presses the Water Power Company for a lease of water, saying he could not negotiate the mortgage without it, and it is refused;' and it is quite clear from the testimony, that without water the property as it then stood was of little value, compared with the sura named in the mortgage. But the effort to get the lease fails; yet this failure to procure water makes no difference to the complainant, the alleged exchange proceeds, notwithstanding, and Van Hook takes an assignment of the mortgage, not paying money, which Gaston told him they wanted, to put the -works in operation and make the property valuable and good security for the money, but making a deed of real estate to Stebbins\u2019s son, and telling us by his witness, the land broker, that Stebbins\u2019s son made a mortgage on that real estate to a Mr. Morgan.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Again, the conversation between Van Hook and Gaston, in which Van Hook, while this alleged trade for real property was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>going on, told Gaston that he had come out to see about loaning the <em>money, </em>and that he could furnish the <em>money </em>if he was satisfied with the security, and in which Gaston told him what is before stated to have been told him by Gaston in that conversation, of what the money was wanted for and how it was to be applied, shows, in my judgment, to the conscience of a court of equity, both <em>snggestio falsi </em>and <em>suppressio veri </em>on the part of Yan Hook.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\">\u25a0 Can it be believed that a- man acting in good \u00ed\u00e1itb, and really intending to give real estate for this mortgage, would have made such a representation to Gaston, or, on receiving the information Gaston gave him, would have omitted to inform Gas-ton that Stebbins proposed to trade the mortgage for real estate in New-York? Can there be a doubt that if he had done so, as he most assuredly was required in honesty to do, the company would have taken immediate means to- protect themselves-against the faithlessness and designs of Stebbins?</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">This part of the case is consistent with all the features of the transaction, as well those before examined as the subsequent parts of it; aad, instead of showing good faith in Yan Hook, it makes him a party to the fraud of Stebbins. I cannot understand how a man acting in good faith could proceed with the trade after this;. but I think I can understand how two men, determining to proceed after this, should proceed as they did; that is, have the deed from Yan Hook for the New-York property made to Stebbins\u2019s son, (who, it will be recollected it is testified, when a subpoena to appear as a witness was handed to him, read it and said he did not know what it was; that he did not know any thing about it; that he did not know Yan Hook;) and have Stebbins\u2019s son make a mortgage to one John B. Morgan. Again I ask, could a-man ingeod faith, on the production of such papers, and after the information he got from Gaston, have bought and paid for this mortgage? It requires stronger faith in the complainant\u2019s simplicity than I have, to believe it.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The closing scene of the transaction is just such as was to be looked for. No evidence was given to show when the assignment to the complainant, or the deed to the son, or the mortgage made by the son, was delivered; but it appears tha&amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>an assignment of the bond and mortgage was left, by Stebbins, in the office of the' clerk of Somerset, and recorded after the 9th of August, 1842 j that on the 8th of September, 1842, the report of the master ih chancery in New-York, of the sale of the New-York property to Yan Hook, was confirmed unless cause to\u2019 the contrary should be shown in eight days; and that the deed for that property, from the master in chancery in New-York to Yan Hook, was recorded on the 19th of September, 1842; and the mortgage from Stebbins\u2019s son to Morgan is <em>dated </em>August 23d, 1842.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\">The complainant\u2019s' witness, Jones, would seem to ask as to suppose that young Mr. Stebbins, under these circumstances, borrowed $8000 on the mortgage executed by him of this New-York property, dated August 23d. It would have been a relief if Mr. Morgan, or somebody acquainted with this part of the transaction, had been examined; to tell us something about this mortgage, when it was delivered, and to whom, and what given for. If it was given for the benefit of Jared N. Stebbins, and had no connexion with the transactions between Yan Hook and him, and Yan Hook actually parted with the New-York property and has no control over it by means of this mortgage to Morgan, it would have been very easy for J. N. Stebbins or Yan Hook to produce evidence to satisfy us of this; and Stebbins, as well as Yan Hook, wa3 interested to do so. Instead of this, and though Yan Hook,- under the pressure of the case in another view of it, puts forward this mortgage from Stebbins\u2019s son, no account of it is given, except that Jones, a witness produced by the complainant, and who produced a <em>certified copy of the </em>mortgage, says, that' he had seen it in New-York the morning of the day of his examination, in the hands of one Edward P. Clark, and that <em>\u201c </em>he could not get the original out of the office; they refused to let him have it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">More light might be thrown upon the subject by examining Jones\u2019s testimony in connexion with a fact of which he did not speak, and which was not alluded to by the counsel on either side, for the reason, I presume, that the voluminous record of the proceedings in the chancery suit in New-York was not read by either of them; and that is, the fact that some time before the sale of the New-York property by the sheriff to Yan Hook, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Bowen, against whom the decree in that case was made, had become insolvent and made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors. But I forbear to say more of this matter, than that we hear nothing of any assignment of that decree either to J. \"N. Stebbins or to his son. In view of this fact, this part of the case is to be a^ded to the pretences.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\">It appears to me, that under the proofs in the cause, irrespective of notice, the complainant is not entitled to be considered a bona fide purchaser, and, therefore, is not entitled to the application of equitable considerations to relieve him from the rule in <em>Barrow </em>v. Bispham.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">I am of opinion, further, that the information he received from the president of the company, was sufficient notice to take from him the character of a bona fide purchaser without notice, if without that information he could have been considered such.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The bill will be dismissed'.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Order' accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
