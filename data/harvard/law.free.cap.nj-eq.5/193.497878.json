I order the sum of $1500 to be put at interest by my executors, and the interest added to the principal from time to time, or the interest put at interest; and the one half of said sum, with one half of the interest which may have accrued when my granddaughter Mary Louisa Cook arrives at the age of twenty-one years, I order to-be paid to her; or if she dies before that time leaving issue her surviving, I order her said share to be paid to her child or children; and the remaining half of the said money, with the remainder of the interest,- I order to be paid to my grandson Joseph Cook; when he arrives at the age of twenty-one years; but if he dies before he arrives at the age aforesaid, leaving issue, I order his said share to be paid to his child or children; and if either the said Mary Louisa or the said Joseph die before arriving at the age aforesaid and without leaving issue, then I give the whole of the said sum and interest to the survivor of them; or if one of them die before arriving of age and leave issue, and the other die before arriving of age and without issue him or her surviving, then I give the whole of said moneys to the child or children of the one so dying and leaving issue.\u201d X\"</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>\u201c 12th; All the residue of my estate, after the payment of ihy debts and expenses, and the legacies herein before devised, I give to my grandchildren Sarah Richman, Mary Louisa Cook, Joseph Cook and Mary Cook, to be equally divided between them, each one to receive his or her share thereof as him or her attains the age of twenty-one years; and if any one of them dies before Kim or her attains the age of twenty-one years, leaving issue him or her surviving, - then,1 to the issue of him or her so dying I give the share which the parent-or parents of such issue would have been entitled to under this devise ; but if any one or more of my said grandchildren die before attaining the age of twenty-one years, and without' issue surviving him or her, then I' give his-or her share of this devi\u00e1e' to the survivors and to the issue of him-or her dying leaving issue, the issue of any one to have the same the parent of such child would have been entitled to under the devise.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-4\">That on or about' the 7th of January,-1841, the executors proved the will, and by virtue thereof possessed themselves of all the estate that was of the -testatrix, amounting to $10,000 and upwards. That..on or about June 9th, 1842, the said Mary Louisa Cook was.married to Richard M.

Second, that by the will the money was not payable until the time at which Mary Louisa Cook would have attained twenty-one years of age if she had lived, and that the bill does not show that that time had arrived-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>He cited 3 Atkyns, 101, 102, 114, 427, 428; 3 <em>Vesey, </em>10, 12.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b195-5\">P. <em>D.

The will only postpones the time of payment. But in reference to both clauses there is a gift over to the issue of the legatee dying before twenty-one, leaving issue. The will gives half, with the interest thereon, to one when she arrives at twenty-one, and half, with the interest thereon, to the other when he arrives at twent.y-one; and provides that if either die under twenty-one, leaving children, the half shall be paid to his or her children; and that if either die under twenty-one, without leavingissue, the other, or the children he or she, if dea$fe*st!$nS8$$l^ft, shall have the whole. <em>r</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">If one die under age leaving children, does this will inquire us to say that these children shall have nothing unless and until they live to the time when their defeased parent would have attained twenty-one, if he or she had lived? I see nothing in the language of the will, or in the nature of provisions, requiring or authorizing such a construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">The demurrer will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Order accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
