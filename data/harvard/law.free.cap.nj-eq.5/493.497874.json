That the said account was the joint account of the executors, and was sworn to by each of them, and was reported by the surrogate of Monmouth to the orphans\u2019 court of the county; and that the said court; in April, 1842, decreed that ithe same be allowed in all things.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-4\">The defendants answered separately.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-5\">David Fisher, -in his answer, admits the account exhibited .and settled by the executors in the orphans\u2019 court, as stated in \u25a0.the bill.; and says, that by joining with his co-executor in \u25a0having the accounts so stated and reported by the surrogate it \u25a0was not his intention to make himself chargeable for any more -of the assets than had come to his hand, and that he was so advised by his counsel and believed, when he joined in the account; it being necessary to have their accounts so settled, to -ascertain the general balance, to determine the respective shares \u25a0of the residuary legatees. He .says that $11,158 81, of the -balance of the said amount, was received by him, and that it was fully laid out and disbursed, to those entitled to receive it \u25a0under the will; and that the residue of said balance, viz. $2773 25, was received by Robbins; and that of that sum there is yet in Robbins\u2019s hands, as he believes, some $1200, to be paid out and distributed under the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-6\">That he and Robbins have at all times kept separate ac.counts of the assets which have come to their hands respectively, and taken separate vouchers for their respective disbursements ; and that he has fully paid out and disbursed all that .came to his hands.

That he is insolvent; and that on the 8th February, 1845, he was declared a bankrupt, and has obtained a certificate of his discharge.

In each the balance found in the hands .of- the executors is stated thus: <em>!! </em>Balance in hands of accountants,- to be disposed of agreeably to will of testator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">The balance found in- their hands by the last account was #13,932 06-|.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">Robbins was, in February, 1843, decreed to be bankrupt: The answer would seem to say that #1237 69 of the balance of the said joint account of the executors was in the hands of Robbins. Fisher paid in full four of the five residuary legatees,each entitled to a fifth of the balance of the said joint account,- and more than half of the remaining fifth.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">If #1237.69,- or any other portion of the balance of the joint-account of the executors was in the hands of Robbins, can Fisher,- after paying, four shares in full, relieve himself from-the payment of the other share by paying half of it and showing that he has no' more of the balance of-the joint accounts in his hands, and that the other executor had received the resF due of that balance?</p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">This is \u00b0a question which should -be well considered before-deciding it in the affirmative. It strikes me it would be a dangerous doctrine. But I am not satisfied that any part of the balance found by the joint account in the hands of the executors can, under the pleadings and proofs in the case, be consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>ered to be in the hands of Robbins and not in the hands of Fisher. A note of Robbins to the testator, of about $1500, was included in the inventory. In the second account of the executors they charge themselves, \u201c April 8th, 1839, cash received of George Robbins, on account of his note, \u00a7600;\u201d and <em>\u201c </em>April 6th, 1840, cash received of George Robbins, in full of his note, 0984 50.\u201d I also find that certain debts due the estate, and which are included in the inventory, amounting in all, at their appraised value, to $1471 46, arc not included in the balance struck in the joint account,, and that no allowance is prayed for them as bad or doubtful debts. Whether Robbins bad received them, and Fisher was therefore unwilling to have' them charged in the joint account, does not appear. The charging themselves in a joint account with cash received of Robbins in full of his note due the estate, no explanation of the charge being made in the case, makes both of the executors chargeable to the legatees for that amount, and' so far as it constitutes a part of the balance struck in the joint account Fisher is liable for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-3\">In view of this, and of the fact that 01471 46' of the assets of the estate is not included in the balance struck against the executors, and may, for aught that appears, be in the hands of Robbins, both the answers may be true in the sense in which they have been1 sworn'to, and yet the whole of the balance of the accounts, as stated and allowed, be in the hands of Fisher; charging him with the debt acknowledged in the joint account to have been received from Robbins.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">Fisher, in his answer, says, that on the 8th of April, 1839, he paid to the complainant 0412, in part payment of his share of the residue of the personal estate, and took his receipt therefor. Two hundred dollars of this 0412 consisted of a note which Fisher procured to be given by Robbins to complainant, and which was never paid; and Fisher at that time had, or must be considered to have had in- hand, (he being liable, as before observed, for, or having actually received the amount of Robbins\u2019s note due the estate,) the 0200 for which, instead of paying it in money to the complainant, he got Robbins to give his note to the complainant. This note was no payment by cither of the defendants to the complainant; and the receipt takess. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>by Fisher'from the complainant for $412 is, therefore, good-only for $212.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\">That no refunding bond was tendered before filing the bib-is no defence in this court. The court- can provide, in the decree, for the giving of a refunding bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">I am of opinion that'both the executors are liable to the complainant for the balance remaining unpaid to him of his shareof the residue of the personal estate of the testator, according to the amount of the said residue as- ascertained by- the said-joint account of the executors;</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Decree accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
