But one who is not made a party, and between whom and the party there is no privity, is not bound by the decree. There is no privity between the executor and the heir or devisee. 1 <em>Paige </em>35; 1 <em>Munf. </em>437; 4 <em>Harr, and John. </em>126, 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">In the case in <em>Munford, </em>the bill was against the executors and devisees ; no proof of the claim was offered, except a judgment against the executors. The court held it was no proof against the devisees.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">The debt of the ancestor, or devisor, should be establish'ed in a suit in which the heirs, or devisees, are parties, and in which they can contest it.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">The effect of the demurrer is not to admit the debt, but to submit to the court the question whether, on the fact stated in the bill, that a decree was obtained in a suit against the executors, a decree can be made against the devisees in this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">The demurrer is allowed, with leave to the complainants to amend their bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">Order accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
