The complainants had sold to J. W. Blydenburgh, a tract of land in this state, and taken his bond for a part of the consideration money, with seven per cent, interest, and his mortgage on the lands sold, to secure the payment of the bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-7\">Both parties resided in New-York, and the papers were executed and acknowledged there, but were exchanged in this state, at the clerk\u2019s office of the county in which the lands are situated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-8\">A moitgage on the same lands, from Blydenburgh to Wads-worth, a witness in the cause, was executed and acknowledged in New-York, at or about the time when the mortgage to the complainants was executed and acknowledged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-9\">Wadsworth testified, that he met Blydenburgh at the complainants\u2019 office in New-York, a few days after the mortgages were acknowledged, for the purpose of having the mortgages delivered, and of Blydenburgh\u2019s getting his deed. That at this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>time, there was a proposition made as to the exchange and delivery of the papers. That one of- the complainants' objected to delivering the deed, unless he could be sure that the mortgage to them was put on record before the mortgage to the witness. That he was present at a subsequent- interview between the same parties, or some of them, in relation to the same subject,at the office of Mr. Feltus, a counsellor at law in New-York,who acted as&gt; counsel for the complainants ; and that' at' this interview it was understood that Blydenburgh and one of the, complainants should meet,- with their papers, at the place of record in New-Jersey, the next day, for the purpose of having the papers recorded in- the .proper order.- That it was agreed that the witness\u2019s mortgage should be second.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-3\">The defence set up by the answer is, that the mortgage was usurious.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-4\">The cause was heard on the pleadings and proofs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b18-5\"><em>Leupp, </em>for the complainants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AG\">cited <em>17 John.

All the parties to this contract resided in New-York at th.e time it was made. The bond and mortgage both truly state the parties, obligor and obligees, and mortgagor and mortgagees, \u00e1s of the city of New-York; The papers were executed in New-York, the mortgage is acknowledged in New-York. It is clearly a New-York transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-10\">A., residing in New-York, lends B., also residing in New-York, a sum of money, and takes his bond for it payable in one year, at New-York interest, seven per cent. To securer the.bond, the borrower gives the lender a mortgage on lands in New-Jersey. It would be- a singular application of the <em>lex loci </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number><em>re\u00ed </em>sitae,, to say, that because this New-York contract is secured by a mortgage on lands in New-Jersey, where the legal interest is six per cent, only, it is void for usury, or even to say that the lender shall receive only New-Jersey interest: 3 <em>Atk. 727, Stapleton </em>v. <em>Conway.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b19-5\">Another ground relied on by the defendant was, that the bond and mortgage, though executed, witnessed and acknowledged in New-York, were actually delivered at the clerk\u2019s office in New-Brunswick, New-Jersey, and not in New-York. I do not see that the mere fact of the exchange of the papers in some place out of New-York, deprives it of the character of a New-York contract. But in this case, the reason why it was done is manifest. It was done by arrangement between the parties, and by the advice of the complainants\u2019 counsel, in order that the complainants might be sure that their mortgage found its right place on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-6\">As to the rate of interest in New-York, it is sufficiently proved in the case, if it were necessary to prove it. But it was not necessary. The defence is usury by the law of New-Jersey. This defence cannot be made in relation to a New-York contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-7\">The defence is overcome by showing that this was a contract not subject to the New-Jersey statute. If the contract was usurious in New-York, it was for the defendant to show it, in pleading and proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-8\">The complainants are entitled to the relief sought by their bill. The usual reference -will ba ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-9\">Order accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
