But one who is not made a party, and between whom and the party there is no privity, is not bound by the decree. There is no privity between the executor and the heir or devisee: 1 Paige, 35; 1 <em>Munf. </em>437; 4 <em>Harr, and John. </em>126, 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">In the case in <em>Munford, </em>the bill .was against the executors ,\u00e1nd devisees; no proof of,the claim was offered, except a judgment against the executors. The court held .it .was no proof against the devisees.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The debt of the ancestor, or devisor, should be established in a suit in which the heirs, or devisees, are parties, a,nd in which .they can contest it.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">The effect of the demurrer is not to admit the debt; hut .to submit to the court the question, whether, on the .fact stated in .the bill, that a decree was obtained in a suit against the executors, a decree can be made against the devisees in this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">The demurrer is allowed, with -leave to the complainants to amend their bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">Order accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
