At the December term, 1842, application was made to that court-to decree and settle the distribution of the surplus. The three grandchildren claimed a full seventh, in right of their deceased father. This was resisted by the surviving children, on the ground that James, the deceased son, had, as they claimed, been advanced by the intestate in his life time. A judgment in favor of Michael Allen, against his son James, for 700 dollars debt and 5 dollars costs, was entered in the common pleas of .Gloucester, on a bond and warrant of attorney, on the 15th of June, 1835. Execution was issued on this judgment, and put into the hands of the sheriff of Gloucester, in the life .time ,of James. After .the death o.f James, Michael Allen signed a writing at the foot of the execution, in these words :\u2014\u201c I hereby discharge J. W.

Slie heard him say, he had let James have money before she came to live with him. She knew James to <em>get </em>of his father, after she went to live with him, 110 dollars in pork and 40 dollars in cash. She recollects intestate\u2019s telling her he \u2018had advanced to James as much as he thought proper at that, time. He told her, one day, that the law made a will good enough for him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-3\">Being cross-examined, she said, James died about six years before the time of her examination as a witness. Michael Allen died in 1840. James was not present at any of the conversations she had with Michael. Michael charged the 110 dollars for the pork to James, in a hook or a note; she thinks a note. She is pretty certain he took a note. All she knows about James\u2019s getting the pork, is what Michael told her. She never saw the note or book account. She heard Michael say, James got the 40 dollars. She did not see it, counted, but she was in the house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-4\">Mary Moore testified, that she heard Michael say, he had given James all ho e,xpected to give him ; that, he had set him up twice ; that he had not done as well as he could wish.

Michael Allen has said to me, that lie had advanced liberally to James. Being cross-examined, he says, he thinks Michael told him he set out Henry Allen, another son, with some money and a horse, when he left his house. Enoch Allen, another son, was about thirty years old when lie died. He had been away from his father\u2019s several years before he died; his mind was impaired, and his father boarded him out. Witness understood the old gentleman that he paid for the hoard of Enoch. Witness knew three of the daughters; they lived with their father several years after they were grown.

She lived in the house of Michael Allen about two years before he died. She heard Michael say he had let James have a good deal of money, and as much as he intended to let him have, till he saw whether there wa\u00e1 any more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>coming to him or not. He said he thought he had let him have as much as he would be able to let the other children have; as much as would be coming to the other children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-5\">Being cross-examined, she says she is <em>17 </em>years of age. She is hired at Mr. Sberwin\u2019s, who married one of the daughters of Michael Allen. The conversation took place at Michael Allen\u2019s, about three-years ago-last summer. There-was-no person present. Sire was in the kitchen at the time. He has told me that, several times. She understood he was 80 or 81 j^ears old when he died. He spoke to her frequently about his other business. She was hired at Michael Allen\u2019s.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-6\">Bowman Sailer. Michael Allen stated to witness that his property at Barnesborough stood 'him in about 5000 dollars; that he'had advanced money to James, and had got no rent for the time James lived there. Henry wished his father, Michael, to take \u25a0\u2022the note which he, Henry, held against James, and keep it out of the share of his estate that would be coming to James after Michael\u2019s decease. Michael held some writings against Henry, for about the same -amount that Henry held against James; and Michael said he went down to Salem and signed Henry\u2019s writings away, and made him very angry \u2022, and that he got a sharp letter from Henry about it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-7\">The testimony on the pait of the grandchildren is as follows :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-8\">Abigail Stout, the first witness called for the surviving children, being called on the part of the grandchildren, testified as follows. She remembers when James went to Natchez. When he left Barnesborough, she heard Michael say James had assigned him notes; but she cannot tell the amount. Michael appeared to be satisfied while James lived at Barnesborough. Michael said these notes were assigned to him by James to collect and pay him as far as they would go; he did not say all; he did not say they would pay all. He did not say whether he was satisfied or not; he did not express any dissatisfaction. This was, perhaps, three weeks before James left for Natchez. Michael and James were together several times shortly before James went to Natchez, about their business. Michael showed her some notes; he did not show her all. Michael told her, James had assigned him notes that would satisfy him for what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>he had let James have, in part; he did not say all. Cross-examined, she says, she never heard Michael say he had given James all he expected he would get; or that James would get no more unless the other heirs agreed to give him more. She has heard him say, he did not wish to give James any more, till he knew what was coming to him- of his share of his estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-5\">Lydia Allen, sworn on the part of the grandchildren, says, she is the widow of James. Michael and James were frequently together before James went south, talking about their business. She heard Michael say, that James owed him money, and he wished him to pay it. She knows James assigned hit\u00bb notes, at different times-. These notes were assigned shortly before James went south. She saw Michael sign a paper ait Svvedesborough.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b103-6\"><em>Jeffers </em>and <em>G. D.

Whatever he let James have, he took his note or obligation for; he put it in the shape of a debt from James to him. The testimony on the part of the surviving children, even if all admissible, is of entirely too indefinite a character to establish an advancement. It-was not claimed, I think, at the bar, that proof of mere parol declarations of a father, that he had fully advanced a child, would be sufficient. See <em>Teller, </em>397; 1 <em>Atk. </em>407.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">The counsel- for- the appellants rely, first, on the notes given by James to his father. A note given by a son to the father is not, of itself, evidence of an advancement by the father. It is evidence of indebtedness by the son. The amount of the note may be recovered back from the son, either by the father, in his life time, or by his personal representatives, after his decease;<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>but no part of an advancement can be recovered back. The very object of the father in-taking the note, should be presumed to be,- to avoid the inequality which would resultj if his personal \u00e9stat\u00e9, at his death, should be insufficient'to give to each of his other chjldren an - equal sum. It is not a gift; the father does not divest himself of .the property. This- is not opposed to the case' of <em>Wanmaker </em>v. <em>Van </em>Buskirk, in Saxton, 688 The opinion of the chancellor in that case, that the amount of the bond was an advancement, was founded on the peculiar circurastanCes': of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-3\">It was contended that .the notes exhibited in this case, should be considered as advancements, because they are outlawed. If nothing appeared but the fact that these notes were found among\u2019 the papers of the intestate after his death, and that they were all outlawed, and could not therefore be made available as debts; it might be a serious inquiry, what would be the proper presumption';- whether the presumption of payment, arising from lapse of time, or the presumption that the father omitted to collect them, or have them renewed, on the ground that he was willing the son should retain the amount as an advancement. But, in my view, it is not necessary to discuss that question in this case.- Under the admissions and acts of the intestate, it would certainly be unsafe to declare, that the whole 'amount of these notes should <em>be considered </em>either advancement or debt. It appears that shortly before James' went to the south, he assigned notes to his father, in part payment of what he owed him. He also gave a bond to his father for $700, and a warrant of attorney for the confession of a judgment thereon ; and judgment was entered thereon accordingly. There is no evidence that the bond was-given on a new or separate advance of moneys The transaction has the appearance of a settlement between them of the amount due from James, and the confession of a judgment for the amount. I am unwilling to consider the notes as evidence, either of advancement to James, or of debt due from him to the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">There can be no doubt that James, in his life time, and his estate, after his death, was indebted to his father, the intestate, in the amount of the judgment. If this debt had been released by the father, to James in his life time, it might,\u2019 perhaps, be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>considered an advancement s <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>Wetherell, </em>2 <em>Sim. and Stu. </em>254. But it remained a debt from the estate of lames to his father, at the father\u2019s death. The endorsement made by Michael. Alien on the execution, discharging the sheriff !S from all liability whatever of the execution, the defendant being dead and no further proceedings required \u00f3n the same,55 did not discharge the debt, so as to entitle James\u2019s children to an equal seventh of the surplus, exclusivo of the amount of this judgment debt. And this discharge of the sheriff was not <em>an </em>advancement to James; for James was then dead,</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Bor the purpose of settling\u2019 the distribution, the amount of this judgment debt should have been added to the said surplus *, and should form a part of the distributive share of the three grandchildren who represent '\u00abheir deceased father, James. The decree of distribution made by the orphans5 court, was made without respect to this judgment deb\u00ed; and the children o\u00ed James were decreed to be entitled to an equal seventh of the surplus, though that surplus did not include the judgment debt,</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">I think the decree is erroneous. The orphans\u2019 court should have added the amount of the judgment, with interest thereon to the death of Michael Allen, to the surplus found by the account of the administrator as stated; and have decreed, that one seventh of the whole sum be paid to each of the surviving children; and that the judgment against James be satisfied, and the residue of the money in the administrator\u2019s hand, be paid to the children of James, equally among them. A decree to this effect will be made by this court-</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
