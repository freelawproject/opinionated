P. took possession of the share assigned to him by the agreement. Afterwards, by an agreement between the three, a certain part of the homestead was as\u00bb signed to M., one of the three, and the other two released the same to her, and M. released to the other two all her interest in the residue of the homestead. Previous to the agreement among the four, H., one of tho heirs, had given a mortgage on his undivided interest in the whole real estate. M. filed a bill against P. for t3?e specific performance of the agreement on his part to release to her the share so assigned to her, tendering a release of her interest in his share. Neither of the said mortgages was paid at the time of the filing of the bill; hut <em>the mortgage given by the intestate was paid before the hearing of </em>the- cause, and the mortgage given by H. on his undivided interest in the estate had been foreclosed, and his said- interest sold; and tho complainant produced at the hearing an agreement by the purchaser to abide by the agreement for partition, and to execute releases under it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b383-5\">Held, that performance of an agreement to execute a release of real estate may be decreed; and that performance may he decreed if the party asking it, is able and willing, at any time before the decree, to perform his part of tho contract.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b383-6\">It was referred to a master to ascertain whether the complainant was able to procure a reloase to P. from tho present owner of H.\u2019s share, and from, the' remaining heirs.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Specific performance of an agreement among heirs for partition cannot lie resisted on the ground that tho defendant, in taking tho part assigned to him, contemplated the sale of it, and that by reason of mortgages existing at the time of the agreement he was unable to sell the part assigned to him ; he knowing of the'mortgages at the time of tho agreement, and one of them, given by the intestate, being paid beforo tho hearing, and the other, given by one of the heirs on his undivided interest in the whole estate, having been foreclosed and such interest sold, and tho complainant proffering a release from the purchaser, of all his interest in the share to the defendant.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b384-5\"><em>Held, </em>that under the circumstances, the other heirs were not necessary parties to the bill.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-6\">Peter <em>A. </em>Kipp died, intestate, leaving a widow, Mary Kipp, and five children, viz.

Peter refused <em>to </em>comply with the request.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-9\">Soper and wife thereupon, on the 15th of April, 1844, filed their bill, stating the foregoing facts, and stating that Peter, as one of the administrators, has in his hands a considerable amount of money belonging to the estate; that the intestate left a large personal estate, and owed debts to a small amount only; and that no settlement of the administrators\u2019 accounts had been made in the orphans\u2019 court; that on the said purchase of the Browning property by Abraham, for the benefit of the estate, Abraham, acting for the estate, gave Browning the privilege of selling the property in such portions as might be most advantageous for the estate and for Browning; and that there had been paid on the said mortgage $600and that the resi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>due of the Browning property is sufficient, as the complainants are informed and believe, to pay the balance due on said $1500 mortgage, given by the intestate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-4\">The bill prays, that Peter may be decreed to perform the agreement; and to execute a release of the share so assigned to the complainant Mary; the complainants tendering themselves ready to perform on their part, and to make such arrangement in relation-'to the' $1500 mortgage as the court may direct, if' that already made'and offered should be decreed insufficient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-5\">.The defendant put in his answer, and proofs were taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-6\">Before the hearing of the cause, the $1500 mortgage was fully paid; and the mortgage given by Henry, on his undi- , vided interest in the real estate of the intestate, had been foreclosed, and his said interest <em>sold </em>under <em>the decrdb, </em>and Mrs. Howard had become the purchaser thereof. She knew, before she bought, of the agreement for partition, and of certain releases having been executed under it; and the complainants produced at the hearing an agreement executed by Mrs. Howard, dated June 5th, 1845, to abide by the agreement for partition, and to execute releases under it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b386-7\">P. <em>D.

If this be so, there is no want of proper parties in t.he causo. I am inclined to think this is the true construction of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The defendant alleges, that his object in selecting the out-lots for his share was that he might sell them, and that, by reason of the incumbrances, he could not immediately accomplish that object.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Two mortgages existed at the time of the agreement, and the weight of the evidence, to my mind, is, that the existence of both was known to the defendant. This takes from the case all idea that the defendant was drawn, into the agreement by concealment from him of any thing which, if known to him, might have prevented him from entering into it. The only ground left the defendant on this part of the case is, that he misapprehended the effect of Henry\u2019s mortgage; and that when he came to carry out his object in selecting the out-lots, he found himself embarrassed by that mortgage. The question then arises, can the case be permitted to turn on proof of the object which the defendant had in selecting the out-lots. Nothing is said of that object in the agreement, it would leave agreements for partition, and the action of a court upon them, to stand on very unde,finable ground, if they could be influenced by proof of any particular object which one of the parties had in agreeing to take the part assigned to him, and that that object had failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">The case, on this part of it, must stand on the same ground as if the defendant\u2019s object was, to keep the part selected by him. He agreed to take that part; and the court cannot look beyond that, and inquire whether he meant to keep it or to sell .it. The defendant\u2019s possession of the part he agreed to take has not been disturbed. By the agreement he was to release <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>to -the others, separately, the share which the others might agree that each of them should -have in the homestead, when the mortgage given by the intestate should be discharged, or such arrangement relating thereto be made, as should be satisfactory to him. This mortgage has now been discharged; and, it is not material, as to the relief prayed, that it was not discharged at the commencement of the suit. So as to the mortgage given by Henry, on his undivided interest in the real estate. If .the defendant\u2019s share has been relieved from the incumbrance of that <em>mortgage; </em>or if the complainants are now able to procure a release to be executed to the defendant by the present owner of that undivided interest, of all the interest of that owner in the share taken by the defendant; the only object which the court can consider the defendant as having had in taking .the share he selected can now be accomplished ; and the time that has elapsed is not material. And if it can now be done, it is not material whether it was offered, or could have been done, at the commencement of the suit, at least not as to the relief prayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">A reference will be ordered, to ascertain whether the complainants are able to procure the release of Mrs. Howard, the present owner of Henry\u2019s undivided share, of all her interest in the share assigned to the.defendant, and to ascertain how the title now stands.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">I think it better also, in this stage of the cause, to direct the master to ascertain whether the complainants are able to procure the release of Abraham to be executed <em>to the </em>defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">If it shall appear that the complainants are able to procure the releases to be executed to the defendant, but that the defendant puts- himself in a position to prevent their delivery to him, by refusing to execute proper releases himself, it appears to me that the case will call for such action of the court as will, nqtwithstanding, give the complainants the relief they seek. The .question of costs is reserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Order accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
