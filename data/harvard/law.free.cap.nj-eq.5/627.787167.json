He cited 4 <em>Griff. Law Reg. </em>1178, 1179, 1185.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">He adverted to the supplement passed February 24tli, 1820, to the \u201c act relative to dower,\u201d the 7th section of which supplement gives an appeal to this court from any sentence or decree of the surrogate-general made under the authority of the said supplement, and insisted that the said 7th section was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">He adverted to article 6th, section 1st, of the new constitu- ' tion. The judicial power shall be vested in \u201c a Court of Errors and Appeals in the last resort in all causes as heretofore,\u201d and admitted that this increases the difficulty and importance of the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The appeal was dismissed by the whole court, except the president, who, being Chancellor and surrogate-general, declined voting. See note.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Note. \u2014 Is there any reason why the legislature cannot give to the Ordinary or surrogate-general jurisdiction over a new subject matter, and give an appeal from his decrees in reference thereto ?</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Cited <em>in Harris </em>v. <em>Vanderveer, </em>6 <em>C.
