Colt, governor of-the Society for establishing Useful Manufactures, under pretence that the Company ,vvere using water to fill their canal which of right belonged to the Society, which allegation and pretence-the.complainants declare to be untrue, on or about the 18th of July last, declared his intention \u2018 to break down the gates of the complainants\u2019 .canal; that the process of .the law was too tedious, and that he would take the law into his own hands,; ..and made many violent declarations and threats, all expressive of the same intent. That on the 8th of August, aforesaid, the caqal being filled and ready fqr business, the complainants gave public notice that the same was ready for business. That on the 'last mentioned day, a party of men of ten or twelve, of Paterson, .the location of the Society, in a violent and riotous manner, broke down a gate and waste way on the canal, .at or opposite Paterson, so .that the water in the canal was discharged therefrom for a distance of seven miles. That the leader of the party declared he w;as employed so to do by the Society; and when remonstrated with by the agent .qf .the complainants, threatened to shoot any person who should interpose .to prevent him. And .the .complainants charge, that the said party were employed and directed .to demolish said gate and waste .way by the said Society, or by T\u00ed. L. Co].t, acting or pretending to act under the authority of the Society.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-3\">That the complainants gave directions for the immediate repair of the breach, and had no ..doubt the same had be.en repaired, and that the part of the canal which had been. so emptied .was in the course of being filled again, and that the same would be again ready for business in, a few days, if no further violence was done to the canal or its works. That at the time of- the said demolition they had seventy-five boats between Newark and Paterson, proceeding to Mauch Chunk for coal, and that the said boats were stopped by reason of said breach, and that there were at the .time many other boats of the company and of individuals about to be put on the canal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>That by the act of incorporation of the Company, the canal is declared to be a public highway. That the canal, if unmolested, will have capacity to transport about 300,000 tons of coal and merchandize annually. That in contemplation of the increased capacity of the canal when widened, several large establishments have been put up on the line of the canal; that other establishments on the line, and inhabitants of villages, would be injured by the interruption of the navigation on said canal. That the Company have in no way infringed any right of the Society touching the use of the waters of the Passaic \u2022: but charge the truth to be, that from the time they commenced filling the canal to the time of the said injury to the canal, more water was running in the Passaic above the falls than before the complainants commenced filling their canal, by reason of the leakage from the canal and by the water flowing from the complainants\u2019 reservoir at Long Pond into the Passaic through the Pompton. That at the time of said breaking, water was actually running over a dam across the Passaic above the falls, erected by the Society for the express purpose of diverting the waters of the Passaic for the use of the Society and mill owners ; so that there was actually running in the Passaic at the time, more water than the Society could divert to their works.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-3\">That the complainants have sustained great and irreparable injury and damages by the said breach and the interruption of their business; and that they apprehend, from the facts above stated, that other like injuries will be committed, and that the said Society, or the said Colt, or some person or persons acting under the authority of them or some of them, will again break down or destroy, &amp;c.; and they pray an injunction against the Society and the said Colt, restraining them from breaking down or injuring any of the works of the canal, until the further order of this court to the contrary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-4\">An injunction was granted, according to the prayer of the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-5\">The Society put in an answer <em>to the bill. </em>They state the incorporation of the Society in 1791, the purchase of 700 acres of land at the great falls of the Passaic, the construction of a canal from a short distance above the falls, to lead <em>the water </em>through the lands bought by them and .empty it into the river <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>below the falls, and the construction, at different periods, of two other.canals, so that the water is now used three times. That ;the ground,-adjacent:to the canals forms sites for mills, and that the Society, finding 'that their manufacturing business could be .carried on more advantageously and effectively-through individual enterprize, have in -a few instances sold, and in general leased, on reservation to the Society .of annual rents, a great number of lots, as cites, on which have been erected ,a number of mills, which are now in full operation, and have leased or sold water-power, on the upper canal to the amount.of twenty-one square feet of water, on the middle canal of -twenty-one and,a half square feet, and .on the lower canal of .twenty-two square feet. That the lots already appropriated, with the buildings ajqd machinery-thereon, are worth about <em>$1,800-000. </em>That said , canals, improvements and leases have all been made and taken under the confident expectation that the faith.of the state would be -kept inviolate, and that the waters of the Passaic would be allowed \u00a1to continue to flow, &amp;e. That Paterson, incorporated under -the said charter, now contains 11,000 inhabitants. That the Society, by such purchase, &amp;c. became entitled to the full flow of all the waters of the Passaic and its tributaries, without alteration or diminution. That the Passaic is formed by the confluence of three large branches, the Passaic, Rockaway and Pompton branches. That -the complainants, in 1828, constructed works on the Rockaway, near Dover, Powerville and Boonton, by means whereof they diverted water of the Rockaway and its tributaries into their canal, and carried it away from the -falls at Paterson and from the .canals of the Society there. That by means of the said works at Dover, Powerville and Boonton, the complainants can take from the Rock-away as much water as they want to supply their canal, without the knowledge .of any person except their own agents. That in consequence of dams, &amp;c. on the streams, the diminution of water in the Passaic, from the withdrawal of it as aforesaid, will not be immediately seen and felt in some parts of the river, which gives rise to contradictory evidence respecting such diminution, and involves it in obscurity. That the canal of the complainants cuts off a great number of small streams which formerly ran into the different branches of the Passaic. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>in 1828 the Society filed their bill in chancery to injoin the said Company, and that the Chancellor decreed that the Society have a clear right to the flow of all the waters of the Passaic at the great falls, without diminution; and that an injunction would be ordered when an actual injury should be sustained by the Society, by the said Company\u2019s taking any of the waters of the Passaic. That in 1833 the Society filed another bill, in which the Chancellor made a like decision as to the rights of the Society. That there was no necessity for the said Canal Company to mix their waters with the waters of the Rockaway, and that they did so for the purpose of taking the waters of the Passaic or its tributaries into their canal. That the works at Paterson will require all the water\u00bb of the Passaic during the summer months, and that if the Canal Company are permitted so to divert the waters, without giving the Society the water in-return, as provided for in the agreement in the answer after mentioned, they will, during the summer months, more especially in dry seasons, divert a great' portion of the water from the works at Paterson, and will greatly injure them at other' seasons of the year. That in January and February, 1836, the Canal Company applied to the legislature for a supplement to their charter, to enable them to make a reservoir at Long Pond and a feeder at Pompier, <em>to </em>use the water of the cana! for manufacturing purposes, to increase the capital stock $600,000, for the parp\u00f3se of making reservoirs, feeders, &lt;fcc.; that the Society and'mill owners remonstrated; and while said application was pending, and after a time liad been fixed for the hearing of the parties before a committee of the legislature,to settle the difficulties between the Company and the Society, and because the conflict between them was so important and affected so many persons, and to compromise disputed rights appertaining to the franchises of the two companies then in the enjoyment of those franchises ; it was, on the 17th of February, 1836, agreed between the companies, in writing as follows: \u201cWhereas certain controversies have arisen, and have for some time existed, between {The Society for establishing Useful Manufactures,\u2019 and { The Morris Canal and Banking Company,\u2019 in relation to the use of the'waters of the Passaic river;\u2022 '\u25a0The Society for establishing Useful Manufactures\u2019 alleging'. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>that <em>\u2018 </em>The Morris Canal and Banking Company\u2019 were diverting the water of some of the tributary streams of the Passaic, so as greatly to diminish the waters at Paterson, in times of drought, of which the said \u00a3 Society for establishing Useful Manufactures\u2019 claim the exclusive use\u2014which allegation- was and is denied by \u00a3 The Morris Canal and Banking Company now, in order to terminate in an amicable manner all said matters in difference between the said companies, it is covenanted and agreed between them as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-3\"><em>\u201c </em>First. The said <em>1 </em>Society for establishing Useful Manufactures\u2019 covenant and agree to and with \u00a3 The Morris Canal and Banking.

That- they will so regulate the sluices or gates to the mills on that race, that not more than twenty-two square feet of water shall be drawn from the same under a- pressure or head of not more than thirty inches, measured from the centre of the apertures to the surface of the water. The apertures already contracted for to be twelve inches square, excepting where, under existing agreements, it is stipulated that they shall be of a different form; and those hereafter to be contracted for, to be not less than six inches in depth; it being expressly understood that in this arrangement it is- agreed that a quantity equal to twenty-two square feet of water, drawn under a head of thirty inches, measured as aforesaid, is the minimum quantity of water to flow regularly for the supply of the mills now erected, or hereafter to be erected, at Paterson, to be measured on said middle canal, in manner aforesaid.

Colt, governor of the Society ; and that said president was clothed with full power to make said agreement by a resolution, &amp;c. That said agreement was entered into in good faith by the Society, and they thereupon considered that all controversies with the said Company were at an end. That in pursuance of the said agree ment, the Society built, at great expense, a dam across the river, and also at the place referred to in said agreement; and built a lock at the place and in the mode pointed out by the engineer of the Canal Company, to take the water from the said canal, according to the terms of the said agreement. That the Canal Company took down their bank across a ravine, cleared out the ravine, and surrendered the possession of it to the Society; and the same continued open and was used by the Society, until it was obstructed by the Company, as after stated in the answer. That after the execution of the said agreement, the Society and others withdrew their opposition and assisted, &amp;c. and the said supplement applied for by the said Company was passed by the legislature, March 5th, 1836.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-9\">The answer insists that this act, and the acceptance of it, effected a change in the .chartered rights of the Canal Company, investing them with additional powers; and that such change being made by virtue of the said agreement with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Society, and in consequence of the withdrawal of their opposition, the agreement became a part of the same transaction, as much as if it had been distinctly referred to in the said supplement ; and was thereby fastened on the franchises of the Canal Company, in whose hands soever they might fall; and that the rights of the Society under the said agreement became a lien on the franchises and privileges pf the Canal Company, so far forth as should be necessary to carry the same into full effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-3\">That under the said supplement the Canal Company increased their capital and made a large reservoir at Long Pond, and a feeder to their canal, and by one or more dams took into their canal the waters of the Pompton and its tributaries, so that they could then take into their <em>canal, in a </em>dry season, if <em>they </em>chose so to do, all the waters of the Pompton .and Rockaway, leaving the defendants without any remedy, except by reason of the said agreement. That Cornelius S. Van Wagoner was appointed by the companies their joint agent, \u00a1to see that the terms of the said agreement should be complied with; and the said two companies executed a commission to him, dated February 6th, 1839, as follows: (setting out the commission. It is an appointment for one year, to see that the agreement is complied with.) That since the passage of the supplement, the Company have exercised the powers granted by it and by the said agreement. That said Van Wagoner did, from time to time, draw from the canal, such water as was required by the Society, not exceeding the quantity stipulated to be drawn by said agreement, for the use of the Society ; and that the Society have ever since that agreement taken from said canal such water as they wanted, according .to the said agreement, until prevented, as after stated. T-hat the Society now own the said ravine. That the Company .commenced, last spring, to enlarge their canal, and that the Society have been prevented from interfering to prevent it by reason of their being bound by-the said agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-4\">Thai on the 1 Zth of June last, (1845,) the Company erected a wall and wood work so as .to prevent any water from flowing from the canal into .the Passaic, or basin above the falls, and placed gates in the same, which they nailed up, so that the Society could not take the water from the canal, as provided for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>in the said agreement, at the place so cleared out and surrendered to the Society in part performance of the said agreement, though forbidden by the Society from erecting said wall and wood work. That after the said erections the works at Paterson became short of water; that at. sometimes there would be plenty of water, and at other times a scarcity; and that on the first of August last, the Company drew into their canal nine-tenths of all the waters of the Pompton, by their said feeder, and at the same time took a considerable part of the liockaway or its tributaries; so that some of the mills at Paterson could not run all their machinery. That the Society, seeing that the water was low at Paterson, by reason of the conduct of the Company, on the 21st of July last, addressed a letter to the Company as follows. (The letter is here given. It states that by the contract the Society is entitled to a constant flow from the canal of three square feet, under a pressure of thirty inches, and also to draw from the canal enough water to supply twentydwo feet, at all times, in <em>the </em>middle canal of the Society at Paterson, and that the Society can view the -said wall and wood work to close said waste way in no other light than as a nuisance, which they will treat accordingly, unless the Company immediately furnish them with their water, according to said agreement, as the water is now very short.) That they received the same day an answer from the cashier of the Company that the president was absent, and that on his return the letter of the Society would receive immediate attention ; and that since then the Society have not heard from the Company in relation <em>to </em>if.and the Society, finding the waters of the Passaic, after sending said letter, rapidly diminishing, and complaints being <em>made by the mill </em>owners, grantees or lessees of the Society, of the scarcity of water, and that they could only run a part of their machinery; and the Society having ascertained that the Company were drawing a great deal of water from the Pompton and liockaway and their tributaries, while at the same time they had shut off all supplies to the works at Paterson; the Society were compelled, to prevent irreparable injury to the mills and inhabitants of Paterson, to remove said wall and wood work and to treat the same as a <em>nuisance; and </em>.they admit, that on the 8th of August, 1845, they did remove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>so much thereof as would permit the water to flow as it had been accustomed to flow through the said ravine, from the time the said lock gate was erected until the said wall and wood work were erected. They admit that said Dickerson and others were employed .by them to .remove the same. They say, that for several days 'before the breaking down the said wall, the water had been very low.at Paterson, occasioned by the Company\u2019s diverting-and using'the waters of the Passaic, and not returning any through the said ravine. That sometimes there would :be plenty of water, and then again a scarcity, without any.cause except the will of the Company, who let the waters come down irregularly. That it may have been, that at the particular time -when the wall was .removed, there was water at Paterson: but if there was, it was only a temporary matter; and that at that time, the said ravine was closed by the act of the Company, so that no water could run to the works at Paterson through the same ; whereas, by the said agreement, the Society were entitled-, at all -times, to have three square feet of water running through the said ravine:; and that .this right did not depend on the-quantity of water in the river.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-3\">On -this answer, a motion was made to dissolve the injunction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-4\">The Society also filed a cross-bill, stating the matters set forth in their answer, and stating, in addition thereto, that the commissioners appointed by -the legislature, previous to the granting of the canal charter, to examine, &amp;c. contemplated that Lake Hopatcong would be an ample supply for the said canal,x and recommended its subserviency -to that object; that Green Pond is a small lake whose, waters-are carried by Meadow Brook into the -Sockaway; and that it was .not contemplated by the said commissioners, or -recommended, that its waters or any waters contributing to the Passaic, should be applied to the purposes of the said canal. That one inducement for selecting Paterson as the site of the Society\u2019s operations, was the consideration that Green Pond might be converted into a reservoir, to supply, in some measure, the deficiency of water occasioned by the droughts of the summer months. That the Canal Company, in March, 1830, executed a mortgage to Wilhelm Willinlc on the canal and chartered lights of the Compa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>ny, to secure $750,000, and have since executed one or more mortgages <em>to </em>the State of Indiana and to the State of Michigan. That after the making of the said agreement between the Company and the Society, and while the Company were enjoying the benefits thereof, WilSnk filed his bill against the Canal Company, on the'20th of October, 1841, to foreclose his mortgage; but that the Society were not made parties to the bill. That under a decree and execution in that suit, the canal, the feeder and its appendages, and the chartered rights of the Canal Company were, on the 1st of October, 1844, sold to B. Williamson, A. Whitehead and J. J. Bryant, and conveyed to them. That the Society did, \u00a9a the day and at the place of sale, and before the sale, publicly give notice of the said agreement to all persons who might bid at the said sale. That the persons now holding the said property and franchises claim to represent, or to be, the Morris Canal and Banking Company, and as such are organized under the said supplement of 1836. That the Morris Canal and Banking Company, thus organized, have lately widened and deepened their canal, and will, by reason thereof, be obliged to take-more water from the Passaic of its tributaries j and that the Society have been prevented from interfering to prevent such alterations by reason- of their being\" bound by the said agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-3\">That about Jon\u00ae 17th, 1845,-the Company constructed the' said wall and wood work, on land of the said Society, on the line of the said canal, and fixed gates in the same, which they afterwards nailed up, so that the Society could not receive the' discharge of water from the canal, as provided for- in the said-agreement. That the place where they so erected the said* work was previously, and ever since the same was first cleared out by them- under- the said agreement,- left open- and unobstructed by the Canal Company, in part performance of the said agreement; and that the Canal Company never had attempted to place any obstructions or erections there, nor hacf* claimed any right so to do, until, &amp;c. That while the said' Company were erecting the said wall and wood work, the Society forbid them and notified them that they had no right to-erect them. That while the Company were filling their canal, the works at Paterson have been short of water, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Company have taken the waters of the Rockaway and its tributaries, and also the waters of the Pompton and its tributaries, as they are authorized by the said 'agreement and the said supplement to do, to fill their canal; that in a dry season they cannot carry on their operations on the said canal without using the waters of the Passaic or its tributaries; and that they have and now do greatly diminish the flow of water at Paterson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-3\">The cross-bill then states the letter to the Company, &amp;c. as stated in their answer to the bill of the Company, and that the Company, since the date of the letter, have continued to draw from the Rockaway and its tributaries and from the Pompton; and at some times have drawn nearly all the water of the Pompton. That on the 1st of August, 1845, they drew nine-tenths of the water of the Pompton into the canal through their said feeder, and have thereby so affected the water of the Passaic, that many of the mill owners and lessees of the Society have not been able to drive all their machinery. That the Society, finding that the Company were diverting the waters of the Passaic, and that the water, from time to time, in different parts of diflerenfc days, was so low as not to allow the mills to run at their usual and accustomed speed, removed a part of the said wall and wood work on the 8th of August, 1845, so as to permit the water of the canal to flow to the Passaic above the falls, as it had been accustomed to-flow under the said agreement, and until, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-4\">That afterwards, on the 16th of August, 1845, the Canal Comppny erected, on lands of the Society, in the said ravine, a solid stone wall, of the width of ten feet, extending to the face or exterior line of the canal, so that no-water can flow from the canal to the works at Paterson, and afterwards stopped the gates from- their reservoir at Long Pond, so that no water could come from that place ; and on the 18th and 19th of August, and for some days before, diverted all the water of the Pompton into their said feeder and thence into their canal, and nearly all the waters of the Rockaway at Boonton into their canal, and at the same time- brought no water down from Long Pond; by reason whereof, nearly all the mills at Paterson were stopped or could run only a small portion of their machinery; by which means- they diverted about two-thirds of all the water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>which should have flowed to the works at Paterson, the right to the flow of which, without diminution, belonged to and still does belong to the Society.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-3\">That the Company, in their bill, have not in any way stated the said agreement between the Company and the Society, nor the said supplement of March 5th, 1836, under which agreement and act combined the Company derive the important powers above set forth; nor have they set forth the fact that the Society were in the actual possession and ownership of the said ravine, and the flow of water from the said canal to the works at Paterson, and that the Society had been so using and enjoying the same since the said agreement; but have knowingly suppressed the same. That the Company have charged tolls on the Pompton feeder, made since the passing of the supplement of 1836, and claim the right to lease the waters of the canal for manufacturing purposes, by virtue of said supplement, and have used the said Pompton feeder and reservoir at Long Pond and drawn\u2019 water therefrom, which they only had a right to do by virtue of the said agreement and the said supplement. That said supplement was passed because the Society had made the said agreement with the said Company, and that in consequence of said agreement the Society withdrew their opposition to the said supplement and thereupon it was passed. That as the Company are enjoying the benefits resulting to them from the said supplement, which was based on the said agreement, they cannot take the benefits resulting from the said agreement and refuse to be bound by the agreement under which the said supplement passed. That if the said agreement is not binding on the Company they have no right to the benefits resulting from the said supplement, or <em>the </em>privileges granted by it, and must give up their reservoir at Long Pond and their Pompton feeder, and their right to lease water as aforesaid, and must permit all the waters of the Pompton and Rockaway and their tributaries to flow down the Passaic to Paterson without alteration or diminution. That under these circumstances the Society hoped the Company would have desisted, &amp;c. or from interfering with the Society to prevent them from receiving a discharge of water from the canal into the river, through the said ravine, as provided for by the said agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>The Society insist, that on a sound construction of the charter' of the Company, they are not authorized by the general expressions it contains,- tb take any of the waters tributary to the Passaic, inasmuch as the same were already appropriated under the faith of the legislature to the'use of thb'Society.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-3\">That' the Company, by their charter, are prohibited from using aiiy waters and streams, except- such as may have'been acquired by gift or' p\u00ednchase, without first causing a map and survey thereof and.having the same appraised; yet that the Company have taken the waters, as above stated, without'- complying with any of the prerequisites- of their charter; and that no survey, map or appraisement of the land or water taken to make the reservoir at- Long Pond, \u25a0 or the Pompton feeder, have been- put' on- record.-- That the Company pretend'that the Society have no right tb abate the said wall and wood work, because they say the-land'on which'it stands belongs to them, the said Company,- the same having been appraised by the commissioners appointed under their- charter'; but-\u2019 the Society say that the said land, when' so appraised, belonged to R.

It is contended by the purchasers .under the Wiffinb mortgage, that the agreement of February 17th, 1836, is .void against them, it being subsequent to that mortgage; and .particularly if the agreement binds the Canal Company -to permit a constant flow of three square feet of water at the ravine; for that such a flow would destroy the canal. It is answered by the Society, that if that agreement is void, then they .claim to be remitted to their original rights under their charter; and that, in .view .of those rights, the Canal Company .are not authorized to .touch or in any way interfere with any of the head waters of the Passaic. To this the Company reply, that the legislature had the power and constitutional right to authorize them to take, for the purposes of the canal, not only the lands and waters of individuals, but even .the lands .and waters of tire Society; and that .the terms of their charter are unlimited in .this respect. If this question shall be presented for discussion in any stage of this contro,versy, it will be the duty of the court to decide it. But certainly, this court would not be asked, at this late day, to grant a preliminary injunction against the .Canal Company, and .suspend their operations till a .question like this should be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">As to the right of the Canal Company to drop the waters they bring from Lake Hopatcong into the Rockaway, with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>view of taking an equal quantity of water out of the Rockaway on the other side of it, and thus saving the expense of an aqueduct, the question has passed, <em>.sub judien. </em>This court, on two successive applications for an injunction, has refused to act against the Company on a denial of that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-3\">As to that part of the cross-bill which asks ,a specific performance of the agreement of February 17th, 1836, the counsel for the Society do not contend that in that aspect .of the case the court should grant a .preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">But it is said on the part of the Society, that they do not ask a specific performance,; that the agreement has been performed ; and that the Society ask the interference of the court to prevent the Company from now repudiating it; that is to say, to restrain the Company from preventing the flowing of water from the canal at the ravine, according to the terms of the agreement. This involves several questions. One of these questions, and which was elaborately argued at the bar, that is to say, whether an injunction could issue to restrain the Company from preventing the flow of water from the canal, I do not find it necessary to .consider. The present motions are denied on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">What is the agreement between the Company and the Society ? The Society claim that it is for a constant flow of three square feet, unqualified by any other rule or consideration. This, the proof now before the court seems to show, would destroy the canal. On the other hand, the extent of damage to the Society by stopping the flow from the canal, is entirely uncertain. The mills might suffer more or less, for a portion of the year, longer or shorter, in dry seasons. Should not the court, under such circumstances, leave the Society to their compensation in damages at law ? Jt is sufficient, for me to say, that under such circumstances I could not grant a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">But I am not so well satisfied that this agreement calls for a constant flow of any quantity of water, as to be willing to grant ,an injunction on the Society\u2019s bill, if all other difficulties in the way of such injunction were removed; and a doubt, as to the correctness of the Society\u2019s construction of the agreement in .this respect would be sufficient ground for denying the injunc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>tion asked by them for the purpose of compelling a constant flow.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\">If the agreement does not call for a constant flow, but only for a flow at such times and in such quantities as to keep the middle canal of the Society in a state to supply twenty-two square feet of water, .should .an injunction to any extent go? Several objections are made to it. First, That the present holders , of the canal, .whether they he-the old Canal Company or a <em>rara avis in t err is, </em>,(in the language of Mr. Wood,) hold it under a mortgage made prior .to this agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Second, That the Society have not fulfilled their part of the agreement-; but that they permit an .escape, under their embankment, of a quantity of water nearly or quite equal to a flow of \u00a1three square feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Third, That there is \u00a1no sufficient -evidence that the Society have .not had, during the whole season, water enough, if it were properly husbanded, and their works were kept tight, according .to the agreement, to supply twenty-two square feet for use on the middle canal.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">If the agreement does .not call for a constant flow, I am of \u25a0opinion, that .the Society .cannot be allowed to permit such an escape ,of water -as, from the proof .now before the court, it appears there is, and still claim the flow at the ravine provided for :in the agreement. If it is impracticable to prevent such escape, then it is impracticable for -the Society to comply on their part with the terms of the agreement; and the result is simply this, that the Society ai;e -unable to use all the water three times over; which they might be able to do if they could comply with the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Again, if there has been any scarcity of water at Paterson this season, beyond what would have .existed independently of the operations of the Canal Company; yet, if that scarcity was produced only by the filling of the enlarged canal, .-and ceased after it was filled, the application for an injunction fails. But it is by no means clear, on the proof that is now before the court, that the filling the canal, this season, did not add to, rather than diminish the flow at Paterson. Indeed, if the filling the canal was calculated to reduce the flow to the falls below the extreme reduction which was the necessary result of so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>continued and severe a drought, it is difficult to imagine how the season could have passed with so little interruption of the works at Paterson.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\">Without permitting myself to be drawn further into the questions that may be involved in other prayers of the cross-bill ; it seems to me. there is no sound equitable principle on which the court can grant the prayer for an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">It, is obvious, that in this view of the case, the court cannot dissolve the injunction obtained by the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The Company\u2019s bill charges, that at the time of the breaking of the gate and waste way at the ravine, the water of the Passaic was running over the dam above the falls, made by the Society to divert the water to their works; and the answer does not deny, but admits the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Under these circumstances, it seems to me that a dissolution of the injunction would be a present recognition by the court of the right of the Society to a constant flow at the ravine of three square feet. This, as intimated before, I am not now prepares! to declare.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Both motions are denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
