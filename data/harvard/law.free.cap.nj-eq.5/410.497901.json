Warne, believing that-the want of water for the canal would be permanent, wished them to buy his whole right. After negotiation between the company and Warne, the company leased from Warne the privilege of taking the water from the Brasscastle for three years, at the annual rent of $250; and thereupon cut a sluice by which they turned the water of the Brasscastle into their canal. The company paid Warne the stipulated rent for the threb years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>On the 19th of January, 1833, Warne sold and conveyed his said land to H.

There is, .also, a difficulty in the way of an injunction.growing out of the length of time during which the complainant has slept over his rights, if he has any. But aside \u2022from these matters, it is clear that, in the present position of things, this is not a case for the interposition of this court by injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">It is.not an application by the owner of a .mill seat, to prevent the obstruction or diversion of the stream. <em>An </em>injunction -is sought by the complainant as a means of compelling the company to make him compensation for the use of the water.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u2022 This must be its only object; for the complainant having conveyed the mill <em>seat, has no use for the water </em>himself. The only benefit -he can derive from Iris present position, under the reservation in his deed to Winter, (assuming that such a.reser-vatiomis good,l is from the actual use of the water by the defendants ; and there is nothing to show that an action at law \u25a0would not yield him any compensation a court of law might award him; and there is nothing of the character of irreparable injury to the complainant by the .defendants\u2019 use of the water.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">.Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
