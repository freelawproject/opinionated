The answer submits that this portion, so conveyed to and now held by Ross, should be first sold, because each of the subsequent purchasers had full notice, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-6\">The answer of Samuel Ross ivas put in before the answer of Abraham Haines, and contains no denial of notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-7\">The testimony is as follows</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-8\">The writing mentioned j-n the answer of Abraham Haines, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>\u25a0as given by John W. Stitts to Barclay Haines, is exhibited, and marked Exhibit A. on .the part of Abraham Haines.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-3\">Barclay Haines, for the defendant Abraham Haines, testifies, that on the 19th of March, 1839, he bought of his father, Abraham Haines, the tract of about twenty-four acres, mentioned in the answer of Abraham Haines ; that at the time he \u25a0bought it, he understood there was a mortgage on it with other property of Abraham Haines, then held by Hinchman Haines; and that the amount due on .the mortgage was $500, with interest from Maroh 25th, 1839, and that .the balance of the mortgage had all been paid .up. He was to give $1500 for the \u25a0tract -he bought\u2014$1000 in trade, and $500 by paying the balance .due on .the mortgage. There was mo written agreement \u25a0between him .and his father. It was expressly agreed between .them that this land should be liable for .the $500 due on the mortgage. When he sold to Stitts, he gave Stitts notice that this tract was liable for the money due on the .mortgage, and was to be alone liable for it. There -was a .written agreement .'between him and Stitts in reference to that sale; the agreement at first was verbal, but was afterwards reduced to writing .and signed by Stitts, at the tipie of the .delivery of the deed. The paper marked Exhibit A. on the part of Abraham Haines, .was here shown to the witness, and he said that it was the .agreement referred to ; that he saw Stitts sign it; that it is wit-messed -by J. R. Value, who at the time was a clerk -for Stitts. He does not think that Value lives in this state; he lived in Pennsylvania at .the .time of the execution of the <em>paper; </em>has never known him to be in Jersey since. Stitts was-to give him $1600 for the tract\u2014$100 in cash, $1000 in trade, and the $500 due on the mortgage, which was a part of the consideration. Stitts was to .pay the interest from March 7th, 1839. \u25a0He knows -Charles H. and John F. White. They resided in \u2022Philadelphia at that time, and do still. He was at his father\u2019s \u25a0when one of them and a Mr. Curtis, a scrivener, whose office was in Arch street, Philadelphia, drove up and inquired for Abraham Haines. They had a conversation with him in witness\u2019s presence. They wished to know of his father whether \u00a1this tract was free and clear, or incumbered; he means the \u00abtwenty-four acres spoken of. His father told them it was in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>cumbered by that $500 mortgage. Curtis then said to White, that man Stitts would have cheated you, perhaps, if you had not come up. His father told them that I had sold Stitts that property, and that I had an agreement from Stitts, showing about that mortgage. They then asked me if I had that agreement. I told them I had, and produced it, and they both read it. Curtis then said to White, this shows the thing exactly, that there is a mortgage on that property for $500. White requested Curtis to take a copy of the agreement, which he did. One of them, he thinks White, then asked who held the mortgage. I told them Hinchman Haines. They asked if I knew whether that money, the $500, was wanted. I replied, I did not know. White asked if Hinchman Haines lived far distant. I told them the distance. They asked me to go there with them to see him. We found him, and I introduced him to those gentlemen. White asked him if he held a mortgage on the property, describing -what property. He said he .did. White asked him if he wanted the money. He said he would like the money paid off, as there were so many indorsements on the bond; that it was covered with them. White told him he expected to buy the property, and if he did he would like to make some arrangement about the mortgage; that if required, he would .give a new bond and mortgage ; that he -would pay the interest up punctually, and -pay all the back interest; and that if he got the property, he thought he would be able to pay off the principal within a year. On these -terms Hinchman Haines consented to let the mortgage lay -for -one year. White then asked Hinchman where he could send the interest money. Hinchman .told him to the post-office at Marlelon. They then parted. He does not remember which one of the Whites it was: it was one of them; they are in partnership together. He has a slight acquaintance with Samuel Ross, one of the defendants in this .case. He had a conversation with Ross, previous to his purchasing this property. R. W. Howell, of Camden, counsel of Ross at that time, called to me as I was passing his office, and wished me to tell him what I knew about the title of this property which Stitts bought of me, and how it was situated as .respected the incumbrances. He said Ross, a client of his, was .about buying it. I told him how it was situated, and that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>was liable for -ibis $500, and alone liable. He then asked me to go .with him to see Ross. -I went with him and saw Ross, at his factory in Camden. -I.then told Ross that this property was subject to the payment of $500, .as I had told his counsel before. I told Ross.at that time, what.the agreement was between Abraham Haines and myself .when I bought the property, in the same manner I have stated in.this examination ; and.also that Iiiad sold it to Stitts subject to the mortgage; and that I had informed one,of the Mr. Whites of its being liable for the .said mortgage. I .do not remember exactly .the reply of Ross. He, .or his counsel, said they were much obliged for the information. Ross and Mr. Howell were both present at the conversation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-5\">Richard W. Howell, sworn en the part of the defendant .Samuel Ross, testifies, that he had a conversation ..with Barclay Haines, in his (Ho well\u2019s)1 office, -in relation to some part of the \u2022property bought by Ross of the Messrs. White. His recollection is, that a short time before the June term, 1841, of the Gloucester court, Barclay Haines called at his office to retain him in a suit. After arranging the business, witness mentioned to him that he had seen his name in connexion with some property \u25a0that Mr. Ross had.either purchased, or was in negotiation for, witli the Whites-; and that it might be important for Mr. Ross \u25a0to possess any information he might have in relation to it. Haines said he would accompany witness in .calling on Ross. They found Ross at his factory in Camden. Witness\u2019s impression is, that Ross was just about starting to visit this farm, he either had purchased or contracted for with the Whites. Witness mentioned to Mr. Ross that this was Mr. Haines, and stated \u2022that Haines knew something about \u00a1the property, or some part .of it. Haines went into an explanation of something relating ito the .property, which at the time witness thought might be important for Ross to know; but the particulars of which he does not recollect. Witness had been spoken to by Ross before then, to draw a deed from the Whites to him. He does not recollect whether the conversation was before or after June 11th, 1841. He remembers that Ross did not seem particularly pleased, and rather cut short the explanation of Haines by remarking that he was entirely satisfied. The substance of it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>this: that the Whites were honorable men; that he had nothing to fear from them, or that they would do what was right in the matter; To a question here put by the counsel of Mr. Ross, whether from what passed in the conversation between Ross and Haines, the witness understood that Ross had already purchased the property from the Whites, the witness says, his impression certainly is that the negotiation was settled at that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-5\">Cross-examined. He cannot recollect whether he drew the deed before or after this conversation wiih Ross. His impression is, that the papers connected with the property were with him at this time, and had been for some time. He drew the deed that was executed. He drew another deed, which was not executed. There were some parts of it, cannot say what, hut connected with the warranty, which he does not recollect, that was objected to by one of the Whites-; it might have been about the $500 mortgage, or it might not; he cannot recollect positively. [The deed which was executed contains only a covenant of warranty, and not a covenant against incumbrances.] The conversation, he had with Haines, before going to Mr. Ross, was about an incumbrance on the property, or some part of it, the particulars of which he does not recollect. It was Mr. Haines\u2019s knowledge of the matter, whatever it was, that witness desired Ross to possess. He presumes Haines made the same statement to Ross which he had made to him, in substance, in1 relation to this matter, whatever it was, but Mr. Ross shortened the conversation. It struck witness at the moment that Ross-was not particularly desirous of hearing Mr. Haines. His carriage was waiting for him at the time. Witness cannot say whether at this time the deed was executed or not. He believer lie should have taken-Haines to Mr. Ross whether the deed was executed or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-6\">The cause was heard on the pleadings and proofs,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b191-7\">Stratton, for the complainant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b191-8\"><em>Ten </em>Eyck, for the defendant Abraham Haines.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b191-9\">Jeffers, for the defendant Samuel Ross.-</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Mr. Ten Eyck cited, 4 <em>Kent\u2019s Com. </em>173, 174, 179; 1 <em>John.
