Co. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 206, the syllabus holds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">\u201cOne who engages the services of an independent contractor, and who <em>actually participates </em>in the job operation performed by such contractor and thereby fails to eliminate a hazard which he, in the exercise of ordinary care, could have eliminated, can be held responsible for the injury or death of an employee of the independent contractor.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">This court in <em>Hirschbach </em>reversed a summary judgment for the defendant who contracted with the injured man\u2019s employer to repair the defendant\u2019s electrical tower. The contractor\u2019s employee fell when the tower broke under tension from the contractor\u2019s winch line. The <em>Hirschbach </em>majority premised the defendant\u2019s liability on his denial of the contractor\u2019s request to position the winch line outside the defendant\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Three members of the court dissented in <em>Hirschbach, </em>citing decisions that bar recovery when the injury results from risks inherent in the contractor\u2019s assigned task. <em>Wellman </em>v. <em>East Ohio Gas Co. </em>(1953), 160 Ohio St. 103 [51 O.O. 27]; <em>Schwarz </em>v. <em>General Electric Realty Corp. </em>(1955), 163 Ohio St. 354 [56 O.O. 319]; <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Whirlpool Corp. </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St. 2d 240 [39 O.O.2d 372]; and <em>Briere </em>v. <em>Lathrop Co. </em>(1970), 22 Ohio St. 2d 166 [51 O.O.2d 232]. The majority distinguished <em>Wellman </em>because in <em>Hirschbach </em>the defendant had \u201cactually participated in the job operation performed by the crew of the independent contractor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">In the present case, Turner relies on the same \u201cinherent risk\u201d decisions, noting that <em>Hirschbach </em>does not overrule these decisions. <em>Hirschbach </em>authorizes liability if the defendant \u201cactually participate^] in the job operation\u201d and negligently fails to eliminate a risk inherent in the contractor\u2019s job. The undisputed facts establish that Turner did not actively participate in any action or decision that led to the fatal injuries. Turner may have known about some of Millgard\u2019s activities, but that knowledge does not constitute \u201cactual participation\u201d in those activities within the <em>Hirschbach </em>rule. Unlike the landowner in <em>Hirschbach, </em>Turner neither gave nor denied permission for the critical acts that led to the decedent\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">As already noted, Millgard alone made the decisions to attempt to drive the lowest casing in hole A-3 deeper into the ground and to send the men down into the hole after the twister bar became jammed. Turner personnel were not consulted about either decision. Caisson installation is known to be dangerous work and Millgard was aware that highly explosive methane gas was present beneath the worksite.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">Appellants assert that certain provisions of the contract between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Turner and Millgard as well as certain portions of Turner\u2019s safety manual reveal Turner\u2019s retention of control over safety procedures at the project site. Turner had an obvious interest in safety and it insisted that its own employees as well as the employees of subcontractors carry on their work activities in as safe a manner as possible. Nevertheless, this concern for safety, which was evidenced in a variety of ways, does not constitute the kind of active participation in Millgard\u2019s work that is legally required to create a duty of care extending from Turner to Millgard\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The Turner \u201cSafety Program\u201d is a one-page list of general safety requirements directed toward all subcontractors. Turner advised everyone concerned that hard hats must be worn, appropriate eyewear and footwear must be available for use, and the like. This safety program was nothing more than a handy, brief reference sheet to remind subcontractors about the fundamental \u201cdo\u2019s and don\u2019ts\u201d at the construction site.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The contract language pertaining to job safety is nothing more than standard \u201cboilerplate\u201d terminology common to virtually all construction contracts. Turner retained the ability to monitor and coordinate the activities of all subcontractors in order to ensure compliance with the architect\u2019s specifications. The various contractual rights reserved by Turner did not empower Turner to control the means or manner of Millgard\u2019s performance. Millgard, the acknowledged expert in caisson installation, assumed the responsibility to construct and install caissons in a sound, efficient, and safe manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The details of Millgard\u2019s performance were directed and carried out solely by Millgard\u2019s employees. Turner did not direct or interfere with Millgard\u2019s work.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">A general contractor who has not actively participated in the subcontractor\u2019s work, does not, merely by virtue of its supervisory capacity, owe a duty of care to employees of the subcontractor who are injured while engaged in inherently dangerous work. The trial court correctly granted, and the court of appeals properly affirmed, summary judgment in favor of Turner.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals as to Turner is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b147-11\">Sweeney, Locher, Holmes and Douglas, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b147-12\">Celebrezze, C.J., and C. Brown, J., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b147-13\">Celebrezze, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A6J\">dissenting. I concur with Justice Brown\u2019s well-reasoned conclusion that the determinative issue in this case is whether the general contractor, Turner, retained custody and control of the premises on which appellants\u2019 decedents met their deaths.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Further, it is clear that Turner\u2019s involvement in controlling safety on this job site, through its safety program, went well beyond the \u201chandy reminders\u201d referred to in the majority opinion. The record is replete with memoranda from Turner\u2019s supervisors and its insurer directing and recommending that Millgard correct safety violations ranging from a defective buzzer on a front-end loader to the storage of gases. Thus, Turner, to the extent that it retained control of safety on the premises, actually participated in Millgard\u2019s work.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">It must not be forgotten that the fundamental purpose of R.C. 4101.11 and 4101.12 is to provide employees with a safe place to work. This was the basis of the federal district court\u2019s opinion in <em>Foraker </em>v. <em>Cyclops Corp. </em>(N.D. Ohio 1985), 605 F. Supp. 641, where the court thoroughly examined <em>Wellman </em>v. <em>East Ohio Gas Co. </em>(1953), 160 Ohio St. 103 [51 O.O. 27], <em>Hirschbach </em>v. <em>Cincinnati Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 206, and <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Mid-States Terminal, Inc. </em>(1984), 17 Ohio App. 3d 19, as well as the opinion of the court of appeals in the instant case. In <em>Foraker, </em>an employee of an independent contractor was severely burned while cleaning a zinc dust collector at the defendant\u2019s plant. The defendant contended that it owed no duty of care to the independent contractor because the contractor\u2019s employees were aware of the hazardous nature of their work. The court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to find that the defendant retained custody and control of the premises by virtue of an agreement which required the contractor to comply with all of the defendant\u2019s safety rules and regulations. Thus, the court concluded, summary judgment in favor of the defendant was precluded and the defendant could be liable under R.C. 4101.11 and 4101.12, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">\u201c* * * It is true that a landowner hires a subcontractor to do work requiring special skills or knowledge and that often this decision is motivated by the knowledge that an inherent danger or risk is involved. At the same time, it is not the rule in Ohio that once the hiring decision is made the independent contractor and his employees are completely independent and stripped of protection. * * *\u201d <em>Foraker, supra, </em>at 651-652.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">In the instant case, as Justice Brown has illustrated, there is a question of fact as to whether Turner and its supervisors did all that they could have done to ensure the safety of appellants\u2019 decedents on the date of this accident. It is apparent that Turner\u2019s supervisor took a \u201chands off\u201d approach to the work being done when this incident occurred. The majority views this as a lack of \u201cactive participation\u201d in the subcontractor\u2019s work, thus insulating Turner from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">However, to the extent that Turner actually participated in Millgard\u2019s activities by retaining control of job safety, a jury might view this \u201chands off\u201d approach as an abdication of Turner\u2019s statutory duty to provide safe working conditions. Thus, summary judgment in the instant case is both premature and inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">For the foregoing reasons, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>C. Brown, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b149-5\">Clifford F. Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AA\">dissenting. I must respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s affirmance of the judgment of the court of appeals in this case. I do so because the summary judgment as to Turner was improperly granted. Where a general contractor retains control over the premises of the job, and retains authority to participate in an independent subcontractor\u2019s work, the general contractor owes a duty to all frequenters of the job site to exercise that retained authority when the general contractor knows, or reasonably should know, that the subcontractor is proceeding with work in a dangerous manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">That statement of the general contractor\u2019s duty of care flows from <em>Hirschbach </em>v. <em>Cincinnati Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 206, in which we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">\u201cOne who engages the services of an independent contractor, and who actually participates in the job operation performed by such contractor and thereby fails to eliminate a hazard which he, in the exercise of ordinary care, could have eliminated, can be held responsible for the injury or death of an employee of the independent contractor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">The general contractor\u2019s duty of care arises from R.C. 4101.11 and 4101.12. In <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Mid-States Terminal, Inc. </em>(1984), 17 Ohio App. 3d 19, now-Justice Douglas, the author of that court of appeals\u2019 opinion, had occasion to analyze this court\u2019s decision in <em>Hirschbach. </em>He stated, at 22, that \u201c[a] careful review of the decision reveals that, in accordance with previous case law, the determination as to the applicability of the Ohio \u2018frequenter\u2019 statutes (R.C. 4101.01 <em>et </em>seq.) in the <em>Hirschbach </em>case turns upon a finding that the defendant had retained custody and control over the premises, as established by the fact of the inspector\u2019s direct participation in the operations of the independent contractor. * * *\u201d In that case, one of the determinative factors was the general contractor\u2019s retention of authority to stop its subcontractor\u2019s work and direct changes in the face of safety-oriented emergencies. There, as here, the general contractor had failed to exercise that authority; there, as here, summary judgment was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">In this case, Turner, the general contractor, and Millgard, the subcontractor, entered into a written contract. In that contract, Turner retained the right to \u201c* * * stop any part of the Work which Turner deems unsafe until corrective measures satisfactory to Turner have been taken * * If Millgard neglected to take such corrective measures, Turner reserved the right to undertake them at Millgard\u2019s cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">Further, Turner\u2019s own safety bulletins acknowledged .Turner\u2019s responsibility for working conditions as follows: \u201cWe are General Contractors and usually as such are responsible for the general conditions which exist on each project we build. * * *\u201d \u201cSubcontractors are also required to adhere to the safety requirements. Superintendents should be sure that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Subs are aware of and follow the sections of the regulations applicable to their work. * * *\u201d \u201cConstant supervision by the Superintendent and responsible staff members is required to eliminate unnecessary hazards on our work.\u201d \u201c* * * Our superintendents must always be alert to prevent unsafe conditions from developing, not only on our own work but on that of others engaged on the project.\u201d The majority\u2019s attempt to dismiss Turner\u2019s contractual language regarding job safety as mere \u201cboilerplate\u201d ignores Turner\u2019s documented acknowledgements that it intended to actually participate in Millgard\u2019s work, at least to some degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Indeed, the record reveals that Turner followed through on its stated intent to closely supervise Millgard\u2019s work. In his deposition, Turner\u2019s assistant superintendent, Neil J. Carothers III, acknowledged that he was on the job site the day of the explosion, and was aware that methane gas had been detected in the A-3 Hole. Just before the explosion, Carothers heard the drill motor stop, and went to investigate. When Millgard\u2019s personnel \u201cimpolitely\u201d asked him to leave, Carothers left, choosing not to exercise Turner\u2019s contractual right to ensure that corrections were safely made..</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Civ. R. 56(C) provides that summary judgment shall be rendered only if \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d In considering a motion for summary judgment supported by evidence, summary judgment \u201cshall not be rendered unless it appears from such evidence or stipulation and only therefrom,, that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, such party being entitled to have the evidence or stipulation construed most strongly in his favor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court of appeals noted that, in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, \u201c* * * there is some evidence that the general contractor\u2019s supervisors attended the job site to oversee and coordinate safety. The general contractor\u2019s personnel knew that methane was present in the hole where the decedents sustained their injuries.\u201d The court of appeals further stated that the evidentiary materials \u201cestablished] without dispute that the general contractor assigned the subcontractor all duties related to the excavation involved here.\u201d Thus, the court of appeals, in essence, held that Turner, by contract, had effectively assigned those safety responsibilities to Millgard, thus escaping liability as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">However, a general contractor should not be able to delegate, by its contract documents, responsibility for all safety precautions on the site, while retaining full authority and control over the premises and the right to direct supervision of its subcontractor\u2019s work. To avoid liability, the delegation must be complete, and retention of control over the premises and the subcontractor\u2019s means of performance abandoned. I would hold that a general contractor\u2019s contractual delegation of safety responsibilities does not relieve all liability to its subcontractor\u2019s employees where, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>here, the general contractor retains control over the premises, retains general supervisory control over the subcontractor, and retains authority to intervene and participate in the work whenever the general contractor finds that its subcontractor is proceeding in an unsafe manner. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Turner was inappropriate. The jury was entitled to consider whether and to what extent Turner had breached its duty of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed, and the cause remanded for trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b151-6\">Celebrezze, C.J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
