R. 12(E) provides: \u201cA motion made before trial other than a motion for change of venue, shall be timely determined before trial. Where factual issues are involved in determining a motion, the court <em>shall </em>state its essential findings on the record.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In ruling on Knapp\u2019s motion for discharge, the trial court on request by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>defendant was required to determine factual issues concerning the reasons for delay of the trial. Crim. R. 12(E) mandates that the court state its essential findings on the record.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Without such findings, neither the court of appeals nor this court can properly review the propriety of the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">A trial court must, upon the defendant\u2019s request, state essential findings of fact in support of its denial of a motion to discharge for failure to comply with the speedy trial provisions of R.C. 2945.71. We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand this cause to the trial court for the purpose of stating its essential findings of fact on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b99-6\">Holmes, C.

R. 48(B), which requires the trial court to \u201c* * * state on the record its findings of fact and reasons for the dismissal\u201d only when the court dismisses a case over the state\u2019s objection. The fact that Crim. R. 48(B) requires findings in one particular situation does not, however, exempt the court from the obligation to make findings in other situations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b99-8\">Celebrezze, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AnU\">dissenting. I agree with the majority\u2019s observation that Crim. R. 12(E) requires that \u201c[w]here factual issues are involved in determining a motion, the court shall state its <em>essential findings </em>on the record.\u201d (Emphasis added.) However, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that the findings and record of the trial court in this case preclude effective review of the ruling on appellant\u2019s motion for discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">If the trial delay is so long that it is \u201c* * * facially unreasonable and seriously open to question * * * the <em>attendant facts and circumstances must be included in the record in sufficient detail </em>so that the necessity and reasonableness of the continuance is demonstrable. * * * For this court to require less is to foreclose effective appellate review * * <em>State </em>v. <em>Westworth </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St. 2d 171, 175 [8 O.O.3d 162],</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">In my opinion, the instant <em>record </em>amply establishes the sequence of events concerning the continuances granted by the trial court. It clearly reveals that a number of the delays were caused by appellant\u2019s own requests <em>and </em>his failure to appear in court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Bauer </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St. 2d 83 [15 O.O.3d 122]; <em>State </em>v. <em>McBreen </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St. 2d 315, 318 [8 O.O.3d 302].<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Additionally, the two continuances requested by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>the prosecutor were both approved by defense counsel. <em>State </em>v. <em>McRae </em>(1978), 55 Ohio St. 2d 149 [9 O.O.3d 118]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1975), 44 Ohio App. 2d 95, 101 [73 O.O.2d 89].<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Although the judge\u2019s essential finding that \u201call\u201d delays were appellant\u2019s is not totally correct, that ruling together with the record does provide the basis of the trial court\u2019s ruling and also contains sufficient facts concerning the chronology of events <em>in this case </em>so that a reviewing court can determine the \u201cnecessity and reasonableness\u201d of the continuances.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">I would follow the standard set forth in <em>Wentworth, supra, </em>and affirm the judgment of the appellate court. Further, although the stated basis of the trial judge\u2019s ruling is not entirely accurate, his decision to overrule appellant\u2019s motion for discharge is nevertheless correct because the continuances of the trial date were reasonable and proper in this case.
