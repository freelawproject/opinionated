The scope of this review is limited. It is not the function of this court to substitute its judgment for that of the Board of Tax Appeals on factual issues, but only to determine whether the decision reached by the board is unreasonable or unlawful. <em>Maumee Valley Broadcasting Assn. </em>v. <em>Porterfield </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St. 2d 95, 97 [58 O.O.2d 192]. On the other hand, this court has never held, and declines to hold now, that it should simply rubber stamp the board\u2019s factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">The record discloses that attorney Zapp prepared a DTE Form 4, and actually filed it with the Board of Tax Appeals on February 3, 1984. The record further discloses that Zapp sent a certified mailing to the Summit County Board of Revision on February 6, 1984. It is undisputed that the certified mailing was received by the board of revision on February 7, 1984, and that it contained a cover letter from Zapp to \u201cMr. Tim Davis, Auditor &amp; Secretary to the Board of Revision [of] Summit County.\u201d What is disputed is whether or not the certified mailing also contained a DTE Form 4. Robin Alexander, Zapp\u2019s secretary, testified that she placed a DTE Form 4 in the February 6, 1984 certified mailing. However, Shelley Rexrode, the clerk for the board of revision, testified that the received mailing did not contain a DTE Form 4. The factual explanations offered by both witnesses seem plausible, and it is possible that they are both telling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>the truth as they know it, but that one of them is mistaken. Under such circumstances, evidence that corroborates the sworn testimony is highly relevant, and generally dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The corroborative evidence tends to support Consolidated Freightways\u2019 version of the facts. As stated above, it is undisputed that Zapp <em>prepared and filed </em>a DTE Form 4 with the Board of Tax Appeals on February 3, 1984. Furthermore, again as stated above, it is undisputed that Zapp sent a certified mailing to the board of revision on February 6, 1984. The issue in this case is whether that mailing contained a DTE Form 4. It is more probable than not that the February 6, 1984 certified mailing contained a DTE Form 4 because: (1) Robin Alexander who prepared the mailing, testified that it did; and (2) her sworn testimony is corroborated by the undisputed fact that her office had prepared a DTE Form 4 before the mailing was sent. In consideration of this evidence, and considering that the testimony of Shelley Rexrode was not corroborated by any independent evidence, we find that Consolidated Freightways timely filed the DTE Form 4 with the Summit County Board of Revision.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Our decision today is very narrow and we conclude by emphasizing what we do not hold. We do not hold that we will substitute our judgment for that of the Board of Tax Appeals on factual issues, and we do not hold that litigants can disregard the mandatory notice-of-appeal requirements of R.C. 5717.01. All that we hold is that, <em>in this case, </em>the factual determination of the Board of Tax Appeals is unreasonable insofar as it found that Consolidated Freightways failed to timely file a DTE Form 4 with the Summit County Board of Revision.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Accordingly, the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is reversed and this cause is remanded to the board for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">\n<em>Decision reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b54-9\">Celebrezze, C.
