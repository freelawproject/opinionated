Such a determination, however, is neither lightly nor automatically imposed. See, <em>e.g., Reinstatement of Rasor </em>(1974), 40 Ohio St. 2d 25 [69 O.O.2d 127] (mitigating circumstances offered with a finding that petitioner had rehabilitated himself to justify readmission to the bar).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">In the present cause respondent\u2019s apparent reluctance to offer mitigation on his own behalf, or to appear before the panel, does not help his position. A review of the record supports the board\u2019s findings and recommendation which we adopt in their totality.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">It is the judgment of this court that respondent be permanently disbarred from the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b143-10\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C. Brown, Douglas and Wright, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
