Driving on 35th Street at as fast as 60 miles per hour, the police car did not gain on the other vehicle; 35th Street merged into Rigel Street about three blocks from National Avenue. After traveling one block on Rigel Street, the pursued car turned east onto Birch Street which it went along for one block to Siva onto which it turned and on which it traveled north for one block, and from which it turned west onto Acacia Street where it stopped in front of 3520 Acacia, the home of Mr. and Mrs. Autry. Rigel, Birch, Siva and Acacia Streets are unpaved, and the area is a residential one. During the chase, Smith, in order to avoid being thrown about, had to hold onto the door fixtures on his side. The rear-end of the pursued car fishtailed as it traveled over the streets after leaving National Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">As Knoll came up behind the other car, defendant got out of the left front door of that car, went around the front of it and turned toward the entrance to 3520 Acacia Street. From the police car, which had then stopped, Smith called to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>defendant to stop, that Smith wanted to talk to him. Defendant turned and looked at Smith and continued toward the house; the two police officers alighted and followed defendant who entered the house, into which the two policemen followed him, opening the screen door to pass through an otherwise opened door. Defendant had gone from the living room into a bedroom, into which the officers followed, and where Smith asked defendant to come outside, that Smith wanted to talk to him. Without saying anything, defendant went out the front door, followed by Smith and Knoll; outdoors, Knoll took hold of defendant\u2019s right arm and Smith of his left and conducted defendant to the police car where Smith told defendant he was under arrest for reckless driving; told defendant to put his arms behind his back so he might have handcuffs put on. Defendant said, \"You are not going to put me no place\u201d and shoved Smith so that the latter was thrown off balance. Smith attempted unsuccessfully to subdue defendant, in which effort Knoll also joined. In the ensuing melee, defendant pulled Smith\u2019s pistol in its holster away from Smith\u2019s belt, but during the struggle the pistol and holster were forced from defendant's hand. After the officers had subdued defendant, he broke away and ran. Smith then drew his pistol but did not fire it. Several hours later defendant surrendered himself into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">At the time, defendant, a 21-year-old Negro high school graduate, temporarily separated from his wife, was living with his mother on Rigel Street around the corner from the Autry house. He was six feet tall and weighed about 190 pounds. He was working as a welder\u2019s apprentice and a plumber\u2019s apprentice five and as many as seven days a week. The car followed by the police, a 1967 Plymouth Sports Fury, had been purchased by defendant in February.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Defendant\u2019s Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">Defendant states the issues as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-9\">\"1. Whether the chief of police of the City of San Diego should have been permitted to testify under subpoena as an expert witness for the defense with respect to police practice in circumstances like those shown here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-10\">\"2. Whether the trial judge properly sustained objections to the hypothetical question sought to be propounded by the defense to the chief of police as an expert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-11\">\"3. Whether special interrogatories and special verdicts requested by the defendant should have been submitted to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>\u201c4. Whether the trial court erred in refusing a \u2018formula\u2019 instruction to the jury on the issue of self-defense, offered by the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-5\">\u201c5. Whether the trial court should have instructed the jury, as requested by the defendant on the effect of the violation of Penal Code 844 by the police officers as disclosed in the evidence at the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">\u201c6. Whether the defendant should have been permitted to refer, in voir dire of the jury panel and in closing argument, to portions of the report of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders relative to community-police relationships in the ghettoes. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Discussion of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">The evidence presented by defendant would have placed the emphasis on issues quite different from those stated above. Defendant\u2019s testimony was that he had last driven his ear at least a half hour before the police entered the Autry house; that just before his arrest he himself had gone to the Autry house from his mother\u2019s home to make a phone call and saw his wife, another woman and his two children in the car as he went toward the Autry house and stopped to speak to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">He concedes, however, that the evidence was sufficient to support the verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">Defendant\u2019s First Contention</p>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">It is claimed that a police officer is competent to give an expert opinion as to whether, under stated circumstances, another police officer uses force upon a person without lawful necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-12\">\u25a0 A hypothetical question was prepared covering defendant\u2019s contentions as to the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-13\">Defendant obtained and had served upon the San Diego chief of police a subpoena for his appearance at 2 p.m. of the day the trial commenced. The police chief presented, through the district attorney, his statement that he did not know anything about the facts of the case, and a motion to quash the subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-14\">Defendant urged to the court that he wished to examine the police chief as an expert as to whether the circumstances of defendant\u2019s encounter with the police on October 7 were such as to make the police guilty of a violation of section 149, Penal Code, which provides: \u2018 \u2018 Every public officer who, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>color of authority, without lawful necessity, assaults or beats any person, is punishable by a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment in the state prison not exceeding five years or in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by both such fine and imprisonment. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The court granted the motion to quash.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">There is no statutory authority to quash a subpoena, other than a subpoena duces tecum. It was held in an early case that in the absence of a statutory provision for such an order, an order quashing a subpoena was a nullity. <em>(Pfister </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>64 Cal. 400 [1 P. 492].) It has since been established that the court may quash a subpena that is regular on its face where the facts justify such action. The Supreme Court has said: \u201cThe defendant is entitled to compel the attendance of witnesses (Cal. Const., art I, \u00a713; Pen. Code, \u00a7 686, subd. 3), but in the instant ease he failed to show that the persons he subpoenaed could offer relevant testimony in his behalf. It is not claimed that they had personal knowledge of the matters relating to the charges. The defendant himself indicated that they could establish only that the sections of the Vehicle Code were discriminately enforced as to him (testimony manifestly incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial for the reasons heretofore stated), and, although invited by the court to set forth the specific nature of the testimony sought to be elicited from the witnesses in question, defendant failed to do so, nor is there any such showing in the petitions with which we are here concerned. Under the circumstances present in the instant proceeding, we are satisfied that the court did not err in quashing the subpoenas.\u201d <em>(In re Finn, </em>54 Cal.2d 807, 813 [8 Cal.Rptr. 741, 356 P.2d 685].)</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">A like result has been achieved by the quashing of a request for the issuance of subpoenas to witnesses for the purpose of impeaching witnesses for the prosecution where: \u201cThere was no showing that any one of the witnesses subpoenaed would have impeached any of the People\u2019s witnesses.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hollander, </em>194 Cal.App.2d 386, 391 [14 Cal.Rptr. 917].)</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">The defendant subpoenaed the police chief for the sole purpose of asking questions as to police methods in dealing with minority groups in the city, and to propound a hypothetical question with whose defects we deal hereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">No attempt was made to show what testimony would be elicited from the prospective witness; there was no offer of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">Apart from the hypothetical question with which we deal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>later, the subject matter of the proposed interrogation was irrelevant to the issue, and had no tendency to prove what in fact occurred at the time or place in question; under the authorities cited, there was no error in the court\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Dependant\u2019s Second Contention</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Defendant submitted to the court a hypothetical question in writing which was marked as a court exhibit. The question was one that defendant would have propounded to the chief of police of San Diego. The court sustained an objection to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Among the assumed matters the question is based upon was that after entering the Autry house and seeing defendant in a bedroom within, the officers asked an occupant (Mrs. Autry) \u20181 if defendant is the man who had just come in. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">Such an assumed fact is wholly unsupported by any evidence, direct or inferential.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">Without discussing whether the opinion sought to be elicited was a proper subject of expert opinion, and without discussing whether the question omitted undisputed facts that should have been embodied, we believe the court\u2019s ruling was correct because of the inclusion of assumed facts of which there was no evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">Error cannot be predicated upon the sustaining of an objection to a hypothetical question that assumes facts of which the record is devoid of evidence. <em>(Linde </em>v. <em>Emmick, </em>16 Cal.App.2d 676, 686 [61 P.2d 338]; <em>Estate of Phillips, </em>202 Cal. 490, 495 [261 P. 709].) The court, without an objection having been made, might properly exclude such a question.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">There was no error in the court\u2019s rulings on the propriety of the hypothetical question regardless of the stated grounds of objection. <em>(Davey </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co., </em>116 Cal. 325, 330 [48 P. 117].)</p>\n<p id=\"b682-13\">Dependant\u2019s Third Contention</p>\n<p id=\"b682-14\">Defendant requested that the following special interrogatories be submitted to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-15\">\u201cDid the police officers, or either of them, assault defendant before defendant offered any physical resistance <em>% </em>\u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>\u201cIf so, was the assault committed with or without lawful necessity ? \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-6\">\u201cDid defendant resist the assault with any greater force than he reasonably believed necessary to protect himself against injury in the circumstances ? \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">\u201cWas defendant reasonable in the circumstances in believing that the force he used was necessary to protect himself from injury?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-8\">He also requested the submission of the following forms of special verdicts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-9\">\u201cWe, the jury in the above-entitled cause find that Officer Donald Knoll did assault defendant John Rhone without lawful necessity.' \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-10\">\u201cWe, the jury in the above-entitled cause find that Officer Donald Knoll did not assault defendant, John Rhone without lawful necessity. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">Concerning the forms of special verdicts requested, it is immediately apparent that they do not provide for a determination of all the ultimate facts upon which the court could draw conclusions of law, that defendant was or was not guilty of the offenses charged against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-12\">One factual issue, the answer to which bore necessarily upon the question whether the officers acted reasonably in taking hold of defendant\u2019s arms when he walked out of the house, is whether it was defendant who drove the ear pursued by the officers and ignored their request that he stop before he entered the Autry house. Defendant\u2019s account was to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-13\">Section 1150, Penal Code, is as follows: \u201cThe jury must render a general verdict, except that in a superior court, when they are in doubt as to the legal effect of the facts proved, they may, except upon a trial for libel, find a special verdict. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b683-14\">Section 1152, Penal Code, is as follows: \u201cA special verdict is that by which the jury find the facts only, leaving the judgment to the Court. It must present the conclusions of fact as established by the evidence, and not the evidence to prove them, and these conclusions of fact must be so presented as that nothing remains to the Court but to draw conclusions of law upon them. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b683-15\">Nothing in the record indicates that the jury expressed or experienced any difficulty in applying the court\u2019s instructions to the facts impliedly found by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-16\">There may be circumstances in which it might be error for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>the court to refuse to invite the jury at its option to return a special verdict or for the court to fail to submit such special verdict on its own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">On the other hand, it has been held as a matter of law in some circumstances that the refusal to submit a special form of verdict was proper <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rehman, </em>253 Cal.App.2d 119, 157 [61 Cal.Rptr. 65]; and see <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>199 Cal.App.2d 510, 522 [18 Cal.Rptr. 793]).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The defendant complains only of the refusal of the court to submit the particular forms of special verdicts and interrogatories prepared by him. Those forms did not cover all the facts at issue under the evidence. The refusal to submit them was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Dependant\u2019s Fourth Contention</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">That is the contention that was abandoned at the time of oral argument. Defendant submitted a form of instruction which the court refused to give.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">The requested instruction, so far as it contained a statement of the law, was fully covered by the instructions given; that the judge may have expressed himself as refusing it as a formula instruction is of no consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">Defendant\u2019s Fifth Contention</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">Defendant requested the following instruction. The failure to give it he assigns as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">\u201cTo make an arrest in a house, a peace officer may break open the door or window of the house in which the person arrested is, or in which they have reasonable grounds for believing him to be, after having demanded admittance and explained the purpose for which admittance is desired. The opening'by police of a closed screen or other door constitutes a breaking within the meaning of this instruction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-13\">\u201cSince it appears from the evidence in this case that the police officers entered the Autry home without demanding admittance or explaining their purpose, I charge you that their entry was illegal and an arrest, if any, made by them in the house after such entry was not a valid arrest. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-14\">The question whether the police acted legally in entering the Autry house without first knocking, identifying themselves, announcing their purpose and requesting admittance, is irrelevant to the issues in the case at bench. In view of the language of Penal Code, section 834a, the illegality of an arrest made in the house would not justify resistance on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>part of defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Baca, </em>247 Cal.App.2d 487, 496 [55 Cal.Rptr. 681]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em><footnotemark>*</footnotemark>(Cal.App.) 70 Cal.Rptr. 271.) There is no question here of the use of physical evidence seized as the result of a search incidental to an unlawful arrest, as in <em>People </em>v. <em>Rosales, </em>68 Cal.2d 299 [66 Cal.Rptr. 1, 437 P.2d 489],</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">It is further true that defendant was seeking to evade the officers who were engaged in an immediate and in-view pursuit of defendant, which made unnecessary what would have been superfluous as far as defendant was concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Dependant\u2019s Sixth Contention</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">To appreciate defendant\u2019s argument, a quotation from his brief will be helpful. He writes: \u201cIn the voir dire examination of the jury panel and in closing argument, appellant sought to make reference to the Report of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders for the purpose of demonstrating that by reason of the existence within the United States of \u2018two societies, one black, one white\u2014separate and unequal\u2019 there are different ways of life, one for the ghetto and one for the rest. When the only two Negro veniremen were excused by the prosecutor upon peremptory challenge, any jury awareness of the nature of ghetto life and police practices there was eliminated, and other evidence to fill the gap was needed if the jury was to function as a body representative of the total community. For these reasons the exclusion of references to the Kerner Commission Report was highly prejudicial to appellant\u2019s cause. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">The assumption that defendant lived in a ghetto area is unsupported by the record, unless unpaved streets are found only in ghettos, or Negro citizens live exclusively in ghettos. The record shows, rather, that defendant was in full-time employment, was a high school graduate, owned and drove a car of the then current annual model, and had himself obtained the assistance of the police on an earlier occasion when his car was stolen. The house in which defendant took refuge had at least two bedrooms, contained a telephone which apparently could be used in more than one room, had a rear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>patio and a front yard partly enclosed with a stone or brick wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The matters at issue were not whether at some times and places police had been guilty of brutality, but what were the conduct and actions of defendant and the two officers with whom he dealt. The report of the Kerner Commission was not in evidence and would not have been admissible in evidence, and was, therefore, not a proper subject for argument by counsel. The knowledge or lack of knowledge of the report by prospective jurors would in no way have indicated bias or prejudice or borne upon their qualifications, any more than would have their familiarity or lack of familiarity with the writings of James Baldwin.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">We do not say that knowledge of the contents of the report \u25a0 would not be useful to a trial judge in pronouncing judgment on a convicted defendant whose living conditions were of the kind defense counsel assumes his client had.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">Brown (Gerald), P. J., and Coughlin, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b680-15\">Defense counsel at the time of oral argument stated he did not continue to make that contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b682-16\">In <em>Dillenbeck </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>69 Cal.2d 472 [72 Cal.Rptr. 321, 446 P.2d 129], the Supreme Court held it error to exclude written bulletins which might have been rules establishing standards for police conduct in the operation of emergency vehicles, a departure from which might have been a failure to use due care. A record of the contents of the documents was established by their offer in evidence. No such attempt was made here to show standards of police conduct by an offer of proof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b685-10\">Penal Code, section 834a, provides: <em>\u201cIf a </em>person has knowledge, or by the exercise of reasonable care, should have knowledge, that he is being arrested by a peace officer, it is the duty of such person to refrain from using force or any weapon to resist such arrest. <em>\u2019 \u2019</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b685-11\">A hearing was granted by the Supreme Court on September 11, 1968.
