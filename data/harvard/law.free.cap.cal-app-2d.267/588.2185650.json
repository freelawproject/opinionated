J.</author>\n<p id=\"AzD\">The trial court found that defendants fraudulently induced plaintiffs to enter into an agreement for exchange of real property by gross overstatement of the income of the motel offered by defendants and by concealment of the existence of a deed of trust upon that property. This deed of trust, executed in favor of defendant husband\u2019s brother 10 weeks before signature of the exchange agreement, was not recorded until close of escrow, at a time carefully contrived to precede recordation of defendants\u2019 deed to plaintiffs. Judgment directed rescission of the exchange agreement, cancellation of plaintiffs\u2019 note to defendants, and reconveyance to plaintiffs of the land originally owned by them. It also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>awarded compensatory damages of $3,100 and exemplary damages of $3,500. Defendants appeal, attacking only the award of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Exemplary damages may be awarded only in an action \u201cnot arising from contract\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a73294). They are not allowable in an action for breach of contract, even though the breach be \u201cwilful\u201d <em>(Chelini </em>v. <em>Nieri </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 480, 487 [196 P.2d 915]). An action on the common counts for money had and received has been held to be \u201cbased on a breach of contract,\u201d thus barring exemplary damages <em>(Crogan </em>v. <em>Metz </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 398, 404-405 [303 P.2d 1029]). Appellants contend that the effect of <em>Grogan </em>is to bar exemplary damages in any action in 1 \u2018 quasi-contract. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">A later case <em>(Ward </em>v. <em>Taggart </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 736, 742-743 [336 P.2d 534]) demonstrates that this conclusion is overly broad. There a real estate broker fraudulently purported to act for a named seller, but in fact used buyer\u2019s funds to purchase for himself and resell to the buyer at a higher price. The buyer was allowed recovery on the basis that the broker was an involuntary trustee of the amount of his secret profit. This remedy was expressly termed quasi-eontraetual, but award of exemplary damages was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">In <em>Ward, </em>the court states that \u201c [t]he word \u2018contract\u2019 is used . . . (section 3294) in its ordinary sense to mean an agreement between the parties, not an obligation imposed by law despite the absence of any such agreement.\u201d (P. 743.) In an action upon such an obligation defendant\u2019s \u201cfraud is not waived, for it is the very foundation of the implied-in-law promise to disgorge\u201d <em>(Id. </em>p. 743; <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Duggan, </em>162 Cal.App.2d 580 [328 P.2d 224] ; see <em>Southern Cal. Disinfecting Co. </em>v. <em>Lomkin, </em>183 Cal.App.2d 431 [7 Cal.Rptr. 43] ; <em>Berning </em>v. <em>Colodny &amp; Colodny, </em>103 Cal.App. 188 [284 P. 496]).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">The obligation upon which recovery is here allowed similarly is one \u201cnot arising from contract\u201d within the meaning of section 3294. It is true that in <em>Ward </em>the parties had never consummated a contract. But here the pleadings, trial, findings and judgment made clear the remedy sought by respondents was rescission of their contract with appellants. Par from waiving the fraud and suing upon the contract, respondents sought a determination that the agreement had never been binding upon them because of appellants \u2019 fraud in its inducement. Respondents pointed to the contract only to assert its invalidity. Judicial determination of its rescission af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>forded no right under the contract hut, as in <em>Ward, </em>remitted respondents to their remedy under appellants\u2019 11 implied-in-law promise to disgorge\u201d the benefits realized by them through their fraudulent inducement of the unenforceable agreement. The action arose from contract only in the remote sense that if respondents had never executed the agreement there would have been nothing to rescind and no ill-gotten gains to be returned. The remedy sought and granted turned wholly upon fraud, and referred to the contract only as the objective achieved by that fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Here, as in <em>Ward, </em>some deterrent to fraud is equitable and reasonable. It is not afforded if the wrongdoer risks only the fruits of his fraud. The broad equity powers invoked in an action for rescission because of fraud should afford such a remedy. The holding of a recent decision <em>(Brockway </em>v. <em>Heilman, </em>250 Cal.App.2d 807 [58 Cal.Rptr. 772]) is not inconsistent with this view. The hypothetical situation there posed (at p. 812) is dictum and, in any event, assumes facts and a form of action unlike those before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Appellants attempt to argue that the 1961 revisions of the code sections dealing with rescission (amending Civ. Code \u00a7\u00a7 1688-1692 and repealing Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3406, 3408) in some way remove the right to exemplary damages upon rescission. But no such intent is revealed in the report to the Legislature which initiated the revision (1961 Report, Cal.Law Revision Com., pp. D-5-35). Moreover, one of the amended sections provides that the party rescinding may seek restitution and \u201cany other relief to which he may be entitled under the circumstances\u201d and that \u201c [t]he aggrieved party shall be awarded complete relief.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1692.)</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Salsman, J., and Brown (H.C.), J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
