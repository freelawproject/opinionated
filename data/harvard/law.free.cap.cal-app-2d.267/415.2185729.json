In the complaint plaintiff sought recovery under \u2022 a replacement cost endorsement which was added to the fire insurance policies issued to him by -respondents.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">Plaintiff alleges in his first amended complaint that, he was the owner of improved real property which was insured by defendants against various perils, including riot and 'fire; the policies provided that, upon the occurrence of any of the perils insured against, the insured would be paid \u20181 actual cash value\u201d for the loss (\u201cactual cash value\u201d constituting the sum resulting by subtracting depreciation from replacement cost) ; thereafter, an endorsement (set out in the complaint as Exhibit A) was added to each policy providing for-, if the insured so elected, replacement cost coverage (or coverage for the actual cost of replacing or repairing the damaged structure) ; subsequently on August 13, 1965, a loss occurred as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>result of the \u201cWatts riots\u201d; defendants paid plaintiff the actual cash value of the loss but refused to pay the replace.ment cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">. Plaintiff\u2019s original complaint (which also pleaded the endorsement by way of exhibit), includes the additional allegation that plaintiff has not replaced or restored the insured \u2022property, nor does he presently intend to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The endorsement in question contains paragraphs numbered 1 through 8. Tlie relevant provisions are set out below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">Paragraph 2. \u201cIn consideration of the application of the \u25a0average clause provisions and the premium of the policy to which this endorsement is attached, the provisions of this policy applicable to the property described in paragraph 1 above (the property described includes buildings covered by the policy) are amended to substitute the term \u2018replacement cost\u2019 for the term \u2018actual cash value\u2019 wherever it appears in this policy, including endorsements attached thereto, thereby eliminating any deduction for depreciation subject, however, \u25a0in all other respects to the provisions of this endorsement and of the policy to which this endorsement is attached. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\">Paragraph 4. \u201cAs respects property to which replacement cost'.'coverage is extended under this endorsement, the insured may elect first to make claim under this policy in accordance with its provisions, disregarding this endorsement, except that the average clause made a part of this policy (changed as provided by paragraph 2 of this endorsement) shall apply irrespective of the election of the insured as to this endorsement ; and the insured may make further claim for any additional liability brought about by this endorsement in accordance with its provisions, provided this company is notified in writing within 120 days after loss, of the insured\u2019s intent to make such further claims. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-9\">Paragraph 6. \u201cThis company shall not be liable under this policy, including this endorsement, for any loss:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-10\">\u00ed \u00cd</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-11\">\u201c(B) As respects property to which replacement cost coverage is extended under this endorsement, unless and until the damaged property is actually repaired or replaced on the same premises with due diligence and dispatch, and, in no event, unless repair or replacement is completed within a reasonable time after such loss. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-12\">In sustaining the demurrers the court below concluded: \u201cThe replacement cost endorsement extends only to amounts actually and necessarily expended in repairing or replacing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>the property and do not extend to any loss unless and until the damaged property is actually repaired or replaced. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Plaintiff suggests that the language of the replacement cost endorsement is ambiguous; that one reasonable interpretation of the endorsement would permit him to elect to recover the replacement cost for his loss without having to comply with the proviso of paragraph 6(B) that he must first repair or replace the damaged property. He alludes to paragraph 4 and argues that it may be interpreted to give him the right to elect to disregard the endorsement (and the proviso of paragraph 6(b) that he repair or replace), yet make his claim for the replacement cost of his loss under the policy as changed by paragraph 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Bead as a whole only one reasonable interpretation of the endorsement is possible: The insured is given the right to first make a claim in accordance with the provisions of the policy, disregarding the replacement cost endorsement; this right (set forth in paragraph 4 of the endorsement) was exercised by plaintiff\u2014his complaint contains the allegation that he was paid the actual cash value of the loss; the insured then may make further claim for the additional coverage of being paid the repair or replacement cost of the damaged property without regard to depreciation, but only on the condition (set out in par. 6(B)) that he actually repairs or replaces the damaged property on the same premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">As indicated above, the language of the instrument, construed by itself, is not reasonably susceptible to the construction placed upon it by plaintiff. However, this does not dispose of the case. The complaint also alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">\"By the provisions of said endorsements set forth herein, the parties intended, and plaintiff so understood, that the endorsement amended his policy, so that he could recover \u2018replacement cost\u2019 rather than \u2018actual cash value\u2019, and elect to disregard it in all respects (including the necessity of actually replacing, as provided in paragraphs 5 and 6 of said endorsement) except that the \u2018 average clause \u2019 would have to continue on a \u2018replacement cost\u2019 basis, rather than an \u2018actual cash value \u2019 basis. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">This allegation brings the case within the rule established in <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>G. W. Thomas Drayage &amp; Rigging Co. </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 33 [69 Cal.Rptr. 561, 442 P.2d 641]. In that ease the trial court ruled that it would not receive any extrinsic evidence to interpret the contract because the plain language of the agreement was controlling. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>In reversing, the Supreme Court said (at pp. 36-37, 39) : \u201cWhen the court interprets a contract on this basis, it determines the meaning of the instrument in accordance with the . . extrinsic evidence of the judge\u2019s own linguistic education and experience.\u2019 (3 Corbin on Contracts (1960) ed.) [1964 Supp. \u00a7 579, p. 225, fn. 56].) The exclusion of testimony that might contradict the linguistic background of the judge reflects a judicial belief in the possibility of perfect verbal expression. (9 Wigmore on Evidence (3d ed. 1940) \u00a7 2461, p. 187.) This belief is a remnant of a primitive faith in the inherent potency [fn. omitted] and inherent meaning of words [fn. omitted].</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">\u201cThe test of admissibility of extrinsic evidence to explain the meaning of a written instrument is not whether it appears to the court to be plain and unambiguous on its face, but whether the offered evidence is relevant to prove a meaning to which the language of the instrument is reasonably susceptible.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\n<em>it</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\"><em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>The fact that the terms of an instrument appear clear to a judge does not preclude the possibility that the parties chose the language of the instrument to express different terms. That possibility is not limited to contracts whose terms have acquired a particular meaning by trade usage [fn. omitted], but exists whenever the parties\u2019 understanding of the words used may have differed from the judge\u2019s understanding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">That decision is controlling here. We cannot anticipate what evidence the plaintiff may offer at a trial to establish the meaning which he has alleged. The mere fact that the insurance policy has a clear meaning to the judge who ruled on the demurrer and a clear meaning to the members of this court will not preclude the plaintiff from offering evidence, if he has any, to support his allegation that the policy means what he claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">The judgments are reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">Files, P. J., and Kingsley, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b440-11\">An addition, to the respondents, plaintiff sued a third insurance company. That defendant, the New Amsterdam Casualty Company, did not, file a demurrer but answered plaintiff's amended complaint. A -subsequent motion by the insurance company for a summary judgment' (K\u00e9\u00e1r.d before another judge), was denied. <em>'*\u2022!</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
