Thereupon City and the federal government executed an appropriate contract assuring use of the grant to effect the proposed program. A part of the grant and tax funds were used to pay. for the real property and other assets City agreed to purchase from System.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Leasing Corporation borrowed $3,000,000 from a bank; executed a debt agreement with the bank; and used a part of the loan in payment of the motor coaches, automotive equipment and other assets it agreed to purchase from System.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">City rented from Leasing Corporation the motor coaches and other property the latter acquired from System; executed a written lease evidencing the transaction, which provided for payment semi-annually of a specified rental and transfer to City of title to the rental property upon satisfaction of Leasing Corporation\u2019s obligation to the bank; entered into a contract with Transit Corporation under which the latter would be responsible for operation and management of the transportation system City acquired through purchase and rental; and agreed to pay Transit Corporation for the services rendered under this contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">System operated both the urban transportation business and a charter bus business. Transit Corporation has continued this dual operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s contentions, as asserted in his complaint and on appeal, are that: (1) The amendment to the charter adding section 77b is ineffective insofar as it purports to authorize the levy of a special tax in aid of public transportation because it was not adopted by a two-thirds vote, which he claims was required by section 76 of the charter; (2) City violated article XI, section 18 of the State Constitution because, in executing the acquisition agreements and federal grant contract, it incurred an indebtedness and liability which exceeded its annual income for that year, and did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>obtain approval by two-thirds of the voters; (3) acquisition of the transportation system was illegal because at the time thereof the auditor had not certified the money required for such acquisition was in the treasury to the credit of the appropriation from which it was to be drawn as required by section 80 of the City Charter; (4) City does not have the power to acquire, own and operate a charter bus business as distinguished from an urban mass transit business; and (5) section 77b authorizes a special tax only for \u201cpublic transportation\u201d purposes, which does not include a charter bus purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The charter of the City of San Diego may be amended by the affirmative vote of a majority of the qualified voters voting on the amendment. (Cal. Const., art. XI, \u00a78, Stats. 1931, ch. 47, \u00a7223, p. 2936.) The addition of section 77b was such an amendment. Plaintiff\u2019s contention the special tax levy authorized by this section requires approval by two-thirds of the electorate, is premised on the provisions of section 76 of the charter which imposes a tax limit and declares, in pertinent part: \u201cNo special tax shall be permitted except as expressly authorized by this Charter\u201d and \u201c. . . no increase over said limits, except as in this Charter prescribed shall be made in any fiscal year unless authorized by ordinance adopted by the vote of two-thirds of the electors of this City voting on the proposition. ...\u201d (Stats. 1931, ch. 47, \u00a776, p. 2890.) Plaintiff asserts section 76 prohibits the imposition of a special tax without the approval of two-thirds of the voters, but fails to show how the foregoing provisions support his position. Dictating a contrary conclusion is the fact: (1) The tax authorized by section 77b is not within the special tax proscribed by section 76 because it is a special tax \u201cexpressly authorized by this Charter\u201d; (2) there is no showing the special tax authorized by section 77b will increase the limit of taxation imposed by section 76; (3) this tax limit applies only to the general tax and not a special tax (see <em>City of Grass Valley </em>v. <em>Walkinshaw, </em>34 Cal.2d 595, 599-602 [212 P.2d 894]); (4) even assuming the section 77b special tax is within the tax limit proscribed by section 76 and will effect an increase in the tax limit, section 77b amends section 76 to the extent there is any conflict; and (5) section 77b expressly declares: \u201cThe enumerated powers in this section . . . shall not be limited by any other provisions of this Charter.\u201d Section 77b is a valid exercise of the electoral power authorizing levy of a special tax for the purpose therein stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s contention execution of the acquisition agreements violated article XI, section 18 of the state Constitution is premised on the claim the obligation of the City-under the lease is an indebtedness or liability for <em>the </em>total amount of the rentals therein agreed to be paid, .which was incurred in the year the lease was executed rather than in the year when the respective rental payments are due; and the sale, loan and leasing arrangement between System, City, Leasing Corporation and the bank was a subterfuge whereby City, as such, acquired ownership of the transportation business of System without obtaining approval of two-thirds of the voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">The third amendment to the Agreed Statement of Pacts, which is dated September 14, 1967, states if the total amount to be paid under the lease as rent \u201cis construed to be a present obligation of the City, then the two-thirds vote requirements of Article 11, Section 18 of the California State Constitution must be met. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The rule of law applicable to the instant situation is stated in <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Offner, </em>19 Cal.2d 483, 485 [122 P.2d 14, 145 A.L.R. 1358], as follows: \u201cIt has been held generally in the numerous cases that have come before this court involving leases and agreements containing options to purchase that if the lease or other agreement is entered into in good faith and creates no immediate indebtedness for the aggregate installments therein provided for but, on the contrary, confines liability to each installment as it falls due and each year\u2019s payment is for the consideration actually furnished that year, no violence is done to the constitutional provision. [Citing cases.] If, however, the instrument creates a full and complete liability upon its execution, or if its designation as a \u2018lease\u2019 is a subterfuge and it is actually a conditional sales contract in which the \u2018rentals\u2019 are installment payments on the purchase price for the aggregate of which an immediate and present indebtedness or liability exceeding the constitutional limitation arises against the public entity, the contract is void. [Citing cases.] \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">City\u2019s monetary obligation under the lease was to pay $2,206,000 concurrently with execution of the lease, as prepaid rental, and the further sum of $360,000 on every January 15th and July 15th during the term of the lease, which was for the period from July 1, 1967 through May 31, 1972. There is no acceleration clause. Upon default the maximum obligation of City remains the same, i.e., to pay the designated semi-annual payments. (See <em>County of Los </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number><em>Angeles </em>v. <em>Nesvig, </em>231 Cal.App.2d 603, 611 [41 Cal.Rptr. 918].) The semi-annual rental is not payable until the due date. No indebtedness or liability therefor arises until that date. The consideration for each rental payment is the right to possess and use the leased property during the subsequent six-month period. Leasing Corporation agrees to transfer ownership of the leased property to City when the former satisfies its obligation to the bank, a condition wholly unrelated to City\u2019s liability to pay rental. In all substantial aspects the lease conforms to those upheld against constitutional attack in <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Byram, </em>36 Cal.2d 694, 700 [227 P.2d 4], <em>Dean </em>v. <em>Kuchel, </em>35 Cal.2d 444, 446 [218 P.2d 521], <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Offner, supra, </em>19 Cal.2d 483, 485, <em>McBean </em>v. <em>City of Fresno, </em>112 Cal. 159, 164, 167 [44 P. 358], <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Nesvig, supra, </em>231 Cal.App.2d 603, 609, 616, and <em>City of La Habra </em>v. <em>Pellerin, </em>216 Cal.App.2d 99,101 [30 Cal.Rptr. 752].</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">City\u2019s method of acquisition and operation of the transportation system without approval of two-thirds of the voters is not invalid because Leasing Corporation agreed to transfer ownership of the buses and other property acquired by it to City upon satisfaction of its obligation to the bank <em>(Dean </em>v. <em>Kuchel, supra, </em>35 Cal.2d 444, <em>447; City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Offner, supra, </em>19 Cal.2d 483); the method of acquisition was through a nonprofit leasing corporation created at the instance of City <em>(Corona etc. Hospital Dist. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>61 Cal.2d 846, 853 [40 Cal.Rptr. 745, 395 P.2d 817]; <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Nesvig, supra, </em>231 Cal.App.2d 603; <em>City of La Habra </em>v. <em>Pellerin, supra, </em>216 Cal.App.2d 99, 101); City agreed to levy a tax authorized by section 77b of the charter to provide funds from which to pay the rentals; or the lease was assigned to the bank as security for money loaned to Leasing Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Contrary to plaintiff\u2019s contention, there is nothing in the debt agreement or the leasing agreement, even though each incorporates the other, which obligates the city to the bank for the loan to Leasing Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s contention the federal grant contract violates the constitutionally prescribed debt limit provision is premised on the claim it committed City to the payment of $9,465,000 for the transportation program outlined in that contract, which included the cost of acquisition, improvements, replacements and operating deficits. The contract, insofar as it relates to the expenditure of money, merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>assures the federal government City intends to carry out its proposal to acquire, maintain and operate a transportation, system; does not purport to prescribe the method of acquisi-' tion, maintenance or operation, or foreclose the method adopted by City, which does not involve incurring an indebtedness in excess of current income and revenue.; and, although containing an agreement by City to \u201cprovide\u201d funds in an amount sufficient \u201cto assure payment of the actual Net Project Cost,\u201d does not prescribe the manner by which the City shall \u201cprovide\u201d such funds or, except negatively, the source of those funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">The electorate of the City of San Diego, by a vote of 57 percent of those voting, conferred upon the city council, for the purpose of establishing a public transportation system,, the power to execute contracts, to acquire property by pur-: chase or lease; and to levy a special tax to be used to discharge any obligation incurred by the City either to acquire and operate or assist a nonprofit corporation to acquire and operate such a system. The method of acquisition and operation adopted by the city council conforms to the powers com ferred; effects the purpose of the charter amendment; and does not violate the debt limit provisions of the Constitution,, the object of which is to proscribe incurring an indebtedness in one fiscal year that will be an obligation against the general funds of the city for future years, unless two-thirds of the electorate approve. <em>(City of Palm Springs </em>v. <em>Ringwald, </em>52 Cal.2d 620, 627 [342 P.2d 898]; <em>McBean </em>v. <em>City of Fresno, supra, </em>112 Cal. 159,164 [44 P. 358].)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Approval of the federal grant application and execution of the grant contract occurred sometime in June 1967. Execution of the purchase, debt and lease agreements,, occurred on June 30, 1967. Each of these occurrences followed-execution of the original agreed statement of facts on March 27, 1967, which, among other things, sets forth the provisions of section 80 of the City Charter that no \u201ccontract agreement, or other obligation involving the expenditure of money out of-appropriations made by the Council shall be entered into . . . unless the Auditor and Comptroller shall first certify\u201d the amount required therefor \u201cis in the treasury to the credit - of the appropriation from which it is to be drawn and that it is otherwise unencumbered\u201d; and states, \u201cThere does not <em>now </em>exist sufficient money in the City Treasury, otherwise not. encumbered, available for use to the credit of an appropri-. ation in order to purchase the System . . . and to make th\u00a7 improvements, replacements and payments for operating defi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>cits contemplated in the Federal grant applications.\u201d (Italics ours.) Implicit in this statement is the fact the auditor and comptroller, on or before March 22, 1967, had not made the certifications, if any, required by section 80 of the Charter. What has occurred since March 22, 1967, does not appear in the record.  The subsequent amendments to the agreed statement did not refer to the matter. City has attached to its brief copies of the required certifications. However, these were not presented to the trial court; are not a part of the record; and may not be considered on appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Shroyer, </em>203 Cal.App.2d 478, 484 [21 Cal.Rptr. 460] ; <em>Bank of America </em>v. <em>Dowdy, </em>186 Cal.App.2d 690, 695 [9 Cal.Rptr. 779].)  On the other hand, it satisfactorily appears that at the time of execution of the purchase and lease agreements City had received sufficient money under the federal grant and from the section 77b tax levy to pay the amount specified for acquisition of the real property and other assets System agreed to sell to City, and the rental prepayment required by the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s contention the federal grant contract and acquisition agreements violated section 80 of the charter is premised on the claim City was contractually committed to complete the transportation system project requiring expenditures for acquisition, improvements, replacements and operating deficits; upon the unavailability of money in the treasury as set forth in the agreed statement; and upon the claimed fact the auditor and comptroller had not made the prescribed certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s arguments in support of his position are premised on a misconception of the facts in the case and the law in the premises. The agreed statement of facts establishes only there was no certification on file at the time the original thereof was executed, i.e., March 22, 1967, rather than at the time the contracts and agreements in question were executed, i.e., June 1967. There is no showing the prescribed certification was not on file at the latter time. As a consequence, plaintiff\u2019s contention is premised on an unproven fact, i.e., a lack of the prescribed certification. In addition, as heretofore noted, the federal grant contract did not obligate City to the expenditure of money out of the city treasury even though it contemplated some of the funds City agreed to \u201cprovide\u201d might come from the city treasury. Furthermore, the power conferred by charter section 77b to execute contracts, acquire property by purchase or lease and dispose of funds, as stated therein, \u201cshall not be limited by any of the provisions of this Charter. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s contention City does not have power to engage in a charter bus business is premised on the concept its power is limited by the provisions of section 77b to the acquisition and operation of a \u201cpublic transportation system\u201d which, he claims, does not include the acquisition and operation of charter buses.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">City\u2019s authority to acquire and operate a charter bus business is not dependent upon the grant of power conferred by section 77b and, thus, is not limited by that section.  A charter city \u201chas all powers over municipal affairs, otherwise lawfully exercised, subject only to the clear and explicit limitations and restrictions contained in the charter.\u201d <em>(City of Grass Valley </em>v. <em>Walkinshaw, supra, </em>34 Cal.2d 595, 598.)  Limitations and restrictions upon such powers must be expressly stated in the charter and may not be implied. <em>(Ibid.) </em> When the exercise thereof is questioned the issue is not whether the charter grants the power, but whether the charter limits or restricts the power. <em>(West Coast Adver. Co. </em>v. <em>San Francisco, </em>14 Cal.2d 516, 521 [95 P.2d 138].)  The enumeration of powers in the charter \u201cdoes not constitute an exclusion or limitation.\u201d <em>(City of Grass Valley </em>v. <em>Walkinshaw, supra, </em>34 Cal.2d 595, 599.)  The operation of a transportation system is a municipal affair. (Art. XI, \u00a7 19, Cal. Const.; <em>In re Orosi Public Utility Dist., </em>196 Cal. 43, 55 [235 P. 1004] <em>; Mullins </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>75 Cal.App. 2d 117, 129 [170 P.2d 118].) Thus, independently of any grant in its charter, City had the power to acquire and operate such a system. However, the assumed existence of the power is confirmed by its charter which declares City \u201cshall have all municipal powers . . . now or hereafter authorized to be granted to municipal corporations by the Constitution and laws of the State of California.\u201d (Stats. 1931, ch. 47, \u00a7 1, p. 2840.) The state Constitution expressly confers on all municipal corporations the power to \u201cestablish and operate public works for supplying its inhabitants with . . . transportation . . . ,\u201d and to \u201cfurnish such services to inhabitants outside its boundaries. ...\u201d (Art. XI, \u00a719, Cal. Const.)</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">As a consequence, the issue at hand is whether the operation of a charter bus business as part of a transportation system consisting primarily in the operation of an urban mass transit bus business is a municipal affair.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The charter bus business in question is defined in the agreed statement of facts as the operation of buses not regularly scheduled as to time or route; under a contract between the operator and an individual or group of individuals exelu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>sively for a specified journey; upon such terms as the parties may agree; and without geographical limits. System operated such a charter bus business in conjunction with its urban mass transit business at the time City and Leasing Corporation acquired its assets. The method of supplying transportation is not limited by the charter; includes services supplied by a charter bus as well as by an urban mass transit bus; and is no less a municipal affair because the bus operates outside the boundaries of the city or benefits nonresidents as well as residents. (Art. XI, \u00a7 19, Cal. Const.; <em>City of Mill Talley </em>v. <em>Saxton, </em>41 Cal.App.2d 290, 292 [106 P.2d 455] ; <em>Durant </em>v. <em>City of Beverly Hills, </em>39 Cal.App.2d 133, 136 [102 P.2d 759].) The power of City to acquire and operate a charter bus business as a part of the transportation business acquired by System is both inherent and conferred by the charter through incorporation of the constitutional grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">However, the issue whether the acquisition and operation of a charter bus business is within the power to acquire and operate a \u201cpublic transportation system\u201d is pertinent to the question whether City may use the special tax authorized by section 77b for the acquisition and operation of a charter bus business, because the authorization is limited to the levy of a tax to be used for discharging obligations undertaken in connection with a \u201cpublic transportation system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Plaintiff contends City\u2019s charter bus business does not have the characteristics of a common carrier, such as the duty to serve all who request service, and an operation with fixed fares, routes and schedules; for this reason is a private carrier rather than a public carrier; and, as a consequence, is not a part of the \u201cpublic transportation system\u201d to which section 77b applies. This conclusion is based upon the false premise, among others, that, for the purpose at hand, a carrier that is not a \u201ccommon carrier\u201d is a \u201cprivate carrier\u201d and not a \u201cpublic carrier.\u201d In support of his position plaintiff relies upon decisions in tort cases considering the difference between the obligations of different types of carriers to their passengers in which, for this purpose, two types of carriers are distinguished by identifying one as a \u201ccommon carrier\u201d and the other as a \u201cprivate carrier.\u201d The classification of these two types of carriers is limited to the purpose for which the distinction was made. The basis for the distinction has no application to a determination whether a carrier is being operated by and for the public as part of a public transportation system. Even assuming the premise a charter bus business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>of the type operated by City does not have the characteristics of a common carrier and for this reason is a private carrier, plaintiff\u2019s conclusion it may not be a part of a \u201cpublic transportation system\u201d is without support in fact or law. The agreed statement lists nine charter cities in California operating a charter bus system as part of a public .transportation system. It is economically advantageous to operate charter buses in conjunction with urban mass transit buses. As heretofore noted, City was empowered to acquire and operate the charter bus business which System operated as part of its transportation system. This power was not limited by section 77b. The authority conferred by that section to levy a tax to acquire and operate a public transportation system impliedly included within its scope whatever transportation system City independently had the power to acquire and operate.
