We uphold the determination made by the lower court, in entering judgment for the.Regents of the University on the pleadings, that the statute which empowers \u201cState officers and employees\u201d to direct the making of such deductions from their salaries does not apply to University employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">Applicable portions of sections 1156, 1156.1, and 1157.3 of the 'Government Code are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In summary, they provide that \u201cState officers and employees\u201d may authorize and' direct the making of deductions from their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>salaries for the purpose, among others, of paying dues in employee associations. The state Controller or other appropriate officer is then required to administer a payroll deduction system. \u201cEmployees of a public agency\u201d may also authorize deductions for dues to an employee association. However, in the case of such an agency the appropriate officer need only administer such a system if the governing body so decides.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Appellants first contend that sections 1156 and 1156.1 unambiguously include employees of the University of California within their coverage. It is true that these sections refer to \u201cstate employees\u201d and that the courts have held that for various purposes employees of the University of California are \u201cstate employees\u201d (e.g. <em>Tolman </em>v. <em>Underhill </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 708 [249 P.2d 280] ; <em>Fraser </em>v. <em>University of. Cal. </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 717 [249 P.2d 283]).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">But these statutes should be construed with reference to the whole system of law of which they form a part. <em>(Select Base Materials </em>v. <em>Board of Equal. </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 640 [335 P.2d 672] ; <em>J. T. Jenkins Co. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1960) 178 Cal.App.2d 379 [2 Cal.Rptr. 852].)  The'meaning of certain words or phrases in a section of a statute may be limited or restricted by reference to surrounding statutes. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pereles </em>(1932) 125 Cal.App.Supp. 787, 790 [12 P.2d 1093].)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">Sections 1150 through 1157.5 of the Government Code (tit. I, div. 4, eh. 1, art. 6), dealing with salary deductions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>establish two distinct classes of employees: employees of a \u201cpublic agency\u201d [hereinafter public employees] and employees of the state [hereinafter state employees]. Parallel statutory sections provide for authorization of deductions by each class of employee for various purposes: the purchase of savings bonds (\u00a7\u00a71152, 1153); contributions to charity (\u00a7\u00a7 1156.3, 1157.2); employee association dues (\u00a7\u00a71156, 1156.1, 1157, 1157.1, 1157.3). Finally, sections 1157.4 .and 1157.5 authorize deductions by county employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Given this statutory scheme, we must determine whether the University of California is for purposes of this statute a part of state government or another kind of public agency. Section 1151 defines \u201cpublic agency\u201d as including \u201ccounties, cities, municipal corporations, political subdivisions, public districts, and other public agencies of the State.\u201d Appellants argue that this must exclude all but local agencies, under the rule of construction that general terms are limited by the specific terms contained in the same series. <em>(Hart </em>v. <em>City of Beverly Hills </em>(1938) 11 Cal.2d 343, 347 [79 P.2d 1080].) On this theory, the concluding phrase of section 1151\u2014\u201cother public agencies of the State\u201d\u2014would be restricted to local agencies and thus could not include the University of California.  But the rule of construction cited by appellants is merely an aid in determining legislative intent. It will not be applied so as to defeat legislative intent otherwise determined. <em>(Coleman </em>v. <em>City of Oakland </em>(1930) 110 Cal.App. 715 [295 P. 59] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>McKean </em>(1925) 76 Cal.App. 114 [243 P. 898].) Where general and specific words or phrases have independent purposes and are not used merely to color one another, the rule should not be used to defeat the apparent purpose of the statute. <em>(County of Sacramento </em>v. <em>City of Sacramento </em>(1946) 75 Cal.App.2d 436 [171 P.2d 477].)</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">We have concluded that sections 1150 through 1157 disclose a legislative intent not to treat the University of California as a part of state government for purposes of payroll deductions. First, the legislation repeatedly provides that wage deduction programs for state employees be administered or regulated in various ways by the State Controller or Board of Control.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since the Controller and the Board of Control do not regulate the activities or policies of the University of California (Cal. Const., art. IX, \u00a7 9; Gov. Code, \u00a7 12470; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number><em>Newmarker </em>v. <em>Regents of the University of Cal. </em>(1958) 160 Cal.App.2d 640 [325 P.2d 558]), an implication arises that the Legislature did not intend that University employees be regarded as state employees for this purpose. Second, legislative intent .regarding University employment may be inferred from the difference in treatment accorded to the policy issues involved in setting up schemes for payroll deduction in behalf of state employees as opposed to other public employees. The Legislature, acting by itself and through such delegated agencies as the State Board of Control and the Controller, constitutes the \u201cgoverning body\u201d for state government. Therefore the Legislature itself made the policy determination, in sections 1156 and 1156.1, that state employees were to be entitled to authorize certain specified deductions from their salaries. Important considerations of personnel management were involved in that determination. The Legislature may have considered that as to other employing jurisdictions, where it was not the \u201cgoverning body,\u201d it should refrain from making the policy determination to which we have just referred. Accordingly in dealing with the question of payroll deduction by employees of other public agencies, the legislation we have reviewed leaves the governing body of the employing jurisdiction empowered to form its own policy as to whether to honor various categories of payroll deduction. There can be no question of the power of the Legislature to put into effect in \u201ccounties, cities, municipal corporations, political subdivisions, [and] public districts\u201d the same statutory scheme that it applied to state employment. Its failure to do so implies an intention to exempt any public jurisdiction having a \u201cgoverning body\u201d other than the Legislature.  Under California Constitution, article IX, section 9, the Regents of the University of California, having \u201cfull powers of organization and government\u201d of the University, are the governing body charged with determining such matters as personnel policy in general and specifically policy regarding honoring of requests for payroll deduction. We conclude that, for purposes of the program under considera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>tion, the Legislature did not intend to treat University employees as state employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Devine, P.
