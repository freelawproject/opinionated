J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-K\">William Leroy Gregg was convicted, after plea.ding guilty, of possessing heroin (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11500). Gregg\u2019s Penal Code section 1538.5 motion to suppress the heroin evidence found in his possession was denied. He purportedly appeals from this nonappealable order of denial. Gregg\u2019s notice of appeal was filed after he changed his plea to guilty, but before judgment was rendered. We treat the appeal as one from the judgment of conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>(an appeal authorized after plea of guilty by Penal Code section 1538.5, subdivision (m)). In so doing we exercise the discretion given us by California Rules of Court, rule 31(a), to treat a premature notice of appeal as filed immediately after rendition of judgment and construe the notice liberally in favor of its sufficiency as required by rule 31(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Gregg contends he was stopped, detained, \u201cfrisked\u201d and arrested without probable cause for a belief he had committed a crime. The search incident to his arrest which revealed heroin in Gregg\u2019s possession is thus claimed to be illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">At approximately 3 :30 a.m. on August 6, 1967, a person later identified as Gregg was sold a bus ticket to Los Angeles by an agent at the San Diego Greyhound Bus Depot. The agent noticed Gregg had a flashlight; possessed a large roll of money; acted nervous; and ran rather than walked to the bus ramp from the ticket counter. The agent reported Gregg to the police as a suspicious person.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The police officers contacted the ticket agent; were given the suspicious character\u2019s description; checked the Los Angeles bus in which Gregg, who matched the description given, was seated; and asked him to dismount. Gregg accompanied the officers off the bus and was given a \u201cpat down\u201d search for weapons. This search revealed a flashlight in his back pants\u2019 pocket. In response to inquiry, Gregg identified himself; explained his presence at the depot; and showed the officers $386 wadded in his hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">The officers observed Gregg was extremely nervous, sweating profusely and the pupils of his eyes were extremely constricted despite poor lighting. The officers shined a flashlight in Gregg\u2019s eyes and noticed no apparent reaction to the light. Questions had to be repeated to him as though he were in a daze. The officers were experienced in narcotic law enforcement and each formed the opinion Gregg was under the influence of a narcotic.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">Gregg was arrested for being under the influence of a narcotic and for burglary. He was told his <em>Miranda </em>rights, then searched. Heroin and narcotic paraphernalia were found in Gregg\u2019s pockets.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">The courts in California \u201c. . . have consistently held that circumstances short of probable cause to make an arrest may still justify an officer\u2019s stopping pedestrians or motorists on the streets for questioning. If the circumstances warrant it, he may in self-protection request a suspect to alight from an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>automobile or to submit to a superficial search for concealed weapons. Should the investigation then reveal probable cause to make an arrest, the officer may arrest the suspect and conduct a reasonable incidental search. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mickelson, </em>59 Cal.2d 448, 450-451 [30 Cal.Rptr. 18, 380 P.2d 658].)</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Gregg\u2019s suspicious activities as related to the officers by the ticket agent justified the officers\u2019 \u201cpat down\u201d search and questioning of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Gregg\u2019s dazed demeanor, profuse sweating, constricted eye pupils and lack of pupillary reaction support the conclusion reached by the officers, who were experienced in dealing with narcotic users, that Gregg was under the influence of a narcotic. Gregg\u2019s arrest was legal, being based upon probable cause to believe he was committing a misdemeanor in the officers\u2019 presence (violation of Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a711721), and the search incident to that arrest was legal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>240 Cal.App.2d 496, 500-501 [49 Cal.Rptr. 663].)</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">The trial court correctly denied Gregg\u2019s motion to suppress the heroin evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">Coughlin, J., and Whelan, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
