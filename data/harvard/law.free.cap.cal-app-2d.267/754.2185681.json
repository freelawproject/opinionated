He recruited boys for the crew and interviewed them at various times and places for this purpose; he transported members of the crew in connection with subscription contests. It was a job requirement that decedent have his own motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">Decedent\u2019s specified work schedule included a 40-hour work week\u20145 days at 8 hours each. Each day started at 2:30 a.m. at the plant for pickup of the day\u2019s papers. The shift ended when no work remained to be done in connection with that morning\u2019s deliveries, usually between 10a.m. and 11:30a.m. In the absence of a specific reason for returning to the plant, decedent could check in by phone when otherwise through and then go home or about his own business.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">The employer provided office space for decedent but he could and did work on his records at home, at his own option, but without express permission or direction. Decedent was reimbursed for mileage commencing at and ending upon return to the plant. The manner of computation was not indicated for those times when there was telephone check-in to the plant. No compensation was paid in relation to work done outside the shift hours. Recruitment of the newsboys, help in subscription contests and receipt of business calls at home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>were part of the work done by decedent outside of shift hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-3\">Decedent met his death while driving to work at 1:50 a.m. in the vehicle owned and used by him for work purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Respondent relies upon <em>Postal Tel. Cable Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>1 Cal.2d 730 [37 P.2d 441, 96 A.L.R. 460] in support of the argument that decedent's travel to and from the newspaper plant under the circumstances outlined above was not within the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The evidence clearly reveals that the use of decedent\u2019s motor vehicle in undirected travel and subject to the control of only decedent, except as to a restriction against unauthorized passengers, in the performance of his duties as supervisor of his newsboy crew made the availability and use of the motor vehicle as much a part of the work and service rendered to the employer as decedent\u2019s personal services, so that the employment relationship may be deemed to have been in effect during the journey in which decedent was killed. <em>(Joyner </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., </em>266 Cal.App.2d 470 [72 Cal.Rptr. 132], See also <em>Le Febvre </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Board, </em>69 Cal.2d 386 [71 Cal.Rptr. 703, 445 P.2d 319].)</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">The order of the Board denying applicant\u2019s claim is annulled and the case is remanded to the Board for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">Brown (Gerald), P. J., and Coughlin, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">Respondents\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied January 22,1969.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b779-11\"> Assigned by the Chairman of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
