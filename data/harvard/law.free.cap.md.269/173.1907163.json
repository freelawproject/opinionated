Before we say why we shall affirm Judge Cahoon a curious set of facts must be related.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">On 18 June 1970 Gro-Plant filed, in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, its declaration, affidavit, notice to plead and a motion for summary judgment against Rudden claiming $1,807.25. The declaration is limited to two common counts \u2014 for goods bargained and sold and for money due on accounts stated between them. A detailed statement of the goods ordered on 2 July 1968 was attached. On 20 July Rudden submitted 13 interrogatories. Gro-Plant\u2019s answers thereto revealed that it is a Florida corporation, that it was not registered to do business in Maryland and that in this regard it followed the advice of counsel. Answering further it said Rudden gave its salesman an order for the merchandise on 2 July 1968, that the order was sent to its place of business in Florida for acceptance, that a list of the items ordered was sent to Rudden \u201cas an acknowledgment\u201d of its acceptance and that the merchandise was shipped on 23 March 1969. During the years 1968, 1969 and 1970, it continued, \u201cany matters arising in Maryland\u201d were handled by one salesman; it neither owns nor leases any real estate in Maryland; none of its officers or directors resides in Maryland; nor has it filed any tax returns in Maryland. Revenues from sales in Maryland do not exceed $100,000 annually which, it says, is less than ten per cent of its \u201centire annual volume.\u201d The salesman who took the order lives in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Gro-Plant\u2019s reply to Rudden\u2019s interrogatories was filed on 11 September 1970. Judgment in favor of Gro-Plant was entered on 18 January 1972. During the intervening 16 months Rudden seems to have done nothing. We have combed the transcript in search of a demurrer, a plea, an affidavit of defense, or a defensive pleading of any kind. We have found nothing. But on the very next day, 19 January, Rudden filed a motion to set aside the judgment. He gave as his \u201creasons therefor\u201d that he had \u201cone or more valid and material defenses to the merits\u201d of Gro-Plant\u2019s claim, that the Military Affidavit failed to show the competence and personal knowledge of the affiant, and that the motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>summary judgment \u201cis dated . . . almost two years prior to the granting\u201d thereof. Gro-Plant, in reply, declared that its attorney tried a number of times to communicate with Rudden\u2019s attorney both by mail and by telephone. On only one occasion was he successful; Rudden\u2019s attorney said he would communicate with his client. \u201cAfter having exhausted every patient effort. . . [its] attorney submitted a request for summary judgment ... .\u201d After a hearing before Judge Cahoon on 10 March 1972 Rudden\u2019s motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">On 5 May 1972 Gro-Plant ordered the issuance of the writ of fieri facias. On 22 May Rudden moved to quash the writ on the grounds that Gro-Plant \u201cis a foreign corporation\u201d doing business in Maryland \u201cwithout compliance with [the] requirements of [the] law . . . .\u201d On the same day the court ordered the execution suspended \u201cuntil this matter is heard and determined.\u201d Rudden\u2019s motion to quash came on for a hearing on 1 September. Judge Cahoon found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">\u201c . . . the <em>res judicata </em>argument [to be] persuasive . . . particularly because . . . [Rudden\u2019s] motion is founded upon the facts that are in the interrogatories which were propounded and responded to sometime in 1970. ... It seems to me . . . very clear from this record that the ground for defense was available and could have been asserted. It was not done and [it] is <em>res judicata </em>as between these parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">From his order denying the motion Rudden has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">While we have yet to subsume the Book of Ecclesiastes into the Maryland Rules, counsel would do well to recall and heed the admonition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-10\">\u201cTo everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-11\">\u201cA time to rend, and a time to sew, a time to keep silence, <em>and a time to speak. </em>\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">The tenor of Rudden\u2019s interrogatories suggests he had then a firm intention to brand Gro-Plant as a foreign corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>\u201cdoing business\u201d in disregard of the requirements of Code (1973 Repl. Vol.), Art. 23, \u00a7 90, and to claim the benefit of the sanction provided by \u00a7 91(c). When Gro-Plant answered it was Rudden\u2019s \u201ctime to speak\u201d but as we have observed his failure to do so was total, inexplicable and unexplained. Quite likely his silence would have continued indefinitely had Gro-Plant not obtained its summary judgment. Oddly enough neither in his motion to strike the judgment nor during argument at the March hearing was any mention made of the fact that Gro-Plant was an unregistered foreign corporation. After his motion was denied Rudden seems to have relapsed into his habitual trance. Aroused once more, this time by the threat of execution, Rudden moved to quash the writ alleging, for the first time, the nullity of the judgment because of Gro-Plant\u2019s foreign status.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Fatal to Rudden\u2019s several contentions is the fallacy of his presumption that Gro-Plant was \u201cdoing business\u201d in Maryland to a degree which required its compliance with the provisions of Art. 23, \u00a7 90. He insists the disclosures made by Gro-Plant in its answers to his interrogatories demand such a conclusion. While we shall not so hold we do not agree that this is so. It well could be, and indeed we think it likely, that the circumstances here, had there been a trial, might have proved to be parallel to the situation in <em>G. E. M., Inc. v. Plough, Inc., </em>228 Md. 484, 180 A. 2d 478 (1962). To the same effect <em>see Katz v. Simcha Company, Inc., </em>251 Md. 227, 238, 246 A. 2d 555 (1968). But the burden of proving that to be so was upon Rudden and he made no effort to shoulder that burden. He seems to be saying that Judge Cahoon should have undertaken, sua sponte, to deny the summary judgment solely on the basis of Gro-Plant\u2019s answers. In fact, Judge Cahoon thought the facts disclosed by those answers \u201cwould fall short of establishing that. . . [Gro-Plant] is doing business here.\u201d We think the judgment was properly entered and that it is now impregnable to the kind of collateral attack mounted by Rudden. <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>265 Md. 327, 289 A. 2d 318 (1972); <em>Grantham v. Board of County Commissioners for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>251 Md. 28, 246 A. 2d 548 (1968), and the cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">It would certainly follow from what we have said that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>there is no merit in Rudden\u2019s contention that Gro-Plant\u2019s execution upon its judgment should be suspended pending compliance with Art. 23, \u00a7 90. Rudden relies, in this regard, on <em>Gibraltar Construction and Engineering, Inc. v. State National Bank of Bethesda, </em>265 Md. 530, 290 A. 2d 789 (1972), but its reliance is misplaced because <em>Gibraltar </em>is clearly distinguishable from the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">We do not reach the res judicata question. Nevertheless we think <em>DeMaio v. Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company, </em>247 Md. 30, 230 A. 2d 279 (1967), and the cases there cited would dispose of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by the appellant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
