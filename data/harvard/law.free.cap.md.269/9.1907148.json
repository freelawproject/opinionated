Vol..) Art. 77A, \u00a7\u00a7 1-10, entitled \u201cCommunity Colleges.\u201d They say the issues were drawn in February, 1972, when the Trustees forwarded to the county executive their estimated operating budget for fiscal year 1973; and the county executive then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>returned the budget with an opinion of the county attorney attached thereto. The county executive wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-5\">\u201c . . . Essentially, the opinion points out (1) the County does have the authority to ask for a detailed budget from the Community College and (2) the County does have the discretion of establishing an amount which is equivalent to 28% of current expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-6\">\u201cIn light of the foregoing, I am returning to you your three page budget request. I am requesting you to submit to me personally a detailed budget request for the Fiscal Year 1973. Your budget must be received no later than the close of business March 6,1972.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Significantly, the county at no time refused to comply with the Trustees\u2019 budget request; and, in fact, acquiesced in a <em>pendente lite </em>order which, \u201cwithout prejudice to the respective positions of the parties with respect to the matters in issue,\u201d required the county to provide the funds budgeted by the Trustees for the college\u2019s 1973 fiscal year.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">Following a hearing, from which there emerged no factual disputes, but which is said to have developed certain legal issues, the chancellor passed a decree containing twelve declarations, all favorable to the Trustees. With one possible exception \u2014 to which we shall refer later \u2014 none of the twelve \u201cissues\u201d ostensibly dealt with in the decree was remotely suggested by the county executive\u2019s letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">Under Code (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol.) Art. 31A, \u00a7 2, \u201c[a]ny person . . . whose rights, status or other legal relations are affected by a statute . . . may have determined any question of construction or validity . .. arising under the . . . statute . . . and obtain a declaration of rights, status or other legal relations thereunder.\u201d Art. 31A, \u00a7 6, provides, in part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-10\">\u201cRelief by declaratory judgment or decree may be granted in all civil cases in which an actual controversy exists between contending parties, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>in which the court is satisfied that antagonistic claims are present between the parties involved which indicate imminent and inevitable litigation, or when in any such case the court is satisfied that a party asserts a legal relation, status, right, or privilege in which he has a concrete interest and that there is a challenge or denial of such asserted relation, status, right, or privilege by an adversary party who also has or asserts a concrete interest therein, and the court is satisfied also that a declaratory judgment or decree shall serve to terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceedings.. . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Although this Court has said that declaratory relief is appropriate where public agencies are at loggerheads, <em>Liss v. Goodman, </em>224 Md. 173, 178, 167 A. 2d 123 (1961), to invoke the jurisdiction of the courts for declaratory relief there must be a justiciable controversy between the parties, <em>Kloze v. Provident Bank, </em>220 Md. 469, 154 A. 2d 711 (1959); <em>Patuxent Co. v. Commissioners, </em>212 Md. 543, 129 A. 2d 847 (1957); <em>Tanner v. McKeldin, </em>202 Md. 569, 97 A. 2d 449 (1953); <em>see also </em>Borchard, <em>Declaratory Judgments, </em>33 <em>et seq. </em>(2d ed. 1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">While an action for a declaratory judgment will lie to determine the construction or validity of a statute, such action cannot be maintained where the essential elements requisite to such relief are not present, <em>Hitchcock v. Kloman, </em>196 Md. 351, 76 A. 2d 582 (1950); <em>Hammond v. Lancaster, </em>194 Md. 462, 71 A. 2d 474 (1950); <em>Davis v. State, </em>183 Md. 385, 37 A. 2d 880 (1944); <em>see Thomas v. Solis, </em>263 Md. 536, 283 A. 2d 777 (1971). In <em>Patuxent Co. v. Commissioners, supra, </em>the Court, quoting from 1 Anderson, <em>Actions for Declaratory Judgments </em>\u00a7 17 (2d ed. 1951), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-6\">\u201c \u2018A controversy is justiciable when there are interested parties asserting adverse claims <em>upon a state of facts which must have accrued </em>wherein a legal decision is sought or demanded.\u2019 \u201d 212 Md. at 548 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>It may well be that there exists between these parties an \u201cactual controversy;\u201d \u201cantagonistic claims\u201d indicating \u201cimminent and inevitable litigation;\u201d or the assertion and denial of \u201ca legal relation, status, right, or privilege.\u201d And, assuming any of these possibilities, we might have been \u201csatisfied also that a declaratory . . . decree [would] serve to terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceedings.\u201d The difficulty confronting us is that if any or all of these grounds for granting declaratory relief do exist, we are unable to perceive them in the record presented to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The most that can be said for the county executive\u2019s letter \u2014 and the parties point to no other \u201cstate of facts\u201d that reveals an \u201cactual controversy\u201d \u2014 is that it presents an apparent disagreement over whether the 1973 fiscal year budget submitted by the Trustees contained sufficient detail to satisfy the county executive. This may reflect a difference of opinion, but hardly rises to the level of a \u201cjusticiable controversy.\u201d In sum, although both parties desire declaratory relief in this case, there is nevertheless lacking \u201cthe state of facts which must have accrued\u201d to establish the requisite \u201cjusticiable controversy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Having concluded that this case is not a proper one for granting declaratory relief, we see no alternative to dismissal. The suit was precipitated by the 1973 fiscal year budget for which, as we noted earlier, the requested funds were furnished. Presumably, a declaration approved by this Court would have governed the relationship between the parties for the 1974 fiscal year budget, which is undoubtedly in the final stages of preparation. We think it unlikely, however, that further proceedings below and in this Court could lead to ultimate relief in sufficient time to be available for that budget.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Our disposition makes it unnecessary to consider the issue presented by the cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">\n<em>Appeals dismissed; remanded with instructions to dismiss both suits for declaratory judgment; appellant to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b34-11\">. A motion raising preliminary objection was filed by the county executive and the members of the county council, in which they contended that suit could only be brought against the county and not against them. The motion was granted and that ruling is the subject of a cross-appeal brought by the Trustees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b37-7\">. We are informed that at its 1973 session, which recently concluded, the General Assembly enacted House Bill 1160; and that it presently awaits the signature of the Governor. Subject to gubernatorial approval and the right of referendum provided for by Art. XVI of the Maryland Constitution, it will become law on July 1, 1973. House Bill 1160 amends \u00a7\u00a7 5(a), 6 and 7(a) and (c) of Art. 77A in such fashion as to clearly subject budgets of community colleges, except those which are regional, to review and approval of the counties and Baltimore City. We find it curious that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>reference was made to the pendency of this legislation when we suggested at oral argument that this \u201cdispute\u201d should more appropriately be addressed to the legislative branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-15\">Were House Bill 1160 to have been applicable to the budget for fiscal year 1974, we would undoubtedly have dismissed this appeal for mootness, since we do not decide moot questions or abstract propositions, Potts v. Governor, 255 Md. 445, 258 A. 2d 180 (1969); Eberts v. Congressional Country Club, 197 Md. 461, 79 A. 2d 518 (1951); Davis v. State, supra; see Note, Declaratory Judgments in Maryland, 6 Md. L. Rev. 221, 226 (1942).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
