Supp.), Article 21, \u00a7 42 (recodified as Article 21, \u00a7 7-106 in the 1973 Repl. Vol.), authorizes any duly organized bar association of this State to petition a court of equity \u201cto order an audit to be made of the accounts maintained ... for funds received in connection with real estate closing transactions in this State\u201d by persons responsible for disbursing funds in connection with the conveyancing of title to real estate where such persons fail to provide the buyer and seller, under certain circumstances and within a designated time, with specified documents evidencing the existence of recorded releases of mortgages or deeds of trust.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>On November 6, 1972 the Bar Association of Montgomery County, pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 42, filed a petition in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to obtain an audit of the accounts maintained by Peter C. Andresen, a member of the Maryland Bar, \u201cfor funds received in connection with real estate closing transactions in the State of Maryland.\u201d The petition alleged that the State\u2019s Attorney of Montgomery County had charged Andresen on November 1, 1972, by a criminal information, with four counts of false pretenses (as shown by a copy of the information attached to the petition); that \u201cadditional facts\u201d had been made available to the Bar Association by the State\u2019s Attorney \u201cwhich strongly suggest circumstances warranting the granting of a special audit upon . . . [Andresen\u2019s] escrow fund accounts\u201d; that the Bar Association had been informed by the State\u2019s Attorney that releases of deeds of trust \u201cappear to have been made tardily or not at all\u201d by Andresen who acted as settlement attorney for the sale of properties from the Clark-King Construction Company (Clark-King) to enumerated homeowners in the Potomac Woods Subdivision (the Subdivision) of Montgomery County; that the transactions in question involving unreleased deeds of trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>pertained to lots 12(T), 13(T), 14(S), 15(S) and 25(R) of the Subdivision; and that the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s investigation disclosed that many of the purchasers of properties in the Subdivision \u201cknew nothing of the named unreleased mortgages until the subject was revealed ... to them [by the State\u2019s Attorney].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Responding to the court\u2019s order to show cause why the audit should not be conducted, Andresen answered that he had not failed to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 42 because all the funds coming into his possession in connection with the transactions either \u201cwere disbursed within five days after settlement, the parties waived receipt of the releases, or that the parties were notified pursuant to \u00a7 42(b).\u201d In addition, Andresen entered a general denial that sufficient ground existed to conduct a special audit under \u00a7 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">At the hearing on the petition, the Bar Association adduced evidence showing that on December 13, 1969, the F. O. Day Company (Day) took a deed of trust from Clark-King, developers of the Subdivision, as security for payment of a note; that the deed of trust, securing a $37,000 debt owed Day by Clark-King, covered sixteen or seventeen lots in the Subdivision and contained a clause authorizing the trustees, Andresen and William Wheeler (Day\u2019s attorney) to release each lot upon payment to the noteholder of $2,000 per lot; that no payments on account of the note were made until October 7, 1970 when $9,000 obtained by Clark-King in connection with settlement upon one of its properties located outside the Subdivision was paid to Day. There was evidence showing that settlement was held on a number of properties purchased within the Subdivision between 1970 and 1972; that Andresen acted as settlement attorney in these transactions; that the outstanding deed of trust held by Day covering the lots in the Subdivision was not disclosed by Andresen at the time of settlement and no release of many of the properties covered by the deed of trust was recorded until many months after the deeds were delivered. Testimony given by the purchasers of lots 25(R) and 7(T) in the Subdivision was to the effect that deeds for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>these properties were recorded in July of 1970, but they were not furnished copies of recorded releases of the deed of trust covering their lots until two years later in July and August of 1972 when the lots were released- from the operation and effect of the deed of trust after demand was made upon Andresen that he provide each of them with a copy of the recorded release. In neither case were the property owners notified of any reason for the delay in releasing the deeds of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Considerable evidence produced by the Bar Association to prove that Andresen, as settlement attorney, failed to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 42 (a) and (b) pertained to properties in the Subdivision which were not specifically alluded to in the petition. Andresen\u2019s objections to the introduction of such evidence were summarily overruled by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">There was evidence showing that at the time of settlement on lots 25(R) and 7(T), the property owners, after being advised by Andresen of the provisions of \u00a7 42, signed the following written waiver:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">\u201cWe hereby waive being furnished evidence of recorded releases; having been assured by said settlement attorney that all funds in this transaction will have been disbursed within 5 days from the date of delivery of the deed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Andresen did not testify at the hearing and offered no evidence on his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">The lower court found that the evidence disclosed \u201cmany transactions where there was a deed recorded, and a release was not of record until in some instances more than two years thereafter.\u201d The court concluded that \u201cthe presumption is . . . that the money was received but it was not disbursed.\u201d Believing that the waivers signed by the owners of lots 25(R) and 7(T) did not constitute compliance with the requirements of \u00a7 42, and that the evidence otherwise showed that Andresen had not complied with the provisions of the statute, the court ordered that a special audit be conducted (by an independent auditor) \u201cof the accounts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>maintained by . . . Andresen . . . for funds received in connection with real estate closing transactions in the State of Maryland.\u201d The order directed that the audit be submitted to the court and that upon receipt, the court would notify counsel for the parties and thereafter would pass \u201ca further order in these proceedings, particularly with reference to the use of said audit.\u201d The court\u2019s order enjoined Andresen from secreting or taking from Montgomery County any of the accounts to be audited, \u201cor any of his account books, check book ledgers, statements of account, checks, stubs or files employed in connection therewith until further Order of this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">Andresen claims on appeal, as he did below, that his Fifth Amendment right against compulsory self-in crimination, applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>Malloy v. Hogan, </em>378 U. S. 1, 84 S. Ct. 1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 653 (1964), would be violated if he were compelled to submit his accounts to the special audit ordered by the court. Fie alleges that the information gleaned from the audit, if made, will be used in connection with the criminal proceedings pending against him instituted by the State\u2019s Attorney, and the disbarment or disciplinary proceedings previously initiated against him by the Bar Association. Other allegations raised by Andresen on appeal are (1) that the lower court erred in admitting into evidence and considering testimony and exhibits regarding matters not included or referred to in the pleadings; (2) that prejudicial error was committed by the court when it considered the testimony of the Bar Association\u2019s investigating attorney to be that of an expert in real estate transactions; (3) that the court was in error in disregarding the written waivers executed by the property owners of their right under \u00a7 42 to be furnished with evidence of recorded releases; (4) that the evidence was legally insufficient to support the court\u2019s order, particularly since no evidence was offered by the Bar Association to show that funds coming into Andresen\u2019s possession were not disbursed within five days from the date of delivery of the deeds, thus obviating the need to provide the buyer and seller with evidence of recorded releases; (5) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>that \u00a7 42 was so vague and indefinite as to constitute a violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; (6) that a compulsory production of Andresen\u2019s accounts would constitute an unreasonable seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">As heretofore indicated, \u00a7 42 (a) and (b) impose a duty upon attorneys assuming responsibility for disbursing funds in connection with the conveyance of title to real estate to provide the seller and buyer, within thirty days from the delivery of the deed (unless an extension of that period is warranted and becomes operative by reason of notice given to the parties), with documentary evidence of recorded releases of mortgages or deeds of trust. Under the provisions of \u00a7 42 (c) failure to comply with these requirements may result in a petition being filed by the seller, buyer, or a bar association seeking an audit of the attorney\u2019s \u201caccounts maintained ... for funds received in connection with real estate closing transactions in this State.\u201d Any such petition is required to \u201cstate concisely the facts showing such noncompliance and shall be verified.\u201d \u00a7 42 (c). By the provisions of \u00a7 42 (e) a settlement attorney is not required to provide evidence of recorded releases to the seller and buyer if he \u201cproperly disburses all funds entrusted to him in the course of the closing transaction within five (5) days from the date of the delivery of the deed or deeds conveying title to the real property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">We think it readily evident that \u00a7 42 was designed to protect the parties in transactions involving the conveyance of title to real estate,from careless or fraudulent practices by persons having responsibility for disbursing the funds received in connection with the conveyance. The grant of authority to a duly organized bar association to petition the court for the audit permitted under \u00a7 42 (c) plainly reflects the Legislature\u2019s recognition that members of the Bar frequently assume the responsibility of disbursing funds in such transactions, and that it is in the general public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>interest, and in the special interest of the legal profession, that a bar association be authorized to assert noncompliance with the provisions of \u00a7 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">We are satisfied that the lower court could properly conclude, as it did, that an audit of Andresen\u2019s real estate accounts was essential because of the evidence showing his failure to comply with the positive requirements of \u00a7 42 (a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The evidence adduced in connection with four of the five transactions specifically referred to in the Bar Association\u2019s petition showed that Andresen did not provide the requisite evidence manifesting release of the Day deed of trust within thirty days of the delivery of the deeds to the properties. That he did not properly disburse the settlement proceeds coming into his hands in connection with these transactions within five days from the delivery of the deeds in accordance with \u00a7 42 (e) is evidenced by the fact that Day\u2019s deed of trust was not released until months after the deeds had been delivered. But even if Andresen had disbursed within the five day period under \u00a7 42 (e), that fact alone would not necessarily insulate him from audit under \u00a7 42 (c); compliance with \u00a7 42 (e) grants relief only from the duty to provide evidence of recorded releases.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">In the circumstances of this case, we do not think the admission of evidence involving transactions not mentioned in the Bar Association\u2019s petition constituted error prejudicial to Andresen\u2019s defense; the evidence \u2014 (except for one property) all relating to properties within the Subdivision \u2014 was essentially cumulative. Nor do we think that the waivers executed by the owners of lots 25(R) and 7(T) relieved Andresen of his obligation to provide them with evidence of the recorded releases; the waivers were plainly predicated upon disbursement being made by Andresen within five days from the date of delivery of the deeds, a condition not met.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And we find no error in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>court\u2019s treatment of the alleged expert witness; his testimony was basically limited to reciting the details of his investigation into the land records of Montgomery County. The only opinion testimony given by him was elicited by Andresen on cross-examination, and it does not clearly appear that the lower court considered it as the testimony of an expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Since Andresen did not challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 42 in the lower court on the ground that it was unconstitutionally vague and indefinite, nor there raise any question with respect to his Fourth Amendment right not to be subjected to illegal seizures, these constitutional issues have not been preserved for appellate review, and we do not pass upon them. <em>Schiller v. </em>Lefkowitz, 242 Md. 461, 219 A. 2d 378 (1966); <em>Hewitt v. State, </em>242 Md. 111, 218 A. 2d 19 (1966); Maryland Rule 885.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The key issue on appeal, and one which was preserved in the lower court, is the relationship of the constitutional protection against compulsory self-incrimination to the ordered audit of Andresen\u2019s real estate accounts. Andresen claims protection under the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment by <em>Malloy v. Hogan, supra, </em>and under Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, which we have construed to be in <em>pari materia </em>with the Fifth Amendment, <em>Blum v. State, </em>94 Md. 375, 51 A. 26 (1902), and subject to a like construction, <em>State v. Panagoulis, </em>253 Md. 699, 253 A. 2d 877 (1969). It is well established that these constitutional provisions are available in civil as well as criminal proceedings, <em>United States v. Kordel, </em>397 U. S. 1, 7-8, 90 S. Ct. 763, 767, 25 L. Ed. 2d 1, 8 (1970) and cases cited therein at n. 10, to protect both oral testimony and private documentary evidence of a testimonial nature, <em>United States v. White, </em>322 U. S. 694, 64 S. Ct. 1248, 88 L. Ed. 1542 (1944), <em>Boyd v. United States, </em>116 U. S. 616, 6 S. Ct. 524, 29 L. Ed. 746 (1886), <em>Archer v. State, </em>145 Md. 128, 125 A. 744 (1924), <em>Blum v. State, supra, </em>which present the claimant with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>substantial hazards of self-incrimination, <em>California v. Byers, </em>402 U. S. 424, 91 S. Ct. 1535, 29 L. Ed. 2d 9 (1971), <em>Malloy v. Hogan, supra, Midgett v. State, </em>223 Md. 282, 164 A. 2d 526 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Andresen relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Boyd, supra, </em>a vintage case of continued vitality <em>(see Couch v. United States, </em>409 U. S. 322, 93 S. Ct. 611, 34 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1973)); that case held that the private records and books of an individual are protected by the privilege against self-incrimination. The Bar Association claims that <em>Shapiro v. United States, </em>335 U. S. 1, 68 S. Ct. 1375, 92 L. Ed. 1787 (1948), and not <em>Boyd, </em>is the controlling authority; <em>Shapi.ro </em>held that records required to be kept by law are \u201cpublic records\u201d outside the scope of the Fifth Amendment protection. Both parties cite <em>Spevack v. Klein, </em>385 U. S. 511, 87 S. Ct. 625, 17 L. Ed. 2d 574 (1967), which held that a lawyer could not be disbarred for refusal, on Fifth Amendment grounds, to produce his financial records subpoenaed to a judicial inquiry into professional misconduct. <em>Spevack </em>is not dispositive of the present controversy, however, for the Supreme Court there expressly refused to consider the applicability of <em>Shapiro </em>as the doctrine espoused in that case had not been timely raised below; nor has any subsequent case squarely answered the question.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">In <em>Shapiro </em>the court concluded that records and documents \u2014 sales invoices, sales books, ledgers, inventory records, contracts and sales records \u2014 required to be kept by valid regulations of the Office of Price Administration could be subpoenaed by the Price Administrator without violating Shapiro\u2019s right against self-incrimination. The Court reasoned, consistent with the principle announced in <em>Wilson v. United States, </em>221 U. S. 361, 31 S. Ct. 538, 55 L. Ed. 771 (1911), and followed in <em>Davis v. United States, </em>328 U. S. 582, 66 S. Ct. 1256, 90 L. Ed. 1453 (1946), and numerous state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>court decisions which it cited in n. 25, 335 U. S. at 18, 68 S. Ct. at 1385, 92 L. Ed. at 1799, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-4\">\u201c \u2018 <em>records required by law to be kept in order that there may be suitable information of transactions which are the appropriate subjects of governmental regulation and the enforcement of restrictions validly </em>established....\u201d\u2019 335 U. S. at 17, 68 S. Ct. at 1392, 92 L. Ed. at 1799</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Amx\">(emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">are analogous to public documents in public offices to which the privilege against self-incrimination does not attach. The Court distinguished <em>Boyd, supra, </em>as extending the protection only to private papers voluntarily maintained, 335 U. S. at 33, 68 S. Ct. at 1392, 92 L. Ed. at 1807-08 n. 42. Recognizing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">\u201c. . .there are limits which the government cannot constitutionally exceed in requiring the keeping of records which may be inspected by an administrative agency and may be used in prosecuting statutory violations committed by the record-keeper himself. . ..\u201d 335 U. S. at 32, 68 S. Ct. at 1391-92, 92 L. Ed. at 1807</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">the Court found the facts in <em>Shapiro </em>to be within those limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">Subsequent cases have identified at least three essential elements of the required records doctrine: (1) the records required to be kept are of the same kind customarily kept by a person engaged in such activity; (2) the records have \u201cpublic aspects\u201d beyond the mere fact that the Government desires the information and has formalized its demand by statute, rule, or regulation; (3) the records relate to an essentially non-criminal and regulatory area of inquiry. <em>Marchetti v. United States, </em>390 U. S. 39, 56-57, 88 S. Ct. 697, 707, 19 L. Ed. 2d 889, 902-03 (1968), <em>Grosso v. United States, </em>390 U. S. 62, 67-68, 88 S. Ct. 709, 713-14, 19 L. Ed. 2d 906, 913 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">The required records doctrine has been applied in numerous and various circumstances; we review only a few <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>illustrative cases. In <em>Hodgson v. Mahoney, </em>460 F. 2d 326 (1st Cir. 1972), the Secretary of Labor, in the process of seeking to enjoin violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, obtained a court order directing the defendant-employer to either answer propounded interrogatories or permit the Secretary to examine his payroll records to obtain the information sought by the interrogatories. The Court approved the order, finding, \u201c. . . the payroll records sought are required to be kept and preserved in order to effectuate governmental regulation .... Consequently they have \u2018public aspects\u2019 and do not invoke the protection of the fifth amendment.\u201d 460 F. 2d at 328. In <em>United States v. Warren, </em>453 F. 2d 738 (2d Cir. 1972), a doctor convicted of unlawful distribution of drugs claimed violation of his right against self-incrimination in the seizure and admission into evidence of his records (index cards with patient names and notations of number of injections given, the dates and charges for them). The Court, finding no constitutional violation, distinguished the case from <em>Hill v. Philpott, </em>445 F. 2d 144 (7th Cir. 1971), which relied upon the holding of <em>Boyd, supra. </em>The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-4\">\u201cHill v. Philpott. . .held that business records seized by an Internal Revenue agent could not be used without violation of the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights. In that case, however, the records were personal business items; in this case, Dr. Warren was required under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360a(d) to make and keep records on acquisition and disposition of amphetamine. Such records, part of a regulatory scheme with public purposes, are not protected by the Fifth Amendment and are specifically excluded from the holding in <em>Hill. </em>445 F. 2d at 146. United States v. Kaufman, 429 F. 2d 240, 247 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U. S. 925, 91 S. Ct. 185, 27 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1970); Shapiro v. United States, 335 U. S. 1, 68 S. Ct. 1375, 92 L. Ed. 1787 (1948).\u201d 453 F. 2d at 742.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">In <em>Fairbank v. Hardin, </em>429 F. 2d 264 (9th Cir. 1970), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Secretary of Agriculture, through administrative proceedings, suspended the license of a registered livestock dealer for wilful misrepresentation of cattle weights in violation of federal law, proof of the violation being established, in part, by admission into evidence of an audit of the dealer\u2019s books and records. Rejecting the dealer\u2019s claim that his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination was thereby violated, the court held, 429 F. 2d at 267:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-4\">\u201cKeeping in mind that petitioners\u2019 registration as a livestock dealer is a privilege granted by the Secretary of Agriculture, pursuant to the provisions of the Act,... and that a livestock dealer is required to keep records for examination by the officials of the agency, . . . and that the keeping of such records and their inspection, from time to time, are important and essential means in the accomplishment of the purposes of the Act, . . . the audit of petitioners\u2019 books and records by respondent Secretary was a proper procedure. Moreover, the receipt in evidence of the products of the audits and the testimony of the auditors in charge was proper and did not constitute error.\u201d [citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Similarly, the \u201cnon-privileged\u201d nature of records required to be kept by ICC regulated carriers has been recognized in the face of Fifth Amendment challenge in <em>United States v. Webb, </em>398 F. 2d 553, 556 (4th Cir. 1968). State courts have similarly recognized and applied the required records doctrine notwithstanding attack made on Fifth Amendment grounds. <em>See, e.g.: State Real Estate Commission v. Roberts, </em>441 Pa. 159, 271 A. 2d 246 (1970); <em>State v. Braun, </em>209 Kan. 181, 495 P. 2d 1000 (1972); <em>People v. Thayer, </em>47 Cal. Rptr. 780, 408 P. 2d 108 (1966); <em>Conner v. Alderman, </em>159 So. 2d 890 (Fla. App. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The required records doctrine of <em>Shapiro, </em>despite substantial criticism<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> has not been repudiated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Supreme Court and continues to be controlling in appropriate factual situations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the facts in the instant case do not present the classic prototype of the required records doctrine \u2014 <em>i.e., </em>a pervasive regulatory scheme with enforcement procedures, including periodic reporting or inspection of records required to be kept thereunder \u2014 we think them close enough in principle to warrant application of the doctrine. <em>See, United States v. Walden, </em>411 F. 2d 1109, 1114 (4th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">Maryland Rule 1230, effective November 2, 1970, adopts the Code of Professional Responsibility of the American Bar Association. <em>Lusby v. Nethken, </em>262 Md. 584, 278 A. 2d 552 (1971). The \u201cDisciplinary Rules\u201d contained therein represent the mandatory minimum level of conduct required of members of the Bar. <em>Montgomery v. State, </em>15 Md. App. 7, 288 A. 2d 628 (1972). DR 9-102 (B)(3) requires that every lawyer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">\u201cMaintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his client regarding them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Neither the Code of Professional Responsibility nor Maryland Code (1957, 1968 Repl. Vol., 1972 Cum. Supp.) Article 10, \u00a7 44,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> prohibiting an attorney from commingling client funds with his own monies, make provision for required reporting or periodic audit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, in the course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>of regulating transactions involving conveyancing of real estate, the Legislature passed Article 21, \u00a7 42, <em>supra </em>note 1, providing a limited right of audit \u201cof the accounts maintained by such person for funds received in connection with real estate closing transactions in this State.\u201d Thus, by combination of court rule and statute, the records in the instant case are required to be kept subject to audit in the narrow circumstances outlined in Article 21, \u00a7 42.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">We think the ordered audit fits each of the <em>Shapiro </em>criteria enumerated above. First, the records required are, obviously, records customarily kept by lawyers, necessary to a proper accounting of monies held for others. Secondly, the records have \u201cpublic aspects\u201d making them at least analogous to public records. They detail the use of monies which the lawyer holds for others in an area properly regulated by the State. In <em>State Real Estate Commission v. Roberts, supra, </em>the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania recognized that the escrow account records of a real estate broker were required records within the meaning of <em>Shapiro. </em>Similarly, in <em>United States v. Silverman, </em>449 F. 2d 1341, 1345 (2d Cir. 1971), the court recognized that an attorney\u2019s closing statements in contingent fee cases, required by court rule to be filed with the court, were required records, noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">\u201cAppellant\u2019s fifth amendment argument is equally without merit. Records required to be kept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>pursuant to a reasonable regulatory scheme have \u2018public aspects\u2019 and may be examined for evidence of criminal conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">Thirdly, the records are not required of an \u201cinherently suspect class\u201d in an area permeated with criminal violations as in <em>Marchetti </em>and <em>Grosso, supra. </em>The distinction is clearly drawn by Justice Brennan\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Mackey v. United States, </em>401 U. S. 667, 708-09, 91 S. Ct. 1160, 1168, 28 L. Ed. 2d 404, 430 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">\u201cOf course, the Government may not insulate inquiries designed to produce incriminating information merely by labeling the inquiry a necessary incident of a regulatory scheme. Where the essence of a statutory scheme is to forbid a given class of activities, it may not be enforced by requiring individuals to report their violations. See Marchetti, . . . [390 U. S. 39, 88 S. Ct. 697, 19 L. Ed. 2d 889]; Haynes v. United States, 390 U. S. 85, 88, S. Ct. 722, 19 L. Ed. 2d 923 (1968); Albertson v. SACB, 382 U. S. 70, 86 S. Ct. 194, 15 L. Ed. 2d 165 (1965). <em>But where the statutory scheme is not designed to forbid certain acts, but only to require that they be done in a certain way, the Government may enforce its requirements by a com'pulsory scheme of reporting, directed at all who engage in those activities, and not on its face designed simply to elicit incriminating information. </em>Shapiro v. United States,. . . [335 U. S. 1, 68 S. Ct. 1375, 92 L. Ed. 1787 (1948)]; see, Albertson v. SACB, supra, at 77-80, 15 L. Ed. 2d at 170-172.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-9\">(emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">Article 21, \u00a7 42 clearly evinces a legislative concern that mortgages and deeds of trust be released, and the buyer and seller informed, in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 42(a) and (b). Failure to follow the legislatively mandated procedure may subject the offending party to the audit contemplated by \u00a7 42(c). But persons failing to adhere to the dictates of \u00a7 42(a) and (b) are not \u201cinherently suspect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>criminal activity\u201d; they need only show, or allow the audit to show, that another proper method was employed, <em>e.g., </em>disbursement of funds within five days as provided in Article 21, \u00a7 42 (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">We are not unmindful of the important values embodied in the Fifth Amendment, nor of its protection to lawyers, as \u201cfirst class citizens.\u201d <em>Spevack v. Klein, supra. </em>Rather, we attempt the \u201cbalancing [of] the public need on the one hand, and the individual claim to constitutional protection on the other,\u201d suggested in <em>California v. Byers, supra, </em>and find that application of the required records doctrine, in the instant case, meets the balance called for without doing violence to the rights of either. .</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">In the circumstances of this case, we conclude that Andresen\u2019s constitutional right against compulsory self-incrimination would not be violated by causing his real estate accounts to be subjected to audit under \u00a7 42(c). The lower court\u2019s order should, however, be modified to limit the audit to those \u201caccounts maintained . . . for funds received in connection with real estate closing transactions in this State\u201d occurring on or after November 2, 1970, the effective date of Maryland Rule 1230. We are further of the view that the lower court\u2019s order should be modified to limit the audit, in its initial phase, to real estate conveyances involving the Potomac Woods Subdivision. In so concluding, we recognize that the scope of the audit authorized by the statute is not limited to those real estate transactions covered in the petition for audit. We, nevertheless, think it the more prudent course of action to first obtain the audit on the transactions occurring within the Subdivision and thereafter, if the Court deems it warranted, to pass a further order widening the audit to include other real estate transactions within the State in which Andresen acted as settlement attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">\n<em>Order of December 19, 1972, modified in accordance with the views expressed in this opinion and as modified affirmed; costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-7\">. \u00a7 42 (Chapter 726 of the Acts of 1968] provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">\u201c(a) <em>Duty of person responsible for disbursement of funds in real estate conveyance. </em>\u2014 When a person has undertaken responsibility for the disbursement of funds in connection with the conveyance of title to real property, it shall be the duty of such person to furnish to the seller and buyer in the transaction, the original or a photographic, photostatic or similarly reproduced copy of the recorded release of any mortgage or deed of trust which such person was obliged to obtain and record with all or part of the funds to be disbursed or, if such original or copy of a recorded release is not readily obtainable at the time of recording, it shall be sufficient to furnish the buyer or seller the original or a copy of the court\u2019s recordation receipt for such release or other certified court document clearly evidencing the recordation of such release.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-9\">\u201c(b) <em>Time of delivery of evidence. </em>\u2014 The required evidence of a recorded release shall be mailed or otherwise delivered to the seller and buyer within thirty days from the delivery of the deed or deeds conveying title to the real property, except that if the recording of the release will be delayed beyond the thirty-day period for causes not attributable to the neglect, omission or malfeasance of the person responsible for the disbursement of funds, a letter explaining the delay shall be mailed or otherwise delivered to the seller and buyer within the thirty-day period, and such person shall furnish to the seller and buyer the required evidence of the recorded release at the earliest opportunity thereafter, provided that the person shall follow the procedure of mailing or otherwise delivering a letter of explanation each thirty days until the required evidence of a recorded release is furnished to the buyer and seller.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-10\">\u201c(c) <em>Noncompliance unth subsections (a) and (b). </em>\u2014 If the provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>subsections (a) and (b) are not complied with by the person responsible for the disbursement of funds, the seller, buyer or a duly organized bar association of this State, may petition a court of equity to order an audit to be made of the accounts maintained by such person for funds received in connection with real estate closing transactions in this State.
