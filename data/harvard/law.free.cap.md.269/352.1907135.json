While the bill of complaint, as originally filed, utilized what was characterized by the chancellor as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>\u201cscatter-gun\u201d approach, the amended bill of complaint brought only against the Commission and the Partnership sharpened the issues only slightly. By leave of court, the County was permitted to intervene. In any event, the matter came on for hearing in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County on the demurrer of the County, or alternatively, on the motion of the County for summary judgment. From an order sustaining the County\u2019s demurrer and from an order and a decree declaring the lease and the ordinances enacted to implement the lease to be valid, the complainants have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">At argument before us, the issues have been narrowed to two questions, stated by the appellants, however, in a more prolix fashion. Basically, the questions are these:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">(i) Is County Bill 167-72, approved on 12 October 1972, an emergency bill which amended the text of the Prince George\u2019s County zoning ordinance, and permitted commercial recreational facilities on land leased from a public agency in an R-R (rural residential) zone invalid as an emergency measure and subject to referendum?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">(ii) Is County Bill 160-72, approved on 19 October 1972 as an emergency measure, which purported to transfer capital funds of $2,000,000.00 from a proposed administrative office building to the construction of roads and a sewage treatment plant at Largo invalid as an emergency measure and subject to referendum?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">(i)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">We regard our opinion in <em>Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland v. Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, </em>269 Md. 202, 306 A. 2d 223 (1973) as clearly dispositive of the attack on County Bill 167-72. Here, the County Council of Prince George\u2019s County was sitting as the district council under the Regional District Act, Ch. 780 of the Laws of 1959, as amended, a public general law which takes precedence over the Prince George\u2019s County Charter. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>As a consequence, the bill was not subject to the Charter provisions respecting referendum and emergency legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">As regards County Bill 160-72, which transferred $2,000,000.00 from capital funds budgeted for a county administration building to the construction of access roads and sewer facilities at Largo, apparently in reliance on Charter, Prince George\u2019s County (1970) \u00a7 818 and \u00a7 824, <em>see Prince George\u2019s County v. Beard, </em>266 Md. 83, 91-92, 291 A. 2d 636 (1972), this was enacted as an emergency measure in the manner contemplated by Charter \u00a7 317, and was declared to be valid by the court below. While the appellants urge that no true emergency existed, it must be remembered that the Council alone had the power to determine whether there was an emergency as contemplated by the Charter and its determination is conclusive and not subject to judicial review. Except for <em>Baltimore v. Hofrichter, </em>178 Md. 91, 99, 100, 11 A. 2d 375 (1940) and <em>Geisendaffer v. Mayor and City Council, </em>176 Md. 150, 3 A. 2d 860 (1939) which are possibly distinguishable, we have consistently held that a legislative determination of emergency is conclusive and not reviewable, <em>Potts v. Governor, </em>255 Md. 445, 448, 258 A. 2d 180 (1969); <em>Heaton v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>254 Md. 605, 255 A. 2d 310 (1969); <em>First Continental v. Director, </em>229 Md. 293, 302, 183 A. 2d 347 (1962); <em>Hammond v. Lancaster, </em>194 Md. 462, 476, 71 A. 2d 474 (1950); <em>Norris v. Baltimore, </em>172 Md. 667, 686, 192 A. 531 (1937); <em>Culp v. Commissioners of Chestertown, </em>154 Md. 620, 623, 141 A. 410 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">As an emergency bill, however, it is not insulated from referendum under \u00a7 319;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it simply remains in force, despite the filing of a petition signed by 10,000 qualified voters, and its effectiveness persists until 30 days after it has been rejected by a majority of the qualified voters of the county voting thereon, should it be so rejected. While this question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>was dealt with only obliquely in the opinion of the court below, and not at all in the order which was entered on 13 December 1972, we are satisfied that the order should have declared that the complainants were entitled to petition County Bill 160-72 to referendum, and should be so modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\n<em>Order of 13 December 1972 modified, and as modified, affirmed; decree of 16 December 1972 affirmed; costs to be paid one-half by appellants and one-half by appellees.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b379-7\">. It is clear from the record that the transfer was not from the County\u2019s current expense budget, Charter \u00a7 807, but from the Capital budget, \u00a7 806 and was therefore not insulated from referendum by \u00a7 319 (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
