The trial judge, Loveless, J., upheld the view of the Board of License Commissioners of Prince George\u2019s County (Board). The appellant, claiming to have been roundly put upon, has appealed. It is best that we begin by setting forth the relevant part of the Legislature\u2019s enactment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">\u201cSection 1. <em>Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Maryland, </em>That Sections . . . 103 (a), 103 (d) and 103 (e) of Article 2B of the Annotated Code of Maryland (1968 Replacement Volume and 1969 Supplement), title \u2018Alcoholic Beverages,\u2019 subtitle \u2018Hours and Days of Sale,\u2019 be and the same are hereby repealed and reenacted, with amendments, and that Section 103 (b) be and it is hereby repealed, and all to read as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-8\">\u201cIn Prince George\u2019s County, (a) no holder of any retail alcoholic beverage license or any agent, servant or employee of a holder of any alcoholic beverage license shall sell or serve any alcoholic beverages or permit any alcoholic beverages to be consumed on the licensed premises between the hours of 2:00 A.M. and 6:00 A.M. [and no] <em>No </em>holder of any retail alcoholic beverage license or any agent, servant or employee of a holder of any alcoholic beverages license shall be permitted to sell any alcoholic beverage or permit any alcoholic beverage to be consumed on the licensed premises between the hours of [12:00 midnight on Saturday] <em>2:00 AM. </em>and 6:00 A.M. [the following Monday, except that holders] Holders of any \u2018on-sale\u2019 retail alcoholic beverage license, their agents, servants, or employees may sell beer and light wine on Sunday, <em>except </em>between the hours of <em>2:00 A.M. and </em>8:00 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>A.M. [and 12:00 midnight and no] <em>No </em>holder of a Class A, beer, wine and liquor license shall be permitted to make any sale between the hours of [midnight] <em>2:00 A.M. </em>and 6:00 A.M. or on Sunday <em>after 2:00 A.M.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">\u201c(d) In Prince George\u2019s County the holder of a Class A (off-sale) license who offers for sale in his licensed premises commodities other than alcoholic beverages and is open on Sundays for the sale of such commodities shall keep all alcoholic beverages upon the premises in a separate beverage department securely closed and locked in a compartment, compartments or enclosure between the hours of [12:00 o\u2019clock midnight on Saturday] <em>2:00 o\u2019clock A.M. on Sunday </em>and 6:00 A.M. the following Monday, subject to rules and regulations of the board of license commissioners not inconsistent with the provisions hereof. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to alcoholic beverages in storage areas which are not open to the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">\u201c(e) In Prince George\u2019s County notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, but in addition thereto the holder of a beer, wine and liquor license, Class B, his agents, servants or employe\u00e9s shall not sell any alcoholic beverages for consumption off the licensed premises between the hours of [12:00 midnight and] 2:00 A.M. <em>and 6:00 A.M. or on Sunday after 2:00 A.M. </em>from any separate store established on the licensed premises as an \u2018off-sale store\u2019 or to keep said \u2018off-sale store\u2019 open for business during said hour and for the purpose of this provision, the board of license commissioners of Prince George\u2019s County shall determine by reasonable standards what shall constitute an \u2018off-sale store.\u2019 Nothing herein contained shall prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages for consumption off the licensed premises between 12:00 midnight and 2:00 A.M. of any day [except</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>What follow are excerpts from a letter dated 24 May 1972 from counsel for the appellant to the Board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">\u201cMy office represents . . . [appellant] which is the holder of a Class A beer, wine and liquor license. It has not opened its store in the past from midnight on Sunday until 2:00 a.m. on Monday. However, its competitor across the street with a Class B license is now open during these hours, and is placing itself in an unfair competitive advantage. Although it is my opinion that my client could legally operate its store during the hours in question, it was advised by your inspector that the statutes involved are subject to further interpretation, and' that it will have to be determined whether a distinction can be made between these two licenses for the hours involved. It is for this reason that I recommend that it make no attempt to open its store during these hours, but that it seek a hearing for the purpose of obtaining a ruling on the interpretation of the applicable statutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-9\">\u201cThe company does not open on Sunday for the sale of commodities other than alcoholic beverages. ... I would like to present the matter to the Board for a determination of the following questions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-10\">\u201c1. Whether a Class A beer, wine and liquor license holder who does not sell commodities other than alcoholic beverages on Sunday is permitted to make sales between 12 midnight and 2:00 a.m. on Monday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-11\">\u201c2. If the answer to number one is in the negative, can the holder of a Class B license <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>sell alcoholic beverages during this time, and if so, whether there are limits on what can be sold.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">In a letter dated 5 July the Board\u2019s administrator said \u201cthe answer to your question No. 1 is \u2018No.\u2019 \u201d In response to the second question the administrator \u201cenclose[d] a copy of Sec. 19 (i) of Article 2B of the Annotated Code (1971 Supplement), which excepts Class B licensees who pay a $1,500 annual fee for the Off Sale privilege on Sunday.\u201d Whether there are \u201climits on what can be sold\u201d was not mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">On 31 July the appellant filed a bill for a declaratory judgment and other relief. The case came on for a hearing before Judge Loveless on 3 October. On 5 December he signed and filed an order the effect of which was to deny Class A licensees the right to sell alcoholic beverages for consumption off of the premises between midnight Sunday and 2:00 a.m. on Monday. In the opinion filed with the order he said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">\u201cIt is stipulated and agreed that the petitioner does not sell any commodities on Sunday and he is, in effect, closed on Sunday. He seeks, however, to open his place of business after midnight and stay open on Monday until 2:00 A.M. He alleges that he is suffering a severe financial loss because he is in competition with a Class B Licensee across the street from his licensed premises and his customers purchase alcoholic beverages from his competitor between the hours in question. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">\u201cThe 1970 amendment for Section 103 (a) extends the hours for Class A licensees from midnight until 2:00 A.M. Section 103 (d) permits persons holding Class A licenses, who sell commodities other than alcoholic beverages, to remain open provided the alcoholic beverages are kept in a separate beverage department securely closed and locked in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>compartment, compartments or enclosure between the hours of 2:00 o\u2019clock, A.M. on Sunday and 6:00 A.M. the following Monday. Certainly a Class A licensee who sold commodities other than alcoholic beverages should not be penalized over a Class A licensee who sells only alcoholic beverages. The Legislature obviously intended that no Class A licensee should sell alcoholic beverages between 2:00 A.M. on Sunday and 6:00 A.M. the following Monday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-4\">\u201cWhatever else may have been the intention of the Legislature, we can not see any exception for the hours of 2:00 A.M. on Sunday until 6:00 A.M. on Monday other than for Class B licensees. The remedy that the petitioner seeks in this case is one which must come from the Legislature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">There can be little doubt that the final sentence of Section 103 (a) confers upon Class A licensees the privilege of selling alcoholic beverages between 12:00:01 a.m. on Monday and 2:00 a.m. on Monday. Sales after 2:00 a.m. on Sunday are indeed verboten but Sunday, needless to say, ends at 12:00:00 p.m. There is even less doubt that Section 103 (d) denies to Class A licensees, who offer for sale commodities other than alcoholic beverages, the privilege of selling alcoholic beverages between 2:00 a.m. \u201con Sunday and 6:00 a.m. the following Monday.\u201d Judge Loveless thought \u201ca Class A licensee who sold commodities other than alcoholic beverages should not be penalized over a Class A licensee who sells only alcoholic beverages.\u201d Perhaps not, but we think it is clear that the Legislature, by what it said rather than by what it may have intended, made a clear and sharp distinction between the one and the other and we shall not, at this time, undertake to say that such a distinction is constitutionally impermissible. We must disagree with the learned trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the \u201cLegislature obviously intended that no Class A licensee should sell alcoholic beverages between 2:00 a.m. on Sunday and 6:00 a.m. the following Monday.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">References were made to other sections of Art. 2B but, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>we see the question presented, they do not require our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">\n<em>Order reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">\n<em>Case remanded for the passage of a declaratory judgment conformable to the views expressed in this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by the appellee.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
