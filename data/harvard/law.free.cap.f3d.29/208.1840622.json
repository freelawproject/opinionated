SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b303-23\">Ethel Paul was denied disability and Supplemental Security Income (\u201cSSI\u201d) benefits by the Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services. Concluding that the district court correctly awarded summary judgment in favor of the Secretary, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-25\">Paul applied for disability and SSI benefits on January 6, 1990, alleging disability because of back injury, diabetes, and hypertension. The Secretary denied her application initially and then again upon reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-26\">At Paul\u2019s request, the claim was heard before an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) on December 21, 1990. Paul\u2019s personal physician, Michael Hunter, attested to Paul\u2019s physical disabilities. In response, the Secretary presented a vocational expert, who opined that Paul had sufficient residual functional capacity to perform certain work, and Donald Faust, an orthopedic surgeon, who examined Paul and testified that her disabilities were less pronounced than had been alleged. The ALJ concluded that Paul\u2019s disabilities were insufficient to meet the SSA requirements and thus denied her relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-27\">The Appeals Council rejected Paul\u2019s request for review. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), Paul appealed to the district court, which adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and dismissed Paul\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-28\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-29\">Paul raises two issues on appeal. First, she contends that the ALJ failed to comply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>with 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512(e)(1), which she reads to require that a claimant\u2019s treating physician be given an opportunity to supplement his initial report with more deta\u00f1ed information, should the ALJ find the information to be inadequate. Paul alleges, and the Secretary acknowledges, that despite the ALJ\u2019s finding that Hunter\u2019s medical conclusions were unsubstantiated by supporting clinical data, Hunter was never solicited by the ALJ to present additional information. Rather, the ALJ merely substituted Faust\u2019s medical opinions for Hunter\u2019s. Paul also asserts, as error, the ALJ\u2019s decision to give more weight to Faust\u2019s testimony, alleging that the opinion of Hunter, as treating physician, should be accorded more deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Our review of the Secretary\u2019s final decision is limited to two inquiries: (1) whether substantial evidence of record supports the Secretary\u2019s decision; and (2) whether the decision comports with relevant legal standards. <em>Muse v. Sullivan, </em>925 F.2d 785, 789 (5th Cir.1991) (per curiam); <em>Villa v. Sullivan, </em>895 F.2d 1019, 1021 (5th Cir.1990). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and less than a preponderance. It is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Muse, </em>925 F.2d at 789. If supported by substantial evidence, the decision of the Secretary is conclusive and must be affirmed. <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 390, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1422, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">This court has jurisdiction to review the Secretary\u2019s final decision only where a claimant has exhausted her administrative remedies. <em>Muse, </em>925 F.2d at 791; <em>Dominick v. Bowen, </em>861 F.2d 1330,1332 (5th Cir.1988). Paul\u2019s fa\u00f1ure to raise her \u00a7 404.1512(e)(1) claim in the Appeals Counc\u00fc, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.900(b), deprives us of jurisdiction to review the claim. As such, we dismiss Paul\u2019s first issue on appeal for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">Paul\u2019s arguments to the contrary are inap-posite. First, the new claim that the ALJ faded to comply with \u00a7 404.1512(e)(1) is not an expansion of the general rationale proffered in support of the appeal. Prior to raising the treating physician supplementation argument in the district court, Paul centered her appeal to the Appeals Counc\u00fc on the a\u00fcegedly disproportionate weight ascribed to the consulting physician\u2019s opinion and on the alleged misapplication of Social Security Ruling 88-13. These foci are distinct from Paul\u2019s additional contention that Hunter should have been contacted to supplement his original testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">The two \u201cassignments] of errors\u201d that Paul presented to the Appeals Counc\u00fc were \u201c[w]hether the [ALJ] erred in discounting the findings and opinions of the treating physicians\u201d and \u201c[w]hether the [ALJ] erred in failing to properly apply Social Security Rule 88-13.\u201d The closest Paul comes to a \u00a7 404.-1512(e)(1) issue in her Appeals Counc\u00fc brief is the statement that \u201c[f]or the [ALJ] to assume that Dr. Hunter did not have the totality of the records in his possession is an unsubstantiated assumption.\u201d This assertion falls well short of an argument that \u00a7 404.-1512(e)(1) (which Paul did not cite) requires that the doctor be recontacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">Second, the caselaw supports our decision to dismiss for want of jurisdiction. We disagree with Paul that the situation in this case is markedly different from those in <em>Dominick </em>and <em>Muse. </em>The plaintiff in <em>Dominick </em>asserted, for the first time on appeal to the circuit court, an error in the determination of her insured status, <em>id. </em>at 1332, wh\u00fce the <em>Muse </em>plaintiff sim\u00fcarly fa\u00fced to challenge the alleged bias of the ALJ in front of the Appeals Counc\u00fc. <em>Id. </em>at 791. Paul, sim\u00fcarly, did not raise the treating physician claim at the Appeals Counc\u00fc; the issue surfaced for the first time in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-13\">Furthermore, wh\u00fce equitable grounds may support this court\u2019s decision to consider issues not previously presented, <em>In re Corrugated Container Antitrust Litig., </em>647 F.2d 460, 461 (5th Cir. Unit A May 1981) (per curiam) (\u201cThis rule, however, is not inflexible and it gives way when necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice.\u201d), we refuse to do so here. Paul\u2019s reliance upon <em>Thorton v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number><em>Schweiker, </em>663 F.2d 1312 (5th Cir. Dec. 1981), in which we considered evidence that had not been presented at previous SSA hearings, is unfounded. In <em>Thorton </em>the plaintiff had requested assistance from the SSA in obtaining certain medical records that she wished to present at her hearing. Despite having given repeated assurances that the records would be obtained, the SSA never did so, and the records never appeared in evidence before the ALJ. In light of the plaintiffs reasonable reliance upon SSA\u2019s representations and in order to prevent a miscarriage of justice, we remanded for further review. <em>Id. </em>at 1316.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">In contrast, Paul\u2019s failure to raise her claim during the administrative process was her own doing; she neither requested help nor relied upon the Secretary\u2019s representations of such help. Therefore, in light of Paul\u2019s failure to exhaust her administrative remedies, we dismiss the \u00a7 404.1512(e)(1) claim for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">We also reject Paul\u2019s second issue on appeal. \u201cAlthough we review the entire record, we may not re-weigh the evidence or substitute our judgment for the Secretary\u2019s.\u201d <em>Hollis v. Bowen, </em>837 F.2d 1378, 1383 (5th Cir.1988) (per curiam). Typically the opinion of the treating physician is entitled to great weight. The ALJ may diminish its weight relative to other experts, however, where the treating physician\u2019s evidence is unsupported by medically acceptable clinical, laboratory, or diagnostic techniques, or where otherwise unsupported by the evidence. <em>Scott v. Heckler, </em>770 F.2d 482, 485 (5th Cir.1985). The opinion of a specialist generally is accorded greater weight than that of a non-specialist. <em>Dorsey v. Heckler, </em>702 F.2d 597, 603 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">We are unable to say that the ALJ erred in deciding as to the credibility of competing witnesses. The ALJ supported his decision to rely more heavily upon Faust\u2019s testimony in part because of inconsistencies in Hunter\u2019s testimony, insufficient laboratory work submitted in support of Hunter\u2019s testimony, and Faust\u2019s qualifications as an orthopedic expert. Faust expressly stated that Paul\u2019s injuries were less severe than alleged and that she was capable of performing specific employment functions. The ALJ\u2019s decision reflects careful consideration of the evidence presented, and we may not substitute our judgment for the Secretary\u2019s. We therefore conclude that, under the appropriate standard of review, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision to weigh Faust\u2019s testimony more heavily and to find that Paul was capable of performing certain work.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we reject Paul\u2019s arguments on appeal and AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
