Mandel was notified of tlieir arrival and went immediately to defendant\u2019s pier to get the goods. He asked in defendant\u2019s office on the pier and was told they didn\u2019t have the goods; he went to different places on the dock looking for them and didn\u2019t get them. The railroad held them for some time, at any rate, over forty-eight hours, and then, pursuant to section 5 of the bill of lading, put them in a warehouse. Mandel and Koch never got them. The duty of the carrier involves the allowance to the consignee of a reasonable time and opportunity after notice of the arrival of the goods within which to take them away. This depends on all the facts and circumstances of' the case and, where the facts axe in dispute or the inference in doubt, is a question of fact and not of law. <em>Burr </em>v. <em>Adams Express Co., </em>71 <em>N. J. L. </em>263.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">It is important that when Mandel first inquired for the goods the railroad\u2019s employe said they didn\u2019t have them. Further inquiry must have seemed to him useless and he could hardly have opportunity to take the goods away when the railroad denied possession. The fact that signs on the pier directed parties desiring their freight to ask the general foreman is at most a circumstance bearing upon the question of reasonable opportunity. The general foreman\u2019s failure to recollect any inquiry by Mandel is of slight consequence, as he himself testified if; would be a hard matter for him to remember, as he had so many inquiries, and it was a \u201cbig station.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>The trial judge was justified in finding that a reasonable opportunity was not given to remove the goods. A judgment for the plaintiff was therefore proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Let the judgment be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
