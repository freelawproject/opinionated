Kelly and Wife <em>versus </em>Charles Beers.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b338-8\">After the sale of an equity of redemption on execution, there remains nothing in the judgment debtor on which an execution against him can operate.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-9\">Entry <em>sur </em>disseizin, to recover possession of a certain parcel of land in Somerset, in the county of <em>Bristol.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-10\">The action was referred to the decision of the Court upon certain facts agreed, to the following effect. The tenant, <em>Beers, </em>on the 11th day of June, 1810, being seized in fee of the demanded [*388] premises, mortgaged the same to <em>John Winslow, </em>*as collateral security for the payment of a sum of money. On the 8th day of August, 1811, the right in equity to redeem the demanded premises, remaining in <em>Beers, </em>was duly sold by a deputy sheriff, upon an execution against him, and was purchased by one <em>Robert Slade. </em>Afterwards, on the same day, another deputy sheriff undertook to sell the same right upon another execution against <em>Beers, </em>and, accordingly, made a deed thereof to one <em>William Mason. </em>On the 13th day of the same August, the same right was again taken upon an execution against <em>Beers, </em>in favor of <em>Lettice Lawton, </em>then sole, but since married to the demandant, <em>Kelly, </em>and the officer made a deed for the conveyance thereof to her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-11\">If, upon the facts agreed, the demandants were entitled, in the opinion of the Court, to recover possession of the demanded premises against the tenant, <em>Beers, </em>he was to be defaulted, and the demandants to have judgment for possession and costs ; otherwise, the demandants were to become nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b338-12\">The cause was argued at the last October term in <em>Bristol, </em>by <em>Sproat, </em>for the demandants, and by <em>Tillinghast </em>and <em>Gilbert, </em>for the tenant;</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4-\">and, being continued for advisement, the opinion of the Court was delivered at this term by</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b338-13\">Jackson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ajp\">[After stating the facts agreed.] The single question in this case is, whether the demandants can maintain their action upon the title set forth in the case agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-14-pl-split\">By the statute of 1783, c. 57, the debtor\u2019s right of redeeming a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>mortgaged estate may be taken on execution, and set off to the creditor, like other real estate. The debtor was considered as owning the land subject to the lien ; and it was given to his creditor, subject still to the same lien, and subject also to the right of the debtor to redeem, as against the judgment creditor, by paying him the debt for which it was thus set off.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">By the statute of 1798, c. 77, the officer is authorized, instead of assigning to the creditor the right of redemption, to sell it at public auction, and apply the proceeds of the sale to the discharge of the execution ; and in this case the * debtor is [*389] allowed to redeem, as against the purchaser, at any time within three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">In each of these modes of levying the execution, the whole estate of the debtor is taken from him. A mortgagor is considered as the owner of the land, as to all the world except the mortgagee. But a debtor, after such a levy, has not, strictly speaking, any interest or estate in the land ; he is not a freeholder ; he has only a possibility, or right to an estate, on payment of a certain sum of money. The law presumes that he has received the full value of his estate ; in one case, according to the appraisement of disinterested men under oath, and in the other, by a fair and public sale at auction ; and the right of redemption, which is still reserved to him, is not so much a valuable interest, as it is a personal privilege to keep his own land, if he does not wish to part with it at its full value. He is under no obligation to redeem. There is no reciprocity between him and the creditor, as there is between mortgagor and mortgagee. The creditor has no right to demand the money ; but is merely bound to convey the land on receiving payment within the time prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">It was competent to the legislature to subject this right of redemption, after a sale on execution, to be taken on another execution. But they have not thought proper to do this ; probably because, for the reason before given, it was not presumed to have any value. In both statutes, it is the right to redeem real estate <em>mortgaged, </em>that is made subject to attachment and execution ; because a mortgage is more frequently given for less than the value of the land, and the right of redemption is, therefore, a real and valuable interest, as well as an estate in the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">If it be said, that, after such a sale on execution, the debtor still owns, in fact, his former right of redemption, but subject to a new lien to the purchaser, it may be answered, that this is not the language of the statutes. His whole estate is taken from him, and the right, which he retains, is like a right of preemption, as if the purchaser had covenanted to sell and convey the land to him for an agreed * price, on receiving payment within a cer- [* 390] tain time. And even if this right should be in some cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>valuable, in consequence of a mistake on the part of the appraisers, or of an unfortunate sale at auction, or a subsequent rise in the value of the land, still it is very different from the right of redemption arising from the reciprocal obligations of mortgagor and mortgagee, which alone is contemplated in the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">On this construction of the statutes, there is no inconvenience nor injustice to creditors. The whole estate of the debtor is sold on the first execution ; and, if the proceeds are more than sufficient to satisfy the execution, the surplus is returned to the debtor, or retained by the officer and applied to any subsequent executions or attachments, according to their priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">If any doubt could have existed on this subject, it is removed by the statute of 1804, <em>c. </em>83, \u00a7 6, which makes this express provision, and puts the sale of personal estate, and of an equity of redemption of real estate, on the same footing in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">After the sale on the first execution, the debtor might have redeemed the estate so sold ; in which case, his former right of redeeming the estate mortgaged would have revested in him, and might have been taken and sold again on another execution. But, under the circumstances of this case, Beers, the debtor, had nothing m the premises, which could have been taken and sold by virtue of the last execution. Of course, nothing passed by the deed made under that last levy; and the demandants have no title to maintain the present action.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">\n<em>Demandants nonsuit.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b340-9\"> Vide <em>Bigelow </em>vs. Wilson, 1 <em>Pick. </em>485. \u2014 <em>Clark </em>vs. <em>Austin, </em>2 <em>Pick. </em>528. \u2014 <em>Bacon </em>vs. <em>Leonard, </em>4 <em>Pick. </em>277. \u2014 <em>Reed </em>vs. <em>Bigelow, </em>5 <em>Pick. </em>281.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">[See <em>contra, Rev Stat. c. 73, </em>\u00a7 48. \u2014 Also <em>Norton </em>vs. <em>Babcock, </em>2 <em>Metc. Rep. </em>510 \u2014 Ed.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
