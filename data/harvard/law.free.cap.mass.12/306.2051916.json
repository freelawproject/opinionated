Rep. </em>501. \u2014 2 <em>Salk. </em>482, 485 3D. &amp; <em>E. 44, </em>637.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b269-11\">Parker, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0v\">The only question presented in this case relates to the notice given by the overseers of <em>Embden </em>to the overseers of <em>Augusta. </em>The notice is, in general terms, that the family of <em>James Savage </em>had applied for relief; and the objection is, that this is uncertain, inasmuch as the overseers of <em>Augusta </em>might not know what individuals composed that family, so as to provide for their removal or support. And the notice is certainly defective, as it may put the overseers of a town to great inconvenience to undertake the removal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>or the support of a family, without knowing of what number it may be composed.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">But a notice which is deficient, if unanswered or not particularly objected to, may become sufficient by an acceptance of it by the adverse party, or by a waiver of any advantage arising from the deficiency. And the answer given in this case proves clearly that the overseers of <em>Augusta </em>were made acquainted with all the facts which were necessary to be known, to enable them to decide whether that town was liable or not. They reply, that the family of <em>James Savage </em>have no settlement in <em>Augusta ; </em>and they utterly refuse either to remove or to support them, or to pay the expenses which had been incurred. This answer was calculated to satisfy the over-[*309] seers of <em>Embden, </em>that *the point in dispute would be the settlement of the paupers, and that there would be no formal objection with respect to the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">It has the appearance of disingenuousness, after appearing to be satisfied with the notice, to make a deficiency of this kind a point of defence against the action. We 'consider the overseers of <em>Augusta </em>as having accepted the notice, and as having waived all objections to its want of particularity.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">\n<em>Defendants defaulted.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b270-8\"> <em>Walpole </em>vs. <em>Hopkinton, </em>4 <em>Pick. </em>358.\u2014 <em>Lanesborough </em>vs. Ashford, 5 <em>Pick </em>190.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"b270-9\"><em> Paris </em>vs. Hiram, <em>ante, </em>262. \u2014 <em>Shutesbury </em>vs. Oxford, 16 <em>Mass.
