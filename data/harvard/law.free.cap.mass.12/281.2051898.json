The agreement was as follows, namely ; \u201c Portland, June 8th, 1813. This may certify, that I, <em>Samuel </em>Todd, do agree to pay my proportional part of the ransom given in <em>St. </em>John's, December 9th, 1812, for the schooner <em>Ospray, </em>by Captain <em>Samuel Fisher, </em>it being two hundred and sixty-one dollars and sixty-one cents, with interest after this date, when it appears that the said ransom is to be paid, as witness my hand. <em>Samuel Todd.\u201d </em>On the back of this agreement * was written [*282] the following, namely; \u201cFor value received, I hereby transfer all my right and interest in the within promise, being myself solely interested, to <em>Jabez Mowry.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-12\">At the trial, which was had upon the general issue, before <em>Thatcher, </em>J., at the last October term in this county, the signing of the said note, and its indorsement to the plaintiff, were admitted, as was also the signing of the said agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-13\">The plaintiff read in evidence the deposition of <em>James Savage, </em>Esq., of <em>Boston, </em>testifying, that some time in July or August, 1813, having in his possession, as attorney to the plaintiff, the note and agreement declared on, the witness gave notice to the defendant, then in <em>Boston, </em>that the same were left with him for collection, the one being indorsed by said <em>Fisher, </em>and the other assigned by <em>Fisher, </em>as the witness supposed, at the same time the first was indorsed, the witness having drawn the form of an assignment on the back of the agreement, and <em>Fisher </em>having agreed to execute it ; that it was un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>derstood by all parties that the plaintiff paid the ransom money for the schooner Ospray, having for the owners\u2019 benefit made himself liable, with the said <em>Fisher </em>and Dr. <em>J. M. </em>Baxter, for the sum mentioned in a writing attached to the deposition, and hereafter described; that the defendant then promised to pay the said two notes, or to give the witness security before he should leave Boston, which he failed of doing ; that the defendant knew and acknowledged that the plaintiff had paid the said money, and made no objection to the portion for which he was liable as part-owner of the schooner ; that the de fendant observed to the witness that <em>Fisher </em>owed him on another account, and that he would obtain from him the balance before leaving Boston, to enable him to make up the money for the plaintiff; wishing the witness to deduct what <em>Fisher </em>owed him, but, on the witness objecting to that course, he undertook to satisfy the full amount of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-5\">The paper annexed to the said deposition was signed by one <em>Thomas Millidge, </em>jun., as agent to the schooner <em>Bream, </em>[* 283] * certifying that he had received a note of hand, signed by said <em>Fisher </em>and <em>Baxter, </em>payable in three months from the date, for \u00a3262 10s., current money of <em>New Brunswick, </em>which sum was to be paid by the said Millidge, to Lieutenant <em>C. Hare, </em>of His Majesty\u2019s schooner <em>Bream, </em>being the sum charged by him for the ransom of the schooner <em>Ospray </em>and cargo.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-6\">The defendant produced a note signed by said <em>Fisher, </em>dated October 3d, 1812, for $ 150.89, payable to the defendant, on which $. 100 was indorsed as paid on the Sth of June, 1813 ; and also an order drawn by <em>Fisher </em>on <em>J. M\u2019Lellan, </em>for $ 247, payable to the defendant, dated on the said 8th of June, which was dishonored by <em>M\u2019Lellan, </em>and which <em>Fisher </em>acknowledged to be good against himself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-7\">A verdict was taken for the plaintiff by consent, subject to the opinion of the Court on the foregoing evidence. If the Court should think the action maintained as to both the plaintiff\u2019s demands or causes of action, judgment was to be entered on the verdict; otherwise, the verdict was to be amended as to the damages, and to stand only for the principal and interest due upon the note first described.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b246-8\">The cause was argued by <em>Longfellow </em>and <em>Storer, </em>for the plaintiff, and by <em>Mellen </em>and <em>Potter, </em>for the defendant;</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ay8\">and, being continued <em>nisi </em>for advisement, judgment was pronounced at the following September term in <em>Berkshire.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b246-9-pl-split\">Parker, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Av9\">If the principal contract, which is declared upon, was duly assigned to the plaintiff, so as to give him the equitable interest and entitle him to an action in the name of <em>Fisher, </em>we have little doubt that an express promise, made to him by the de* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>fendant, gives him a right of action in his own name upon that promise. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The only question of difficulty is, whether the contract or undertaking of <em>Todd </em>to <em>Fisher </em>is duly assigned to the plaintiff. It appears clearly to have been intended to be assigned ; a valuable consideration was paid, and the written evidence of the contract was delivered over to the plaintiff. But <em>Fisher </em>had not signed his name on tue back, although words of transfer were written for the purpose of having his * signature, and the omission was [*284] accidental and not by design.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Whatever may be the effect of handing over a written contract to a party, to whom it is intended to be transferred, without a recognition of the transfer by the person bound by the contract, and a promise to pay the contents to the holder ; we are satisfied, that, with such recognition and promise, the assignment is sufficient without the name of the assignor. It amounts to the substitution of one creditor for another, by the consent of the two creditors and the debtor ; and an action may be maintained by such assignee in his own name, founded on the assignment and the express promise of the debtor to pay him. Without such promise of the debtor, the assignment, without writing, may be good, to some purposes, between the assignor and assignee ; but it would be a question between those two only. The action must, in such case, be brought in the name of the assignor ; and if he who holds the contract obtains the money, he will be enabled to keep it, if he can show that he has an equitable right to it, notwithstanding there may have been no assignment of it in writing. A question may also sometimes arise between the assignee and a creditor of the assignor, who may summon the debtor as trustee ; but in the present case no such difficulty has occurred.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">With respect to the right of the defendant to set off any demand he has against Fisher, we think his engagement to pay the plaintiff effectually precludes him. When notified of the assignment, if he had stated his counter claims, and promised to pay only such balance as might be due, his debt would have been protected ; or, if he had not promised at all, the action must have been brought by <em>Fisher, </em>and he would have had a right to set off, according to the statute, if legally and equitable entitled.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> But his promise to pay, especially after signifying a wish to deduct what was due to him from <em>Fisher, </em>amounts to a relinquishment of his right, or an acknowledgment that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>none. And, considering the favorable light in which the plaintiff stands, as having advanced money essentially for the ben[*285] efit of the defendant, it is * not difficult to imagine that he was ready to postpone any claim of his own, for the purpose of indemnifying the plaintff.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">We are therefore of opinion that the verdict is right, and judgment must be entered accordingly.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b247-9\"> <em>Fenner </em>vs Mears, 2 <em>W.
