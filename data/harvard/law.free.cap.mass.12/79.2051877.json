Boardman.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b76-9\">An insurance was effected for $3000 on a ship, and $ 1000 on her cargo, from the <em>United States </em>to <em>Ireland. </em>At the foot of the policy was this memorandum. \u201c Should this <em>vessel and cargo </em>be insured in <em>England, </em>this policy is to be can-celled,\u201d &amp;e. Insurance was made in <em>England, </em>by the plaintiff\u2019s agent there, on the vessel only and not on the cargo. And the underwriter here was holden liable as insurer of the cargo.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b76-10\">The policy stated, that the plaintiff, A. B., <em>or as agent, </em>made insurance, &amp;c. And it being agreed by the parties, that the insurance was made for the benefit of the plaintiff and another joint owner, the plaintiff recovered the whole amount of the loss in his own name, for the use of himself and the other joint owner.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-11\">This was an action of <em>assumpsit </em>brought upon a policy of insurance upon the brg <em>Eliza </em>and cargo, underwritten by the defendant, in which the plaintiff declares for a total loss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>The cause was submitted to the opinion of the Court upon the following facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-5\">The policy declared on was executed on the 31st of January, 1810, and states, that \u201c Mr. <em>Samuel </em>Davis, or as agent, doth make insurance, and cause to be insured, lost or not lost, the sum of $ 3000 on the hull and appurtenances of the brig Eliza, and $ 1000 on her cargo from <em>Bath </em>to <em>Cork.\u201d </em>The policy is in the usual form, and at the foot thereof is the following memorandum, namely, \u201c Should this vessel and cargo be insured in <em>England, </em>in time to attach, this policy is to be cancelled on the assured\u2019s producing a copy of the policy, or the original, and paying one half per <em>cent.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-6\">The brig <em>Eliza </em>sailed from <em>Bath, </em>for <em>Cork </em>on or about the 17th of December, 1809, and has not been heard of since. It is believed that she foundered at sea ; and an abandonment was made in due season. The vessel and cargo were owned by the plaintiff, <em>John Richardson, </em>and <em>Chapin * Weston ; </em>one eighth part [*81] being the property of <em>Weston, </em>and the remainder the property of <em>Richardson </em>and the plaintiff. The insurance was made for the benefit of <em>Richardson </em>and the plaintiff, and they were, from the commencement of the risk until the time of the loss, jointly interested in the vessel to the amount insured thereon, and in the cargo to the amount of $707.31. On the 5th of March, 1810, the agent of said <em>Davis </em>and <em>Richardson </em>in <em>London </em>caused insurance to be made <em>on the vessel </em>to the amount of \u00a3900 sterling, \u201c from <em>Bath </em>to a port of discharge in the United Kingdom, with leave to touch and stay at <em>Fayal, </em>or any place in <em>Spain </em>or <em>Portugal.\u201d </em>The assured have received nothing from the underwriters upon this policy. Neither the original policy underwritten in <em>London, </em>nor a copy thereof, has been produced ; nor the half <em>per cent, </em>paid .by the plaintiff, for the purpose of enabling him to vacate the policy declared on.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-8\">When\u201d the plaintiff applied for this insurance, he stated that he had given orders to the correspondent of himself and <em>Richardson </em>in <em>London </em>to effect insurance there ; but, in consequence of the uncertainty of his letters going to <em>London, </em>he wished a <em>conditional </em>insurance made here, and the memorandum relative to the same at the foot of the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-9\">It was also agreed, that, if the plaintiff had produced evidence that his order for insurance had been executed in <em>London, </em>his premium would have been returned bv the insurance broker, without reference to the date of said <em>English </em>policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-10\">If, on these facts, the Court should be of opinion that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, it was agreed that he should become nonsuit. If the Court should be of opinion that he was entitled tc recover for a total loss, the defendant was to be defaulted, and judgment to be rendered for a total loss on the policy and costs, deduct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>ing the premium note and one <em>per cent. </em>If the Court should be of opinion that the plaintiff was entitled to recover for a loss [*82] on the * cargo only, then the plaintiff was to have judgment for that loss and costs, and the defendant might file in offset certain specified premium notes.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b78-5\">The cause was argued, at the last March term, by <em>Crane, </em>for the plaintiff, and <em>Hubbard, </em>for. the defendant;</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"A5P\">and at this term the opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b78-6\">Jackson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Atg\">The principal question in this case turns upon the construction of the memorandum at the foot of the policy declared on. It seems impossible to doubt as to the intention of the parties in making it. The plaintiff had sent orders to <em>London </em>to effect insurance there on the property in question, or on sonrft iart of it; but, it being necessarily uncertain whether those orders would be received and be executed by his agent in <em>London, </em>before intelligence of the safe arrival of the vessel, or of a loss, should reach that place, he wished to have conditional insurance made, to take effect in that event. He intended to be insured here, only to the extent of what he should fail to get insured in <em>England. </em>He disclosed these views to the insurers here, and upon that representation this policy was effected.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">But the event, which he intended to guard against, has not occurred. His instructions did reach his correspondent in <em>London, </em>and insurance was seasonably effected there, and did attach, according to the terms of the memorandum. If, then, the defendant is not discharged, it is because the parties have failed, from want of care or skill, to express what they most unquestionably intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">The plaintiff, however, contends, that, by the terms of the memorandum, this policy was to be void only in case the vessel <em>and </em>cargo should be insured in <em>England; </em>and that, although the vessel appears to have been fully insured there, yet, there having been no Insurance on the cargo, the condition has not happened, and this policy is effectual for the whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">It is not uncommon, in papers written without much attention to technical and grammatical rules, to find <em>and </em>used for <em>or, </em>and <em>or </em>for <em>and.</em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> In this case neither word alone would have clearly [*83 ] expressed the intent of the parties. They intended, *that, if vessel and cargo, or either of them, should be insured in <em>England, </em>this policy should attach only on what should remain uninsured by such policy effected in <em>England.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">It is the duty of the Court, after having ascertained the meaning of the parties to a contract, to give it full effect, so far as may be consistent with the principles of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>The construction which we have adopted in the present instance, and which seems forced upon us by the nature and circumstances of the case, is confirmed by the legal principles applicable to the contract of insurance. A policy embracing two distinct subjects of insurance is, to many purposes, considered as two distinct policies.<footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> Here is one insurance for $3000 on the ship, and another for $1000 on the cargo. The intent and effect of the memorandum is, that, if the ship be insured in England, this insurance on the ship is to be void ; and, if the cargo be insured in England, the insurance made here on the cargo is to be void. <em>Reddendo singula </em>singulis, the memorandum is coextensive with the policy ; and the condition which is to annul the contract is applicable to both or either of its parts, according to the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The plaintiff has further contended, that the production by him of the policy effected in <em>England </em>is a. condition precedent to the cancelling of this.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">We cannot yield to this construction of the memorandum. The effect of it would be, to put it in the power of the assured to vacate the policy, and obtain a return of the premium, if the vessel should arrive safely ; and to hold the insurer responsible in case a loss should occur. Such a stipulation is utterly inconsistent with the nature of the contract; and could never have been proposed, or acceded to, by men of common understanding. Having agreed that this policy should be void, if insurance should be effected in <em>England, </em>they proceed to specify a particular mode of proving the fact. The clause in question is, in effect, an agreement on the part of the insurer, that he will return the premium, retaining only half <em>per cent., </em>on the bare production of the <em>English </em>* policy, [*84] or a copy of it, without requiring from the assured more formal and complete evidence of the fact. But when the insurer has the affirmative on that question, and it is for his interest to prove the existence of such a policy in <em>England, </em>it is absurd to suppose, that the most satisfactory evidence produced by him should be of no avail, unless his adversary should think fit to aid him, and to furnish additional evidence to the same point.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">The opinion which we have formed is founded entirely on the construction of the memorandum ; and not on the idea of a double insurance, or over insurance, such as existed in the cases cited for the defendant on this point.<footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> These cases are not applicable to policies made in the form usually adopted here. For many years past the policies effected in this State have almost universally contained a stipulation, that, in case the sum assured, whether by one or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>more policies, should exceed the value of the property at risk, the first insurers should be liable, and so on successively, according to the time of their respective subscriptions, until the whole property be covered ; and that those, who subscribed afterwards, should be discharged, and return the premium, retaining only half <em>per cent. </em>The question, therefore, of contribution among insurers cannot arise on such a policy, as no insurer is in any case chargeable for more than he is bound eventually to pay on his own account.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">We are entirely satisfied that the insurance, so far as respects the ship, is annulled and defeated by the memorandum, and by the events which have occurred ; and the insurance on the cargo is effectual, and the contract in that respect in full force against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">This brings into view the objection suggested by the defendant, namely, that the plaintiff, having insured for himself, \u201c <em>or </em>as agent,\u201d cannot, in any view, be entitled to recover more than one half of the sum insured on the cargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Here again we may apply the remarks before made as to the phraseology of mercantile contracts, and the case of [ * 85 ] * <em>Rees </em>vs. <em>Abbot </em>there referred to. The parties have agreed, in their statement of the case, that this insurance was in truth made for the use and benefit of the plaintiff and <em>Richardson ; </em>and we see no difficulty in carrying that intention into effect. It is an insurance of all the interest which the plaintiff and Richardson, or either of them, had in the property at risk, to the extent of the sum insured by this policy. If this be not the.meaning, we must suppose that the plaintiff, when procuring this insurance, did not know whether he wanted it for himself or for <em>Richardson ; </em>although he knew that one or the other of them intended to be insured, and he was willing to become responsible for the premium. So as to the insurers, we must suppose that they were willing to insure the sum of $4000 on this vessel and cargo, either for the plaintiff or for <em>Richardson; </em>but that they would not insure for both of them jointly. This is to suppose that both parties acted without motive, or in a manner wholly inconsistent with the usual course of such transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">A policy written in the old form, namely, \u201c as well in the plaintiff\u2019s own name, as for and in the name and names of all and every other person or persons, to whom the same may appertain,\u201d &amp;c., would have better expressed the intent of the parties.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> But that form has been disused in this State for twenty years past; and probably was not familiar to the broker, nor to any of the parties concerned. When the defendant agreed t.o insure for the plaintiff as agent, either he was informed that <em>Richardson </em>was the principal, or he waived all information on the subject. In either case the policy is equally valid and effectual.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>The declaration has not been exhibited to the Court; and no question has been raised respecting it. Upon the construction which we give to the policy, there is no doubt that the plaintiff might, by an apt declaration, recover the whole amount of the loss in his own name, for the use of himself and <em>Richardson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">*It is, therefore, the opinion of the Court, that the plain- [*86] tiff is entitled to recover for a total loss on the cargo, to the extent of his own and <em>Richardson's </em>interest therein ; from which is to be deducted the amount of the premium notes mentioned in the case ; and the balance to be adjusted according to the agreement of the parties filed in the case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b78-12\"> <em>Rees </em>vs. <em>Abbot, Cowp. </em>832.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b79-8\"> <em>Marsh., B. </em>1, c. 14, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(3)\">\n<p id=\"b79-9\"> <em>Marsh. </em>146 \u20141 <em>W.
