After arriving at <em>Neio Bedford, </em>war was declared against <em>England, </em>which put a stop to the voyage. In the mean time the agent had sold the cargo. The purchaser was held entitled to the cargo, paying the expense of unloading, without paying any freight; and this, notwithstanding the master had signed bills of lading promising to deliver the cargo in <em>England.</em></headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-9\">This was an action of replevin, to which the defendants pleaded property in a stranger ; replication, property in the plaintiff, and issue thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-10\">This issue was tried at an adjournment of this Court for the county of Bristol, held at Taunton, in May, 1814, before the present <em>Chief Justice.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-11\">The facts proved at the trial, as reported by the judge, were as follows. On the third of February, 1812, the defendants, being owners of a certain ship, entered into a charter-party with one <em>E Brown, </em>as agent of the company of <em>Brown and others, </em>merchants of <em>Plymouth, </em>in <em>England, </em>by which charter-party the defendants were bound to send the said ship to <em>Savannah, </em>in <em>Georgia, </em>there to take in a cargo of timber and other wood, and proceed to <em>Plymouth, </em>or some other port in <em>England. </em>The ship proceeded to <em>* Savannah, </em>and there took in a cargo, pursuant to the [* 371 charter-party ; which cargo was purchased for and in behalf of the said house in <em>England, </em>by the said <em>E. Brown, </em>their agent. After the ship was loaded, and before she could go to sea, the act of the <em>United States </em>laying an embargo had passed, and, on the 15th of April, 1812, notice of it reached <em>Savannah ; </em>which prevented the ship from sailing. An agreement in writing was then made, by the said <em>E. Brown </em>and the master of the ship, that the ship should be carried to <em>New Bedford, </em>there to remain until the embargo should cease. Before this, the master of the ship had signed bills of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>lading in the usual form, one of which had been sent by the said agent to the house in <em>England. After </em>the ship arrived at New <em>Bed-ford, </em>war was declared between the <em>United States </em>and <em>Great Britain. </em>The said <em>E. Brown </em>testified, that his principals in <em>England </em>had, by letter, authorized him to dispose of the cargo in America, on account of the war, and that, in pursuance of said authority, he sold the same to the plaintiff for a valuable and sufficient consideration, of which he gave immediate notice to the defendants. After the purchase, the plaintiff came on to <em>New Bedford </em>and claimed the cargo, and tendered to the said <em>Delano </em>the sum of $ 220, for the expenses of unlading the cargo, dockage, &amp;c. But the defendants refused to deliver the cargo, alleging that they ought to be paid their freight, at least from <em>Savannah </em>to <em>New </em>Bedford, and that they had a right to retain the property until the bill of lading, which had been sent on to <em>Eng</em>land, was returned or cancelled. The defendants also offered evid\u00e9nce to show that the plaintiff, as owner, had derived an advantage from the removal of the timber from <em>Savannah </em>to <em>New Bedford, </em>which was rejected ; and the jury were instructed, if they believed that the sum tendered was sufficient to indemnify the defendants for unlading the cargo, and for the charge of dockage, &amp;c., to find a verdict for the plaintiff, which they did.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-5\">The defendants moved for a new trial, because <em>E. Brown </em>was admitted as a witness, and because the jury were misdirected in matter of law.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ACy\">* This motion was argued at this term, by <em>Whitman </em>and Holmes, for the defendants, and <em>Washburn, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A40n\">after which, the opinion of the Court<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> was delivered by</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b324-11\"> <em>Jackson, </em>J., having been of counsel, did not sit in this cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b324-8\">Parker, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AjW\">Three objections are made to the verdict in this case. 1. That <em>E. Brown </em>was not a competent witness. 2. That the judge, at the trial, ought to have instructed the jury, that freight was due from <em>Savannah </em>to <em>New Bedford, </em>and, therefore, sufficient money had not been tendered, to entitle the plaintiff to a delivery of the timber. 3. That an indemnity against the bill of lading, signed by the master of the ship and transmitted to <em>England, </em>should have been offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">The first objection has, very properly, been abandoned ; it being manifest that <em>Brown </em>was merely an agent, without any interest in the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">With respect to the <em>second, </em>it appears clearly, from the report of the trial, that the master of the ship, for the benefit of the owners, agreed with <em>Brown, </em>the agent of the freighters, to suspend the contract during the operation of the embargo, and, for the mutual convenience of the parties, it was agreed that the ship should be sailed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>to <em>New Bedford; </em>which was to avoid expense, and the injury resulting from the climate. This agreement was afterwards recognised and assented to by the defendants ; and it was manifestly for their interest to have the ship at their own doors, where she could be taken care of at a small expense, and where she would be liable to little injury during an embargo, which was indefinite in duration, rather than at a distant Southern port. There is no pretence in justice for freight-money from <em>Savannah </em>to <em>New Bedford</em>; for the dissolution of the contract by the war must be considered in the same light as if the ship had lain at <em>Savannah </em>until the war took place. The accidental increased value of the timber gives no right to demand freight upon a contract which was at first suspended by mutual consent, and after-wards dissolved by irresistible authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">* Nor is there any thing in the <em>third </em>objection. The [ * 373 | bill of lading was of no legal effect after the declaration of war, nor can any action be maintained upon it. It will always be a sufficient answer, that it became impossible to perform the contract, without violating the laws of the country. Besides, the authorized receipt of the cargo here by an agent of the owners, and the sale of it, would, of themselves, defeat any attempt to maintain an action upon the bill of lading.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\n<em>Judgment according to the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b325-7\"> <em>Palmer </em>vs. <em>Lorillard, </em>15 <em>Johns. </em>14, 16 <em>Johns. </em>348. \u2014 <em>Odlin </em>vs. <em>Ins.
