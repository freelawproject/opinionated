The demandant counts upon the seizin of <em>Tristram Gilman, </em>his predecessor in the said parish, within thirty years, and upon a dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>seizin committed by <em>Alfred </em>Johnson, the former minister of <em>Freeport, </em>who demised the same to a committee of Freeport, under whom the tenant entered, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-5\">The action was submitted to the Court upon an agreed statement of facts to the following purport. The demandant is the settled, ordained minister of the first parish in <em>North Yarmouth, </em>and the lot of land demanded was drawn to the right originally reserved for the use of the ministry in that town. The town of <em>Freeport </em>was taken off from <em>North </em>Yarmouth, and incorporated in the year 1789, about which time the Reverend <em>Alfred Johnson </em>was settled as the minister of the first parish in said town, and from that time occupied the lot demanded, until the year 1805 ; after which it was occupied by the said first parish, through their committee or agent, from year to year, until the commencement of this suit, when the tenant, <em>Nye, </em>was in possession of it under said parish.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-6\">In the year 1770, the town of <em>North Yarmouth, </em>then constituting one parish, and of which the said first parish in * <em>North Yarmouth </em>is the successor, voted that a certain [* 286] part of said town, including what is now <em>Freeport, </em>should be set off into a separate district, excepting the public lands reserved for the use of the ministry. In the year 1774, the said town of <em>North Yarmouth, </em>then being one' parish as aforesaid, voted that the inhabitants in the easterly end of the same town, including what is now <em>Freeport, </em>should have the lot demanded in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-9\">In the year 1769, upon the dismissal of the Rev. Mr. <em>Brooks, </em>the Rev. Mr. <em>Gilman, </em>on whose seizin the demandant counts, was settled as the minister in said <em>North Yarmouth, </em>and the same year the town voted that he should occupy certain specified parcels of the ministerial lands in said town ; all which he possessed and occupied until his death in the year 1807 ; but he never entered upon, claimed, or possessed the lot demanded in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-10\">\u2022 What is now <em>Freeport </em>was, before its incorporation, called the easterly part of <em>North Yarmouth ; </em>and the inhabitants thereof applied their portion of the taxes .laid for that object in supporting their own public worship after the year 1774.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-11\">There was evidence of the demanded premises having been inclosed by a fence before the year 1775 ; but it did not appear whether such fence was erected by the persons occupying the demanded premises, or by the tenants of the adjoining lands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-12\">Upon the facts appearing in the case, it was agreed, that the Court should enter judgment by default of the tenant, or nonsuit of the demandant, as their opinion should be.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b249-13\">The cause was argued, at this term, by <em>Mellen, </em>for the demandant, and by <em>Whitman </em>and <em>Mitchell, </em>for the tenant;</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A54\">and, being continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number><em>nisi, </em>judgment was rendered at the following September term in <em>Berkshire.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b250-5\">Parker, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Apt\">The demandant has counted upon the seizin of Mr. <em>Gilman, </em>his predecessor, within thirty years before the commencement of his action; and such seizin must be proved, [* 287] or he cannot recover. For, by our statute *of limitation of real actions, being <em>Stat. </em>1807, <em>c. </em>74, \u00a7 2, \u201cNo person shall sue, have, or maintain any writ of entry upon disseizin done to any of his ancestors or predecessors, &amp;c., unless the ancestor or predecessor, under whom the demandant shall claim, shall have been seized or possessed of the lands, &amp;c., demanded within thirty years next before the test of the writ, or bringing such action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">It is expressly agreed in this case, that Mr. <em>Gilman </em>never entered upon, possessed, or made claim to the land demanded. His seizin, therefore, if he had any, must have been a constructive one, being derived from his title to all the ministerial lands in <em>North Yarmouth </em>at the time he was settled in the ministry there ; he having actually entered upon some of the lots, which were a part of the ministerial right. But such a constructive seizin cannot be inferred in this case ; because he did not enter upon a part with a view of claiming the whole ; but, on the contrary, in pursuance of a vote of the town, acting parochially, he appropriated to himself only some of the lots or parcels which belonged to the ministerial right; thereby assenting to the disposition made by the town of the other lots, at least so far as to negative any implication of a seizin of those others, arising from the right vested in him by his settlement, and by his occupation of the other lots. Whether the demandant would be entitled to recover upon this evidence, if the lot demanded had remained vacant and unoccupied, we need not determine ; for here has been an occupation, if not adverse, inconsistent with the seizin of the demandant\u2019s predecessor, so as effectually to bar him, according to the statute, from maintaining this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">In the year 1770, by a vote of the town of <em>North Yarmouth, </em>then comprising but one parish, the inhabitants of that part of the town now <em>Freeport </em>were set off into a separate district ; and in 1774 the lot demanded was appropriated to-the inhabitants of the easterly part of the town, who carried on public worship, separate from the town, in a place convenient for themselves. In consequence of this appropriation, they soon after, at their own expense, erected [*28S] *a meeting-house upon the lot thus granted to them, which they have continued to use for public worship to the present time.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8-pl-split\">In the year 1789, the same section of the town was incorporated \u2018nto a separate town, and in the following year they.settled a minister. Now, although the grant was ineffectual, because it had not the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>press assent of the minister for the time being, without which the town or parish could not transfer the land, yet the implied assent of the minister, he not having objected, but having suffered the land to be occupied under the vote of the town during his life, is sufficient to disprove any seizin in him.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The objection suggested at the bar, that the persons, described as the inhabitants of the easterly part of the town, were not capable of taking by grant, or of disseizing the rightful owner, does not apply here. It is sufficient for the defence, that Mr. <em>Gilman </em>was not seized, and there appears to be no evidence of an actual or constructive seizin in him.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Whether the fences, which inclosed the land demanded, were built by the \"inhabitants, who were the object of the vote of the town, or by the owners of the adjoining land, is immaterial ; as the land appears to have been distinctly separated from all other land ; and the meeting-house built within the inclosure is sufficient evidence of occupation of the whole lot.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">\n<em>Demandant nonsuit.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b251-8\"> Vide <em>Barr </em>vs. Gratz, 4 <em>Wheat. </em>213 <em>\u2014Brimmer </em>vs. <em>Proprietors of Long Wharf, </em>5 <em>Pick </em>131. \u2014 <em>Rust </em>vs. <em>Boston Mill Corporation, </em>6 <em>Pick </em>158. \u2014 <em>Langdon </em>vs. <em>Potter </em>&amp; al., 3 <em>Mass.
