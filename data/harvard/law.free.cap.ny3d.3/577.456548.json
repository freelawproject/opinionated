Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The issue presented by this appeal is whether respondents\u2019 obligation to pay sums for certain loss adjustment expenses arising from a \u201cfollow the settlements\u201d clause is subject to the indemnification limit stated in a reinsurance policy. Like the Appellate Division, we conclude that it is, and therefore affirm the order of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">In December 1990, appellant Factory Mutual Insurance Company (formerly known as Allendale Mutual Insurance Company) entered into an agreement with Bull Data Systems Inc. to provide property insurance with an indemnification limit of $48 million. Specifically, the policy covered against the risk of loss or damage to Bull Data\u2019s personal computer inventory stored in a warehouse located in Seclin, France. In turn, Fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>tory Mutual obtained facultative reinsurance<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from various London reinsurers which have severally subscribed to the reinsurance agreement at issue in this litigation. The reinsurance policy states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\">\u201cREASSURED: ALLENDALE INSURANCE COMPANY \u201cASSURED: BULL DATA CORPORATION and/or as original. \u201cPERIOD: Twelve months at 1st June, 1991 and/or as original. Both days inclusive. \u201cLOCATIONS: Bull Data Corporation, Seclin, France as original. \u201cINTEREST: Goods and/or Merchandise incidental to the Assured\u2019s business consisting principally of personal computers and/or as original. \u201cLIMIT: US$ 7,000,000 any one occurrence p/o US$ 13,500,000 any one occurrence excess of US$ 25,000,000 any one occurrence. \u201cCONDITIONS: As original and subject to same valuation, clauses and conditions as contained in the original policy or policies but only to cover risks of All Risks of Physical Loss or Damage but excluding Inventory Shortage.

Reinsurers agree to follow the settlements of the Reassured in all respects and to bear their proportion of any expenses incurred, whether legal or otherwise, in the investigation and defence of any claim hereunder. Service of Suit Clause (U.S.A.). Insolvency Clause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">In June of 1991, a fire that generated a spate of litigation, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>the United States and abroad, destroyed the warehouse. Bull Data presented a claim to Factory Mutual and, suspecting that the fire was the result of arson, Factory Mutual refused to satisfy it.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Bull Data brought suit in the courts of France to recover under its insurance policy. Factory Mutual also commenced an unsuccessful litigation against Bull Data in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, claiming that the loss was due to arson, and the limit of liability under the insurance policy was $48 million. After incurring approximately $35 million in litigation expenses, both lawsuits were terminated and Factory Mutual settled the claims with Bull Data for nearly $100 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Factory Mutual thereafter sought payment from respondent reinsurers. The reinsurers refused payment and filed an action in the courts of England seeking a declaration that the reinsurance contract was invalid. The English courts dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. During that period, Factory Mutual commenced a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island seeking $7 million from the reinsurers and an additional $5 million in loss adjustment expenses, allegedly the proportionate share of expenses that the reinsurers owed Factory Mutual for having defended the Bull Data claim. Factory Mutual later discontinued the action upon stipulation and commenced a similar action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin granted partial summary judgment to the reinsurers and dismissed Factory Mutual\u2019s claim for loss adjustment expenses <em>(Allendale Mut. Ins. Co. v Excess Ins. Co. Ltd., </em>970 F Supp 265 [SD NY 1997], <em>amended upon rearg </em>992 F Supp 271 [SD NY 1997]). During the pendency of Factory Mutual\u2019s appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, that court decided an unrelated case which affected the subject matter jurisdiction of the pending case, resulting in dismissal of the appeal and vacatur of the judgment of the District Court <em>(Allendale Mut. Ins. Co. v Excess Ins. Co. Ltd., </em>62 F Supp 2d 1116 [SD NY 1999]).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">The reinsurers thereafter commenced this declaratory judgment action in Supreme Court, New York County, seeking to annul the reinsurance agreement based on material nondisclosures and misrepresentations or, in the alternative, a judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>awarding damages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Factory Mutual interposed a counterclaim, seeking the $7 million indemnification limit under the reinsurance policy as well as $5 million in loss adjustment expenses incurred by Factory Mutual in the litigation of the original claim with Bull Data. Both Factory Mutual and the reinsurers moved for partial summary judgment on Factory Mutual\u2019s counterclaims seeking loss adjustment expenses in excess of the amount stated in the indemnification limit. Supreme Court denied the reinsurers\u2019 motion, granted Factory Mutual\u2019s cross motion and declared that the reinsurers\u2019 obligation to pay their proportionate share of the loss adjustment expenses was not subject to the stated indemnity limit of $7 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The Appellate Division reversed by granting the reinsurers\u2019 motion and denying Factory Mutual\u2019s cross motion. The Court thus declared that any portion of the loss adjustment expenses \u2022 that the reinsurers were obligated to bear was subject to the $7 million limit stated in the reinsurance policy. The Appellate Division granted Factory Mutual leave to appeal to this Court. We now affirm the order of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">In resolving the issue before us, we are mindful that in interpreting reinsurance agreements, as with all contracts, the intention of the parties should control. To discern the parties\u2019 intentions, the court should construe the agreements so as to give full.meaning and effect to the material provisions (see <em>Breed v Insurance Co. of N. Am., </em>46 NY2d 351, 355 [1978]; <em>see also Greenfield v Philles Records, Inc., </em>98 NY2d 562, 569 [2002]; <em>Slatt v Slatt, </em>64 NY2d 966, 967 [1985]).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Here, there is no dispute that the reinsurance agreements set the policy limit at $7 million per occurrence. The so-called \u201cfollow the settlements\u201d clause is thereafter set forth in the section of the policy entitled \u201cCONDITIONS.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As provided in the agreement, the clause requires the reinsurers to pay their por<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>tion of expenses incurred in the investigation and defense of any claim under the agreement. The reinsurers, however, contend that their liability to pay is subject to the $7 million cap negotiated under the policy. By contrast, Factory Mutual argues that the reinsurers\u2019 liability to pay the defense expenses is separate and apart from the indemnification cap on the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">We agree with the reinsurers and hold that they cannot be required to pay loss adjustment expenses in excess of the stated limit in the reinsurance policy. Once the reinsurers have paid the maximum amount stated in the policy, they have no further obligation to pay Factory Mutual any costs related to loss adjustment expenses. In so holding, we follow the decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit as expressed in <em>Bellefonte Reins. Co. v Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>(903 F2d 910 [2d Cir 1990]) and <em>Unigard Sec. Ins. Co., Inc. v North Riv. Ins. Co. </em>(4 F3d 1049 [1993]). In both cases, the ceding insurers claimed that a similar \u201cfollow the fortunes\u201d clause required the reinsurers to reimburse litigation costs beyond the stated limit in the policy. The court in both cases concluded that such a reading of the policy would render meaningless the liability cap negotiated in the policy. According to the <em>Bellefonte </em>court, to \u201callowt ] the \u2018follow the fortunes\u2019 clause to override the limitation on liability\u2014would strip the limitation clause and other conditions of all meaning; the reinsurer would be obliged merely to reimburse the insurer for any and all funds paid. . . . The \u2018follow the fortunes\u2019 clauses in the certificates are structured so that they coexist with, rather than supplant, the liability cap. To construe the certificates otherwise would effectively eliminate the limitation on the reinsurers\u2019 liability to the stated amounts\u201d (903 F2d at 913).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Likewise here, the parties negotiated an indemnity limit of $7 million per occurrence. Thus, any obligation on the part of the reinsurers to reimburse Factory Mutual, whether it be for settling the original insurance claim with Bull Data or for the loss adjustment expenses incurred in the protracted litigation that ensued, must be capped by the negotiated limit under the policy. Otherwise, the reinsurers would be subject to limitless liability. Indeed, this case well illustrates such an injustice as Factory Mutual now seeks to saddle the reinsurers with a portion of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>litigation bill that exceeds the negotiated policy limit by more than 70%.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To permit such a result would render the liability cap a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Factory Mutual asserts that this case is distinguishable from <em>Bellefonte </em>and <em>Unigard </em>in that those cases involved liability insurance while this case involves property insurance. According to Factory Mutual, a liability insurance product normally encompasses the obligation to pay the legal defense costs on behalf of the insured as well as the cost of the loss itself. Thus, the risk to be spread in reinsurance would already include loss adjustment expenses. However, a property insurance product would cover only the value of the property item to be insured. Under those circumstances, Factory Mutual contends, an insurer would have no contractual obligation to incur investigation or litigation costs and the risk of those costs is not already included in the reinsurance product. We find this argument unpersuasive and conclude that this distinction does not provide a sufficient basis to extend the reinsurers\u2019 liability beyond the limit stated in the reinsurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The limit clause in the policy is intended to cap the reinsurers\u2019 total risk exposure. Although Judge Scheindlin\u2019s decision in <em>Allendale </em>was vacated and is not binding, we find her reasoning persuasive, \u201cWhether [the reinsurers] reimburse [Factory Mutual] for claims for property losses or defense costs makes no difference to them. Reinsurers of property insurance policies have the same interest in controlling their maximum exposure as do reinsurers of liability insurance policies. Thus, <em>Bellefonte </em>and <em>Unigard\u2019s </em>holdings that the limit clauses define the reinsurers\u2019 bargained-for maximum exposure to liability inclusive of all costs and expenses are applicable even where the underlying insurance policy does not oblige the insurer to cover the insured\u2019s defense costs\u201d (992 F Supp at 277).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Of course, both parties were well aware of the type of product that was being reinsured. It would be far from unreasonable to expect that at the time of procuring reinsurance, Factory Mutual could anticipate the possibility of incurring loss adjustment expenses in settling a claim from Bull Data. Certainly, nothing prevented Factory Mutual from insuring that risk either by expressly stating that the defense costs were excluded from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>indemnification limit or otherwise negotiating an additional limit for loss adjustment expenses that would have been separate and apart from the reinsurers\u2019 liability on the insured property. Failing this, the reinsurers were entitled to rely on the policy limit as setting their maximum risk exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs, and the certified question answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-7\">. \u201cFacultative reinsurance is policy-specific, meaning that all or a portion of a reinsured\u2019s risk under a specific contract of direct coverage will be indemnified by the reinsurer in the event of loss\u201d <em>(Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s of London, </em>96 NY2d 583, 587 [2001]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b648-8\">. Factory Mutual moved Supreme Court to dismiss the action on the grounds of forum non conveniens and also commenced an action in the Superior Court of Providence, Rhode Island. Supreme Court granted Factory Mutual\u2019s motion. While the reinsurers appealed the order, they sought a preliminary injunction in Supreme Court to enjoin the Rhode Island proceeding, which that court denied. While the Rhode Island court was considering Factory Mutual\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on its claims for loss adjustment expenses in excess of the indemnification limit, the Appellate Division reversed the order of Supreme Court, reinstated the reinsurers\u2019 lawsuit and enjoined the Rhode Island litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b648-9\">.

(dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AUO\">I see no way to tell from the plain language of this certificate whether the parties intended for costs and expenses to be included in the reinsurance limit or excluded from it. Further, in my view the majority has misinterpreted <em>Bellefonte Reins. Co. v Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>(903 F2d 910 [2d Cir 1990]) in ways that augur further expansion of its much debated holding. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">The certificate pertains to reinsurance of a $13,500,000 layer ($25,000,000 to $38,500,000) of a $48,000,000 <em>property </em>insurance policy issued by Factory Mutual. Two provisions are at issue. The first provides that the \u201cLIMIT\u201d is \u201cUS$ 7,000,000 any one occurrence [part of] US$ 13,500,000 any one occurrence excess of US$ 25,000,000 any one occurrence.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The second notes several \u201cCONDITIONS,\u201d including one whereby the certificate is made \u201csubject to same valuation, clauses and conditions as contained in the original policy\u201d (a \u201cfollowing form\u201d provision) and one whereby \u201c[Reinsurers agree ... to bear their proportion of any expenses incurred\u201d (a \u201cfollow the settlements\u201d provision).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">In essence, the majority concludes that the only reasonable interpretation of these provisions is that the policy contains a $7,000,000 limit (any one occurrence) which is cost-inclusive. This conclusion rests too heavily on the \u201cfollow the settlements\u201d provision of the certificate, and fails to consider the \u201cfollowing form\u201d provision. An equally plausible reading is that the parties, who \u201cconditioned\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the certificate on the same \u201cvaluation, clauses and conditions\u201d as exist in the primary <em>property </em>policy\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>where costs are commonly paid in addition to the policy limit* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2014could have intended to create a cost-exclusive reinsurance limit. Moreover, the parties did not expressly state that the limit was \u201csubject to\u201d the conditions and therefore capped all liability under the certificate <em>(see e.g. Bellefonte). </em>Because the certificate may reasonably be interpreted in either of two ways, I conclude that it is ambiguous <em>(see Evans v Famous Music Corp., </em>1 NY3d 452 [2004]).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Moreover, I disagree with the majority\u2019s apparent reading of <em>Bellefonte. </em>In <em>Bellefonte, </em>Aetna issued primary and excess <em>liability </em>policies to A.H. Robins Co., the manufacturer of the Daikon Shield. Aetna reinsured the excess policies with various reinsurers. After an \u201cexplosion\u201d of litigation over the device, Aetna and Robins disputed the extent of Aetna\u2019s liability for defense expenses under the excess policies, and ultimately reached a monetary settlement in excess of the limit stated in the excess policy. Aetna then looked to the reinsurers for the excess paid on the underlying policy. The reinsurers refused to pay, arguing that their liability was limited by the reinsurance certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The certificate stated that the reinsurance was provided \u201csubject to the . . . amount of liability set forth herein\u201d (903 F2d at 911). The court concluded that this created a cap on the reinsurers\u2019 liability whether reached through payment of expenses or settlement of claims. The Second Circuit reasoned that \u201c[a]ny other construction of the reinsurance certificates would negate\u201d the \u201csubject to\u201d provision of the certificate <em>(id. </em>at 914; <em>see also Unigard Sec. Ins. Co. v North Riv. Ins. Co., 4 </em>F3d 1049 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>[2d Cir 1993] [following <em>Bellefonte </em>as certificate included same \u201csubject to\u201d language]).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The <em>Bellefonte </em>court also considered and rejected a second argument made by Aetna, which the Appellate Division applied below (2 AD3d 150 [1st Dept 2003]) and the majority now adopts. Aetna argued that the \u201cfollow the fortunes\u201d doctrine, as embodied in a clause in the certificate,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> obligated the reinsurers to pay all Aetna\u2019s settlements even if they were in excess of the liability limit in the reinsurance policy. The <em>Bellefonte </em>court rebuffed this argument, noting that \u201c[t]he \u2018follow the fortunes\u2019 clauses in the certificates are structured so that they coexist with, rather than supplant, the <em>liability cap. </em>To construe the certificates otherwise would effectively eliminate the limitation on the reinsurers\u2019 liability to the stated amounts\u201d (903 F2d at 913 [emphasis added]). Critically, this prong of the court\u2019s analysis was based on its conclusion that the certificate created a cap on liability through the \u201csubject to\u201d and the \u201climitation\u201d clauses, and that \u201cthe \u2018follow the fortunes\u2019 doctrine does not allow Aetna to recover defense costs beyond the express cap stated in the certificates\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The Appellate Division disregarded the \u201csubject to\u201d analysis in <em>Bellefonte, </em>as does the majority, summarily concluding that \u201call contracts are subject to their terms and conditions\u201d (2 AD3d at 152). Instead, the Appellate Division relied on <em>Bellefonte\u2019s </em>\u201cfollow the fortunes\u201d analysis, and concluded that the \u201coverriding determination in <em>Bellefonte </em>and <em>Unigard </em>was that the \u2018follow the fortunes\u2019 clauses of the reinsurance contracts considered there coexisted with, and did not supplant, the contract limitations\u201d <em>(id.). </em>In my view, this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Bellefonte\u2019s holding was not intended as a general rule applicable to any and all reinsurance certificates <em>(see </em>Goldstein, <em>Bellefonte Lives, </em>8-10 Healey\u2019s Litig Rep Reinsurance 9 [1997] [noting that <em>Bellefonte </em>should have been limited to \u201cthe specific contract language\u201d in the certificate]). The holding relies on specific certificate language\u2014\u201cthe first two provisions of the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>insurance certificates\u201d (903 F2d at 913)\u2014which the court determined contained a \u201ccap\u201d on the reinsurers\u2019 liability. Because the certificate had a cap, the \u201cfollow the fortunes\u201d clause in the certificate could not supplant the cap, which therefore limited expenses.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The Appellate Division and now the majority have converted a rule unique to the specific certificate language in <em>Bellefonte </em>into a general principle that a \u201cfollow the fortunes\u201d clause never supplants a policy limit. Thus, the majority, like the Appellate Division before it, expands <em>Bellefonte </em>from a contract-specific holding into a rule of general applicability.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">When the holding of Bellefonte\u2014that the reinsurance certificate\u2019s specific policy language controls whether costs are included or excluded from the limit\u2014is applied here, it is easily distinguished. There is no \u201csubject to\u201d language in the reinsurance certificate at issue on this appeal. Rather, the certificate contains two discrete provisions\u2014\u201cLIMIT\u201d and \u201cCONDITIONS\u201d\u2014and neither offers any guidance as to whether the \u201cCONDITIONS\u201d are subject to the \u201cLIMIT.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Further, it is worth observing that practitioners in the reinsurance industry have consistently criticized <em>Bellefonte. </em>Specifically, commentators have noted that in ruling \u201cbased solely on a textual interpretation of the language of the certificates,\u201d the <em>Bellefonte </em>court ignored important extrinsic evidence of industry custom and practice showing that the nature of the underlying policy often controlled whether the reinsurance limit was cost-inclusive or cost-exclusive <em>{see </em>Goldstein, <em>Bellefonte Lives </em>[\u201c (n) otwithstanding <em>Bellefonte . . . </em>the industry for the most part has continued to follow the custom and practice of reinsurers providing coverage for expenses in addition to limits where the reinsured policy also covers expenses in addition to limits\u201d]). There was a fear \u201cthat the <em>Bellefonte </em>rule would be applied to the same certificate language but where the reinsured policy covered defense costs in addition to limits\u201d <em>{id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>When <em>Unigard </em>was decided, this fear was realized. There, the certificate language was nearly identical to that in <em>Bellefonte. </em>The Second Circuit rejected extrinsic evidence that the reinsurers covered expenses in addition to the policy limit, instead choosing to rely on its holding in <em>Bellefonte </em>and the similar certificate language (4 F3d at 1071).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Commentators have similarly faulted <em>Allendale Mut. Ins. Co. v Excess Ins. Co. Ltd. </em>(970 F Supp 265 [SD NY 1997], <em>rearg granted and original decision adhered to </em>992 F Supp 271 [1997], <em>vacated </em>172 F3d 37 [table, text at 1999 WL 55313, 1999 US App LEXIS 1735 (2d Cir 1999)]). The federal District Court in <em>Allen-dale </em>was the first court to rule on the case now before us, holding that the plain language of the certificate meant that expenses were included in the policy limit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Citing <em>Bellefonte </em>and <em>Unigard, </em>the court rejected Factory Mutual\u2019s request to distinguish these cases on the basis of the specific certificate language or the nature of the underlying policies (992 F Supp at 274-275). <em>Allendale </em>was thus judged to be \u201ca significant extension\u201d of <em>Bellefonte </em>on both fronts <em>(see </em>Goldstein, <em>Bellefonte Lives; see also </em>Goldstein, <em>For Whom Does Bellefonte Toll? It Tolls for Thee, </em>9-7 Mealey\u2019s Litig Rep Reinsurance 12 [1998] [\u201cBecause <em>Allendale </em>involved reinsurance of a property policy, rather than a liability policy that provided a defense for the insured, and because the contract at issue lacked certain critical language contained in the <em>Bellefonte </em>and <em>Unigard </em>certificates, <em>Allendale </em>clearly expanded the breadth of the <em>Bellefonte </em>Rule\u201d]).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Today, the majority adopts the <em>Allendale </em>rationale, and suggests that Factory Mutual should have negotiated language \u201cexpressly stating that the defense costs were excluded from the indemnification limit,\u201d or otherwise setting forth \u201can additional limit for loss adjustment expenses that would have been separate and apart from the reinsurers\u2019 liability on the insured property\u201d (majority op at 584-585). But Factory Mutual first obtained the relevant certificate in London in December 1990, about eight months after the Second Circuit decided <em>Bellefonte. </em>It seems harsh and unrealistic for us to fault Factory Mutual for not having drafted this certificate to conform with a recently decided case whose potential future reach could hardly have been predicted at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Here, both parties moved for summary judgment, arguing that the certificate was unambiguous. Although neither party argued that the certificate was ambiguous, ambiguity is an issue of law for the courts (Greenfield, 98 NY2d at 569). Factory Mutual opposed the reinsurers\u2019 motion for summary judgment with extrinsic evidence of industry custom and practice, and thereby created a question of fact concerning the parties\u2019 intent <em>(Mallad Constr. Corp. v County Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn., </em>32 NY2d 285, 290-293 [1973]). Our precedent establishes that where there is ambiguity in a reinsurance certificate, the surrounding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>circumstances, including industry custom and practice, should be taken into consideration <em>(see London Assur.

The courts below did not determine whether or not this was the case here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b652-9\">. Indeed, the history of this case betokens ambiguity: five courts have now interpreted the certificate with varying results. Supreme Court and the Rhode Island Superior Court concluded that the certificate does not contain a cap and therefore the limit is cost-exclusive <em>(see Factory Mut. Ins. Co. v Excess Ins. Co., </em>Super Ct, Providence, RI, May 22, 2001, Hurst, J., PC 00-0760 [litigation enjoined 285 AD2d 351 (1st Dept 2001)]; <em>Excess Ins. Co. v Factory Mut. Ins. Co., </em>Sup Ct, NY County, Aug. 22, 2002, Moskowitz, J., Index No. 605759/ 99). The majority now joins the Appellate Division and the United States District Court for the Southern District, which found that the limit is cost-inclusive <em>(see 2 </em>AD3d 150 [1st Dept 2003]; <em>Allendale Mut. Ins. Co. v Excess Ins. Co.

The clause provided that \u201cthe liability of the Reinsurer . . . shall follow that of [Aetna]\u201d (903 F2d at 911). These clauses are generally construed to mean that \u201cthe reinsurer follows the insurer\u2019s fortunes under the latter\u2019s insurance policies, subject to the stated exclusions and limitations in the reinsurance agreement . . . Without such a concept\u2014and on occasion even with it\u2014the reinsurer could successfully assert a defense to a claim under the reinsurance agreement, that was not asserted by the insurer with respect to the insurance claim, leaving the insurer with an unidentified liability\u201d (Staring, Reinsurance \u00a7 18:1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b654-8\">. Our decision in <em>Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s of London </em>(96 NY2d 583 [2001]) is not to the contrary. There, we were asked whether a \u201cfollow the fortunes\u201d clause negated an insurer\u2019s obligation to apply the allocation methodology contained in the reinsurance policy. In rejecting this argument, we agreed with the \u201crationale\u201d of the Second Circuit that the follow the fortunes doctrine \u201cdoes not alter the terms or override the language of reinsurance policies\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 596). Thus, <em>Travelers </em>supports the proposition that each reinsurance policy must be interpreted according to its own terms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b655-6\">. On reargument, however, the <em>Allendale </em>court acknowledged that \u201c[i]n a purely semantic sense, the Reinsurance Agreement is ambiguous\u201d (992 F Supp at 276). Nonetheless, the judge concluded that the certificate was only reasonably interpreted to be cost-inclusive. The <em>Allendale </em>court (like the majority) seemed concerned that a reinsurer would otherwise accept open-ended liability for costs (992 F Supp at 276 n 4), and thus appears to have \u201calter[ed] the contract to reflect its personal notions of fairness and equity\u201d <em>(Greenfield v Philles Records, </em>98 NY2d 562, 570 [2002]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b655-7\">. Other courts have regarded <em>Bellefonte </em>and <em>Unigard </em>skeptically. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v Philadelphia Reins. Corp. </em>(1995 WL 217631, 1995 US Dist LEXIS 4806 [ED Pa, Apr. 13, 1995]) followed <em>Bellefonte, </em>but only because Aetna was a party in <em>Bellefonte </em>and therefore was collaterally estopped from relitigating the issue. The court in <em>Philadelphia Reinsurance </em>preferred the analysis used in <em>Penn Re, Inc. v Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>(1987 WL 909519, 1987 US Dist LEXIS 15252 [ED NC, June 30, 1987]). There, the court (deciding the issue prior to <em>Bellefonte) </em>interpreted a reinsurance policy containing a \u201csubject to\u201d provision and found that the reinsurer was liable for costs in addition to the limit of the policy. <em>Bellefonte </em>rejected the analysis of <em>Penn Re. </em>In <em>North Riv. Ins. Co. v CIGNA Reins. Co. </em>(52 F3d 1194 [3d Cir 1995]), the court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>faced with a <em>Bellefonte </em>question, which it avoided by holding that whether the certificate placed a cap on the policy was not timely raised. In <em>TIG Premier Ins. Co. v Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. </em>(35 F Supp 2d 348, 350 [SD NY 1999]), the court sidestepped <em>Bellefonte </em>by applying California law, which allows use of extrinsic evidence to reveal a \u201clatent ambiguity\u201d in a contract that \u201cappears unambiguous on its face.\u201d Accordingly, the court reviewed extrinsic evidence showing that reinsurers commonly pay expenses in addition to limits. Finding a genuine issue of fact, the court denied the motion for summary judgment. In addition, arbitrators have apparently declined to follow <em>Bellefonte, </em>at least in some cases <em>{see </em>Monin and Brady, <em>Reinsurance Disputes: Death of the Handshake, </em>61 Def Couns J 529, 538 n 22 [Oct. 1994]; Monin and Brady, <em>Updating Reinsurance Law Developments: The Gloves are Beginning to Come Off, </em>63 Def Couns J 219, 223 [Apr. 1996]; <em>see also </em>Wilker and Lenci, <em>Much Ado About Nothing: A Response Regarding Bellefonte\u2019s Reach, </em>9-10 Mealey\u2019s Litig Rep Reinsurance 16 [1998] [stating that \u201carbitration panels, even those sitting in the Second Circuit, are free to ignore <em>Bellefonte, Unigard, </em>and <em>Allendale\u2019\u2019 </em>and suggesting that \u201cmost properly constituted arbitration panels will not follow those decisions or any generalized <em>Bellefonte </em>rule unless it is shown that it was clearly the cedent\u2019s and reinsurer\u2019s intention not to cover expenses in addition to the liability limit of the certificate in question\u201d]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b657-8\">. \u201cReinsurance, like any other contract, depends upon the intention of the parties, to be gathered from the words used, taking into account, when the meaning is doubtful, the surrounding circumstances.
