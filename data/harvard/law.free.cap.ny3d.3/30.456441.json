The challenged counts are based on defendants\u2019 filing of allegedly false New York State and City tax returns, which did not reflect certain interest income derived from the mortgages held by IMSC on Ocean House.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">Inasmuch as the evidence before the grand jury did not establish that defendants\u2019 tax returns were either mailed from or received in Manhattan, or that defendants committed any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>act in Manhattan establishing an element of the relevant offenses <em>(see </em>CPL 20.40 [1] [a]), the People relied on a theory of \u201cparticular effect\u201d jurisdiction in order to establish venue in New York County with respect to these counts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This theory permits a criminal court of a particular county to exercise geographical jurisdiction, or venue, over an offense when\u2014even though none of the conduct constituting the offense occurred within that county\u2014\u201c[s]uch conduct had, or was likely to have, a particular effect upon such county or a political subdivision or part thereof, and was performed with intent that it would, or with knowledge that it was likely to, have such particular effect therein\u201d (CPL 20.40 [2] [c]). Conduct constituting an offense has a \u201cparticular effect\u201d upon a county when it \u201cproduces consequences which, though not necessarily amounting to a result or element of such offense, have a materially harmful impact upon the governmental processes or community welfare of [the] particular [county], or result in the defrauding of persons in such [county]\u201d (CPL 20.10 [4]).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">After Supreme Court denied their motion to dismiss the five tax-related counts, made on the ground that jurisdiction did not lie in New York County, defendants brought this CPLR article 78 proceeding, seeking a writ of prohibition to enjoin prosecution of those counts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Appellate Division denied the petition, concluding that defendants\u2019 filing of the allegedly false New York City tax returns had a particular effect on New York County. We disagree, and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">At the outset, we emphasize that, in order for prosecutorial jurisdiction to lie in New York County, it is that county\u2014and not the City generally\u2014that must suffer a particular effect as a result of defendants\u2019 alleged conduct. The statutory requirement that the conduct have a materially harmful impact may thus be satisfied only by a \u201cconcrete and identifiable injury\u201d <em>(Steingut, </em>42 NY2d at 318) to either the county\u2019s governmental processes (that is, the executive, legislative or judicial branch of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>government) or the welfare of the county\u2019s community. Moreover, to be materially harmful, the impact must be more than minor or incidental, and the conduct must harm \u201cthe well being of the community as a whole,\u201d not merely a particular individual (<em>Fea, </em>47 NY2d at 77). In addition, because the jurisdiction of the county seeking to prosecute must be established before the grand jury, the type of injury or offense contemplated by the particular effect statute must \u201cbe perceptible and of the character and type which can be demonstrated by proof before a Grand Jury\u201d <em>(Steingut, </em>42 NY2d at 317). Because particular effect jurisdiction is to be applied only in \u201climited circumstances\u201d <em>(Fea, </em>47 NY2d at 76), it has been rarely invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">[I] There is no dispute that defendants\u2019 conduct, if true, had a materially harmful impact on the governmental processes or community welfare of New York City as a whole. By underreporting income on their New York City tax returns, defendants deprived the City of revenue that would otherwise have been available to meet its financial obligations and fund its governmental operations. Such a loss of revenue, which could lead to cuts in city services or increases in taxes, clearly constitutes a perceptible injury to the City of New York. The question presented, however, is whether the evidence before the grand jury establishes a concrete and identifiable injury suffered specifically by New York <em>County. </em>We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The People\u2019s theory of venue is based on New York County\u2019s status as the \u201cseat of City government,\u201d and the resultant processing of city income tax revenue in that county. Under this theory, defendants\u2019 alleged tax evasion has a particular effect on New York County because New York City taxes are processed and remitted to the City through the Transitional Finance Authority, which is located in New York County,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and through city bank accounts also located there. Further, these accounts are controlled by the New York City Commissioner of Finance, whose office is located in New York County, as is the Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>ment of Finance\u2019s Bureau of Treasury, which oversees the collection and management of the City\u2019s tax revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">We conclude, however, that\u2014in a prosecution whose gravamen is the deprivation of revenue from New York City\u2014the location of city agencies and bank accounts is alone insufficient to establish a particular effect on the county in which they happen to be located.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">In <em>Steingut, </em>the defendants were indicted for corrupt use of position or authority <em>(see </em>former Election Law \u00a7 448 [1], [3]), based on a meeting held in Manhattan at which defendants allegedly conspired to corrupt an election to be held in Kings County for city councilmember-at-large. Although Kings County was in some measure affected by this criminal conduct, we held that the mere fact that the allegedly tainted election was to take place in Brooklyn was insufficient to establish particular effect jurisdiction in Kings County. As is readily apparent, the conspiracy to corrupt the election in <em>Steingut </em>bore a closer relationship to Kings County, where the election was to take place, than the false filing here bears to New York County.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">As we explained in <em>Steingut, </em>\u201cIf the injured forum jurisdictional statute were to be triggered by the amorphous fact that the voters of the county would be called upon to vote in an election allegedly tainted by criminal activity localized in a single county, then if the election was one for a State-wide office <em>any </em>county within the State would be able to assert jurisdiction to indict and prosecute. This is clearly not the intent of the statute\u201d (42 NY2d at 317).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">The same concerns exist in the case before us, where the facts proffered to establish particular effect are even more amorphous than those held insufficient in <em>Steingut. </em>Permitting New York County to exercise particular effect jurisdiction over an alleged underreporting of income on tax returns based solely on the \u201cprocessing\u201d of New York City tax revenues in Manhattan would effectively grant the New York County District Attorney jurisdiction throughout New York City to prosecute any income tax or other offense that arguably affects city revenue or expenditures.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Such jurisdiction would include prosecution of a Bronx toll taker who embezzles funds, or of a person who steals from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>city agency in Kings County or vandalizes city property in Queens or Richmond.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Moreover, under the People\u2019s theory, the Albany County District Attorney could prosecute any similar crime against the State, no matter where it occurred, including, for example, a Buffalo resident who steals from the till at a local Department of Motor Vehicles office or a driver who evades a toll on Long Island. These scenarios would constitute a vast expansion of the \u201climited circumstances\u201d in which protective jurisdiction is to be applied <em>(Fea, </em>47 NY2d at 76).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Rather, such \u201climited circumstances\u201d have typically involved situations in which the injury to the prosecuting county is more particular and readily identifiable. If, for example, a person commits criminal mischief by maliciously blowing up a dam in Putnam County near the Westchester County line, thus flooding some Westchester territory\u2014a result the individual either intends or knows is likely to occur\u2014jurisdiction of the crime will properly lie in Westchester as well as in Putnam <em>(see Stein-gut, </em>42 NY2d at 317; Preiser, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 11A, CPL 20.40, at 133).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Other examples of perceptible, materially harmful impacts on counties where the offensive conduct has not occurred include the failure of a temporarily released prisoner to return to the county of confinement <em>(see People v Scannelli, </em>49 AD2d 648 [3d Dept 1975]); the violation of an order of protection issued in a particular county, even if the conduct violating the order occurred elsewhere <em>(see People v Ortega, </em>152 Misc 2d 84 [Grim Ct, NY County 1991]); or \u201can attempt in county <em>B </em>to bribe an executive officer of county <em>A </em>to effectuate a decision favorable to the offeror\u2019s interests in county B,\u201d because such an attempt, if accomplished, \u201cwould have a perceptible detrimental impact upon the governmental integrity of county A\u201d <em>(Fea, </em>47 NY2d at 77).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">In general, then, particular effect jurisdiction will be sustained when, for example, a defendant\u2019s out-of-county conduct has interfered with the county\u2019s courts or administration of justice; has exposed a large number of county residents to a specific harm; has caused a physical intrusion upon the county; or has involved the theft of funds from the county itself. But where, as here, the only nexus between the prosecuting county and the harmed political subdivision is the location of offices and ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>counts of the subdivision within the county, the statutory requirements have not been satisfied and the asserted impact is \u201camorphous at best\u201d <em>(Fea, </em>47 NY2d at 77).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Indeed, the People\u2019s theory would permit the type of broad geographical jurisdiction specifically rejected when the statute was enacted. The statutory definition of \u201cparticular effect\u201d was added to the original bill after \u201cDistrict Attorneys complained that the proposed statute gave all counties jurisdiction of all crimes and they gave, as an example, that under it any robbery or burglary of a bank in one county would cause an effect on depositors in many counties and the crime would be committed with intent and knowledge that it would have such effect\u201d <em>(Matter of Steingut v Gold, </em>54 AD2d 481, 487 [2d Dept 1976], <em>affd </em>42 NY2d 311 [1977]). Plainly, CPL 20.40 (2) (c) requires a harm <em>to </em>the prosecuting county, not a harm felt by a city-wide governmental agency that happens to have an office <em>in </em>the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">That the instant prosecution arises from a violation of Penal Law \u00a7 175.35 does not change this result. True, we explained in <em>Fea </em>that \u201c[extraterritorial jurisdiction is to be applied only in those limited circumstances where the out-of-jurisdiction conduct is violative of a statute intended to protect the integrity of the governmental processes or is harmful to the community as a whole\u201d (47 NY2d at 76-77 [citations omitted]). And Penal Law \u00a7 175.35 provides that \u201c[a] person is guilty of offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree when, knowing that a written instrument contains a false statement or false information, and with intent to defraud the state or any political subdivision, public authority or public benefit corporation of the state, he [or she] offers or presents it to a public office, public servant, public authority or public benefit corporation with the knowledge or belief that it will be filed with, registered or recorded in or otherwise become a part of the records of such public office, public servant, public authority or public benefit corporation.\u201d Clearly, inasmuch as it criminalizes frauds perpetrated on the State or its political subdivisions, this statute is intended to protect the integrity of governmental processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">But that truism neither answers the question nor alters the analysis with respect to which political subdivision is defrauded or affected. While it is beyond dispute that defendants\u2019 alleged conduct materially harmed the government of New York City, nothing in <em>Fea, </em>or in Penal Law \u00a7 175.35, abolishes the mandate of CPL 20.40 (2) (c) and 20.10 (4) that the particular effect in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>this case be not on the governmental processes of New York City as a whole, but on those of New York County. The evidence proffered here is insufficient to establish that the harm suffered by the City was in any meaningful way peculiar to New York County. The People have identified no New York County government agency, employee or process that is connected in any way to New York City income tax collection, nor have they identified any particular harm to the welfare of New York County or its residents. Rather, all five boroughs and their residents and governments were equally affected by the City\u2019s loss of funds and the resultant risk of service cuts or tax increases, and the ministerial act of processing tax revenue cannot alone create a jurisdictional nexus.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Nor is the evidence here sufficient to establish the second statutory requirement for injured forum jurisdiction\u2014that the conduct was performed with intent that it would, or with knowledge that it was likely to, have a particular effect in New York County. We disagree with the Appellate Division that it would have been reasonable for the grand jury to presume that defendants, who neither executed the subject tax returns in New York County nor mailed them there, had knowledge or intent that their Queens County scheme to defraud was likely to have a particular harmful effect on New York County (as opposed to New York City), or, specifically, that their false tax returns were likely to be processed in New York County offices and banks. Most citizens would have no awareness of this circumstance, or of where the City banks. Rather, defendants likely filed their tax returns only with the knowledge and intent that material harm would befall the City or the State in general by their failure to remit the taxes owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">We note that New York City is unique among municipalities of the State in that it is larger than any of the counties it comprises. Elsewhere, cities, towns and villages exist wholly within single counties, which have jurisdiction under the statute to prosecute crimes having a particular effect on any municipality contained within them. Of course, historically and constitutionally, counties prosecute, not cities <em>(see </em>NY Const, art XIII, \u00a7 13; <em>see also </em>County Law \u00a7 700). The People assert that this unique situation creates an anomaly whereby the City may be deprived of its ability to prosecute within its borders certain crimes, of which it is undeniably the victim, involving depletion of its coffers.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">That fear is unwarranted. First, particular effect jurisdiction is an alternative ground for venue that is generally invoked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>only when jurisdiction does not he on some other basis\u2014such as the far more common scenario in which evidence exists that conduct establishing an element of the offense has occurred within one (or more) of the five counties of the City <em>(see </em>CPL 20.40 [1] [a]). In that event, which would certainly include all larcenies by physical taking of, and all damage to, city property, the county or counties where the conduct occurred would have jurisdiction to prosecute. Second, even in cases involving false filing of income tax returns, in which city taxes\u2014like state taxes\u2014will have been mailed to Albany,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> jurisdiction will lie in any county where the defendant executed or mailed the return. In any event, whether New York City\u2019s situation is unique or anomalous, any perceived gap must be filled by the Legislature. We hold only that, under CPL 20.40 (2) (c), New York County may not assert jurisdiction over all crimes affecting the City on the sole basis that certain city agencies transact their business in offices located in Manhattan. Of course, nothing in our decision today prevents defendants from being prosecuted for their alleged false filings in any county\u2014including another county within New York City\u2014in which venue properly lies <em>(see </em>CPL 40.30; <em>Steingut, </em>54 AD2d at 485 n 4).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Finally, we reject defendants\u2019 contention that the indictment was facially insufficient for failure to specify the particular effect charged.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is true that in <em>Steingut, </em>this Court noted that \u201cthe nebulous nature of the impact claimed by the prosecutor . . . [was] best illustrated by the fact that the indictment itself [did] not even allege the effect which the purported crime would have on Kings County. Rather in the most conclusory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>fashion, the indictment simply state[d] \u2018the defendants\u2019 conduct had and was likely to have a particular effect on Kings County\u2019 \u201d (42 NY2d at 318). The Court concluded that \u201c[c]ertainly the invoking of the extraordinary injured forum jurisdictional statute requires the specification of a more concrete and identifiable injury\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Nevertheless, although the indictment here, too, merely asserted without specificity that the charged conduct \u201chad and was likely to have a particular effect upon the County of New York, and was performed with intent that it would and with knowledge that it was likely to have such a particular effect herein,\u201d the bill of particulars provided by the People set forth in detail both the prosecution\u2019s theory of venue and specific facts in support of their contention (which we reject) that there had been a particular effect on New York County. We thus agree with the Appellate Division that the bill of particulars, in combination with the indictment, sufficiently put defendants on notice of the accusations against them and enabled them to prepare a defense <em>(see People v Iannone, </em>45 NY2d 589, 597-598 [1978]; <em>People v Grega, </em>72 NY2d 489, 498 [1988]; <em>People v Fitzgerald, </em>45 NY2d 574, 579-580 [1978]).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Appellate Division should be reversed, without costs, the petition granted, and respondents prohibited from continuing with the prosecution of counts 26 through 30 of the subject New York County indictment.</p>\n<author id=\"b106-6\">Read, J.

City taxpayers file their city and state tax returns with the State Commissioner of Taxation and Finance in Albany (see Tax Law \u00a7\u00a7 1312, 652 [a]; 20 NYCRR 152.12). The funds are then remitted to the State Comptroller, also in Albany, who forwards the New York City personal income tax portion of that revenue to the Bond Trustee of the New York City Transitional Finance Authority (TFA), a state public benefit corporation (see Public Authorities Law \u00a7 2799-aa <em>et seq.), </em>who eventually remits any remaining funds not used to pay TFA\u2019s bond obligations and operating expenses to the New York City Commissioner of Finance (see Tax Law \u00a7 1313).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b101-10\">.

Significantly, the majority acknowledges that \u201c[c]learly,\u201d petitioners violated a \u201cstatute [Penal Law \u00a7 175.35] . . . intended to protect the integrity of governmental processes\u201d (majority op at 37). The majority concludes, however, that the necessary \u201cparticular effect\u201d is lacking here because it is not enough that New York County is the seat of New York City government (majority op at 35, 39). It is hard to imagine, though, that the Legislature intended to preclude the county in which city government is situated from prosecuting city tax cheats. Surely, evading city taxes affects the \u201cgovernmental processes or community welfare\u201d of New York County as contemplated by CPL 20.40 (2) (c). Nor can it be said that petitioners (especially petitioner Taub, who had practiced as a tax attorney) should be surprised to face prosecution in New York County. Put differently, by allegedly evading city taxes, he would have had \u201cknowledge that [his tax evasion] was likely to . . . have [a] particular effect\u201d (CPL 20.40 [2] [c]) in the county where his city taxes were required to meet the City\u2019s financial obligations and to operate city government; namely, New York County.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Further, the quantifiable revenue loss here is precisely the type of \u201cconcrete and identifiable injury\u201d required in <em>Matter of Steingut v Gold </em>(42 NY2d 311, 318 [1977]). During a meeting in New York County, a public official offered to use his official position to benefit a corrupt businessman in exchange for the latter\u2019s promise to hold a fundraising event for a campaign occurring in Kings County <em>(see id. </em>at 313-314). We found venue lacking in Kings County because there was absolutely no evidence that the election had been tainted. That is, the gravamen of the crime charged in <em>Steingut </em>was really the quid pro quo, which occurred entirely in Manhattan, and could just as easily have been a promise by the businessman to give the public official tickets to a sporting event, rather than an offer to hold the fundraiser. Here, by contrast, the People adduced evidence before the grand jury of the exact amount of city taxes allegedly evaded by petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\"><em>Fea </em>is likewise distinguishable from this case. In <em>Fea, </em>the People failed to adduce evidence that the defendant\u2019s conduct had any actual impact on the county (Bronx) asserting venue: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>the defendant loanshark beat a delinquent debtor in Rockland County to assure resumption of payments in Bronx County <em>(see People v </em>Fea, 47 NY2d at 73-74). Moreover, the defendant had not been charged with violating a statute designed to protect governmental processes <em>(see id. </em>at 76-77).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">The main stumbling block for the majority appears to be that revenue loss from city tax evasion affects all of the City\u2019s counties (majority op at 38). But we have never before required a particular effect to be a unique effect <em>(see Steingut, </em>42 NY2d at 317). Moreover, while the majority may consider it undesirable for multiple counties to have jurisdiction over a single offense, the Legislature clearly contemplated that eventuality. As the Commission Staff Notes observe, \u201c[i]n general, . . . multiple county jurisdiction is bestowed more liberally than state jurisdiction\u201d (Commission Staff Notes, reprinted following CPL 20.40 in NY Cons Laws Serv, Book 7, at 109).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">In addition, the potential for prosecution in multiple jurisdictions does not prejudice a defendant. We have recognized, for example, that under the jury trial guarantee of article I, \u00a7 2 of the State Constitution, a criminal defendant has the right \u201cto be tried in the county where the crime was committed <em>unless </em>the Legislature has provided otherwise\u201d <em>(People v Ribowsky, </em>77 NY2d 284, 291 [1991] [emphasis added]). Furthermore, a defendant who faces potential prosecution by multiple counties will, in fact, be prosecuted only once: constitutional protections against double jeopardy, as well as the even more protective statutory bars against multiple prosecutions <em>(see </em>CPL art 40), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>safeguard a defendant against multiple prosecutions for the same offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The majority worries that allowing venue here might inspire the New York County District Attorney to assert jurisdiction over cases where, for example, a toll collector embezzles in the Bronx; or a person steals from a city agency in Kings County or vandalizes city property in Queens or Richmond Counties. Perhaps, the majority suggests, the Albany County District Attorney might be tempted to assert jurisdiction over similar cases of theft or vandalism that diminish state revenues or cause state expenditures (majority op at 35-36). Assuming these District Attorneys would desire to expend limited resources on the prosecutions hypothesized by the majority, the statutes at issue here would preclude them from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The majority\u2019s hypothetical examples are crimes that, like tax evasion, are committed against a government and adversely affect government revenues. Unlike offering a false instrument for filing, however, these crimes are not \u201cviolative of a statute intended to protect the integrity of the governmental processes\u201d <em>(People v Fea, </em>47 NY2d at 76-77). On the contrary, the majority\u2019s hypothetical examples are garden-variety larcenies or criminal mischief. Such thefts and vandalism do not fall within the category of crimes susceptible to extraterritorial jurisdiction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Further, the majority\u2019s hypothetical examples are readily prosecuted in the county where the defendant committed the crime. After all, the geographic location of vandalism or a theft is obvious. Accordingly, venue for the majority\u2019s examples would lie in the county of occurrence under CPL 20.40 (1) (a), which provides venue over an offense when a defendant\u2019s \u201c[c]onduct . . . within such county [is] sufficient to establish . . . [a]n element of such offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Under the majority\u2019s reading of the injured forum statutes, however, it has become immeasurably more difficult, if not impossible, to prosecute the evasion of city taxes (except city sales taxes)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> within the City of New York. Venue will still lie within the county in which the false filing was either executed or mailed (majority op at 39). As this case illustrates, however, it is not always easy to determine years after the fact where a defendant executed or mailed a false tax return. Indeed, according to the People, \u201can attempt to ground venue in any county on the basis of execution or mailing would be an exercise in futility\u2014even under the \u2018preponderance of the evidence\u2019 standard applicable to issues of county venue.\u201d For example, in this case \u201cthere was no direct evidence establishing where [petitioner] Taub was when he signed and mailed the returns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The majority has therefore effectively designated the county where the false instrument was filed as the sole certain venue for prosecuting evaders of New York City income taxes <em>(see Matter of Sharpton v Turner, </em>169 AD2d 947, 950 [3d Dept 1991]).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, which administers the New York City resident income tax, requires a taxpayer to file a combined state and city resident income tax return <em>(see </em>Tax Law \u00a7 1312 [c]; 20 NYCRR 292.1). The Department has directed taxpayers to file these combined returns at an address in Albany County if using the United States Postal Service, or at an address in Ulster County if using <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>a private delivery service (see www.nystax.gov [IT-100-I (Instructions), at 6]).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">In short, city income tax cheats may be prosecuted in a county where city tax collection functions have been centralized for reasons of administrative and taxpayer convenience; they may not be prosecuted in New York County, which is the seat of city government, even though a shortfall in city revenues adversely affects the city government\u2019s ability to meet its financial obligations and deliver city services. In our view, a fair reading of the injured forum statutes would avoid this anomalous result. Accordingly, we respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that venue does not lie here, and would affirm the judgment of the Appellate Division denying petitioners\u2019 request for prohibition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Judges G.B. Smith, Ciparick, Rosenblatt and R.S. Smith concur with Chief Judge Kaye; Judge Read dissents and votes to affirm in a separate opinion in which Judge Graffeo concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Judgment reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-6\">. The majority points out that District Attorneys initially complained that multicounty jurisdiction would apply too broadly, with every county potentially having jurisdiction over bank robberies or burglaries, for example, no matter where committed (majority op at 37). Admittedly, the Commission Staff Notes preceded those complaints. Yet, the injured forum provision was revised, not jettisoned. Further, the revisions designed to address the District Attorneys\u2019 comments\u2014especially, defining \u201cparticular effect\u201d to necessitate an impact on \u201cgovernmental processes\u201d\u2014argue for venue here. Nor are the District Attorneys of the other four counties within New York City likely troubled by New York County\u2019s exercise of venue over this tax evasion case <em>(see </em>Wise, <em>Funds Recovered in Tax Cases Soften Blows to </em>DAs\u2019 <em>Budgets, </em>NYLJ, May 10, 2004, at 1, cols <em>4, 5, </em>at 7, col 1 [describing program to offset budget cuts to the five District Attorneys\u2019 offices by allowing them to \u201ckeep part of the taxes recovered through criminal prosecutions\u201d of \u201ctax cheats and others who commit financial crimes\u201d; and noting that the New York County District Attorney\u2019s office \u201cagreed to make ... its recoveries available to other counties,\u201d which allowed the other four District Attorneys\u2014via a transfer of almost $14,000,000 from New York County\u2014to recover current year budget cuts]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b109-7\"><em>. </em>Petitioners\u2019 litigation strategy undercuts any argument that multiple-county jurisdiction works to a criminal defendant\u2019s detriment. The net effect of obtaining prohibition here is that petitioners have willingly exposed themselves to prosecution in multiple counties. Specifically, New York County will continue prosecuting the 29 remaining counts of the indictment, and petitioners now face (as they conceded at oral argument) the prospect of prosecution elsewhere on the five tax-related counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b109-8\">. The crime charged against petitioners\u2014offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree\u2014occurs when a person \u201cknowing that a written instrument contains a false statement or false information, and with intent to defraud the state or any political subdivision, public authority or public benefit corporation of the state, . . . offers or presents it to a public office, public servant, public authority or public benefit corporation with the knowledge or belief that it will be filed with, registered or recorded in or otherwise become a part of the records of such public office, public servant, public authority or public benefit corporation\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 175.35). As the majority acknowledges, this statute is \u201cintended to protect the integrity of governmental processes,\u201d as called for in <em>Fea </em>to support extraterritorial jurisdiction (see <em>Fea, </em>47 NY2d at 77; majority op at 37). In stark contrast, \u201c[a] person steals property and commits larceny when, with intent to deprive another of property or to appropriate the same to himself or to a third person, he wrongfully takes, obtains or withholds such property from an owner thereof\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 155.05 [1]). Criminal mischief of any degree is similarly bereft of any lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>guage protecting governmental processes, and simply calls for an \u201cintent to damage property of another person\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 145.05).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b110-9\">. Interestingly, the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, which administers the New York City sales and use tax, has designated a location in New York County as the mailing address for filing all New York State and Local Quarterly Sales and Use Taxes Returns (see www.nystax.gov [Form ST-100]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b110-10\">. The majority has also encouraged New Yorkers to execute and mail their tax returns from out of state in order to minimize their exposure to prosecution for tax evasion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b111-7\">. The majority emphasizes that petitioners still face numerous other charges, some of which carry stiffer penalties than the tax-related counts at issue here (majority op at 32). This strikes us as irrelevant. The People should be allowed to pursue the full case against petitioners. This is surely what was intended by the Commission for Quality of Care, which brought these matters to the New York County District Attorney\u2019s attention, and the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, which recommended that the New York County District Attorney commence a grand jury investigation into petitioners\u2019 possible tax crimes and false filings. Further, petitioners might face consecutive sentencing if convicted for falsely reporting income on separate years\u2019 returns.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
