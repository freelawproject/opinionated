IV There is no compelling policy reason for vacating a jury\u2019s award of punitive damages against a defendant, such as Carvel Corporation, whom a jury has found independently liable, in tort, for willfully violating an independent societally-imposed duty because of the happenstance that, under the circumstances, defendant\u2019s intentionally tortious conduct also violated a privately-imposed contractual duty between the parties. <em>(Giblin v Murphy, </em>73 NY2d 769; <em>Rocanova v Equitable Life Assur.

Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Several franchisees of Carvel Corporation sued it in federal court, complaining of the distribution of Carvel\u2019s products through supermarkets that competed with the franchisees. Juries awarded damages to three of the franchisees on tort and contract claims, and Carvel appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. That court has certified to us the question of whether the franchisees have a valid tort claim for \u201cinterference with prospective economic relations.\u201d We hold that they do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Until the early 1990\u2019s, Carvel ice cream was distributed only through franchised stores, and Carvel had repeatedly told its franchisees it had no plans to sell through supermarkets. A decline in Carvel\u2019s fortunes caused it to change its mind, however, and Carvel adopted a \u201csupermarket program.\u201d The program called for sales to supermarkets by Carvel itself and by those franchisees that chose to participate in the program\u2014 which required franchisees to pay substantial license fees and to upgrade their stores. Most franchisees chose not to participate. From 1993 to 2000, the supermarket program grew rapidly, while many franchised stores went out of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">The franchisees assert that Carvel\u2019s supermarket program was harmful to them in itself, and that the details of the program\u2019s implementation made things worse. Among their grievances are that Carvel sold to supermarkets at bargain prices; that it issued coupons to customers that Carvel would redeem from supermarkets but not from franchisees; and that those coupons were printed on bags that Carvel required franchisees to use in their stores. They contend that, as their expert witness testified, Carvel\u2019s supermarket program was not \u201cconsistent with the customary practices and standards in the franchise industry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>The franchisees\u2019 claims, both in contract and. tort, are illuminated by their written agreements with Carvel. Those agreements were of two types. The earlier agreements, known as \u201cType A,\u201d included a specific restriction on Carvel\u2019s rights to compete with its franchisees, providing that Carvel \u201cwill not establish or license another person to establish a Carvel Store\u201d within a quarter mile of the franchisee\u2019s store on the same street. The Type A agreements contained other language, including a reference to \u201ca unique system for the production, distribution and merchandising of Carvel products,\u201d that the franchisees interpret as prohibiting Carvel from implementing its supermarket program.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The later, \u201cType B,\u201d agreements also contained the \u201cunique system\u201d language, but not the quarter-mile restriction. They provided that the license granted to the franchisee was \u201cnonexclusive,\u201d and that Carvel \u201cin its sole and absolute discretion\u201d could license other Carvel stores and could sell its products \u201cthrough the same or different delivery systems or other distribution channels.\u201d The franchisees who signed Type B agreements had all received, before they signed the agreements, an offering circular saying that Carvel was free to sell through \u2018 \u2018supermarkets. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Of the three franchisees whose cases are now before us, two, Marsella and the Noonans, signed Type A agreements; the third, Giampapa, signed Type B. Each agreement contains a New York choice of law clause, and it is not disputed that New York law governs both the contract and tort claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">The two franchisees who signed Type A agreements were allowed to go to juries on claims that Carvel \u201cbreached its franchise agreement\u201d with them. One of them, the Noonans, got a favorable verdict on that claim. All three of the franchisees went to juries on claims that Carvel \u201cbreached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing\u201d and \u201ctortiously interfered with the [franchisee\u2019s] existing or prospective business relations,\u201d and all three got favorable verdicts on those two claims. Only the verdicts for tortious interference with business relations are now our concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">The Certified Questions</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">The Second Circuit Court of Appeals certified the following two questions to us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-10\">1. \u201cUnder applicable standards for a claim of tor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>tious interference with prospective economic relations, did the evidence of the franchisor\u2019s conduct in each of the three trials on review in these consolidated appeals permit a jury finding in favor of the franchisee?\u201d (350 F3d 6, 23 [2003].)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-4\">2. \u201cIs public harm required for a punitive damages claim by a franchisee against its franchisor for tortious interference with the franchisee\u2019s prospective economic relations with its customers?\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 26.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">We answer the first question \u201cno.\u201d This answer renders the second question academic.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The franchisees\u2019 tort claim is that Carvel unlawfully interfered with the relationships between the franchisees and their customers. The franchisees do not claim that the customers had binding contracts that Carvel induced them to breach; they allege only that, by implementing its supermarket program, Carvel induced the customers not to buy Carvel products from the franchisees. The juries have found that Carvel did so induce customers, and the question for us is whether that inducement was tortious interference under New York law. We conclude that it was not because Carvel\u2019s conduct, which did not constitute a crime or an independent tort and was not aimed solely at harming franchisees, was also not the sort of egregious wrongdoing that might support a tortious interference claim in the absence of such an independently unlawful act or evil motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">We have recognized that inducing breach of a binding agreement and interfering with a nonbinding \u201ceconomic relation\u201d can both be torts, but that the elements of the two torts are not the same. Our leading cases, as the Second Circuit Court of Appeals noted, are <em>Guard-Life Corp. v S. Parker Hardware Mfg. Corp. </em>(50 NY2d 183 [1980]) and <em>NET Bancorp Inc. v Fleet/Norstar Fin. Group, Inc. </em>(87 NY2d 614 [1996]). We said in <em>NET, </em>summarizing what we had held in <em>Guard-Life.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-9\">\u201c[T]he degree of protection available to a plaintiff for a competitor\u2019s tortious interference with contract is defined by the nature of the plaintiffs enforceable legal rights. Thus, where there is an existing, enforceable contract and a defendant\u2019s deliberate interference results in a breach of that contract, a plaintiff may recover damages for tortious interfer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>ence with contractual relations even if the defendant was engaged in lawful behavior. Where there has been no breach of an existing contract, but only interference with prospective contract rights, however, plaintiff must show more culpable conduct on the part of the defendant.\u201d (87 NY2d at 621 [citations omitted].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">By saying in <em>NBT </em>that a defendant who induced the breach of a binding contract could be liable \u201ceven if the defendant was engaged in lawful behavior,\u201d we implied that the same was not ordinarily true where the plaintiff complained only of \u201cinterference with prospective contract rights.\u201d This applies equally if not a fortiori, here, where the franchisees complain of interference not with \u201ccontract rights\u201d but only with existing or prospective economic relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Under <em>NBT, </em>where a suit is based on interference with a nonbinding relationship, the plaintiff must show that defendant\u2019s conduct was not \u201clawful\u201d but \u201cmore culpable.\u201d The implication is that, as a general rule, the defendant\u2019s conduct must amount to a crime or an independent tort. Conduct that is not criminal or tortious will generally be \u201clawful\u201d and thus insufficiently \u201cculpable\u201d to create liability for interference with prospective contracts or other nonbinding economic relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Since the franchisees have not shown that Carvel\u2019s conduct was criminal or independently tortious, they cannot recover unless an exception to the general rule is applicable. Such an exception has been recognized where a defendant engages in conduct \u201cfor the sole purpose of inflicting intentional harm on plaintiffs\u201d <em>(NBT Bancorp, Inc. v Fleet/Norstar Fin. Group, Inc., </em>215 AD2d 990, 990 [3d Dept 1995], <em>affd </em>87 NY2d 614 [1996]), but that exception clearly does not apply here. It is undisputed that Carvel\u2019s motive in interfering with the franchisees\u2019 relationships with their customers was normal economic self-interest; Carvel wanted to reverse a period of business declines and make itself more profitable. It was not acting solely to hurt the franchisees; indeed, one of the franchisees\u2019 prize pieces of evidence is a statement by a Carvel executive, in colorful terms, that he was completely indifferent to the franchisees\u2019 fate.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">We did not decide in <em>Guard-Life </em>or <em>NBT, </em>and we do not decide today, whether any other exception to the general rule exists\u2014 whether there can ever be other instances of conduct which, though not a crime or tort in itself, was so \u201cculpable,\u201d to use <em>NBT\u2019s </em>word, that it could be the basis for a claim of tortious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>interference with economic relations. That is a question we leave for another day, because no such egregious conduct was shown here.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">The sort of \u201cmore culpable\u201d conduct we had in mind in <em>NBT </em>was described in <em>Guard-Life, </em>where we referred to a Restatement section dealing with the issue of when a business competitor may recover against another for \u201ctortious interference.\u201d Where no binding contract is interfered with, and there is no \u201cunlawful restraint of trade,\u201d the Restatement provides that the competitor will not be liable so long as \u201cthe means employed are not wrongful.\u201d <em>(Guard-Life, </em>50 NY2d at 191, summarizing Restatement [Second] of Torts \u00a7 768.) Continuing to draw on the Restatement, we added in <em>Guard-Life-.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-5\">\u201c Wrongful means\u2019 include physical violence, fraud or misrepresentation, civil suits and criminal prosecutions, and some degrees of economic pressure; they do not, however, include persuasion alone although it is knowingly directed at interference with the contract ([Restatement (Second) of Torts] \u00a7 768, Comment <em>e; </em>\u00a7 767, Comment c).\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">The Restatement section on which <em>Guard-Life </em>relied refers to actions between business competitors, and the plaintiff and defendant in <em>Guard-Life </em>were competitors in a marketplace. The logic of <em>Guard-Life </em>and <em>NBT </em>does not, however, depend on the parties\u2019 status as competitors. The existence of competition may often be relevant, since it provides an obvious motive for defendant\u2019s interference other than a desire to injure the plaintiff; competition, by definition, interferes with someone else\u2019s economic relations. Where the parties are not competitors, there may be a stronger case that the defendant\u2019s interference with the plaintiffs relationships was motivated by spite. But as long as the defendant is motivated by legitimate economic self-interest, it should not matter if the parties are or are not competitors in the same marketplace. Indeed, in <em>NBT, </em>while we referred to the defendant as the plaintiffs \u201ccompetitor\u201d (87 NY2d at 617), it is not clear from the opinion whether we meant that they were competitors in their everyday business, or only that they were competing for the particular corporate acquisition that gave rise to the lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Thus it is not relevant here whether we characterize Carvel and its franchisees as \u201ccompetitors.\u201d The question, under <em>Guard-Life </em>and <em>NBT, </em>is whether the \u201cmeans\u201d employed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Carvel were \u201cwrongful\u201d or \u201cculpable\u201d as we used those terms in those cases. Most of the items in <em>Guard-Life's </em>catalog of \u201cwrongful means\u201d are acts that would be criminal or independently tortious, and most are obviously absent here: Carvel did not drive the franchisees\u2019 customers away by physical violence, or lure them by fraud or misrepresentation, or harass them with meritless litigation <em>(Guard-Life, </em>50 NY2d at 191).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The franchisees claim that Carvel did use wrongful \u201ceconomic pressure\u201d <em>(id.), </em>but that argument is ill-founded for two independent reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">First, it is ill-founded because the economic pressure that must be shown is not, as the franchisees assume, pressure on the franchisees, but on the franchisees\u2019 customers. As federal courts applying New York law have recognized, conduct constituting tortious interference with business relations is, by definition, conduct directed not at the plaintiff itself, but at the party with which the plaintiff has or seeks to have a relationship. <em>(G.K.A. Beverage Corp. v Honickman, </em>55 F3d 762, 768 [2d Cir 1995] [claim dismissed because alleged conduct was not directed at plaintiff\u2019s customers]; <em>Fonar Corp. v Magnetic Resonance Plus, Inc., </em>957 F Supp 477, 482 [SD NY 1997] [\u201c(U)nder New York law, in order for a party to make out a claim for tortious interference with prospective economic advantage, the defendant must . . . direct some activities towards the third party . . .\u201d]; <em>Piccoli A/S v Calvin Klein Jeanswear Co., </em>19 F Supp 2d 157, 167-168 [SD NY 1998] [claim must fail because \u201cdefendants\u2019 alleged conduct concededly was not directed towards any third party with whom Piccoli had an existing or prospective business relationship\u201d].) While economic pressure brought to bear by one contracting party on the other may, on rare occasions, be tortious <em>(see Albemarle Theatre, Inc. v Bayberry Realty Corp., </em>27 AD2d 172 [1st Dept 1967]; <em>Rich v New York Cent. &amp; Hudson Riv. R.R. Co., </em>87 NY 382 [1882]), it cannot constitute the tort of interference with economic relations. Here, all Carvel did to the franchisees\u2019 customers was to make Carvel goods available in supermarkets at attractive prices; this, in the language of <em>Guard-Life, </em>was not \u201cpressure\u201d on these third parties but legitimate \u201cpersuasion,\u201d and thus tortious interference with economic relations was not established.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The franchisees\u2019 argument is also ill-founded because the Carvel activities they complain of do not amount to the sort of extreme and unfair \u201ceconomic pressure\u201d that might be \u201cwrong<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>ful\u201d under <em>Guard-Life </em>and <em>NBT. </em>The crux of the franchisees\u2019 complaint is that Carvel distributed its products through competitive channels, to an extent and in a way that was inconsistent with the franchisor-franchisee relationship. But the relationship between franchisors and franchisees is a complex one; while cooperative, it does not preclude all competition; and the extent to which competition is allowed should be determined by the contracts between the parties, not by courts or juries seeking after the fact to devise a code of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">The facts of this case illustrate the point. Both the Type A and Type B contracts between Carvel and its franchisees expressly dealt with the question of when competition would be forbidden and when permitted. To the extent that the express words of the contracts failed to prohibit some acts arguably inconsistent with the nature of the relationship, the franchisees could\u2014and did\u2014invoke the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The intervention of tort law to regulate when a franchisor may or may not compete with its franchisees is neither necessary nor useful.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Apart from attacking the supermarket program in general as excessively and destructively competitive, the franchisees also attack the coupon-redemption element of that program as excessive \u201ceconomic pressure.\u201d The essence of the coupon program was to give customers who used coupons a better price when they shopped in supermarkets. This, like any other form of price competition, should be regulated, if at all, by the franchisor-franchisee contract, not by tort law. The mere institution of a coupon program was not \u201ceconomic pressure\u201d rising to the level of \u201cwrongful\u201d or \u201cculpable\u201d conduct in the <em>Guard-Life/NBT </em>sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The franchisees also claim that, by putting coupons on the bags used by the franchisees\u2014and thus compelling them, in effect, to promote products sold in supermarkets in competition with their own\u2014Carvel went beyond legitimate competitive activity. The evidence of this practice, however, is extremely thin. No such evidence was introduced by either Marsella or Giampapa. John Noonan testified that the Noonans \u201chad to\u201d give their customers bags supplied by Carvel, and that an exhibit counsel showed him, a copy of a bag containing a coupon, looked like \u201cthe kind of Carvel bags . . . used in [the Noonans\u2019] Carvel store from time to time.\u201d There was no evidence that the Noonans or any other franchisees complained of having to distribute these bags, or were threatened by Carvel with consequences if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>they did not do so. There is no evidence of how many bags containing coupons were distributed, or what if any economic impact the coupons derived from bags had on any franchisee. At best for the franchisees, the record shows that the Noonans received some indeterminate number of coupon-bearing bags from Carvel \u201cfrom time to time\u201d and gave them to customers. This does not come close to showing the kind of \u201ceconomic pressure\u201d that might support a claim for tortious interference with economic relations\u2014quite apart from the fact that, as explained above, that tort could exist only if the \u201cpressure\u201d were on the customers, not the franchisees.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The franchisees argue that their tort claim is supported by our decision in <em>A.S. Rampell, Inc. v Hyster Co. </em>(3 NY2d 369 [1957]), but <em>Rampell </em>is distinguishable. The defendant in <em>Rampell, </em>a manufacturer, had enticed away not its distributor\u2019s customers, but the distributor\u2019s key employees. The distributor claimed that, because of the \u201crelation of confidence\u201d between it and the manufacturer, the inducement was actionable \u201csince its real purpose was the appropriation by [the manufacturer] of plaintiffs sales organization and good will\u201d (3 NY2d at 375). No similar claim is made here, and our decision upholding the complaint in <em>Rampell </em>does not alter our conclusion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Accordingly, the first certified question should be answered in the negative and the second not answered as academic.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b260-7\">Graffeo, J. (concurring).</author>\n<p id=\"Ayg\">We concur that the first certified question should be answered in the negative because, under the particular facts and circumstances of this case, Carvel\u2019s conduct was not sufficiently improper to support a claim for tortious interference with prospective contractual relations. We write separately, however, because we find that the standard applied by the majority is too restrictive. We would adopt the rule set forth in Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 766B, which provides that improper conduct is the appropriate standard in a tortious interference with prospective contractual relations case involving noncompetitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">The Restatement (Second) of Torts distinguishes between interference by a noncompetitor and interference by a market competitor. Section 766B, applicable to noncompetitors, provides that a defendant \u201cwho intentionally and improperly interferes with another\u2019s prospective contractual relation ... is subject to liability to the other for the pecuniary harm resulting from loss of the benefits of the relation.\u201d In contrast, section 768 (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>states that a \u201ccompetitor\u201d who interferes with another\u2019s prospective contractual relation\u2014where \u201cthe relation concerns a matter involved in the competition between the [parties]\u201d\u2014will be liable for such interference only where the interferer employed wrongful means. Thus, the relevant inquiry under the Restatement in determining the applicable standard is whether the interfering party is a market competitor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">We have previously applied Restatement \u00a7 768\u2019s wrongful conduct test in cases involving competitors. In <em>Guard-Life Corp. v S. Parker Hardware Mfg. Corp. </em>(50 NY2d 183 [1980]), we held that where the injured party and interfering party are \u201cbusiness competitors,\u201d the injured party must establish that the interfering party employed wrongful means to state a claim for tortious interference with prospective contractual relations <em>(id. </em>at 190-191, citing Restatement [Second] of Torts \u00a7 768). In <em>NBT Bancorp Inc. v Fleet/Norstar Fin. Group, Inc. </em>(87 NY2d 614 [1996]), we relied on <em>Guard-Life </em>in affirming the dismissal of a tortious interference claim by a financial institution against a competing bank, holding that the plaintiff produced insufficient evidence that the defendant employed wrongful means.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Here, Carvel was not a \u201ccompetitor\u201d of its franchisees within the meaning of the Restatement. Rather, for the purposes of this claim, Carvel and its franchisees were more akin to economic partners, whose relationship contemplated cooperation, mutual promotion of Carvel products and a joint interest in maintaining consumer loyalty. Clearly, the expectations of these parties, particularly the franchisees, differed from that of commercial competitors with no product commonality. Moreover, to the extent that Carvel was technically \u201ccompeting\u201d with its franchisees for customers, such competition was not true free market competition, since Carvel was in a position of dominance by virtue of its franchisor-franchisee relationship. In this context, we therefore would apply section 766B of the Restatement rather than employ the section 768 wrongful means standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The majority concludes otherwise, holding that where a defendant acts in its own economic self-interest, the standard applicable to a tortious interference claim is whether the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>dant employed \u201cwrongful means\u201d or committed \u201cegregious wrongdoing.\u201d The majority thus posits that \u201cit is not relevant here whether we characterize Carvel and its franchisees as \u2018competitors.\u2019 \u201d (Majority op at 191.) The relevant inquiry under the Restatement, however, is directed to the nature of the parties\u2019 relationship as competitors or noncompetitors. This issue regarding the interfering party\u2019s economic self-interest is not determinative; rather, where the parties are noncompetitors, economic self-interest under the Restatement is but one of the factors\u2014albeit a significant one\u2014to consider in determining whether the interferer acted improperly.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Section 767 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts enumerates a variety of factors to consider when evaluating a claim of improper interference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">\u201c(a) the nature of the actor\u2019s conduct,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">\u201c(b) the actor\u2019s motive,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">\u201c(c) the interests of the other with which the actor\u2019s conduct interferes,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-9\">\u201c(d) the interests sought to be advanced by the actor,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-10\">\u201c(e) the social interests in protecting the freedom of action of the actor and the contractual interests of the other,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-11\">\u201c(f) the proximity or remoteness of the actor\u2019s conduct to the interference and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-12\">\u201c(g) the relations between the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">Additionally, commentary to the Restatement categorizes economic pressure as one type of interference that may constitute improper conduct and specifies the factors to analyze:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-14\">\u201cThe question whether [economic] pressure is proper is answered in the light of the circumstances in which it is exerted, the object sought to be accomplished by the actor, the degree of coercion involved, the extent of the harm that it threatens, the effect upon the neutral parties drawn into the situation, the effects upon competition, and the gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>eral reasonableness and appropriateness of this pressure as a means of accomplishing the actor\u2019s objective\u201d (Restatement [Second] of Torts \u00a7 767, Comment c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">Although we conclude that the improper conduct standard should apply, we nonetheless concur with the majority holding because, based on the record in this case, the proof of economic pressure engaged in by Carvel does not rise to the level of improper conduct. Reviewing all of the factors listed in section 767, the franchisees\u2019 proof fails to establish that Carvel acted improperly with respect to either the Type A or Type B franchisees. As an initial matter, because the determination of whether economic pressure is improper must be reviewed \u201cin the light of the circumstances in which it is exerted\u201d and section 767 specifies that \u201cthe relations between the parties\u201d is a consideration, Carvel\u2019s actions must be analyzed in the context of its contractual agreements with its franchisees.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Type B franchisees, like Giampapa, expressly agreed that Carvel could sell its products \u201cthrough the same or different delivery systems or other distribution channels,\u201d and a disclosure form clarified that such alternative marketing channels could include \u201csupermarkets.\u201d Because the Type B agreements expressly permitted Carvel\u2019s sale of ice cream cakes to supermarkets, and the franchisees under such contracts had full knowledge that Carvel products could be sold in retail venues other than Carvel stores, such sales do not constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>economic pressure rising to the level of improper conduct sufficient to support a tortious interference claim by the Type B franchisees.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">A closer case is presented with respect to the Type A franchisees. The Type A franchise agreements restrict Carvel from licensing other Carvel stores within a quarter of a mile of a franchisee, creating a relatively small sales territory for the franchisee. The agreements also refer to \u201ca unique system for the production, distribution and merchandising of Carvel products.\u201d The franchisees assert that Carvel\u2019s supermarket program is inconsistent with the unique system of Carvel stores envisioned in their agreements and amounted to improper economic pressure. Because Carvel and its franchisees were not operating in an arm\u2019s length environment, \u201cthe relations between the parties\u201d factor weighs in the franchisees\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Balancing each of the factors, however, compels the conclusion that Carvel did not act improperly. Carvel\u2019s conduct in selling ice cream cakes to supermarkets, in and of itself, is not coercive in nature and is not compelling evidence of improper economic pressure. Moreover, Carvel\u2019s supermarket sales were not specifically aimed at inducing particular customers away from the franchisees; such sales were aimed at supermarket customers in general. Additionally, we agree with the majority that the franchisees\u2019 evidence regarding Carvel\u2019s practice of requiring them to use bags with printed coupons redeemable only at supermarkets is vague and insubstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">In accordance with section 767, the supermarket program must also be considered in light of Carvel\u2019s motive, as well as the interests Carvel sought to advance through its implementation. As a result of declining sales due to growing competition in the frozen desserts industry, Carvel commissioned a study on its market decline. The study concluded that the creation of a supermarket program \u201cis totally necessary if Carvel is to survive as a brand over the next decade.\u201d Thus, in creating the supermarket program, which Carvel introduced in response to this study, Carvel was legitimately concerned with its future profitability and cannot be said to have been primarily motivated by a desire to interfere with relations between the franchisees and their customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Concluding that the franchisees\u2019 claim does not meet the improper conduct standard, we therefore agree that the first certified question should be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"Agp\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Judges G.B.

We have defined wrongful means \u201cas representing \u2018physical violence, fraud or misrepresentation, civil suits and criminal prosecutions, and some degrees of economic pressure; they do not, however, include persuasion alone although it is knowingly directed at interference with the contract\u2019 \u201d <em>(NBT, </em>87 NY2d at 624, quoting <em>Guard-Life, </em>50 NY2d at 191).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b262-15\">. Of course, we agree with the majority that conduct rising to the level of an independent tort or a crime, or conduct aimed solely at harming a plaintiff, would also support a tortious interference claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b263-6\">. In discussing \u201ceconomic pressure\u201d as wrongful means, the majority limits that theory solely to situations where the defendant directs such pressure at parties with whom the plaintiff seeks a contractual relationship. The majority relies on a number of federal cases in support of this proposition <em>(see G.K.A. Beverage Corp. v Honickman, 55 </em>F3d 762, 768 [2d Cir 1995] [tortious interference claim dismissed because plaintiffs made \u201cno allegations that (the defendants) had any contact with the (plaintiffs\u2019) customers or that (the defendants) tried to convince the customers to make contracts with them rather than the (plaintiffs)\u201d], <em>cert denied </em>516 US 944 [1995]; <em>Piccoli A/S v Calvin Klein Jeanswear Co., </em>19 F Supp 2d 157, 167-168 [SD NY 1998] [tortious interference claim dismissed where \u201cthe defendants\u2019 alleged conduct concededly was not directed towards any third party with whom (the plaintiff) had an existing or prospective business relationship\u201d]; <em>Fonar Corp. v Magnetic Resonance Plus, Inc., </em>957 F Supp 477, 482 [SD NY 1997] [quoting <em>Honick</em>man], <em>cert denied sub nom. Domenick v Fonar Corp., 522 </em>US 908 [1997]). These cases suggest that the allegedly interfering party must have some direct contact with the third-party customers, thereby inducing them not to deal with the plaintiffs. In this case, Carvel did have contact with the franchisees\u2019 customers through the supermarket program. But these cases do not hold that \u201ceconomic pressure\u201d must be exerted on third parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
