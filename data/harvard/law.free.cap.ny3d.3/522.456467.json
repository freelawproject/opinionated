The evidence was insufficient to establish that appellant killed Wayne Flowers \u201cas part of the same criminal transaction\u201d in which he killed Franklin Dennis in a different location an hour and a half later, and the court erred in importing the broad definition of a \u201ccriminal transaction\u201d contained in CPL 40.10 (2) for double jeopardy purposes into the first-degree murder statute when it defined that crime under Penal Law \u00a7 125.27 (1) (a) (viii) for the jury. <em>(Jackson v Virginia, </em>443 US 307; <em>People v Fernandez, </em>173 Misc 2d 938; <em>People v Finnegan, </em>85 NY2d 53; <em>People v Walker, </em>81 NY2d 661; <em>Pajak v Pajak, </em>56 NY2d 394; <em>Segar v Youngs, </em>45 NY2d 568; <em>People v McNamara, </em>78 NY2d 626; <em>People v Neumann, </em>51 NY2d 658; <em>People v Powell, </em>54 NY2d 524; <em>People v Hernandez, </em>98 NY2d 8.) II. When the People relied almost exclusively on appellant\u2019s confessions, which he testified were involuntary, the trial court\u2019s error in revising its <em>Sandoval </em>ruling to permit inquiry about appellant\u2019s prior violent crime was harmful because the evidence of guilt was far from overwhelming when properly assessed \u201cwithout reference to the error\u201d and, in any event, there was a significant probability of acquittal but for the error. <em>(People v Sandoval, </em>34 NY2d 371; <em>People v Fardan, </em>82 NY2d 638; <em>People v Cooper, </em>92 NY2d 968; <em>People v Morgan, </em>171 AD2d 698; <em>People v Melendez, </em>55 NY2d 445; <em>People v Moore, </em>92 NY2d 823; <em>Richardson v Marsh, </em>481 US 200; <em>People v Moore, </em>71 NY2d 684; <em>People v Lugo, </em>218 AD2d 711; <em>People v Rojas, </em>97 NY2d 32.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number><em>Charles J.

Defendant\u2019s contention that, under a correct definition of the term \u201ccriminal transaction,\u201d the evidence was legally insufficient to sustain his first-degree murder conviction is without merit. The CPL 40.10 definition of \u201ccriminal transaction\u201d applied to Penal Law \u00a7 125.27 (1) (a) (viii), and under that definition, the evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt was legally sufficient. <em>(People v Reed, </em>265 AD2d 56; <em>Matter of Alonzo M. v New York City Dept. of Probation, </em>72 NY2d 662; <em>Matter of SIN, Inc. v Department of Fin., </em>71 NY2d 616; <em>People v Cruz, </em>48 NY2d 419; <em>People v McNamara, </em>78 NY2d 626; <em>People v Fernandez, </em>173 Misc 2d 938; <em>People v Mateo, </em>93 NY2d 327; <em>Matter of Moran Towing &amp; Transp.

In any event, if the court erred, the error was harmless because the evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt, without reference to the error, was overwhelming, and there is no significant probability that the jury would have acquitted defendant had the court not modified its <em>Sandoval </em>ruling. <em>(People v Smith, </em>97 NY2d 324; <em>People v Hopkins, </em>58 NY2d 1079; <em>People v Lawson, </em>293 AD2d 338; <em>People v Sandoval, </em>34 NY2d 371; <em>People v Fardan, </em>82 NY2d 638; <em>People v Crimmins, </em>36 NY2d 230; <em>People v Gray, </em>84 NY2d 709; <em>People v Smith, </em>97 NY2d 324; <em>People v Hopkins, </em>58 NY2d 1079; <em>People v Schaeffer, </em>56 NY2d 448.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b590-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b590-6\">Read, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">We hold that the People adduced legally sufficient evidence that defendant committed first-degree murder by killing multiple victims during the \u201csame criminal transaction\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 125.27 [1] [a] [viii]). In affirming defendant\u2019s conviction, we conclude that the statutory term of art \u201ccriminal transaction\u201d in Penal Law \u00a7 125.27 (1) (a) (viii) should be construed as incorporating the technical definition given the phrase in CPL 40.10 (2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Defendant killed two people in a 90-minute time span. The first killing occurred about 1:40 a.m. on July 4, 1999, and the second took place nearby at roughly 3:10 a.m. The evidence against defendant consisted of statements and confessions that he made after being arrested; specifically, one that the police reduced to writing, which defendant signed, and another in a 50-minute videotaped interview conducted by an assistant district attorney. Additionally, the People presented several witnesses at trial who corroborated details of defendant\u2019s confessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Defendant, who acknowledged being friendly with members of the \u201cBloods,\u201d fatally shot his two victims, who he claimed were members of the \u201cCrips,\u201d because he believed that they were prepared to carry out a contract to kill him. The two homicides occurred within a relatively small area of a housing project where defendant had lived until two weeks beforehand. He moved away after a conflict with someone named \u201cSnag.\u201d Defendant subsequently learned that Snag, who had abandoned the Bloods to become a Crip, had issued an order or contract, called a \u201c187\u201d in gang parlance, directing any member of the Crips to kill him. Armed with a .38 caliber snub-nosed handgun, defendant returned to the housing project on July 3, 1999 to \u201csquash\u201d this contract on his life. As defendant put it, he intended to \u201ccatch[ ]\u201d Snag.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Initially, defendant encountered a man known to him as \u201cCallie\u201d standing with another man. According to defendant, these men, like Snag, belonged to the Crips, and were \u201chench[es]\u201d who could carry out the hit. When defendant tried to talk to the two men, they said nothing. He then entered a building in the housing project to visit a friend. From a window, defendant observed Callie and his companion, now standing with a third man. Fearing that the three men were armed and on the lookout for him, defendant and his unarmed friend decamped to the building\u2019s roof, where defendant remained for nearly four hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">Despite his professed fear for his life, defendant eventually left the roof\u2014now alone, but still armed\u2014and went to a fast-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>food restaurant outside the housing project. After eating, he returned and observed Callie standing with four men, none of whom he knew to be Crips. Believing that Callie would no longer be armed, defendant decided to confront him regarding the contract. They argued. Backing away, defendant drew his gun and fired three shots at Callie, fatally wounding him in the head. In his videotaped confession, defendant said that he intended only to hurt, not kill, Callie.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">As defendant ran away after shooting Callie, he realized that as a result of what he had just done, Snag would now surely want him dead. He circled back to the roof, a vantage point from which to look out for Snag, \u201cthe dude [he] had the main beef with,\u201d and watched as police officers placed crime scene tape near Callie\u2019s body. Defendant saw Snag approach the crime scene on a bike \u201cto see what happened to . . . his gang members,\u201d then leave. Defendant reloaded his gun. As he explained, \u201cI went this far [so] I better go on with it or . . . I\u2019m gonna wind up dead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">When defendant next spied Snag, standing on the sidewalk below and smoking marijuana, he climbed down a fire escape from the roof to street level and crept towards him. With his gun at the ready, defendant ducked behind a wall on which Snag\u2019s male and two female companions were sitting. Then defendant called out, causing Snag to turn. Although he saw no weapon in Snag\u2019s hands, defendant fired three shots, inflicting a fatal chest wound.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Again, defendant claimed that he wanted his victim to \u201cfeel it,\u201d but not to die.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Following the second killing, defendant hid in a vacant apartment in the housing project; he left the following day, disguised in women\u2019s clothing. The police arrested him approximately 2V2 weeks later.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Defendant stood trial on two counts of first-degree \u201csame transaction\u201d murder (Penal Law \u00a7 125.27 [1] [a] [viii]). The first count charged defendant with intentionally killing Callie, and then, as part of the same criminal transaction and with intent either to kill or cause serious physical injury, causing Snag\u2019s death; the second count reversed the order of the victims, listing Snag as the primary one. At the close of trial, the judge submitted both counts to the jury. Rejecting defendant\u2019s request to define \u201ccriminal transaction\u201d by reference to dictionary definitions, the trial court instead supplied the definition in CPL 40.10 (2). The jury convicted defendant of intentionally killing Snag (the second count), and acquitted him of the other count. The jury did not consider any lesser-included offenses because the trial judge had instructed the jurors to do so only if they acquitted defendant on both first-degree murder counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">A divided Appellate Division affirmed defendant\u2019s judgment of conviction (1 AD3d 450 [2d Dept 2003]), and a dissenting Justice of that Court granted him leave to appeal to us. We now affirm.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Defendant asserts that the phrase \u201ccriminal transaction\u201d in subdivision (1) (a) (viii) of the first-degree murder statute must be understood by its ordinary meaning and not by reference to the definition in CPL 40.10 (2). We disagree. Courts generally ascribe statutory words an \u201cordinary and usual\u201d meaning only if a statute contains \u201cwords of ordinary import\u201d (McKinney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 232, at 392-393). A different rule applies when statutory language has \u201creceived a technical or peculiar significance from long habitual construction, or by legislative definition\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 393-394).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">\u201cWords of technical or special meaning are construed according to their technical sense, in the absence of anything to indicate a contrary legislative intent\u201d (Statutes \u00a7 233). Put somewhat differently, when a statute does not define a particular term, it is presumed that the term should \u201cbe given its \u2018precise and well settled legal meaning in the jurisprudence of the state\u2019 \u201d <em>(Matter of Moran Towing &amp; Transp. Co. v New York State Tax Commn., </em>72 NY2d 166, 173 [1988], quoting McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 233).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Moreover, \u201c[w]hen terms of art or peculiar phrases are used, it is supposed that the Legislature had in view the subject matter about which such terms or phrases are commonly employed\u201d (McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 233, at 397). As a corollary, \u201c[w]here the same word or group of words is used in . . . different statutes, if the acts are similar in intent and character the same meaning may be attached to them\u201d (McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 236, at 401-402). Applying these standard rules of statutory construction, we conclude that the trial court properly construed \u201ccriminal transaction\u201d in subdivision (1) (a) (viii) of the first-degree murder statute by reference to the definition in CPL 40.10 (2), a conclusion shared by the two intermediate appellate courts of this state which have considered the issue <em>(see People v Reed, </em>265 AD2d 56, 66-67 [2d Dept 2000]; <em>People v Mower, </em>280 AD2d 25, 28 [3d Dept 2001], <em>affd on other grounds </em>97 NY2d 239 [2002]).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">It is difficult to imagine a clearer example of \u201c[w]ords of technical or special meaning\u201d (McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 233) than the phrase \u201ccriminal transaction\u201d as defined in CPL 40.10 (2). This phrase is a legislative term of art, appearing in many statutes in addition to CPL 40.10 and the first-degree murder provision at issue here <em>(see e.g. </em>CPL 40.40 [1]; 40.50 [2], [3]; 200.20 [2] [a]; 200.40 [1] [c]; 240.20 [1] [a], [g]; Penal Law \u00a7 60.27 [4] [a]; \u00a7 70.25 [2-fl; \u00a7\u00a7 130.53, 145.05 [1]; \u00a7\u00a7 215.15, 215.16, 215.17, 450.10 [4] [cl; \u00a7 460.10 [4] [b]; \u00a7 470.03 [1], [2]; \u00a7 480.00 [7] [b]; see <em>also </em>CPLR 1310 [4-b] [b]; ECL 71-4401 [9]; Family Ct Act \u00a7 311.6 [2]; Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1690 [1]). Importantly, whatever the meaning of the phrase in these other statutes, nothing in the text or legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>history of the first-degree murder statute suggests that the Legislature intended for \u201ccriminal transaction\u201d to have a meaning different from CPL 40.10 (2) <em>(see Matter of Moran Towing &amp; Transp. Co. v New York State Tax Commn., </em>72 NY2d at 173; <em>see also </em>McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 233).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Further, applying the species of dictionary definition proposed by defendant would render the statute vague, something the Legislature surely did not intend for a statute drafted to \u201cnarrow\u201d the potential class of intentional murderers exposed to capital punishment <em>(see People v Harris, </em>98 NY2d 452, 476 [2002] [the United States Supreme Court has \u201crecognized that a state\u2019s capital sentencing scheme must genuinely narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)]; <em>see also People v Cahill, </em>2 NY3d 14, 68 [2003] [\u201c(T)he Legislature crafted Penal Law \u00a7 125.27 (1) (a) to narrow the class of eligible offenders\u201d]). The impracticability of using dictionary definitions is easily shown. By way of example, according to the Random House Unabridged Dictionary (2d ed 1993), to \u201ctransact\u201d is to \u201ccarry on or conduct (business, negotiations, activities, etc.) to a conclusion or settlement.\u201d This definition (suggested by defendant) begs the questions of what kind of \u201cactivities\u201d a factfinder should view and how to determine when the \u201cactivities\u201d have reached a \u201cconclusion.\u201d By contrast, CPL 40.10 (2) defines exactly what criminal conduct, both temporal and motivational, will lead to liability under subdivision (1) (a) (viii) of the first-degree murder statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Thus, liability under Penal Law \u00a7 125.27 (1) (a) (viii) attaches only to a defendant who commits an intentional murder and \u201ccauses the death of [at least one] additional person\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 125.27 [1] [a] [viii]) by engaging in \u201ctwo or more or a group of acts either ... so closely related and connected in point of time and circumstance of commission as to constitute a single criminal incident, or ... so closely related in criminal purpose or objective as to constitute elements or integral parts of a single criminal venture\u201d (CPL 40.10 [2]). Limiting liability to only those intentional killers so situated fulfills the Legislature\u2019s narrowing goal <em>(see People v Cahill, </em>2 NY3d at 68).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Defendant makes two arguments to counter the importation of CPL 40.10 (2)\u2019s definition of \u201ccriminal transaction\u201d into Penal Law \u00a7 125.27 (1) (a) (viii). First, he points out that CPL 40.10 states that \u201c[t]he following definitions are applicable to this article.\u201d Citing <em>People v McNamara </em>(78 NY2d 626 [1991]) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>and <em>People v Neumann </em>(51 NY2d 658 [1980]), he contends that the definition of \u201ccriminal transaction\u201d in CPL 40.10 is, thus, inapplicable to any other statute unless the Legislature expressly provides otherwise. Both <em>McNamara </em>and <em>Neumann, </em>however, involved attempts to define a particular substantive offense by reference to definitions applicable to another offense aimed at proscribing different conduct <em>(see People v McNamara, </em>78 NY2d at 630 [refusing to apply definitions applicable to article 245 of the Penal Law to article 240 because the former, as contrasted with the latter, \u201cis directed to offenses against \u2018public sensibilities,\u2019 not \u2018public order,\u2019 and proscribes different conduct\u201d]; <em>People v Neumann, </em>51 NY2d at 665 [definition sharing between weapons offenses and perjury offense would not lie \u201c(b)ecause neither (of the weapons offenses) is related in any way to a prosecution for perjury\u201d]). Here, by contrast, we are simply determining that a statutory term of art common to both statutes under consideration should be understood in light of the technical meaning supplied by CPL 40.10 because nothing in Penal Law \u00a7 125.27 indicated that the Legislature intended otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Defendant also argues that, at most, only the \u201csingle criminal incident\u201d definition in subdivision (2) (a) of CPL 40.10 should be imported into Penal Law \u00a7 125.27 (1) (a) (viii). According to defendant, incorporating the \u201csingle criminal venture\u201d definition of subdivision (2) (b) into subdivision (1) (a) (viii) of the first-degree murder statute would render subdivision (1) (a) (xi) of the latter statute superfluous. To support his argument, he asserts that there is no difference between a \u201cgroup of acts . . . so closely related in criminal purpose or objective as to constitute elements or integral parts of a single criminal venture\u201d (CPL 40.10 [2] [b]) and a \u201ccommon scheme or plan\u201d as used in Penal Law \u00a7 125.27 [1] [a] [xi]. Defendant is wrong.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Initially, there is no basis for incorporating only half of CPL 40.10 (2)\u2019s definition of \u201ccriminal transaction\u201d into Penal Law \u00a7 125.27 (1) (a) (viii). If the Legislature had intended this result, it would have so stated, as it has both in other sections of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Penal Law (see Penal Law \u00a7 480.00 [7] [b] [for purposes of the criminal forfeiture provisions of the Organized Crime Control Act, defining a \u201c(s)pecified felony offense\u201d as \u201cthree or more violations of\u2019 certain enumerated felonies, \u201cwhich violations do not constitute a . . . single criminal transaction, as defined in paragraph (a) of subdivision two of section 40.10 of the criminal procedure law\u201d]), and in other statutes <em>(see </em>CPLR 1310 [4-b] [b] [same with regard to civil forfeiture]).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Additionally, the potential superfluity of which defendant complains would exist only if he is correct that a \u201ccommon scheme or plan\u201d is equivalent to a \u201csingle criminal venture.\u201d The Legislature, however, has treated these two terms of art as distinct. CPL 200.40 (1), for example, provides for joinder of multiple defendants in a single indictment if either \u201call the offenses charged are based upon a common scheme or plan; or ... all the offenses charged are based upon the same criminal transaction as that term is defined in subdivision two of section 40.10\u201d (CPL 200.40 [1] [b], [c]). If the \u201csingle criminal venture\u201d portion of CPL 40.10 (2) meant the same as a \u201ccommon scheme or plan,\u201d there would have been no need for the Legislature to differentiate as it did in CPL 200.40 (1), In fact, accepting defendant\u2019s argument that a \u201csingle criminal venture\u201d as defined in CPL 40.10 (2) is equivalent to a \u201ccommon scheme or plan\u201d would render CPL 200.40 (1) partially redundant or superfluous, the very result that defendant claims that he seeks to avoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The plain language of Penal Law \u00a7 125.27 also eliminates any potential superfluity. Subdivision (1) (a) (viii) premises liability on committing multiple homicides during the \u201csame criminal transaction\u201d while subdivision (1) (a) (xi) applies only if the homicides occurred in \u201cseparate criminal transactions.\u201d A \u201csame\u201d transaction obviously cannot also be a \u201cseparate\u201d transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Further, under CPL 40.10 (2), a \u201c \u2018[cjriminal transaction\u2019 means conduct . . . comprised of two or more or a group of acts.\u201d An \u201c[a]ct\u201d is a \u201cbodily movement\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 15.00 [1]), while \u201c[c]onduct\u201d normally consists simply of \u201can act or omission and its accompanying mental state\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 15.00 [4]). By definition then, liability under subdivision (1) (a) (viii) is predicated upon committing at least two homicidal acts sharing either the temporal proximity necessary to be a \u201csingle criminal incident\u201d under CPL 40.10 (2) (a), or the motivational unity called for in CPL 40.10 (2) (b) so as to \u201ccon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>stitute elements or integral parts of a single criminal venture.\u201d The latter is what defendant suggests may be indistinguishable from a \u201ccommon scheme or plan\u201d homicide under Penal Law \u00a7 125.27 (1) (a) (xi). What defendant overlooks, however, is that subdivision (1) (a) (viii) contemplates a virtual simultaneity, or at least contemporaneity, between the \u201ctwo or more or a group of acts\u201d necessary to establish \u201csame transaction\u201d first-degree murder, even acts that are \u201celements or integral parts of a single criminal venture\u201d (CPL 40.10 [2] [b]). By contrast, subdivision (1) (a) (xi) applies in the absence of contemporaneity.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">By way of explanation, the first-degree murder statute provides that \u201c[a] person is guilty of murder in the first degree when . . . [w]ith intent to cause the death of another person, he <em>causes </em>the death of such person or of a third person\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 125.27 [1] [emphasis added]). The Legislature\u2019s use of the present tense (\u201ccauses\u201d) carries into subdivision (1) (a) (viii), but not into subdivision (1) (a) (xi).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Specifically, liability under subdivision (viii) attaches solely if, \u201cas part of the same criminal transaction, the defendant, with intent to cause serious physical injury to or the death of an additional person or persons, <em>causes </em>the death of an additional person or persons\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 125.27 [1] [a] [viii] [emphasis added]). Thus, as called for by the present tense \u201ccauses,\u201d any additional homicides must be contemporaneous with the threshold intentional murder. If not, a defendant may simply have committed separate second-degree murders, or perhaps a second-degree murder and first-degree manslaughter (see <em>People v Cahill, </em>2 NY3d at 64 [the first-degree murder \u201cstatute begins by declaring that every first degree murder must include an intentional (second degree) murder. An additional aggravating factor\u2014murder \u2018plus\u2019\u2014raises the crime to murder in the first degree\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">By contrast, subdivision (1) (a) (xi) speaks in the past tense (\u201ccaused\u201d), not the present tense (\u201ccauses\u201d as used in subparagraph [viii]). Liability attaches under subparagraph (xi) solely \u201cwhen . . . [w]ith intent to cause the death of another person, he <em>causes </em>the death of such person or of a third person; and . . . the defendant intentionally <em>caused </em>the death of two or more additional persons within the state in separate criminal transactions within a period of twenty-four months\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 125.27 [1] [a] [xi] [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Thus, subdivision (1) (a) (xi) contemplates that the additional homicides necessary to aggravate a threshold intentional second-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>degree murder to first-degree murder <em>(see People v Cahill, </em>2 NY3d at 64) will have occurred in the past. Aggravation occurs under subdivision (1) (a) (viii), however, only if the additional homicides are sufficiently contemporaneous with the threshold intentional murder. There is consequently no danger of conflating \u201cseparate criminal transactions . . . common scheme or plan\u201d murder under Penal Law \u00a7 125.27 (1) (a) (xi) with \u201csingle criminal venture\u201d (CPL 40.10 [2] [b]) \u201csame criminal transaction\u201d murder under Penal Law \u00a7 125.27 (1) (a) (viii).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Because we conclude that the trial court properly charged the jury using the CPL 40.10 definition for \u201ccriminal transaction,\u201d we now turn to whether the People adduced legally sufficient evidence that the homicides committed by defendant occurred during the \u201csame criminal transaction.\u201d Viewed in the light most favorable to the People (see <em>People v Cunningham, </em>2 NY3d 593, 595 n 1 [2004]), we conclude that the evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt was clearly sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">By his own admission, defendant armed himself and set about \u201csquashfing]\u201d the contract on his life by \u201ccatch[ing]\u201d Snag, the person whom he held responsible for placing the contract. Before finding Snag, though, defendant happened upon Callie, whom he viewed as Snag\u2019s enforcer and therefore a likely candidate to carry out the hit. As part of his effort to \u201csquash\u201d the contract, defendant decided to confront Callie and, as a result of this motivation, he killed Callie.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">After killing Callie, defendant raced back to an area less than a block away where he knew he would likely encounter Snag. Although defendant had a 90-minute interval during which to leave, he instead chose to stay, determined to \u201cgo on with it.\u201d Carrying through on his continuing motivation to \u201csquash\u201d the contract, defendant indeed went \u201con with it\u201d by reloading his gun and lying in wait for an opportunity to \u201ccatch[ ]\u201d Snag. Ultimately, defendant completed exactly what he had set out to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>do: he came down from his rooftop sanctuary, sneaked up on Snag and shot him to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The spatial and temporal proximity of defendant\u2019s homicidal acts, all of which were fueled by a common motivation, establish that he acted during the \u201csame criminal transaction.\u201d Indeed, defendant\u2019s various acts were both \u201cso closely related and connected in point of time and circumstance of commission as to constitute a single criminal incident\u201d (CPL 40.10 [2] [a]) and \u201cso closely related in criminal purpose or objective as to constitute elements or integral parts of a single criminal venture\u201d (CPL 40.10 [2] [b]). Put differently, defendant\u2019s two homicidal acts were part of a continuous course of conduct sufficient to establish the contemporaneity necessary to constitute \u201csame transaction\u201d first-degree murder.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s remaining claim does not warrant reversal of his judgment of conviction. Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-8\">.

In his confessions, defendant identified his friend Marcus as Snag\u2019s male companion. Marcus testified for the People, corroborating defendant\u2019s statement that Marcus had, indeed, been present when Snag was shot. According to Marcus, Snag uttered an expletive, which caused Marcus to turn and look in the same direction as Snag. When he did so, Marcus saw a \u201cflash\u201d and heard gunshots. He observed defendant near the flash, about 12 to 13 feet away from Snag.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b592-8\">. Defendant testified at trial, claiming that he had invented his confessions under duress, and had not even been present at the housing project on the day of the murders. For example, defendant stated in his confessions that he hid in a vacant apartment with his friend \u201cSnoop\u201d after the shootings. While there, he phoned \u201cFife,\u201d from whom he had borrowed the murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>weapon, and arranged for someone to come and pick up the gun from him. As defendant told it in his confessions, a girl named \u201cSin\u201d ultimately came to the apartment to get the gun, which he had placed in a bag. In his trial testimony, however, defendant claimed to have \u201cmade up\u201d Sin. In rebuttal, the People presented a witness named Cindy Jean. She testified that, around July 4, 1999 (she couldn\u2019t recall the exact date), her boyfriend, Fife, sent her to the housing project to pick up a package. When she arrived, Snoop met her, brought her to an apartment and handed her a bag to take to Fife. She remembered having seen defendant in the apartment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b593-11\">. Defendant did not raise his current claim concerning the definition of \u201ccriminal transaction\u201d in the Appellate Division. The claim is fully amenable to our review, however, because defendant properly preserved it at trial (see CPL 470.35 [1] [\u201cUpon an appeal to the court of appeals from an order of an intermediate appellate court affirming a judgment, sentence or order of a criminal court, the court of appeals may consider and determine . . . any question of law involving alleged error or defect in the criminal court proceedings resulting in the original criminal court judgment, sentence or order, regardless of whether such question was raised, considered or determined upon the appeal to the intermediate appellate court\u201d]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b596-7\">.

The dissent seems to read subdivision (1) (a) (xi)\u2019s requirement of \u201cseparate\u201d criminal transactions as somehow negating the motivational linkage contemplated by CPL 40.10 (2) (b)\u2019s \u201csingle criminal venture\u201d definition. What the dissent overlooks is that acts constituting \u201cseparate\u201d homicidal transactions lack, not motivational unity, but rather the contemporaneous conduct required to be the \u201csame criminal transaction.\u201d Thus, when different intentional murders are remote enough (due to a lack of the continuous conduct present in this case) to constitute \u201cseparate criminal transactions,\u201d those murders may nonetheless have been carried out \u201cpursuant to a common scheme or plan.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b600-8\">. While it may have been the case here, we are not suggesting that a defendant\u2019s acts must establish both parts of the CPL 40.10 (2) definition of \u201ccriminal transaction.\u201d Indeed, the trial court charged the jury in the disjunctive <em>(compare People v Mateo, 2 </em>NY3d 383, 406 [2004], <em>cert denied </em>\u2014 US \u2014, 124 S Ct 2929 [2004] [rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim \u201cthat the jury be unanimous on one theory (of first-degree murder liability) or the other\u201d]), as the Criminal Jury Instructions recommend (see CJI2d[NY] Penal Law \u00a7 125.27 [1] [a] [viii], at 125-2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b600-6\">R.S. Smith, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"A5u\">I agree with the majority that the evidence was sufficient to permit a correctly-charged jury to convict defendant of first degree murder, and that the <em>Sandoval </em>error of which defendant complains was harmless. I dissent from affirmance of the conviction, however, because I believe the jury was incorrectly charged on the definition of \u201ccriminal transaction.\u201d The definition used in the charge, while broadening the scope of the subparagraph of the Penal Law involved in this case, shrinks an important part of another subparagraph\u2014 the \u201ccommon scheme or plan\u201d branch of the serial murder statute\u2014to the vanishing point.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Murder in the first degree is defined in Penal Law \u00a7 125.27 (1). Section 125.27 (1) (a) lists, in 13 subparagraphs, the aggravating factors that can convert second degree murder to first degree murder. Two of those subparagraphs\u2014subparagraph (viii), the one at issue here, and subparagraph (xi), the serial murder subparagraph\u2014use the term \u201ccriminal transaction.\u201d Section 125.27 (1) (a) (viii) provides that first degree murder occurs where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>\u201c(viii) <em>as part of the same criminal transaction, </em>the defendant, with intent to cause serious physical injury to or the death of an additional person or persons, causes the death of an additional person or persons; provided, however, the victim is not a participant in the criminal transaction\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">Section 125.27 (1) (a) (xi) says a killing may be murder in the first degree where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-5\">\u201c(xi) the defendant intentionally caused the death of two or more additional persons within the state <em>in separate criminal transactions </em>within a period of twenty-four months when committed in a similar fashion or pursuant to a common scheme or plan\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Thus subparagraph (viii) applies only where crimes are committed \u201cas part of the same criminal transaction\u201d and subparagraph (xi) only where they are committed \u201cin separate criminal transactions.\u201d The two subparagraphs are mutually exclusive, and to expand or contract the definition of \u201ccriminal transaction\u201d is a zero sum game: the more cases the definition includes, the more cases will fit within subparagraph (viii) and the fewer within subparagraph (xi). The flaw in the majority opinion, I believe, is that it never addresses this aspect of the statute. It discusses at some length another difference between subparagraphs (viii) and (xi)\u2014that the former uses the present tense and the latter the past. But that discussion is irrelevant to my point, which is that the definition of \u201ccriminal transaction\u201d affects each subparagraph in a fundamentally opposite way. For that reason the term should, if possible, be defined in a way that gives meaningful scope to both subparagraphs.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The Legislature has left it to the courts to select a definition. It did not define the term \u201ccriminal transaction\u201d for purposes of Penal Law \u00a7 125.27; it could have, but did not, adopt the definition contained in CPL 40.10 (2), which is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">\u201c \u2018Criminal transaction\u2019 means conduct which establishes at least one offense, and which is comprised of two or more or a group of acts either (a) so closely related and connected in point of time and circumstance of commission as to constitute a single criminal incident, or (b) so closely related in criminal purpose or objective as to constitute elements or integral parts of a single criminal venture.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Like the majority, I do not read into the Legislature\u2019s failure to adopt the CPL definition an implied rejection of it. I agree that we are free to adopt that definition for purposes of Penal Law \u00a7 125.27 if we think it the best available. But we are not compelled to adopt it, and in my view it is not the best available. I would adopt instead only subsection (a) of CPL 40.10 (2), and I would define \u201ccriminal transaction\u201d to mean \u201cconduct which establishes at least one offense, and which is comprised of two or more or a group of acts so closely related and connected in point of time and circumstance of commission as to constitute a single criminal incident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">If this definition is adopted, Penal Law \u00a7 125.27 (1) (a) (viii) will continue to have substantial content. Anyone who kills two people where the killings are sufficiently close in time and circumstance of commission will be guilty of first degree murder under subparagraph (viii). This definition would clearly permit the present defendant to be convicted of first degree murder. His two killings were only about an hour and a half apart and were linked by a continuous chain of circumstances: a jury could well have found that they were parts of \u201ca single criminal incident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">But it is a mistake, in my view, to include the second half of the CPL definition\u2014acts \u201cso closely related in criminal purpose or objective as to constitute elements or integral parts of a single criminal venture\u201d\u2014when defining \u201ccriminal transaction\u201d for Penal Law \u00a7 125.27 purposes. When this part of the definition is applied to Penal Law \u00a7 125.27 (1) (a) (xi) it produces a result that is strange at best. Subparagraph (xi) applies to crimes that occur \u201cin separate criminal transactions . . . pursuant to a common scheme or plan.\u201d Under the definition the majority adopts, this must mean crimes that are <em>not </em>\u201cso closely related in criminal purpose or objective as to constitute elements or integral parts of a single criminal venture\u201d and yet are part of \u201ca common scheme or plan.\u201d The language seems almost perfectly self-contradictory; I cannot think of a single case to which it would apply, and neither the People\u2019s brief in this case nor the majority opinion offers an example. Thus the majority\u2019s definition effectively nullifies the \u201ccommon scheme or plan\u201d branch of Penal Law \u00a7 125.27 (1) (a) (xi). Subparagraph (xi) would have meaning only as applied to crimes committed in \u201cseparate criminal transactions ... in a similar fashion.\u201d When the Legislature added the words \u201cor pursuant to a common scheme or plan\u201d it was apparently wasting its breath.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Accordingly, I would reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction on the ground that the trial court erroneously adopted the definition of \u201ccriminal transaction\u201d contained in CPL 40.10 (2) (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Judges G.B. Smith, Rosenblatt and Graffeo concur with Judge Read; Judge R.S.
