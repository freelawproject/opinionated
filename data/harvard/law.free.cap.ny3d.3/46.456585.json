Section 240 (1) of the Labor Law clearly applies to all owners (not expressly exempt) of property where work of the type described in the statute is being done. The imposition by the Appellate Division of a condition to such general application in the situation of the injured plaintiff here was erroneous and should be reversed. <em>(Haimes v New York Tel. Co., </em>46 NY2d 132; <em>Panek v County of Albany, </em>99 NY2d 452; <em>Coleman v City of New York, </em>91 NY2d 821; <em>Bland v Manocherian, </em>66 NY2d 452; <em>Zimmer v Chemung County Performing Arts, </em>65 NY2d 513; <em>Gordon v Eastern Ry.

If this Court accepts the condition to property owners\u2019 liability under the Labor Law applied by the lower courts in this case, such condition should be deemed as having been met under the circumstances present here. III. This Court should also reverse the Appellate Division\u2019s <em>alternate </em>ruling that, as a matter of law, the work being done by the injured plaintiff at the time of his injury was not of a type protected by section 240 (1) of the Labor Law. Summary judgment should in fact be given to plaintiffs on the issue. <em>(Prats v Port Auth. of N.Y. &amp; N.J., </em>100 NY2d 878; <em>Fuller v Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., </em>213 AD2d 986, 86 NY2d 708; <em>Rocovich v Consolidated Edison Co., </em>78 NY2d 509; <em>Panek v County of Albany, </em>99 NY2d 452; <em>Gordon v Eastern Ry.

An opportunity to affect work site safety is a necessary condition precedent to the imposition of liability on the owner of a building or structure when a worker has been injured due to a violation of Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1). <em>(Hargobin v K.A.F.C.1.

Since Lancaster Studio Associates did not own the cable television equipment plaintiff worked on, it cannot be liable as an \u201cowner\u201d under Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1). <em>(Gordon v Eastern Ry.

We conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, the cable technician does not come within the protections of the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Plaintiff Anthony Abbatiello was a cable television technician employed by third-party defendant Paragon Cable Manhattan, Inc.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On August 12, 1995, Paragon dispatched plaintiff to a building owned by defendant Lancaster Studio Associates in response to the complaint of a tenant who was a cable service subscriber. Lancaster had no notice that plaintiff would be on its premises for any purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">While on the property, plaintiff rang the subscriber\u2019s doorbell and attempted to enter the building\u2014both to no avail. As he had previously done work at that location, plaintiff proceeded to identify the junction box that routed the cable signal into the subscriber\u2019s apartment. The box was bolted on an exterior wall of the building, about 15 to 20 feet above ground level. To access the box, plaintiff placed a 20-foot extension ladder, which had been supplied by Paragon, against the side of the building. He climbed the ladder, equipped to take the cable box apart, di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>agnose and fix the problem. Following inspection, plaintiff determined that the defective signal was caused by water seeping into the junction box. However, before he could take any further action, the ladder bent, causing plaintiff to fall to the ground and injure himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Plaintiff later commenced this action against Lancaster and its individual partners alleging common-law negligence and violations of Labor Law \u00a7\u00a7 200, 240 and 241. Lancaster brought a third-party action against Paragon, and Paragon counterclaimed. Lancaster moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and counterclaim, and Paragon separately sought dismissal of the complaint. Supreme Court granted both motions and dismissed the complaint in its entirety. The Appellate Division, with one Justice dissenting, affirmed, concluding that there could be no Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) liability here both because the owner did not authorize or even know of plaintiff\u2019s presence, and because the work being performed was routine maintenance (307 AD2d 788 [2003]). We now affirm on both grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The Parties\u2019 Relationship</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">In <em>Blake v Neighborhood Hous. Servs. of N.Y. City </em>(1 NY3d 280 [2003]), we recently reviewed the history and purposes of Labor Law \u00a7 240 (l).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We reaffirmed the rule that an accident alone does not establish a Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) violation, and that absolute liability requires a violation of the statute. We found no violation in <em>Blake </em>and likewise find no violation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">We have consistently \u201cobserved that the purpose of the statute is to protect workers by placing ultimate responsibility for safety practices on owners and contractors instead of on workers themselves\u201d <em>(Panek v County of Albany, </em>99 NY2d 452, 457 [2003] [citations omitted]). Accordingly, the statute imposes absolute liability on owners and contractors for any breach of the statutory duty that proximately causes injury <em>(see Blake, </em>1 NY3d at 287). To come within the special class for whose benefit absolute liability is imposed, a plaintiff must demonstrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>that \u201che was both permitted or suffered to work on a building or structure and that he was hired by someone, be it [the] owner, contractor or their agent\u201d <em>(Whelen v Warwick Val. Civic &amp; Social Club, </em>47 NY2d 970, 971 [1979]).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Following the <em>Whelen </em>line of precedent, the First Department has generally held that a cable technician called to a building by a tenant without the knowledge or consent of the owner is not an employee for purposes of Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) and therefore is not afforded the protections of that statute against the owner <em>(see Ceballos v Kaufman, </em>249 AD2d 40 [1st Dept 1998]). On the other hand, relying on <em>Celestine v City of New York </em>(86 AD2d 592 [2d Dept 1982], <em>affd </em>59 NY2d 938 [1983]) and its <em>progeny\u2014Gordon v Eastern Ry. Supply </em>(82 NY2d 555 [1993]) and <em>Coleman v City of New York </em>(91 NY2d 821 [1997])\u2014 the Second and Third Departments have held building owners strictly liable for the injuries of such workers on the ground that ownership alone may determine whether defendant is liable under section 240 (1). Persuaded by the distinctions between <em>Celestine </em>and its progeny and the facts presented here, we refuse to impose absolute liability on an owner where a cable technician is injured while performing work without the owner\u2019s knowledge or consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Common to <em>Celestine, Gordon </em>and Coleman\u2014and to all cases imposing Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) liability on an out-of-possession owner\u2014is some nexus between the owner and the worker, whether by a lease agreement or grant of an easement, or other property interest. Here, however, no such nexus exists. The injured plaintiff was on the owner\u2019s premises not by reason of any action of the owner but by reason of provisions of the Public Service Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Public Service Law \u00a7 211 states the purpose of Public Service Law article 11\u2014\u201cto ensure that cable television companies provide adequate, economical and efficient service to their subscribers, the municipalities within which they are franchised and other parties to the public interest.\u201d According to Public Service Law \u00a7 228 (l),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">\u201cNo landlord shall (a) interfere with the installation of cable television facilities upon his property or premises, except that a landlord may require:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-8\">\u201c(1) that the installation of cable television facilities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>conform to such reasonable conditions as are necessary to protect the safety, functioning and appearance of the premises, and the convenience and well being of other tenants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Plaintiff argues that, notwithstanding the mandatory access imposed by Public Service Law \u00a7 228 (1), Lancaster should be deemed an \u201cowner\u201d for purposes of Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) as it maintained a degree of control over the work and would have knowledge\u2014albeit constructive\u2014that Paragon employees would be coming upon its property periodically to effectuate repairs at the request of tenant-subscribers. We disagree,</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Lancaster is powerless to determine which cable company is entitled to operate, repair or maintain the cable facilities on its property, since such decision lies with the municipality\u2014the franchisor <em>(see </em>Public Service Law \u00a7 219). The City of New York gave Paragon the franchise, and the right to install its cable facilities. This included the right to maintain and service its facilities at the premises free from interference after installation <em>(see Loretto v Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., </em>458 US 419, 439 [1982]). Neither did Lancaster incur liability for injury to a cable company employee by failing to exercise its right under the statute to require \u201creasonable conditions\u201d for the protection of its property and tenants when the employee installs the cable <em>(see </em>Public Service Law \u00a7 228 [1] [a] [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Lancaster cannot be charged with the duty of providing the safe working conditions contemplated by Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) for cable television repair people of whom it is wholly unaware. Supreme Court correctly noted that, but for Public Service Law \u00a7 228, plaintiff would be a trespasser upon Lancaster\u2019s property and Lancaster would neither owe a duty to plaintiff nor incur liability. Any permission to work on the premises was granted upon compulsion and no relationship existed between Lancaster and Paragon or the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Having found no nexus here, we conclude that plaintiff is not an employee for purposes of Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) and that Public Service Law \u00a7 228 does not impose constructive notice on a building owner nor does it subject the owner to liability under Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1). We thus agree with Supreme Court that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-8\">\u201c[t]he Public Service Law was enacted to secure the right of the tenant to have access to cable television services, not to impose unconditional liability upon a defenseless fee owner. The interpretation sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>gested by the plaintiff goes far beyond the scope of the language employed in each statute, so as to create a new liability with respect to cable service workers which was not envisioned by the Legislature.\u201d (188 Misc 2d 665, 676 [2001].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The Nature of the Work</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">We also agree with the Appellate Division that plaintiff, at the time of his accident, was involved in \u201cthe routine maintenance of a malfunctioning cable box and [the work] did not constitute \u2018erection, demolition, repairing, altering, painting, cleaning or pointing of a building\u2019 so as to fall within the protective ambit of Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1)\u201d (307 AD2d 788, 789 [2003] [citations omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Plaintiff here was engaged in an activity similar to that of plaintiff in <em>Esposito v New York City Indus. Dev. Agency </em>(1 NY3d 526 [2003]), who was performing a monthly maintenance check on air conditioners located high off the ground. One unit appeared in need of repair, and plaintiff left and returned with tools and parts. As he climbed the ladder and began to remove the unit cover, the bottom of his ladder \u201ckicked out\u201d and he fell. We held that \u201c[t]he work . . . involved replacing components that require replacement in the course of normal wear and tear. It therefore constituted routine maintenance and not \u2018repairing\u2019 or any of the other enumerated activities\u201d (Esposito, 1 NY3d at 528). Likewise here, plaintiff determined that the cause of the defective signal was water in the tap, a common problem caused by rainwater accumulating in junction boxes affixed to building exteriors. The remedy would have been to loosen a few screws and drain the water from the tap and, if worn out, replace the tap. These activities constitute routine maintenance and not repair as contemplated by Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B.
