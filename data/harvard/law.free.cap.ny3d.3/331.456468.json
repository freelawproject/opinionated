If the intent is to distribute such benefits, that should be separately, and explicitly, stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-14\">After 28 years of marriage, Robert and Sandra Kazel were divorced in 1991. In accordance with a final posttrial judgment distributing the marital property by, among other things, divid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>ing the husband\u2019s pension plan between the parties pursuant to the equitable distribution formula established in <em>Majauskas v Majauskas </em>(61 NY2d 481 [1984]),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the matrimonial court entered a QDRO directing that plaintiff wife begin to receive a fixed percentage of her former husband\u2019s monthly allowance either at such time as he \u201chas retired from and is actually receiving a monthly allowance from his . . . Pension Plan\u201d or, at plaintiffs option, \u201cafter the earlier to occur of the first date for payments allowed under the plan or after [he] reaches the earliest retirement age under the Plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Robert Kazel died in 2001 before reaching retirement age, and therefore never received any payments under the plan. Following his death, plaintiff sought to share with decedent\u2019s widow in preretirement death benefits payable under decedent\u2019s pension plan. Because the QDRO, by its plain terms, granted plaintiff an interest only in decedent\u2019s retirement annuity, and not in his death benefits, the plan administrator denied plaintiff any share of those benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Plaintiff, conceding that the QDRO failed to grant her an interest in her former husband\u2019s death benefits, sought to modify or supplement the QDRO to award her a share of such benefits. Supreme Court denied the motion, concluding that plaintiff had failed to establish that the intent of the underlying divorce decree had been to award her survivor benefits. The Appellate Division, one Justice dissenting, affirmed and granted leave to appeal to this Court, certifying the following question: \u201cWas the order of this Court entered December 31, 2003, properly made?\u201d We answer in the affirmative, and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 USC \u00a7 1001 <em>et </em>seq.) (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (IRC) require all pension plans to provide survivor benefits to a participant\u2019s surviving spouse <em>(see </em>ERISA [29 USC] \u00a7 1055 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>[a]; Internal Revenue Code [26 USC] \u00a7 401 [a] [11]; \u00a7 417). Pursuant to a divorce, however, a QDRO can provide that a former spouse be treated as a surviving spouse\u2014to the exclusion of the actually surviving spouse if, as here, the decedent had remarried\u2014for purposes of ERISA and the joint and survivor rules of the IRC <em>(see </em>ERISA [29 USC] \u00a7 1056 [d] [3] [F]; Internal Revenue Code [26 USC] \u00a7 401 [a] [11]; \u00a7\u00a7 417, 414 [p] [5] [A]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, a former spouse can overcome the right of an actually surviving spouse to receive a survivor annuity only if specifically awarded such benefits by the matrimonial court. Further, such an award must be reflected in a QDRO, evidenced by clear language designating the former spouse as the surviving spouse for purposes of the survivor benefits. The QDRO must reflect the intent of the underlying judgment of divorce, and must comply with its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Although plaintiff contends that the phrase \u201cpension plan,\u201d as contained in the underlying judgment of divorce, can encompass both retirement annuities and survivor benefits, the law is otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">In <em>McCoy v Feinman </em>(99 NY2d 295, 303 [2002]), we explained that <em>\u201cMajauskas can </em>govern equitable distribution of preretirement death benefits earned during the marriage, but mere mention of <em>Majauskas </em>does not by itself establish the parties\u2019 intent to allocate those benefits\u201d (emphasis in original). As we stated then and underscore now, pension benefits and death benefits are two distinct matters. Both ERISA and the IRC treat them as separate interests, and we therefore hold that reference to a pension plan or pension benefits will not be deemed to include death benefits. Indeed, even \u201ca stipulation\u2019s conclusory representation that the parties agreed to allocate to the nonemployee spouse all the benefits available . . . under the applicable section of the Internal Revenue Code\u2014which authorizes but does not mandate assignment of survivor benefits <em>(see </em>26 USC \u00a7 414 [p])\u2014does not evince the parties\u2019 intent to distribute each such benefit\u201d <em>(McCoy, </em>99 NY2d at 303 [internal quotation marks omitted]). Rather, any distribution of survivor benefits should be explicitly stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s attempt to distinguish this case from <em>McCoy </em>is unavailing. There, the stipulation of settlement \u201cclearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>expressed the parties\u2019 intention to award plaintiff <em>retirement benefits </em>under the plan. Critically, however, in no way did the stipulation provide or even suggest that the parties had agreed to allocate to plaintiff <em>preretirement death benefits, </em>and we cannot read the stipulation as if it had\u201d (99 NY2d at 303 [emphasis in original]). Because the stipulation \u201cwas not ambiguous and did not cover preretirement death benefits, it did not entitle plaintiff to receive those benefits; nor did the judgment, which merely incorporated that stipulation\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">True, <em>McCoy </em>involved a stipulation between the parties, rather than a decree issued after trial. But that distinction is immaterial. Fundamentally, the issue in <em>McCoy </em>was whether a stipulation, silent as to death benefits, could be read to reflect an intent to include such benefits. We held that it could not. Similarly, a divorce decree, silent as to death benefits, cannot be read to include them.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Whether the matrimonial court should have, or would have, equitably distributed the preretirement benefits, the fact remains that it did not.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the absence of evidence that the death benefits were ever considered by the matrimonial court, we will not infer from silence in the underlying trial record\u2014let alone contrary language in the QDRO\u2014that the intent of the court was other than to provide plaintiff with a share of any benefits actually received by her former husband during his lifetime, or that the matrimonial court\u2019s reference in its amended decision to \u201cpension interests\u201d\u2014which clearly <em>were </em>meant to be divided\u2014included death benefits. Although plaintiff would have us presume that death benefits are meant to be included within a distribution of pension benefits in the absence of an express provision excluding them, the law requires the contrary presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Since the underlying judgment fails to reflect an express intent by the matrimonial court to distribute the death benefits, the QDRO was not, as plaintiff asserts, carelessly drafted, but rather correctly reflects\u2014as it must\u2014the terms of the decree from which it arises.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs, and the certified question answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Judges G.B. Smith, Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Graffeo, Read and R.S.

Of course, a QDRO can provide that the former spouse receive all or only a portion of the survivor benefits, in which case the benefits would be shared with the actually surviving spouse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b401-9\">. On this record, the failure of the judgment of divorce to distribute preretirement death benefits is unsurprising. It appears that no evidence was adduced at trial with respect to any value, or even the existence, of such benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
