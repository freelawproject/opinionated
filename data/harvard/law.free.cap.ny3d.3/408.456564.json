At the time of the accident, Rubeis was employed by Venezia Iron Works, Inc. Rubeis commenced a personal injury action against Aqua Club, which then impleaded Venezia alleging a cause of action for common-law indemnification and contribution. Aqua Club claimed that plaintiff sustained a grave injury under Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 11 and thus plaintiffs employer was Hable.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">At the close of the liability phase of trial, the court granted Aqua Club judgment on its claim against Venezia, subject to resolution of the question whether plaintiff sustained a grave injury, which it submitted to the jury. The court instructed the jury that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">\u201c[i]n order to prove a grave injury . . . the medical evidence must indicate that . . . plaintiff is unable to return to any employment. You may consider plaintiffs ability to obtain other employment and should also consider his abiHty to perform the usual and customary tasks of ordinary day-to-day living, such as whether he is physically independent and ambulatory, in determining whether or not plaintiff suffered a grave injury. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">The jury found that the plaintiff sustained a grave injury and awarded him approximately $3.2 million in damages. The trial court denied Venezia\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict, but the Appellate Division, Second Department, reversed and granted the motion. Relying on Second Department case law holding that brain injury does not result in permanent total disability where the employee is able to perform day-to-day functions, the Appellate Division concluded that plaintiff had not suffered a grave injury under Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>\n<em>Largo-Chicaiza v Westchester Scaffold Equipment Corp.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Jorge Largo-Chicaiza, a day-laborer, sustained a brain injury when he fell from the roof of a six-story house owned by Peter and Catherine McCaffrey while removing shingles. At the time of the accident, he was employed by the general contractor, Salvatore Sanzo. Largo-Chicaiza brought a personal injury action against the McCaffreys, Sanzo and the roofing subcontractors. In their answers, defendants each sought dismissal of the complaint and, in the alternative, cross-claimed for indemnification and contribution against Sanzo pursuant to Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Sanzo sought summary judgment against plaintiff and dismissal of all cross claims against him on the ground that he was plaintiffs employer, and plaintiffs sole recovery against him were therefore workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The trial court granted Sanzo\u2019s motion for summary judgment as against plaintiff, but denied his motion seeking to prohibit impleader actions against him and converted defendants\u2019 cross claims into third-party actions against Sanzo. Citing <em>Way v Grantling </em>(289 AD2d 790, 792 [3d Dept 2001]) for the proposition that permanent total disability relates to the injured party\u2019s employability, not ability to function in society, the trial court concluded that the evidence raised material questions of fact. The Appellate Division, Second Department, reversed and, citing <em>Rubeis </em>(305 AD2d 656 [2003]), concluded that plaintiffs injuries were not a grave injury under Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">\n<em>Knauer v Anderson</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Thomas Knauer, an electrician employed by Knauer Electric, sustained a brain injury when he fell 17 feet from a ladder and crashed headfirst onto a gravel floor. Knauer commenced a personal injury action against the general contractor and the property owner. The defendants then brought a third-party action against plaintiffs employer for indemnification. The trial court denied the employer\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding a triable issue of fact regarding whether plaintiff sustained a grave injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">After trial, the court charged the jury that permanent total disability means permanent total disability from employment and does not require that plaintiff lack all capacity to perform personal or household activities. The jury found in plaintiffs favor, awarding him $11 million, and the Appellate Division, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Fourth Department, affirmed, relying on <em>Way. </em>The Court reasoned, \u201cevidence that a plaintiff has suffered the specified injury to the brain resulting in permanent total disability relates to his or her permanent total disability from employment, not to his or her ability to otherwise care for himself or herself and function in a modern society\u201d (2 AD3d 1314, 1315 [4th Dept 2003] [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">We granted leave to address this split among Departments on the meaning of \u201cpermanent total disability\u201d under Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 11 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">\u201cAn employer shall not be liable for contribution or indemnity to any third person based upon liability for injuries sustained by an employee acting within the scope of his or her employment for such employer unless such third person proves through competent medical evidence that such employee has sustained a \u2018grave injury\u2019 which shall mean only one or more of the following: death, permanent and total loss of use or amputation of an arm, leg, hand or foot, loss of multiple fingers, loss of multiple toes, paraplegia or quadriplegia, total and permanent blindness, total and permanent deafness, loss of nose, loss of ear, permanent and severe facial disfigurement, loss of an index finger or an acquired injury to the brain caused by an external physical force resulting in permanent total disability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">Section 11 was enacted in 1996 as part of a comprehensive reform intended to reduce costs for employers while also protecting the interests of injured workers (Omnibus Workers\u2019 Compensation Reform Act of 1996, L 1996, ch 635; Governor\u2019s Approval Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1996, ch 635, at 54, 1996 NY Legis Ann, at 459). Before that, New York State stood alone in freely allowing a defendant in a personal injury action brought by an employee injured on the job to seek indemnification or contribution from the employer. Central to the reform was immunity from tort liability for employers who provide workers\u2019 compensation coverage by exposing employers to third-party liability \u201conly in cases involving <em>narrowly defined </em>\u2018grave\u2019 injuries\u201d (Governor\u2019s Approval Mem, Bill Jacket at 55, 1996 NY Legis Ann, at 460). The injuries enumerated as grave were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>\u201cdeliberately both narrowly and completely described. The list is exhaustive, not illustrative: it is not intended to be extended absent further legislative action\u201d (id.).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">This legislative directive has consistently guided our determination as to whether a particular injury is a grave injury within the statute. In <em>Castro v United Container Mach. Group, Inc. </em>(96 NY2d 398 [2001]), for example, we held that the term \u201c loss of multiple fingers\u2019 cannot sensibly be read to mean partial loss of multiple fingers\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 401). The word finger in the statute means the whole finger, not just its tip. And in <em>Meis v ELO Org., LLC </em>(97 NY2d 714, 716 [2002]), we concluded that loss of a thumb is not \u201cpermanent and total loss of use\u201d of a hand, and thus not a grave injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">In <em>Castro </em>and <em>Meis, </em>the words of the statute alone answered the question before us. Partial loss of multiple fingers, and loss of a thumb, simply do not fit the clear literal terms of the statute. The statutory words \u201can acquired injury to the brain caused by an external physical force resulting in permanent total disability,\u201d however, do not alone answer the question whether a particular injury is a grave injury. That phrase <em>requires </em>interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The definition of \u201cpermanent total disability\u201d within section 11 has, moreover, divided the Appellate Divisions. The Third and Fourth Departments conclude that the permanent total disability envisioned by the section \u201crelates to the injured party\u2019s employability and not his or her ability to otherwise care for himself or herself and function in a modern society\u201d <em>(Way v Grantling, </em>289 AD2d 790, 792 [3d Dept 2001]; <em>Knauer v Anderson, 2 </em>AD3d 1314 [4th Dept 2003]). In Way, the Third Department found a material issue of fact as to permanent total disability when evidence suggested that the employee\u2019s postconcussive syndrome permanently disabled him from competitive employment in even the most menial tasks, and where he had been awarded Social Security disability benefits. When defining \u201cpermanent total disability\u201d the Second Department, by contrast, has focused on the injured party\u2019s ability to engage in day-to-day functions <em>(see Schuler v Kings Plaza Shopping Ctr. &amp; Mar., Inc., </em>294 AD2d 556, 559 [2d Dept 2002] [no grave injury where injured plaintiff managed a limited social agenda and was able to, among other things, dress and feed himself and handle simple arithmetic]).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">These appeals in fact place before us two possible definitions of permanent total disability: the Second Department\u2019s stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>dard essentially requiring a vegetative state, and the Third and Fourth Departments\u2019 standard essentially requiring unemployability. In choosing between these alternatives, our guiding principle is, of course, to implement the intent of the Legislature\u2014in this case to narrow tort exposure for employers while also protecting the interests of injured workers\u2014by considering both the language used and objects to be accomplished. While both definitions are plausible, the second, in our view, better fits section 11 and better effectuates the legislative purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">First, we consider the choices within the context of section 11 itself. The Legislature in section 11 has itself defined a grave injury to include \u201closs of multiple fingers,\u201d \u201closs of multiple toes,\u201d \u201closs of nose,\u201d \u201closs of ear,\u201d \u201cpermanent and severe facial disfigurement\u201d and \u201closs of an index finger.\u201d None of those enumerated grave injuries has the effect of preventing an employee from performing daily life activities. Limitation of permanent total disability to a vegetative state thus is too harsh a test, out of step with the balance of the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Next, we consider the two alternatives within the larger context of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, where the customary definition of \u201cdisability\u201d relates to employment.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The Workers\u2019 Compensation Law deals with employment benefits, and the term \u201cdisability\u201d generally refers to inability to work. Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 201 (9) (A) and Department of Labor Rules and Regulations (12 NYCRR) \u00a7 363.1, for example, relate disability to inability to perform duties of employment.

(dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"ALI\">As between the two plausible definitions for a \u201cpermanent total disability\u201d with respect to an acquired brain injury under Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 11, the narrower one is, in my view, more faithful to legislative intent. Accordingly, I dissent, and would affirm the orders in <em>Rubeis </em>and <em>Largo-Chicaiza </em>and reverse the order in <em>Knauer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The 1996 amendment of Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 11, which created the \u201cgrave injury\u201d exception for indemnification or contribution claims against an injured worker\u2019s employer (L 1996, ch 635, \u00a7 2), was heavily negotiated. The particular compromises struck to develop the list of grave injuries are unknowable and, in some cases, the results seem downright peculiar. Why, for example, is the loss of an index finger a grave injury while the loss of a thumb is not? We clearly know, however, what the Legislature intended, which was to curtail third-party actions against the employer of an injured worker sharply and to do so, in large part, by designating grave injuries that were \u201cdeliberately both <em>narrowly and completely described,\u201d </em>\u201cexhaustive, not illustrative\u201d and \u201cnot intended to be extended further absent legislative action\u201d <em>(Castro v United Container Mach. Group, Inc., </em>96 NY2d 398, 402 [2001], quoting Governor\u2019s Approval Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1996, ch 635, at 55, 1996 NY Legis Ann, at 460).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Despite the Legislature\u2019s best efforts to insulate the grave injuries in section 11 from judicial interpretation (and the perceived attendant risk of judicial expansion), the phrase \u201can acquired injury to the brain caused by an external physical force resulting in permanent total disability\u201d is not self-explanatory. In adopting a standard for permanent total disability essentially requiring unemployability rather than the competing and narrower standard, the inability to perform the usual activities of daily living, the majority deploys tools of statutory interpretation that are tried-and-true, but unsuited to the particular task. Specifically, since many (but certainly not all) of the grave injuries listed in section 11 do not prevent an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>employee from performing daily life activities, the majority reasons that \u201c[Limitation of permanent total disability to a vegetative state ... is too harsh a test, out of step with the balance of the section\u201d (majority op at 417). This kind of text-based analysis ill-fits section 11 since the list of grave injuries is, as previously noted, the singular product of legislative compromise, and is exhaustive, not illustrative. It is difficult to reason by analogy to the other grave injuries on the list when these are as various as the loss of a finger and quadriplegia.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">The majority further observes that the word \u201cdisability\u201d generally refers to employment within the \u201clarger context\u201d of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (majority op at 417). But these employment-related definitions of \u201cdisability\u201d appear in provisions of the statute relating to payment of compensation <em>(see e.g. </em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 15 [1]; \u00a7\u00a7 37, 201 [9]). These provisions bear no relationship to section ll\u2019s very different and overriding goal\u2014to safeguard employers from impleader except in rare circumstances. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">When the Legislature adopted section 11, it intended to retrench an employer\u2019s exposure to costly third-party actions, and thereby reduce the employer\u2019s insurance premiums and out-of-pocket payments. The Legislature did this by barring third-party actions against employers except in the limited circumstances of a grave injury. As has been pointed out, the 1996 amendment of section 11 to carry out this goal \u201c[was] at best indifferent to the employee, its aim being to protect the employer\u201d <em>(Under Workers\u2019 Compensation Reform Act, Loss of Thumb is Held to Mean Loss of Use of Hand, Supporting Impleader of Employer, </em>109 Siegel\u2019s Practice Review 1 [May 2001]). In light of this goal and the concomitant legislative intent for us to exercise our interpretive function particularly sparingly and narrowly with respect to grave injuries under section 11,1 would adopt the more restrictive of the two plausible, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>and equally workable, definitions for a \u201cpermanent total disability\u201d developed by the Appellate Divisions; namely, that a \u201cpermanent total disability\u201d with respect to an acquired brain injury means the inability to perform the usual activities of daily living, essentially requiring a vegetative state.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Judges G.B. Smith, Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Graffeo and R.S. Smith concur with Chief Judge Kaye; Judge Read dissents and votes to affirm in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">In <em>Rubeis v Aqua Club, Inc.: </em>Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">In <em>Largo-Chicaiza v Westchester Scaffold Equipment Corp.: </em>Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Judges G.B. Smith, Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Graffeo and R.S. Smith concur with Chief Judge Kaye; Judge Read dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">In <em>Knauer v Anderson: </em>Judgment appealed from and order of the Appellate Division brought up for review affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b485-6\"> In fact, the Legislature seems to have borrowed section ll\u2019s definition of an acquired brain injury from Public Health Law \u00a7 2741, not from any other provision in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law. In relevant part, section 2741 defines \u201ctraumatic brain injury\u201d to mean <em>\u201can acquired injury to the brain caused by an external physical force resulting in total </em>or partial <em>disability </em>or impairment\u201d (emphasis added). The Legislature considerably limited this definition in section 11 by eliminating the words \u201cpartial\u201d and \u201cimpairment\u201d and adding the word \u201cpermanent\u201d to describe, along with \u201ctotal,\u201d the profound extent of disability required to quality as a grave injury. Nothing in section 2741 or article 27-CC of the Public Health Law relates the word \u201cdisability\u201d to the concept of employability.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
