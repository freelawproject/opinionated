Holding a public hearing under General Municipal Law \u00a7 705 is not an \u201caction\u201d within the meaning of article 8 of the Environmental Conservation Law requiring state environmental quality review. <em>(Programming &amp; Sys. v New York State Urban Dev. Corp., </em>93 AD2d 733, 61 NY2d 738; <em>Matter of Mayerat v Town Bd. of Town of Ashford, </em>185 AD2d 699; <em>Housing Justice Campaign v Koch, </em>164 AD2d 656.) II. Municipal annexation proceedings and procedures are established by the Legislature through General Municipal Law article 17, which was enacted pursuant to constitutional mandate under article IX, \u00a7 1 (d) of the New York State Constitution and may not be materially amended or changed by regulations of the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation. <em>(Matter of Connell v Town Bd. of Town of Wilmington, </em>113 AD2d 359, 67 NY2d 896; <em>Cross Westchester Dev.

III. The Appellate Division\u2019s reliance on the SEQR Handbook regarding municipal annexations is totally at odds with the will of the people in adopting article IX, \u00a7 1 (d) of the New York State Constitution and the legislative intent of General Municipal Law article 17 to provide an impartial process to determine the overall public interest in municipal annexations. <em>(Matter of Rochester Tel. Mobile Communications v Ober, </em>251 AD2d 1053; <em>Matter of Sour Mtn. Realty v New York State Dept. of Envtl.

IV If state environmental quality review be applicable to municipal annexations, then the environmental review should be conducted by the referees as lead agency (especially in view of the quasi-legislative role of the Appellate Division under General Municipal Law \u00a7 712) in order to preserve the impartiality of the process. <em>(Matter of Mayer at v Town Bd. of Town of Ashford, </em>185 AD2d 699; <em>Matter of Common Council of City of Albany v Town Bd. of Town of Bethlehem, </em>23 AD2d 381, 17 NY2d 594; <em>Matter of City Council of City of Mechanicville v Town Bd. of Town of Halfmoon, </em>27 NY2d 369; <em>Mayor of Vil. of Mount Kisco v Supervisor of Town of Bed-ford, </em>45 NY2d 335.) V New York courts have been reluctant to halt annexation proceedings for alleged lack of full state environmental quality review compliance where no specific or definitive plans for development have been put forward. <em>(Cross Westchester Dev.

If lack of state environmental quality review were to render the initial annexation petition legally defective, such defect should have been dealt with under General Municipal Law \u00a7 711 (3) through CPLR article 78. <em>(Matter of City Council of City of Saratoga Springs v Town Bd. of Town of Greenfield, </em>29 AD2d 167.) VII. If state environmental quality review be applicable to municipal annexations, then appellants should have the right to cure without stopping the proceedings under General Municipal Law \u00a7 712. <em>(Matter of City of Gloversville v Town of Johnstown, </em>210 AD2d 760; <em>Matter of Weinstein Enters, v Town of Kent, </em>171 AD2d 874.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b577-5\"><em>Arnis Zilgme, Town Attorney, </em>Newtonville <em>(Danielle M.

We conclude that SEQRA requirements apply to all annexations under article 17 of the General Municipal Law, but that the extent of environmental assessment that must be undertaken is dependent on the specific development plans associated with the transfer of territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">When a municipality seeks to acquire territory that lies within the boundaries of an adjacent municipality, article 17 of the General Municipal Law\u2014known as the Municipal Annexation Law\u2014sets forth the public interest concerns that must be weighed and the requisite procedural steps to be followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Generally, a proposed annexation is initiated by a petition signed by either 20% of the persons residing within the territory who are qualified to vote or by the owners of a majority of the assessed valuation of land in the area proposed to be transferred (see General Municipal Law \u00a7 703). Upon notice to the public and af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>fected residents, the governing boards of the affected municipalities conduct a joint public hearing on the issue whether the annexation is in the overall public interest <em>(see </em>General Municipal Law \u00a7\u00a7 704, 705). Within 90 days after the hearing, the governing board of each locality must adopt a resolution and issue a written order regarding whether annexation is in the overall public interest <em>(see </em>General Municipal Law \u00a7 711). In the event the local governments disagree, application may be made to the appropriate Appellate Division department to determine whether the proposed annexation is in the overall public interest <em>(see </em>General Municipal Law \u00a7 712).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">In this case, petitioner East-West Realty Corporation is the owner of approximately 37 acres of vacant property located in the Town of Colonie and adjacent to the City of Watervliet. The property is currently zoned to permit single family residences. East-West inquired of the Town about the possibility of constructing a senior citizen assisted-living development at the site and claims that the informal response from the Town was unfavorable. East-West then filed a petition with respondent Town Board of the Town of Colonie and petitioner City Council of the City of Watervliet seeking to have approximately 43 acres, including its 37 acres, transferred by annexation to Watervliet in accordance with article 17 of the General Municipal Law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">In December 2002, Colonie and Watervliet held a joint public hearing on the petition. East-West did not present a formal development plan, but indicated \u201cthe property is proposed to be developed as potentially assisted living senior apartments.\u201d Watervliet subsequently passed a resolution approving of the annexation and declaring the transfer of realty to be in the overall public interest. Colonie meanwhile adopted a resolution denying the petition on the ground that annexation was not in the overall public interest. Colonie took the position that review of potential environmental impact under SEQRA was necessary to fully assess whether annexation was in the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Faced with conflicting municipal resolutions, Watervliet commenced this proceeding in the Appellate Division, and East-West intervened as a petitioner. In its answer and by motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>dismiss the amended petition, Colonie asserted that Watervliet failed to comply with SEQRA requirements prior to approving the proposed annexation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> East-West cross-moved for an order appointing three referees to hear and report to the Court. The Appellate Division dismissed the petition and agreed with Colonie to the extent it held that \u201can appropriate form of SEQRA review of an annexation \u2018action\u2019 is required\u201d before either municipality could adopt a resolution regarding the annexation (309 AD2d 1114, 1116 [2003]). We granted Watervliet and East-West leave to appeal and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">SEQRA\u2019s primary purpose \u201cis to inject environmental considerations directly into governmental decision making\u201d <em>(Matter of Coca-Cola Bottling Co. v Board of Estimate, </em>72 NY2d 674, 679 [1988]). The Legislature\u2019s intent is reflected in the statute, which requires that \u201c[s]ocial, economic, and environmental factors [ ] be considered together in reaching decisions on proposed activities\u201d (ECL 8-0103 [7]). The procedures necessary to fulfill SEQRA review are carefully detailed in the statute and its implementing regulations (see ECL 8-0101\u20148-0117; 6 NYCRR part 617; <em>see also Matter of New York City Coalition to End Lead Poisoning v Vallone, </em>100 NY2d 337, 347-348 [2003]), and we have recognized the need for strict compliance with SEQRA requirements <em>(Matter of Merson v McNally, </em>90 NY2d 742, 750 [1997]).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">In this case, Watervliet and East-West initially argue that SE-QRA does not apply to municipal annexations because article 17 of the General Municipal Law, which does not incorporate SE-QRA explicitly, provides the exclusive process for annexations. They also contend that General Municipal Law \u00a7 718 (5) indicates that \u201c[t]he provisions of [article 17] shall be controlling notwithstanding any inconsistent act of the legislature to the contrary,\u201d and therefore article 17 exempts annexations from SEQRA. We conclude, however, that SEQRA is neither inconsistent with nor contrary to the procedures delineated in the General Municipal Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">It is well established that SEQRA \u201cis a law of general applicability\u201d <em>{Matter of Sour Mtn. Realty, Inc. v New York State Dept. ofEnvtl. Conservation, </em>260 AD2d 920, 923 [1999], <em>Iv denied </em>93 NY2d 815 [1999]). Moreover, the Legislature has declared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>\u201cthat \u2018to the fullest extent possible\u2019 statutes should be administered by the State and its political subdivisions in accordance with the policies set forth in SEQRA and that environmental factors should be considered in reaching decisions on proposed projects\u201d <em>(Matter of Tri-County Taxpayers Assn. v Town Bd. of Town of Queensbury, </em>55 NY2d 41, 46 [1982] [quoting ECL 8-0103 (6)]). The overriding goal of article 17 of the General Municipal Law is to assess whether a proposed annexation is in the best interest of the public. After a joint hearing predicated upon a petition for annexation is held <em>(see </em>General Municipal Law \u00a7 705), each municipality must, within 90 days of the hearing, decide whether annexation is in the \u201cover-all public interest\u201d (General Municipal Law \u00a7 711 [1]). Where the involved municipalities disagree on whether annexation is in the public\u2019s best interest\u2014as happened in this case\u2014the Appellate Division may be called upon to consider \u201cwhether the proposed annexation is in the over-all public interest\u201d (General Municipal Law \u00a7 712 [1], [10]). The aims of SEQRA are congruous\u2014the objective is to determine \u201c \u2018whether or not a project or activity should be approved or undertaken in the best over-all interest of the people of the State\u2019 \u201d <em>(Matter of WEOK Broadcasting Corp. v Planning Bd. of Town of Lloyd, </em>79 NY2d 373, 380 [1992], quoting <em>Matter of Town of Henrietta v Department of Envtl. Conservation, </em>76 AD2d 215, 222 [1980]). We believe that SEQRA promotes, rather than undermines, the public interest purposes of article 17 of the General Municipal Law and therefore conclude that General Municipal Law \u00a7 718 (5) does not exempt the annexation process from SEQRA review.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Watervliet and East-West further submit that SEQRA review is not required because annexation, in and of itself, is not an \u201caction\u201d as defined in article 8 of the Environmental Conservation Law. They contend that a proposed annexation must be accompanied by a specific development plan before SEQRA is triggered. Because East-West has no definite plans for the site and has not filed any formal application for development of its property, they claim that any SEQRA analysis is premature. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Article 8 of the Environmental Conservation Law creates the procedural and substantive requirements for governmental enti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>ties to follow when reviewing the environmental consequences of proposed projects or \u201cactions\u201d <em>(see Matter of WEOK Broadcasting Corp., </em>79 NY2d at 381). \u201cAction\u201d is a term of art in the SEQRA statute and is broadly defined to include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\">\u201c(i) projects or activities directly undertaken by any agency; or projects or activities supported in whole or part through contracts, grants, subsidies, loans, or other forms of funding assistance from one or more agencies; or projects or activities involving the issuance to a person of a lease, permit, license, certificate or other entitlement for use or permission to act by one or more agencies; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">\u201c(ii) policy, regulations, and procedure-making\u201d (ECL 8-0105 [4]).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">Pursuant to its authority under section 8-0113 of the Environmental Conservation Law, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) has promulgated regulations that refine the definition of \u201cactions\u201d for SEQRA purposes. For example, under DEC\u2019s regulations, \u201cactions\u201d include \u201cagency planning and policy making activities that may affect the environment and commit the agency to a definite course of future decisions\u201d and the \u201cadoption of agency rules, regulations and procedures, including local laws, codes, ordinances, executive orders and resolutions that may affect the environment\u201d (6 NYCRR 617.2 [b] [2], [3]).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">In 1987, apparently in response to <em>Matter of Connell v Town Bd. of Town of Wilmington </em>(113 AD2d 359 [1985], <em>affd </em>67 NY2d 896 [1986]),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> DEC amended its regulations to clarify that the annexation of 100 or more contiguous acres constitutes a Type I action <em>(see </em>6 NYCRR 617.4 [b] [4]). In doing so, DEC implicitly determined that an annexation of less than 100 acres is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>\u201cunlisted action\u201d <em>(see Cross Westchester Dev. Corp. v Town Bd. of Town of Greenburgh, </em>141 AD2d 796, 797 [1988]; SEQR Handbook, at 105 [1992 ed]).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">In urging that a proposed annexation, absent a formal development project, cannot be an \u201caction\u201d for SEQRA purposes, Watervliet and East-West in effect assert that DEC\u2019s regulation is invalid. Because DEC is entitled to deference in its construction and application of environmental conservation statutes, our standard of review is limited to whether DEC\u2019s interpretation is unreasonable or irrational <em>(see Matter of Rodriguez v Perales, </em>86 NY2d 361, 367 [1995]; <em>Matter of Astoria Generating Co. v General Counsel of N.Y. State Dept. of Envtl. Conservation, </em>299 AD2d 706, 707 [2002]).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">We cannot say that DEC\u2019s classification of annexations as actions subject to SEQRA is unreasonable. Annexations are often the first step toward the development of real property and may involve a change in municipal services or land use regulation. A principal goal of SEQRA is \u201cto incorporate environmental considerations into the decisionmaking process at the earliest opportunity\u201d <em>(Matter of Neville v Koch, </em>79 NY2d 416, 426 [1992]; <em>see also </em>6 NYCRR 617.1 [c]). Based on SEQRA\u2019s broad definition of \u201cactions,\u201d which should be liberally construed to facilitate SEQRA\u2019s salutary purposes, it is not irrational to require SEQRA review of annexations while municipalities contemplate the ramifications of an annexation proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\"><em>Matter of Programming &amp; Sys. v New York State Urban Dev. Corp. </em>(61 NY2d 738 [1984]) does not dictate a contrary result. In that case, the Urban Development Corporation (UDC) had been involved with the City of New York in attempting to redevelop a neighborhood surrounding a building leased by the petitioner. The petitioner, whose lease would be terminated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>without compensation in the event of an eminent domain proceeding, commenced a proceeding against the UDC, alleging that before it could proceed any further, the UDC had to prepare and file an environmental impact statement. The UDC countered that any redevelopment in the area was still in the planning stage and therefore such environmental review was not required. We affirmed the dismissal of the petition, holding that although the UDC had taken preliminary steps in its redevelopment plan, \u201can environmental impact statement is not required until a specific project plan for the development is actually formulated and proposed\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 739).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\"><em>Programming </em>is distinguishable for three reasons. First, although East-West\u2019s tenuous plans may be analogous to the lack of a definite project plan in <em>Programming, </em>this case involves a specific request for governmental action\u2014approval of an annexation proposal. Second, unlike <em>Programming, </em>a DEC regulation designates the proposed governmental activity at issue as an \u201caction\u201d for purposes of SEQRA application. Finally, whereas the particular issue in <em>Programming </em>was whether an environmental impact statement was necessary, the issue here is whether any form of SEQRA review is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Having concluded that SEQRA applies to municipal annexations in general, we next address the appropriate extent or level of environmental review applicable to the proposed annexation before us. DEC\u2019S regulations contemplate two types of environmental review: the environmental assessment form (EAF) and the environmental impact statement (EIS). All \u201cactions\u201d subject to SEQRA (i.e., Type I and unlisted actions) initially require the preparation of an EAF, whose purpose is to aid an agency \u201cin determining the environmental significance or nonsignificance of actions\u201d (6 NYCRR 617.2 [m]; <em>see also </em>617.6 [a] [2], [3]).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After reviewing the EAF, if the lead agency (which can be a designated municipality) determines \u201cthat the action may include the potential for at least one significant adverse environmental impact,\u201d a positive declaration must be issued and completion of an EIS becomes necessary (6 NYCRR 617.7 [a] [1]; <em>see also </em>ECL 8-0109 [2]). The EIS is a more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>comprehensive evaluation of environmental impact.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Conversely, an EIS will not be required and the agency may issue a negative declaration where it concludes \u201cthat there will be no adverse environmental impacts or that the identified adverse environmental impacts will not be significant\u201d (6 NYCRR 617.7 [a] [2]). Thus, \u201c[w]hile an EAF is used to determine significance or nonsignificance, the purpose of an EIS is to examine the identified potentially significant environmental impacts which may result from a project\u201d <em>(Matter of Merson, </em>90 NY2d at 751).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Here, because the proposed annexation of approximately 43 acres is an unlisted action, an EAF is appropriate and must be completed before Watervliet or Colonie acts to adopt or reject the petition for annexation. Since the annexation proposal lacks a specific project plan that has been officially submitted or a rezoning proposal that changes the use for which the property may be utilized, the EAF will necessarily be limited to the annexation itself and its effects. Where, on the other hand, an annexation is premised upon a formal project plan, environmental review will be more extensive and must address the specific use of the property in evaluating the related environmental effects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number><em>(see Programming, </em>61 NY2d at 739; <em>see also Cross Westchester Dev. Corp., </em>141 AD2d at 797).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">We have considered Watervliet\u2019s and East-West\u2019s remaining arguments and found them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B. Smith, Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Read and R.S. Smith concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-9\">. \u201cAnnexation\u201d is defined as \u201c[a]n alteration of the boundaries of a county, city, town or village which has the effect of adding territory to it. Such term shall not include the creation or dissolution of a county, city, town or village, or the consolidation of two or more counties, two or more cities, two or more towns or two or more villages, respectively, or the diminution of the area of a village pursuant to section 18-1804 of the village law\u201d (General Municipal Law \u00a7 701 [1]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b580-8\">. If the municipalities agree, \u201csuch determination shall be final and conclusive\u201d (General Municipal Law \u00a7 711 [4]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b580-9\">. The premises affected by the annexation petition consists of several parcels: 36.6 acres owned by East-West, 2.8 acres owned by Rait Highland Club, LLC and a 3.8 acre Niagara Mohawk utility corridor. The latter two owners are not parties to this proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b581-8\">. We agree with the Appellate Division that Colonie properly raised the SEQRA issue as an affirmative defense in its answer to the petition. Because Colonie served the answer within four months of Watervliet\u2019s adoption of its resolution approving the annexation, the objection was timely (see CPLR 217).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b582-6\">. Notably, article 17 of the General Municipal Law was enacted in 1963 <em>(see </em>L 1963, ch 844), 12 years before SEQRA was adopted in 1975 <em>(see </em>L 1975, ch 612).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b583-10\">. SEQRA also specifies that \u201c \u2018[actions\u2019 do not include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-11\">\u201c(i) enforcement proceedings or the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in determining whether or not to institute such proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-12\">\u201c(ii) official acts of a ministerial nature, involving no exercise of discretion; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-13\">\u201c(iii) maintenance or repair involving no substantial changes in existing structure or facility\u201d (ECL 8-0105 [5]).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b583-14\">. In <em>Connell, </em>the Appellate Division held that a municipality\u2019s adoption of a resolution approving an annexation \u201cwas not an \u2018action\u2019 as defined by SE-QRA\u201d and therefore SEQRA review was unnecessary (113 AD2d at 361). We affirmed on the narrow ground that the proceeding was untimely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b584-7\">. The regulations classify actions as Type I, Type II or unlisted, depending on the potential effects on the environment <em>(.Matter of Merson v </em>McNally, 90 NY2d 742, 750 [1997]). A Type I action \u201ccarries with it the presumption that it is likely to have a significant adverse impact on the environment and may require an EIS [environmental impact statement]\u201d (6 NYCRR 617.4 [a] [1]). A Type II action is not subject to SEQRA review because it has \u201cbeen determined [by DEC] not to have a significant impact on the environment or [is] otherwise precluded from environmental review under Environmental Conservation Law, article 8\u201d (6 NYCRR 617.5 [a]). Finally, all remaining actions are classified as \u201cunlisted\u201d actions (6 NYCRR 617.2 [ak]). Type I and unlisted actions are subject to SEQRA review, and Type I actions \u201care more likely to require the preparation of an EIS than Unlisted actions\u201d (6 NYCRR 617.4 [a]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b585-9\">. Type I actions require the preparation of a \u201cfull\u201d EAF whereas unlisted actions may use either the \u201cfull\u201d or \u201cshort\u201d EAF (6 NYCRR 617.6 [a] [2], [3]; <em>see also </em>6 NYCRR 617.20 Appendices A, C). The agency may waive the requirement of an EAF if a draft EIS is submitted instead (6 NYCRR 617.6 [a] [4]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b586-6\">. If a lead agency decides that an EIS is necessary, a draft EIS (DEIS) must be prepared. After the agency accepts a DEIS, it must be filed with DEC and copies made available to members of the public on request (ECL 8-0109 [4]; 6 NYCRR 617.12 [b]). The agency can also conduct a public hearing on notice (6 NYCRR 617.9 [a] [4]). Unless the agency withdraws the proposed action or determines that it \u201cwill not have a significant adverse impact on the environment,\u201d the agency must prepare a final EIS (FEIS) 45 days after any hearing or 60 days after the filing of the DEIS, whichever occurs later (6 NYCRR 617.9 [a] [5]). Before issuing final approval, the agency must consider the FEIS and make written findings that the requirements of SEQRA have been met (6 NYCRR 617.11).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">As to content, the EIS must include a description of the proposed action, its environmental impacts and any unavoidable adverse effects (ECL 8-0109 [2] [a]-[c]); \u201calternatives to the proposed action\u201d (ECL 8-0109 [2] [d]), including a \u201cno action alternative\u201d (6 NYCRR 617.9 [b] [5] [v]); and \u201cmitigation measures proposed to minimize the environmental impact\u201d (ECL 8-0109 [2] [f]; <em>see also </em>6 NYCRR 617.9 [b] [5] [iv]). An agency must \u201cmake an explicit finding that the requirements of [SEQRA] have been met and that consistent with social, economic and other essential considerations, to the maximum extent practicable, adverse environmental effects revealed in the environmental impact statement process will be minimized or avoided\u201d (ECL 8-0109 [8]; <em>see generally Matter of Jackson v New York State Urban Dev. Corp., </em>67 NY2d 400, 415-416 [1986]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b587-9\">. If annexation includes a rezoning proposal that would change the permissible use of the parcel, \u201cenvironmental review may be conducted on a conceptual basis\u201d even where no specific project is proposed because the new zoning requirements provide the parameters to conduct meaningful review <em>(Matter of Neville, </em>79 NY2d at 426; see <em>also Matter of Brew v Hess, </em>124 AD2d 962, 965 [1986]; <em>Matter of Kirk-Astor Dr. Neighborhood Assn. v Town Bd. of Town of Pittsford, </em>106 AD2d 868, 869 [1984], <em>appeal dismissed </em>66 NY2d 896 [1985]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
