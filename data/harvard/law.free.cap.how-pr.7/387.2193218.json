If a <em>feme covert </em>plaintiff is not an infant, or lunatic, &amp;c., no order for leave to sue by next friend, or for the appointment of next friend, is necessary (1 <em>Hoff. Pr. </em>66). It seems he should be a man of substance; and if he is insolvent, the proceedings may be stayed a reasonable time till security is filed, and the complaint may be dismissed if that is not done (Lawrence vs. Lawrence, 3 <em>Paige, </em>267; Fulton vs. Rosevelt, 1 <em>id. </em>178; Robertson vs. Robertson, 3 <em>id. </em>387; Remnington vs. Alvin, 1 <em>S. &amp; S. 264; </em>Barlee vs. Barlee, <em>id. </em>150: Anon. 1 <em>Atk. </em>570; 1 <em>Dan. Pr. 144; </em>3 <em>Wend. 424; </em>3 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>360; Andrew vs. Craddock, 1 <em>Eq. Ca. .Ab. </em>72; <em>S. C. Prec. in Chan. </em>376). In case of an infant sole plaintiff, the Revised Statutes required that the next friend should be appointed by the proper officer (2 <em>R. S. </em>445-6). The Code requires a guardian for an infant party, to be appointed by the court or a judge <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 115-6). But if of full age, as in this case, I find no precedent of an order appointing a next friend. No one can sue as her next friend without her consent <em>(Stor. Eq. Pl. </em>\u00a7 61), which is usually evinced by a written consent signed by her (1 <em>Hoff. Pr. 66; App. No. </em>11; 2 <em>Barb. Ch. Pr, </em>263, 687). In Remington vs. Alvin, <em>supra, </em>it appeared the next friend was the paramour of the plaintiff and insolvent; a person not likely to be appointed by the court. And in Bligh vs. Tredgett (8 <em>Eng. L. </em>&amp; <em>E. R. </em>79), one whom the solicitor had substituted in the place of a deceased <em>pro. ami, </em>was made liable for all the costs, though the substitution was without his knowledge, he having never heard of the suit until a motion to dismiss the bill (and see <em>Mitford, </em>28; Randolph vs. Dickerson, 5 <em>Paige, </em>577; Andrews vs. Craddock, <em>supra ; </em>Greenaway vs. Rotherham, 9 <em>Sim. </em>88; 1 <em>Dan. Pr. </em>14; Smith vs. Myers, 3 <em>Madd. R. 474; </em>1 <em>Moult. Ch. Pr. </em>107; <em>2 id. </em>490; Anon. 1 <em>Ves. Jr. </em>409, <em>and notes'). </em>This case might have been decided differently here, as to the liability for costs; but I do not understand any action of the court is necessary to appoint a <em>pro. ami </em>in these cases. Nor do I understand that the Code has changed the practice as to the manner of naming or appointing a next friend.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
