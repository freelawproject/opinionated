The district court dismissed the employees\u2019 claims, finding that (1) the claims constituted a <em>de facto </em>appeal from a previous state court judgment which rejected similar arguments and that, therefore, under the <em>Rook-er-Feldman</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>doctrine, the district court did not have jurisdiction to consider these claims; and (2) because the related state court judgment was on appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court, any ruling by the district court would be an \u201cundue interference with state proceedings\u201d and that, therefore, the district court must abstain from exercising its jurisdiction pursuant to the <em>Younger </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1267-9\">Both the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine and the <em>Yownger </em>doctrine are extremely narrow exceptions to the federal courts\u2019 \u201cvirtually unflagging\u201d duty \u201cto adjudicate claims within their jurisdiction.\u201d <em>New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v. Council of the City of New Orleans, </em>491 U.S. 350, 359, 109 S.Ct. 2506, 105 L.Ed.2d 298 (1989) (\u201cNOPSI\u201d). Upon review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we conclude that neither of these limited exceptions to our jurisdiction applies. We conclude, however, that the doctrine of <em>res judicata, </em>as applicable through the Full Faith and Credit Clause, does require dismissal of this case. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the disposition, although on a different ground than that relied upon by the district court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1267-14\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-15\">The General Retirement System for Employees of Jefferson County, Alabama (the \u201cRetirement System\u201d) was created in 1965 by an act of the Alabama legislature. It is funded by yearly contributions from the participating Jefferson County employees which are matched by yearly contributions from the County and by the income generated from the investment of those contributions. At some point during the 1970s, approximately 238 Jefferson County sheriffs deputies voluntarily withdrew from the Retirement System and removed their contributions, with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-16\">In 2003, the Alabama Legislature approved a local law, Alabama Act 2003-343 (the \u201cAct\u201d), allowing Jefferson County employees who had previously withdrawn from the Retirement System to rejoin and \u201cmake up\u201d for up to 20 years in which they did not contribute to or participate in the Retirement System. The Act also allowed Jefferson County employees who had not withdrawn to convert periods of unpaid service to paid service upon making an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>additional contribution to the Retirement System. The Act then required the County to contribute matching funds for any employee taking advantage of the Act and to pay any additional amounts necessary to make the Retirement System actuarially sound. In other words, the Act required the County to contribute additional funds to replicate investment earnings that would have occurred had the employees in question continually contributed to the Retirement System.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">After the Act was passed, two groups of county employees filed suit in state court to establish the constitutionality of the Act and to force the County to implement it. Sheriff Deputy Jimmy Black brought one of the class-action lawsuits on behalf of all deputies who had opted out of the Retirement System and who were seeking to rejoin as allowed under the Act. Certain other Jefferson County employees also sought a hearing before a special master when the County did not allow them to convert unpaid service to paid service under the Act. Employee-members who had not opted out of the Retirement System brought a separate lawsuit seeking to invalidate the Act. These cases were all consolidated in the Jefferson County Circuit Court, with Black identified as the lead plaintiff <em>{\u201cBlack\u201d). </em>In November of 2005, the <em>Black </em>court ruled that the Act, which created additional pension benefits for certain employees of Jefferson County, was constitutional and due to be enforced (the \u201cNovember 2005 Order\u201d). Thereafter, the court set deadlines for the County\u2019s compliance with the terms of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">In an effort to offset the costs of funding the enhanced pension benefits mandated by the Act, the Jefferson County Commission passed Resolution No. 2006-683 on June 7, 2006 (the \u201cResolution\u201d). The Resolution states that if a member of the Retirement System elects to take advantage of the additional pension benefits provided by the Act, he or she will no longer be eligible to receive the discretionary, non-pension benefits of retiree health insurance and sick leave retirement benefits. The County distributed the Resolution to persons eligible under the Act, giving them the opportunity to elect between (1) obtaining the Act\u2019s enhanced benefits and foregoing the non-pension benefits or (2) remaining eligible for retiree health insurance coverage and sick leave retirement benefits and foregoing the enhanced pension benefits available under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-7\">On June 19, 2006, the <em>Black </em>plaintiffs made a motion for supplemental relief before the Jefferson County Circuit Court, arguing that the Resolution \u201cimpermissibly impairs and impedes\u201d the November 2005 Order, which instructed the County to implement the Act. Specifically, the <em>Black </em>plaintiffs argued that the Resolution discourages those entitled to enhanced benefits under the Act from electing to receive those benefits, impermissibly imposes additional burdens upon the exercise of the rights established under the Act, and frustrates the enforcement and implementation of the Act as ordered by the court. Accordingly, the plaintiffs asked the court to enjoin the County- from enforcing the Resolution as inconsistent with its Order to implement the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-8\">The <em>Black </em>court held an evidentiary hearing on this motion for supplemental relief and, on September 14, 2006, it issued an order stating, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1268-9\">The Jefferson County Commission has been vested with the responsibility for maintaining a balanced budget for the County and funding and overseeing vital public services for the citizens of the County. In adopting the Resolution, the Commission did not abuse their vested discretion, and did not engage in fraud. This Court\u2019s inquiry must end there, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>the authority to determine the appropriations necessary for the performance of government function is a legislative power, not a judicial power. This Court would infringe upon the boundaries between our State\u2019s branches of government delineated in Sec. 43 of the Alabama Constitution if it were to enjoin this Resolution. This Court also finds that the issues presented in Plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the Resolution are completely separate and involve different facts, issues and theories than the previous action challenging Act 03-343. Thus, the Court finds that there is no justiciable issue involved in the Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Supplemental Relief. Therefore, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Supplemental Relief is DENIED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1269-5\">(citations omitted, emphasis added). The <em>Black </em>plaintiffs did not appeal the denial of their motion for supplemental relief. On November 17, 2006, the court certified its judgment in the <em>Black </em>litigation as final. Neither party appealed from this final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-6\">On May 18, 2007, six Jefferson County employees, including lead plaintiff Steven Green,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> filed a class action lawsuit against the Retirement System and the County in the Circuit Court for Jefferson County, Alabama <em>(\u201cGreen </em>/\u201d). The <em>Green I </em>plaintiffs sought to represent the class of \u201c107 Jefferson County employees\u201d who had elected to receive the additional pension benefits provided under the Act. They argued that, by adopting the Resolution, the County had retaliated against and treated the putative class unequally. Accordingly, the <em>Green I </em>plaintiffs sought a declaration that the Resolution was invalid, a permanent injunction preventing the operation of the Resolution, and damages measured by the value of the sick leave retirement credit and retiree health insurance they had been forced to forego by the Resolution. The County moved for summary judgment, arguing (1) that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred by the doctrines of <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel; (2) that Art. Ill, \u00a7 43, Ala. Const. 1901, prevented the trial court from hearing the plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the Resolution; (3) that Alabama law does not recognize an equal-protection challenge; and (4) that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are due to be dismissed because the plaintiffs did not present their claims to the Jefferson County Commission before commencing their action and, thereby, violated \u00a7 6-5-20 et seq., Ala.Code 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-9\">On September 17, 2007, the <em>Green I </em>court issued a brief order stating, <em>in toto:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbC\">For the reasons stated therein, the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment is due to be GRANTED. Neither the named class representatives nor any member of the putative class may maintain the claims raised in the complaint. This action is therefore DISMISSED with prejudice, costs taxed as paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1269-10\">The <em>Gkreen I </em>plaintiffs moved the trial judge to recuse himself and moved for a new trial or, in the alternative, to alter, amend, or vacate the judgment or for relief from judgment. The trial court denied these motions without comment. On November 1, 2007, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the Alabama Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-11\">On January 29, 2008, while <em>Green I </em>was pending on appeal before the Alabama Supreme Court, 104 Jefferson County em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>ployees, again led by Steven Green, filed the instant lawsuit against the Retirement System and Jefferson County Commission in the federal district court for the Northern District of Alabama <em>(\u201cGreen II\u201d). </em>All six of the named plaintiffs from <em>Green I </em>are plaintiffs in this litigation; 98 other employees are named as plaintiffs in <em>Green II, </em>all of whom elected to receive the additional pension benefits provided under the Act and were therefore members of the putative class in <em>Green I. </em>In their complaint, the <em>Green II </em>plaintiffs allege that, by adopting the Resolution, the defendants discriminated against them and violated their \u201cprocedural due process rights under the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution\u201d and \u201cestablish[ed] a policy of discriminating against them\u201d in violation of the Public Health Services Act (\u201cPHSA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300bb-l to 8. Accordingly, the plaintiffs assert two causes of action: (1) for equitable relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300bb-7<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and (2) for equitable relief and damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-4\">Defendants filed a motion to dismiss <em>Green II. </em>The district court referred the motion to a magistrate judge. After converting the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment and allowing the parties to submit additional briefing, the magistrate judge issued a Report and Recommendation (\u201cR&amp;R\u201d), recommending that the defendants\u2019 motion be granted. The R&amp;R found that <em>res judicata </em>did not require dismissal, but (1) pursuant to the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, the district court had no jurisdiction to consider the claims brought by the six plaintiffs who were a party to <em>Green I </em>and (2) the <em>Younger </em>doctrine required the court to abstain from exercising jurisdiction over the claims asserted by the remaining ninety-eight plaintiffs. Accordingly, the R&amp;R suggested that summary judgment was appropriate as to all of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-9\">The plaintiffs filed objections to the R&amp;R, to which the defendants responded. On October 7, 2008, in a brief opinion, the district court adopted the R&amp;R in full and granted summary judgment in favor of defendants. The plaintiffs timely filed their notice of appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-10\">On November 14, 2008, while this appeal was pending before this court, the Alabama Supreme Court affirmed the state trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in <em>Green I, </em>- So.2d -, 2008 WL 4892051 (Ala. Nov. 14, 2008). The Alabama Supreme Court held that the decision in <em>Black </em>was on the merits such that the claims asserted in <em>Green I were </em>barred under the doctrine of <em>res judicata. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1270-13\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-14\">We review dismissals for lack of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Barbour v. Haley, </em>471 F.3d 1222, 1225 (11th Cir.2006). We review a district court\u2019s decision to abstain from exercising its jurisdiction for an abuse of discretion. <em>31 Foster Children v.

Pruitt, </em>174 F.3d 1215, 1219 (11th Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-15\">Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). \u201cWe can affirm a judgment on any legal ground, regardless of the grounds addressed and relied upon by the district court.\u201d <em>Cuddeback v. Fla. Bd. of Educ., </em>381 F.3d 1230, 1235-36 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-6\">On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in finding that <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>and <em>Younger </em>\u2014 -which represent narrow exceptions to a district court\u2019s jurisdiction \u2014 divested the court of jurisdiction in this case. For the reasons stated herein, we agree. Nonetheless, we affirm the grant of summary judgment in this case because, based on the <em>res judicata </em>principles of Alabama law, the state court\u2019s final judgments in the related cases of <em>Black </em>and <em>Green I </em>preclude our consideration of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-7\">\n<em>A. Rooker-Feldman Doctrine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-8\">Generally speaking, the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine recognizes that federal district courts do not have jurisdiction to act as appellate courts and precludes them from reviewing final state court decisions. The underlying rational for this doctrine comes from two federal jurisdictional statutes: 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257. First, section 1331 provides that federal district courts \u201cshall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising\u201d under federal law, but does not provide for appellate jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. Second, section 1257 provides for Supreme Court review of state court judgments when certain federal questions arise. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257(a) (\u201cFinal judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had, may be reviewed by the Supreme Court by writ of certiorari.\u201d). \u201cTaken together, the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine draws a \u2018negative inference\u2019 from section 1257: \u2018because Congress <em>only </em>provided for review of state court judgments by the Supreme Court, Congress therefore intended to preclude lower federal courts from exercising such review.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nicholson v. Shafe, </em>558 F.3d 1266, 1272 (11th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Federaci\u00f3n de Maestros de Puerto Rico v. Junta de Relaciones del Trabajo de Puerto Rico, </em>410 F.3d 17, 21 (1st Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-10\">In the recent case of <em>Exxon Mobil, </em>the Supreme Court warned the lower courts that we have extended this narrow doctrine \u201cfar beyond the contours of the <em>Rooker </em>and <em>Feldman </em>cases.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). The Court instructed that the doctrine is \u201cconfined to cases of the kind from which the doctrine acquired its name: cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court further noted that <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>does not prohibit a \u201cdistrict court from exercising subject-matter jurisdiction simply because a party attempts to litigate in federal court a matter previously litigated in state court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 293, 125 S.Ct. 1517. Rather, \u201c[disposition of the federal action, once the state-court adjudication is complete, would be governed by preclusion law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1271-11\">Having received the Supreme Court\u2019s guidance in <em>Exxon Mobil, </em>the Eleventh Circuit recently considered the application of <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>in <em>Nicholson, </em>558 F.3d at 1272. In <em>Nicholson, </em>we adopted the rule followed by several other circuits \u201cthat state proceedings have not ended for purposes of <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>when an appeal from the state court judgment re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>mains pending at the time the plaintiff commences the federal court action that complains of injuries caused by the state court judgment and invites review and rejection of that judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Guttman v. Khalsa, </em>446 F.3d 1027 (10th Cir.2006), <em>Federacion de Maestros de Puerto Rico, </em>410 F.3d at 17, <em>Domheim v. Sholes, </em>430 F.3d 919 (8th Cir.2005)). We explained that \u201cconfining the scope of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine to instances where the state proceedings have ended, in line with both the <em>Rooker </em>and <em>Feldman </em>cases,\u201d heeds the Supreme Court\u2019s warning that the doctrine is limited and should be applied narrowly. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Exxon Mobil, </em>544 U.S. at 283, 125 S.Ct. 1517).</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-4\">Applied here, the chronology of significant dates is as follows: the state court granted summary judgment in <em>Green I </em>on September 17, 2006; the <em>Green I </em>plaintiffs appealed the grant of summary judgment to the Alabama Supreme Court on November 1, 2007; the <em>Green II </em>plaintiffs filed the instant federal action on January 29, 2008; and the Alabama Supreme Court affirmed the state trial court\u2019s ruling in <em>Green I </em>on November 14, 2008, nearly one year after the commencement of these federal proceedings. As such, because an appeal of <em>Green I </em>remained pending in the state court at the time the <em>Green II </em>plaintiffs filed the instant case, the state court proceedings had not ended for purposes of <em>Rooker-Feldman, </em>as clarified by <em>Exxon Mobil </em>and <em>Nicholson. </em>Accordingly, this case was not a <em>de facto </em>appeal from a final state court judgment and the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine did not divest the federal district court of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-5\">\n<em>B. Younger Abstention</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-6\">In <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>a federal plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of a state statute under which he was being prosecuted in state court as a defendant. 401 U.S. at 39, 91 S.Ct. 746. The Supreme Court, concluding that the state criminal proceeding offered a sufficient forum for the plaintiff to raise his constitutional defense, abstained from hearing the plaintiffs claim and stated the general rule that a federal district court must refrain from enjoining pending criminal state court proceedings except under certain special circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 53-54, 91 S.Ct. 746. Such abstention, the Supreme Court recognized, is required by \u201c[o]ur Federalismos]\u201d notion of comity, that is, \u201ca proper respect for state functions\u201d and \u201cthe belief that the National Government will fare best if the States and their institutions are left free to perform their separate functions in their separate ways.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1272-8\">The abstention doctrine derived from <em>Younger </em>applies most often in cases involving pending state criminal prosecutions. <em>See, e.g., O\u2019Shea v. Littleton, </em>414 U.S. 488, 500, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974) (rejecting challenge to state criminal justice system \u201caimed at controlling or preventing the occurrence of specific events that might take place in the course of future state criminal trials\u201d); <em>Luckey v. Miller, </em>976 F.2d 673, 677-78 (11th Cir.1992) (abstaining from an attempt to \u201crestrain every indigent prosecution and contest every indigent conviction until the systemic improvements [plaintiffs] seek are in place\u201d). Early on, the Court expanded <em>Younger </em>abstention to apply to pending civil proceedings that are \u201cakin to a criminal prosecution,\u201d <em>see, e.g., Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., </em>420 U.S. 592, 95 S.Ct. 1200, 43 L.Ed.2d 482 (1975) (nuisance statute), <em>Middlesex County Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar, </em>457 U.S. 423, 432, 102 S.Ct. 2515, 73 L.Ed.2d 116 (1982) (state bar disciplinary hearing), and, more recently, in strictly civil proceedings which implicate state courts\u2019 \u201cimportant interests in administering certain aspects of their judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>systems.\u201d <em>Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., </em>481 U.S. 1, 12-13, 107 S.Ct. 1519, 95 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987) (requirement for the posting of bond pending appeal); <em>see Juidice v. Vail, </em>430 U.S. 327, 334, 97 S.Ct. 1211, 51 L.Ed.2d 376 (1977) (state contempt process).</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-5\">Even as the principles of <em>Younger </em>have expanded, however, the Supreme Court has made clear that the abstention doctrine is not triggered in a civil context unless the federal injunction requested would create an <em>\u201cundue </em>interference with state proceedings.\u201d <em>NOPSI, </em>491 U.S. at 359,109 S.Ct. 2506 (emphasis added). The <em>Younger </em>doctrine, like the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, is \u201can extraordinary and narrow exception to the duty of a district court to adjudicate a controversy properly before it.\u201d <em>Colo. River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, </em>424 U.S. 800, 813, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976) (quoting <em>County of Allegheny v. Frank Mashuda Co., </em>360 U.S. 185, 188-89, 79 S.Ct. 1060, 3 L.Ed.2d 1163 (1959)). Accordingly, a district court should not lightly shirk its \u201cvirtually unflagging obligation to exercise the jurisdiction given [to it].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 818, 96 S.Ct. 1236. In addition, the Supreme Court has instructed that <em>Younger </em>only applies where the state proceeding at issue involves \u201corders that are uniquely in furtherance of the state courts\u2019 ability to perform their <em>judicial </em>functions ... it has never been suggested that <em>Younger </em>requires abstention in deference to a state judicial proceeding reviewing legislative or executive action.\u201d <em>NOPSI, </em>491 U.S. at 368, 109 S.Ct. 2506 (emphasis added); <em>Wexler v. Lepore, </em>385 F.3d 1336, 1338-39 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that a pending state civil action does not require the federal court to abstain \u201cunless the requested federal relief would result in meticulous and burdensome federal oversight of state court or court-like functions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-7\">In this case, the district court, adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s R&amp;R, found that <em>Younger </em>barred its consideration of the remaining 98 plaintiffs\u2019 claims, explaining that because <em>Green I </em>was pending before the Alabama Supreme Court at the time, \u201cif this court were to grant the relief requested by the plaintiff, it would effectively bar any action taken by the state courts.\u201d Furthermore, the district court noted that \u201cthe proceedings most certainly implicate a number of important state interests.\u201d However, as the district court itself noted, \u201cThe crux of the <em>[Green II] </em>complaint turns on the validity of a <em>legislative enactment </em>of the Jefferson County Commission, a political subdivision of the state, which affected discretionary employee benefits of government employees.\u201d Accordingly, it is clear that the plaintiffs in this case did not ask the district court to enjoin or otherwise interfere with the pending state court action; rather, they challenged a legislative act of the Jefferson County Commission under federal law while, at the same time, state law challenges to the same legislative act were pending on appeal with the Alabama Supreme Court. Nothing in <em>Younger </em>or in any of its progeny requires a district court to abstain under these circumstances. <em>See Wexler, </em>385 F.3d at 1340 (noting that \u201cgenerally, as between state and federal courts, the rule is that the pendency of an action in the state court is no bar to proceedings concerning the same matter in the Federal court having jurisdiction\u201d). Accordingly, the district court erred and thereby abused its discretion in finding that <em>Younger </em>required abstention in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-8\">\n<em>C. Res Judicata</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-9\">Although neither party challenges the district court\u2019s finding that <em>res judicou</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number><em>ta </em>does not apply in this case, we review <em>de novo </em>all portions of a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment and may affirm on any legal ground. <em>See Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Roundtree Transp. and Rigging, </em>286 F.3d 1233, 1263 (11th Cir.2002) (explaining that an appellate court may affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment \u201cas long as the judgment entered is correct on any legal ground regardless of the grounds addressed, adopted, or rejected by the district court\u201d) (internal quotation and citation omitted). After reviewing this ease and the related state court cases of <em>Black </em>and <em>Green </em>I \u2014 including the Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Green </em>I\u2014 we conclude that, as a matter of law, consideration of this case is precluded by the state courts\u2019 judgments in <em>Black </em>and <em>Green I </em>under the doctrine of <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1274-4\">When we are considering whether to give <em>res judicata </em>effect to a state court judgment, we \u201cmust apply the <em>res judicata </em>principles of the law of the state whose decision is set up as a bar to further litigation.\u201d <em>Kizzire v. Baptist Health System, Inc., </em>441 F.3d 1306, 1308-09 (11th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Amey, Inc. v. Gulf Abstract &amp; Title, Inc., </em>758 F.2d 1486, 1509 (11th Cir.1985)). Accordingly, in this case, Alabama\u2019s res <em>judicata </em>principles apply. Under Alabama law, \u201cthe essential elements of <em>res judicata </em>are (1) a prior judgment on the merits, (2) rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, (3) with substantial identity of the parties, and (4) with the same cause of action presented in both actions.\u201d <em>Equity Res. Mgmt., Inc. v. Vinson, </em>723 So.2d 634, 636 (Ala.1998). If all four elements are met, any claim that was, or could have been, adjudicated in the prior action is barred from future litigation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1274-5\">When the Alabama Supreme Court ruled on the appeal in <em>Green I, </em>it considered whether the decision in <em>Black </em>barred the claims asserted by the plaintiffs in <em>Green I. </em>In considering this issue, the Court addressed the four elements of <em>res judicata. </em>First, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that the <em>Black </em>court\u2019s \u201cdenial of the motion for supplemental relief was a final judgment on the merits for <em>res judicata </em>purposes.\u201d <em>Green I, </em>2008 WL 4892051 at *5. Second, it ruled that this final judgment \u201cwas a decision rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *7. Third, the Alabama Supreme Court found that the \u201cparties in the <em>Black </em>litigation are substantially identical to the parties involved in <em>[Green </em>2].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *8. The Court explained that under Alabama law, \u201c[a] person may be bound by a judgment even though not a party to a suit if one of the parties to the suit is so closely aligned with his interests as to be his virtual representative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Gonzalez, LLC v. DiVincenti, </em>844 So.2d 1196, 1203 (Ala.2002)). Applying this rule, the Court found that \u201c[i]n the <em>Black </em>litigation, the subclass of Jefferson County deputies and the subclass of Jefferson County employees had an identical interest in seeking the invalidation of the resolution because, under the terms of the resolution, members of both subclasses would have been required to forfeit certain discretionary benefits in order to opt back into the retirement system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, even though the <em>Green I </em>plaintiffs were not named plaintiffs in <em>Black, </em>the Alabama Supreme Court found that the third element of <em>res judicata </em>was met because the parties in <em>Green I </em>had \u201cidentical interests\u201d as the parties involved <em>in the Black </em>litigation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1274-7\">Finally, addressing the fourth element of <em>res judicata, </em>the Court found that the same cause of action was presented in both <em>Black </em>and <em>Green I. </em>It reasoned that <em>\u201c[r]es judicata </em>applies not only to the <em>exact legal </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number><em>theories </em>advanced in the prior case, but to <em>all legal theories and claims </em>arising out of the same nucleus of operative facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Old Republic Ins. Co. v. Lanier, </em>790 So.2d 922, 928 (Ala.2000)) (emphasis in original). Two causes of action are the same for <em>res judicata </em>purposes \u201cwhen the same evidence is applicable in both actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Old Republic Ins. Co., </em>790 So.2d at 928). Because the <em>Green I </em>plaintiffs sought \u201ca judgment declaring that the sole purpose of the resolution is to punish Jefferson County employees who convert unpaid service to paid service under the Act and a permanent injunction to prevent the County from enforcing the resolution\u201d and the plaintiffs in the <em>Black </em>litigation \u201clikewise sought to enjoin the County from enforcing the resolution,\u201d the Court found \u201cthe claims in the two cases arise out of the same nucleus of operative facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *9. Additionally, the Court noted that the <em>Green I </em>plaintiffs, in seeking to prevent the County from enforcing the Resolution, \u201crely on the same evidence and advance many of the same arguments raised in the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for supplemental relief in the <em>Black </em>litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Court found that the final element of <em>res judicata </em>was met because the cause of action asserted in <em>Green I </em>was the same cause of action raised in <em>Black. </em>For these reasons, the Alabama Supreme Court concluded that the claims raised by the <em>Green I </em>plaintiffs were barred and it affirmed the state trial court\u2019s judgment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1275-5\">Applying the decision in <em>Green I </em>to the case before us, we must conclude that the Alabama Supreme Court would find that the claims asserted by the <em>Green II </em>plaintiffs are also barred under the doctrine of <em>res judicata. </em>Regarding the first and second elements of the doctrine, we are bound by the Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s finding that <em>Black </em>was a final judgment on the merits rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction. <em>San Remo Hotel, L.P. v. City and County of San Francisco, Cal, </em>545 U.S. 323, 348, 125 S.Ct. 2491, 162 L.Ed.2d 315 (2005) (holding that a plaintiff is precluded by the full faith and credit statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738, from relitigating those issues which were adjudicated by a state court). Similarly, following the Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s guidance, we must also conclude that the plaintiffs in the case before us \u2014 104 Jefferson County employees who elected to receive the additional pension benefits provided under the Act\u2014 are \u201csubstantially identical\u201d to the plaintiffs involved in both the <em>Black </em>and <em>Green I </em>actions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This is so because the plaintiffs in all three cases share an identical interest in \u201cseeking the invalidation of the resolution because ... [they all] would have been required to forfeit certain discretionary benefits in order to opt back into the retirement system.\u201d <em>Green I </em>at *8. This shared interest makes these parties \u201csubstantially identical\u201d for purposes of preclusion under Alabama law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1275-8\">The only remaining question, therefore, is whether the causes of action in <em>Black </em>and <em>Green I </em>are identical to the causes of action asserted in the case at bar. Clearly, the plaintiffs in <em>Black </em>and <em>Green I </em>did not assert causes of action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and the PHSA; however, the Alabama Supreme Court has explained that, regardless of the \u201cexact legal theory\u201d advanced in the prior case, claims are \u201cidentical\u201d for purposes of <em>res judicata </em>if they \u201caris[e] out of the same nucleus of operative facts\u201d and if \u201cthe same evidence is applicable in both actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>case, the plaintiffs \u2014 like the plaintiffs in <em>Green </em>I \u2014 sought a permanent injunction of the enforcement of the Resolution and damages measured by the value of the sick leave retirement credit and retiree health insurance. Following the Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision, we must conclude that because the relief sought is identical, the \u201cclaims in the two cases arise out of the same nucleus of operative facts.\u201d Additionally, a review of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint shows that, in seeking to prevent the County from enforcing the Resolution, the plaintiffs rely on the same evidence and advance many of the same arguments raised by both the <em>Black </em>and the <em>Green I </em>plaintiffs. Therefore, we conclude that the final element of <em>res judicata </em>is met.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-4\">Applying Alabama preclusion law, as described by the Alabama Supreme Court in <em>Green I, </em>we conclude that there was a prior final judgment on the merits in the <em>Black </em>litigation, that that judgment was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, that the parties in the <em>Black </em>litigation, the <em>Green I </em>litigation, and this action are substantially identical, and that the cause of action was the same in all three disputes. Thus, the four elements of <em>res judicata </em>are met and the claims raised by the plaintiffs are barred as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-5\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1267-10\">. <em>Rooker v.
