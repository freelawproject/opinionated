Y. R. Hunter $1595, with which he purchased a stock of goods, and that said goods were sold and delivered by him to F. S. Hunter, the decedent, in consideration of his paying to the plaintiff the money due to her by S. Y. R. Hunter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-12\">The testimony of S. Y. R. Hunter was that he had money in his hands as executor of the plaintiff\u2019s father, which he had invested in dry goods ; that being indebted also to the decedent he sold his stock to him in payment of his indebtedness, the decedent at the same time agreeing to pay the debt of S. Y. R. Hunter to the plaintiff. There was evidence also of declarations , of the decedent to the same effect. The decedent paid the plaintiff $500, on account of her claim. There was no agreement in writing by the decedent, and the evidence was all objected to on the ground that it was <em>parol; </em>but it was admitted by the court, and exception taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-13\">Stroud, J., refused to charge in accordance with the defendant\u2019s request, that the agreement being for the payment of the debt of another, and not being in writing, the plaintiff could not recover; but told the jury, that if they should find from the evidence that Samuel Hunter was indebted to the plaintiff, and Frederick had become indebted to Samuel, and it was agreed among the three that Frederick should pay to her in lieu of Samuel, the amount due by Samuel, and he did pay a part, but not the whole, they might give a verdict for the plaintiff for the balance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-14\">There was a verdict for the plaintiff for $1318.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-15\">The defendant took a writ of error, and assigned for error the admission of the evidence and the charge of the court.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Auz\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>January 28th 1867,</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b119-5\"><em>W.

L. 308, because the agreement or some note or memorandum thereof was not in writing and signed by the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">The simple question then is, was the agreement within the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>visions of this section. Samuel V. R. Hunter as executor of De Young\u2019s estate received moneys belonging to the plaintiff, which were put into the stock of his store, and belonged to her. Being indebted to the decedent, Hunter transferred the stock to him, with the agreement that out of the stock so transferred the decedent should pay the plaintiff the amount due her. This arrange- &lt; ment was made and agreed to by Hunter, the decedent and the plaintiff. This brings the ease clearly within Stoudt <em>v. </em>Hine, 9 Wright 30, as the fund was provided by the original debtor, whether his own or that of the plaintiff, to pay the very debt which the decedent promised to pay, and which promise he partly fulfilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The judge was therefore substantially correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
