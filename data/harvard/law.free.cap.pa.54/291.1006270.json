Shortly after Mr. Jenks called on the plaintiffs, and informed them that by reason of this destruction of the navigation the defendants could not furnish the coal; that it was an act of God, and they were not responsible. The plaintiffs on the trial gave evidence of their purchase of 437 tons of the first 1000 of other persons than the defendants, at prices above the contract price. The defendants, under exception, proved that the Lehigh Canal was the only outlet by which they could ship coal to market. They also proved the cost' of transporting coal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>between the time of the freshet and July 1862; also that the plaintiffs, June 10th, offer to receive <em>\u201c </em>steamboat coal\u201d from the defendants, instead of egg coal, and the declining of the offer by the defendants; also plaintiffs\u2019 letter of June 20th, inquiring whether defendants intended to abandon their contract, and again proposing to take steamboat coal or Lehigh coal; with defendants\u2019 reply of the 21st, that they did not intend to abandon the contract but adhere to it as far as in their power; also letter of plaintiffs of 24th, notifying defendants that they would supply their wants elsewhere, and hold them responsible for the loss; also letter of July 3d from plaintiffs, referring defendants to their counsel, Mr. Gibbons ; letter July 10th, from Mr. Guillou, defendants\u2019 -counsel, to Mr. Gibbons, informing him that the defendants would be prepared to deliver the monthly supply <em>\u201c </em>for this and the remaining month of the contract time * * and under the increased rates of freights and tolls existing on and before the 1st inst.

If the jury are satisfied from the evidence that, without any fault on the part of the Buck Mountain Coal Company, their performance of the contract to deliver coal became impossible, then the defendants are not liable in damages for their failure during such time as the impossibility continued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-17\">Answer: \u201cAffirmed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-18\">4. If the jury find that the defendants offered on the 10th July 1862, to furnish to plaintiffs \u201c their monthly supply for that month and the remaining months of the contract term,\u201d and the plaintiffs did not after such offer make any demand for coal or send their carts to plaintiffs\u2019 wharf for any, then the plaintiffs can have no claim for damages by reason of'non-delivery after that date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-19\">Answer: \u201cI assent to this point as applicable to the three thousand. See general charge as to the one thousand.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-20\">5. If the jury find from the evidence that the plaintiffs failed or refused early in July to pay the defendants \u201cfor the delivery of coal to them of the preceding month,\u201d then after such refusal the defendants were no longer bound to continue delivering coal in pursuance of the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-21\">\u201c Not assented to.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>6. If the plaintiffs paid for coal, in and after June, a price less than they would have been obliged to pay under the contract, viz., $3.43 per ton, with addition of the advance in freights and tolls, which had taken place prior to 1st July, then instead of being damaged they have been benefited, and in the assessment of damages allowance must be made for the loss thus avoided to the plaintiffs, and which adherence to their contract would have occasioned them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-6\">Answer: \u201c Not assented to.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-7\">Thompson, J., after reciting facts, charged:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-8\"><em>\u201c </em>In view of these facts thus before us, for their existence is not so much disputed as their effect, I instruct you:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-9\">\u201c 1. That the contract in question was entered into with the defendants, miners and transporters of coal, to be delivered at a certain point or place designated. This was not a purchase of coal in market, but to be brought there, and it must be presumed the place from whence it was to be brought was known, and in view of the parties as well as the mode of transportation, where but one existed. If, therefore, the only medium of transporting the coal in quantities such as would be required in the present contract was destroyed by an inevitable flood, and the defendants were thereby prevented from fulfilling the contract, they are excused from compliance therewith during the time they were so prevented, but no longer. The act of God, as I have already informed you, injures no one. In other words, no one is entitled to recover damages on account of injuries therefrom.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-10\">\u201c 2. That the defendants may shelter themselves from liability to damages for non-delivery of coal during the time after the occurrence of the disaster and before they were able to resume its performance; measuring that time by the time of the offer to furnish coal, it was about one month.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-11\">\u201c Was this unreasonable delay ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-12\">\u201c 3. When the defendants offered to resume a compliance of their contract, they had a right to insist on an advance in freight and tolls, if any advance occurred on or before July 1st 1862, from any cause which they could not control. The agreement to pay advance freight and tolls is general, and it applies to increase by the most usual and ordinary mode. Did an increase occur before the 1st July ? If it did, and lasted up until performance or offer of performance by the defendants, they had a right to demand it. The offer to furnish coal, therefore, on the basis of the contract, including the advance freight and toll, if any existed, was, if made and refused, a sufficient compliance on the part of the defendants, and if the plaintiffs did not choose to take coal, the fault is theirs, and they cannot recover damages if the offer was made in good faith. So in regard to the demand for-the coal in 1863 by the plaintiffs. If they declined to take them after an offer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>made in July 1862, which we have said was within the terms of the contract, so far as the demand for increased tolls and freight was concerned, their demand in 1863 goes for nothing. These offers to perform, if I recollect aright, refer exclusively to 3000 tons, on which the advance in freights was applicable, and not to the residue of the first 1000 tons, to which it did not apply.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-5\">\u201c 4. If the defendants are to be excused on account of the destruction occasioned by the flood, and tendered compliance as' soon thereafter as possible, we have said that, as to the 3000 tons, if that was the extent of the tender or offer on the terms of the contract as to advance freight and tolls, it will be a defence against the plaintiffs so far. But what excuse have they for nondelivery of the 437 tons undelivered of the first 1000 tons to be delivered ? No offer was made of that as I remember. It was to be delivered at $3.43, no matter what increase in the expenses of transportation occurred. As the defendants asserted their determination to adhere to the contract they must perform or offer to perform it in all its parts. If I am right in supposing that there was no delivery or offer to deliver this coal, the plaintiffs will be entitled to damages for its non-delivery, and that will be the difference between the price agreed to be paid for it and what the plaintiffs had to pay for coal to supply its place, and interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-6\">\u201c I am reminded that the contract was entire and not separable in performance. I have thought of this, and, although it is not clear of difficulty, yet I am of opinion that the contract allows us to interpret it as separable for the purpose of performance. The first 1000, as distinctly designated in the contract, is to be delivered at a fixed and certain price, under all circumstances of possible compliance \u2014 payments in the order fixed by the contract,\u2014 and was to be monthly \u2014 and if an advance had taken place, as it did on the remainder of the coal, the accounts in regard to the first 1000 tons would have designated it as distinctly as if under a distinct contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-7\">\u201c It so turned out that before the 1st of July an advance of freights and tolls did occur as to the 3000; but did not, for it could not, as to the 1000. As the defendants claimed to adhere to the contract \u2014 performance for these reasons, it seems to me, became separable, and that the case is not within the rule suggested by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel; and I think the justice of the case requires us so to treat it. Nothing was said by the plaintiffs about want of an offer of entire compliance by the defendants\u2014 the difficulty seems to have been in regard to the increased cost of coal on account of the advance in freights and tolls, they seeming to rely on the law as they assert it, that the act of God did not apply to excuse the performance of the contract, and could furnish no grounds for the advance in freights and tolls. Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>the circumstances a recovery may be had for the deficiency in the performance as to this 437, if not for the 3000 tons, it not having been delivered, if it was not offered to be delivered. I therefore charge you, on these views of this contract, that we think the plaintiff is entitled thus far to recover, so far at least as the law of the case is concerned: the facts are for-you.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-6\">\u201c I do not regard the plaintiffs\u2019 case as improved by the offer to take steamboat coal under the circumstances, nor to accept Lehigh coal. The defendants might choose, as they did, to stand on their contract, and having done so, they must show perform-, anee or offer of performance, and we have, we think, commented on that part of the case sufficiently to render our views comprehensible by you.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-7\">\u201c The defendants have no grounds for defeating the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery, because of the failure to pay for the 172 tons remaining unpaid of the first 1000 tons. They might have made it a ground of rescission, but they waived this both by acts and declarations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-8\">\u201c Should you find for the plaintiffs, you may defalk from the damages the amount of the unpaid bill, and-if it do not extinguish the damages incurred, return a verdict for the balance.

L. 803, for the purpose of mining of coal, and for transacting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>the usual business of companies engaged in the mining, transporting to market and selling of coal and the other products of coalmines, and were subsequently authorized to construct a railroad with one or more tracks, to intersect the navigation of the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company, which they completed in 1840, and established a depot at Rockport, where they broke and prepared their coal, and thence shipped it by the said navigation to market. The Lehigh Coal and Navigation works, therefore, became an indispensable and all-important link in their chain of transportation; a fact well known to all their customers, as well as the quality of their coal and the mines from which it was taken. Of course all contracts made with the defendants were made in full view of these facts. On .the 4th of June 1862 an unprecedented freshet in the river Lehigh swept away all the upper Lehigh Navigation works, which have never been restored above Maueh Chunk, and completely stopped all transportation of coal by the defendants to market.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The loss of life and property on the line of the river by this act of God was very large.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">On the 28th May 1862, the defendants contracted to deliver to plaintiffs 4000 tons of their coal at their wharf in Philadelphia, from their mines, in such quantities as the plaintiffs might call for, at the price for the first 1000 tons of $3.43 per ton, the balance, say 3000 tons, at $3.43 per ton, with the addition of any advance in freights and tolls which may take place on or before July 1st 1862, the plaintiffs to pay any tax that may be imposed by the government. Payment to be made on the 1st of each month for the delivery of the preceding month. The coal delivered in the present month (May) to be considered as a portion of the quantity contracted for. The first 1000 tons is settled by the verdict, and the only question is as to damages claimed by the plaintiffs for the non-delivery of the remaining 3000 tons.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">The defendants offered within a reasonable time after the freshet, to deliver their coal according to the terms of the contract, but this was declined. All the facts were submitted to the jury under the charge of the court, and the only question is, whether the instructions of the judge were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">The delivery of coal was to be at intervals during the period of a year, as it suited the plaintiffs, who had no accommodation for storing it in large quantities. The learned judge, after stating the relations of the parties, says: \u201c If, therefore, the only medium of transporting the coal in quantities, such as would be required in the present contract, was destroyed by an inevitable flood, and the defendants were thereby prevented from fulfilling the contract, they are excused from compliance therewith during the time they were so prevented, but no longer. That the defendants may shelter themselves from liability to damages for non-delivery of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>coal during the time after the occurrence of the disaster, and before they were able to resume its performance. Measuring that time by the time of the offer to furnish coal, it was about one month. Was this unreasonable delay ?\u201d Certainly not in such a contract, and where the fulfilment to the exact letter was prevented by an act of God, over which they could have no possible control, and which they could not have in any way provided against, as they were not the owners of the navigation works. \u201c When the defendants offered to resume a compliance of their contract, they had a right to insist on advance on freight and tolls, if any advance occurred on or before July 1st 1862, from any cause which they could not control. The agreement to pay advance freight and tolls is general, and it applies to increase by the most usual and ordinary mode. Did an increase occur before the 1st of July ? If it did, and lasted until performance or offer of performance by the defendants, they had a right to demand it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\u201c The offer to furnish coal, therefore, on the basis of the contract, including the advance freight and tolls, if any existed, was, <em>if made and refused, </em>a sufficient compliance on the part of the defendants, and if the plaintiffs did not choose to take coal, the fault is theirs, and they cannot recover damages, if the offer was made in good faith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">This is the whole case before us; and we perceive no error in the rulings of the learned judge, which are very moderate in a case where the act of God should properly leave the parties without any remedy on either side.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">In the case of Appleby <em>v. </em>Myers, in the Exchequer Chamber on 21st June last, 16 Law Times 669, where the plaintiff contracted with the defendant to supply and put up on the defendant\u2019s premises an engine and certain machinery, for which he was to be paid a lump sum on completion; and when a portion of the machinery was put up and fixed, but before the whole was completed, an accidental fire broke out on the defendant\u2019s premises, which destroyed the premises and so much of the work as the plaintiff had done upon them, and rendered the further performance of the contract impossible; it was held that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover the whole, nor any portion of the contract price.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">\u201cWe think,\u201d said Justice Blackburn, \u201cthat when, as in the present case, the premises are destroyed without fault on either side, it 'is a misfortune equally affecting both parties, and excusing both from further performance of the contract, but giving a cause of action to neither.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">The verdict of the jury effects the same result in this case, and as the plaintiff's have failed in sustaining their specifications of error,</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
