L. 582, the jury is to find what goods were in the garnishees\u2019 hands when attached and afterwards, and their value. This means their present value, for otherwise, if they should advance in value, it would be for the profit of the (garnishee or debtor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-8\">By section 50 of the same act (Purd. 493, pi. 11), the goods \u201c shall be bound by the writ, and be in the officer\u2019s power he shall secure them to abide the judgment of the court; and the garnishee is called on to show cause why the plaintiff should not have execution of the effects of the defendant in his hands:\u201d Hampton <em>v. </em>Matthews, 2 Harris 105; Flanagin <em>v. </em>Wetherill, 5 Wh. 280; Layman <em>v. </em>Beam, 6 Id. 181.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-9\">The control of the garnishee over the goods must therefore be suspended, unless he have antecedent rights, which the attachment cannot override.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-10\">The garnishees are either bailees, holding the goods as security, and could not sell without notice to Frame ; \u2014 Davis <em>v. </em>Funk, 3 Wright 249, Sterns <em>v. </em>Marsh, 4 Denio 227, 2 Kent 581.; \u2014 or factors to sell, whose control over the goods being no greater than the owner\u2019s, ceased as his did when the attachment was served.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-11\">It is, beside, against the policy of the law to allow a garnishee to retain control of goods in the custody of the law: Shaw <em>v. </em>Levy, 17 S. &amp; R. 99; Pott <em>v. </em>Oldwine, 7 Watts 173.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b85-12\"><em>J. W. Paul, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABz\">An attaching creditor is in no better position than the debtor: U. S. <em>v. </em>Vaughan, 3 Binn. 394; and as the debtor sent the goods to be sold, and received advances on them, his creditor could not stop a sale. The advances gave the garnishee a lien which the attachment could not displace: Stevenson <em>v. </em>Pemberton, 1 Dall. 3.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b85-13\">The opinion of the court was delivered, by</p>\n<author id=\"b85-14\">Agnew, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AlW\">This is a foreign attachment. The defendant had consigned to the garnishees a quantity of leather for sale, on which they had made large advances before the attachment was served. It is contended the attachment arrested their power to sell, leaving the goods tied up in their hands. We cannot assent to this. We are bound to take notice of the general usages governing the contracts of factors and commission merchants. By the order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>sell and advances made by the factors, an interest was acquired in the goods, with a right to sell which could not be affected by the after-attachment. It would be deleterious to trade, and the rights of those engaged in it, to hold that goods forwarded to a factor to bo sold, may be tied up in his hands until the creditor of the consignor is ready to proceed with his execution to convert them. In the management of the business of the present day, when all things move by steam, and time and space are almost annihilated, to compel the factor to store goods consigned to him for sale, would be to impede his business, and fill the room in his warehouse, which the quick movements of trade would devote to the goods of others. The attaching creditor stands upon no higher footing than his debtors in relation to the garnishee. What right would the debtor himself have to say to the garnishee, \u201c you shall not sell,\u201d without tendering him his advances and making him whole ? Even an execution cannot be levied of goods in pawn, so as to take them out of the pawnee\u2019s possession, without tendering him the money for which he holds them in pledge. So here the garnishees, as factors to sell, having made advancements, had a power coupled with an interest which was irrevocable except upon a tender of their charges. Added to the injury to them by protracted storage, a fall in price might leave their advances partially unprotected. If the plaintiff was desirous to retain the goods for an advance in price it was his duty to furnish the money to relieve them of the lien of the garnishees, and to direct the sheriff to take them into custody. There being no fraud alleged in the sale, the court below was right, and</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
