Said extension to be made, and damages to be assessed and paid, as is provided by existing laws, and said streets to be put in good travelling order, by the highway department, immediately upon the confirmation of the report of said commissioners.\u201d The court thereupon appointed the commissioners, who held their first meeting November 24th 1864, and proceeded to assess damages: their right to do so being denied by the plaintiffs in error. After the meeting, before the commissioners had closed, there was passed, on the 4th day of February 1865, \u201c A supplement to an act to open and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>straighten Highland and Union avenues, and Thirtieth street, in the Twenty-second Ward, and Church'and Adams streets, in the City of Philadelphia, approved, the twentieth of May, Anno Do-mini one thousand eight hundred and sixty-four,\u201d which enacted \u201c That so much of the above act that reads, from Nash street to Main street, to be twenty feet wide, shall be so construed by the commissioners in making their report to the court, as to read, and the said Church street, from Nash street to Main street, to be twenty feet wide,\u201d &amp;c. * * * \u2022' *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-6\">\u201c That thirty days after the confirmation of the report of the commissioners, it shall be the duty of the chief commissioners of highways to notify the property-holders on said Church street to set in their fences on the line of the aforesaid confirmed street: Provided, The property-owners, to whom damages have been awarded by the commissioners, shall have been duly paid the said award.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-7\">The commissioners, May 8th 1865, filed their report, to which the plaintiffs in error excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-8\">The exceptions were, that the commissioners had no power to assess damages; that insufficient damages were awarded; that the commissioners had heard all the evidence as to damages before the Act of 1865 was passed, and that after the hearing and the passage of that act, the commissioners reported on the opening of the street so as to increase the damages. ' The last exception was sustained and the report referred to the commissioners to re-examine the question of damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-9\">At the meeting of the commissioners the plaintiffs in error protested against the submission of the question to them, on the ground that one of the commissioners was interested, and that another had expressed an opinion on the question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-10\">The commissioners reported reaffirming their first finding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-11\">To this report exceptions were filed, viz.: that the commissioners \u201c had awarded no or\" insufficient damages that two of the commissioners were interested and incompetent, and that they had not returned the protest presented to them by the exceptors against their acting.

The 1st specification of error is to the power and authority of the commissioners under the Act of the 4th February 1865, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>assess damages to the property-owners on the street. Whatever difficulty there might have been to maintain their right to do so under the Act of 20th May 1864, all doubt was removed by the first-mentioned act. The proviso to the 2d section expressly recognises this right as existing, and it needs no argument to prove it.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">2. The 2d and 3d specifications of error are objections to the competency of two of the commissioners, but not appearing on the record, we cannot take notice of the testimony to prove it: Rule of Court, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">3. The last is a general error, and need not be noticed. See Rules of Court requiring the errors to be specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">4. The main argument in the case was directed to a point not embraced by any of the exceptions to the proceedings below, not raised by any exception taken to the confirmation of the report by the Court of Quarter Sessions in this court, namely, the constitutionality of the Act of the 4th of February 1865, under which the commissioners in part acted. It was not raised when the commissioners were appointed, nor when their report was before the court for confirmation, nor in the court excepting in argument. Under these circumstances we ought not to notice it: Rule IX., \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 6, of the Rules of this Court; Wright\u2019s Index 318-19. We may notwithstanding however, say that we see nothing whatever to create any doubt of the entire constitutionality of either of the Acts of Assembly referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Proceedings affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
