The Bank of Penn Township were garnishees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-12\">On the 16th of June 1865, the garnishees answered, admitting that they had on deposit to the credit of the defendant $1083.99. On the 17th of June the defendant pleaded \u201c payment, &amp;c.,\u201d and on the 23d filed an additional plea, that the plaintiff ceased to do business as a corporation on the 8th of November 1858, and while the case was depending and before judgment, the directors, December 1st 1858, passed a resolution that \u201c the unsettled business, books and papers of the company be placed in the hands of the committee now holding the guarantee-notes, viz.: D. S. Winebrenner, D. Smith, Jr., and George F. Thomas, who shall be empowered to make settlement and employ the solicitor of the company to make collectionsthat this resolution gave the committee power to settle the defendant\u2019s claim, and that in the succeeding January the directors, of whom the committee were three, signed an agreement, that in consideration of the defendant having received no value for the note on which judgment had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>been obtained, \u201c we, the late directors, do hereby agree that if he will pay 10 per cent, of the amount of said note we will receive it as full satisfaction for said judgmentthat in pursuance of the agreement the defendant tendered \u201c $60, being 10 per cent, of the amount of the note,\u201d to the treasurer of the company, and afterwards to the solicitor of the company, both of whom declined to receive it, and that afterwards he paid that amount to D.

This was of course irregular. It is probable the judgment was intended to have been given against the garnishees, and not against the defendant; and if there was in fact no other finding of the jury than a verdict on the 2d plea, it may be that there was nothing in the way of a judgment against the garnishees. If the issue rendered by the 2d plea was immaterial, a verdict upon it amounted to nothing. The plea should have been met by a demurrer, and the plea of payment disposed of in the regular way. If the issue joined upon that had been determined in favor of the plaintiffs, they would have been entitled to a judgment against the garnishees. But as the record stands, the judgment that was given is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">Judgment reversed and the record remitted, with directions to proceed, &amp;c.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
