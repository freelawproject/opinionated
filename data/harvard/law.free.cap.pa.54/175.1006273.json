Odiorne, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-15\">The register granted administration on the 30th of October 1866, to David W. Odiorne, a brother of the decedent and resident of New York, against the consent of Annie I. Odiorne, his widow, and she appealed to the Register\u2019s Court. Administration was granted to her in Philadelphia on the 31st of October.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-16\">The decedent and Annie Isadore Robbins, both residing in Philadelphia, were married there on the 17th of August 1861.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-17\">After the marriage he followed his business of photographer in that city. His business being dull, he moved to West Chester, Chester county, in July 1865. There was some evidence of his intention to return to Philadelphia. He was not successful in West Chester, and his means became greatly straitened. Their life together did not appear to be very happy ; they had quarrels, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>she finally (about July 1866) left home and went to Detroit, to follow the occupation of an actress.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-6\">On the 17th of July 1866, the decedent wrote to his wife acknowledging the receipt of a letter from her of the 14th, expressing much interest in her, and wishes for her success and advising her as to her deportment; he concludes : \u201c I hope when this reaches you that you will be permanently settled, that is as long as you stay in Detroit; then I can write often, and not wait always for an answer. Grod bless you, darling.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-7\">On August 8th he wrote again: \u201cAlways remember health first, without which you can do nothing ; and remember you are not strong by any means. \u2014 So be careful of yourself, darling, for my sake, for should anything happen you I never would forgive myself for consenting to your going on the stage.\u201d.

I did not telegraph because I determined before I started not to go either to you or West Chester.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-9\">\u201c I am tired of acting in this farce, and deceit is not my role. Wlien I went to Detroit the only thing I prayed for was that ' I might never see your face again, but your own actions obliged me to be deceitful. I had no alternative but that, or experience trouble in getting off. My being away from you has fully convinced me (although I knew it before) that I could never again endure the thought of living with you \u2014 no matter in what relation.

Is it so, or is it a dream? Would to Grod it were! As it is I cannot realize it. I am exerting myself now to do -what I feel I cannot perform, that of obeying your wishes and bidding you farewell, never to live and love each other as we once did; never to meet or anxiously expect the arrival of each other; never to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>call each other by those endearing names we loved to.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ape\">Where a wife leaves her husband and renounces all conjugal intercourse a considerable time before his death, she becomes not such a widow, after his death, as was in the contemplation of the legislature when the Acts of Assembly were passed which entitle her to administer his estate and to appropriate $300 of it to her own use. It has been held that desertion for more than twelve years forfeits her rights under these statutes: 2 Am. Law Reg. 510. Nor is a wife within their meaning who has lived in a foreign country and never formed part of her husband\u2019s family here: Spier\u2019s Appeal, 2 Casey 233. Nor a wife who, by articles of separation, has relinquished all her rights in her husband\u2019s estate: Dillinger\u2019s Appeal, 11 Casey 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-14\">The acts contemplate the case of a wife who lives with her husband till his death and faithfully performs all her duties to his family, not one who voluntarily separates herself from him and performs' none of the duties imposed by the relation.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-15\">On this ground we think the court .judged soundly in denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>administration to the appellant. It is denied that she deserted her husband, but it is impossible to read the letters upon our paper-books without seeing that whilst Odiorne regarded his wife with the tenderest affection and desired her society, she, on the other hand, had conceived an unconquerable disgust for him and was determined never again to live with him. Under date of August 20th 1866, after she had gone to Detroit as an actress, she employed the following language:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\u201cMy being away from you has fully convinced me (although I knew it before), that I could never again endure the thought of living with you \u2014 no matter in what relation. I would sooner die than be forced to do so, and I know the law cannot force me to.\u201d * * * \u201c I do not suppose that you will view this in any kind of a reasonable light, as reason does not seem to be one of your qualities, but, John, you must listen to facts, and the thing has been reduced to this point: that man nor the devil shall force me to do against my will, let the consequences be what they may ; I cannot do otherwise. I am able and willing to take care of myself, and ask no bones off of any of you. I feel that I never want to see you again arid I might as well say so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">To this letter he returned a most affectionate expostulation, and she -replied, under date of August 24th, repeating with equal emphasis her fixed resolution to live with him no more. \u201c My decision,\u201d she says, \u201c is the result of calm, deliberate and decided reflection. I feel that by doing what you wish I would be committing a crime against my own nature. I will tell you that every feeling in my nature rises in most terrible revolt and repugnance at the simple idea of ever being anything to you \u2014 it is disgusting to me \u2014 I swear it by all that is holy, and yet you are so selfish as to seek by your sorrow to influence my inclinations. But I repeat you never can do it. I shall never under heaven be yours again, and you might as well, first as last, view it in a just and practical light.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">There is much more to the same effect in her letters. Now this lady, who could defy her husband\u2019s sorrowful entreaties to return to the duties of a wife, ought not to be so prompt to seek the <em>rights </em>of a wife, after driving him into a premature grave. It is to the faithful wife, who lives with her husband, and sustains and comforts him as he descends into the dark valley, that the law gives rights which it withholds from her who forgets and repudiates both vows and duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">Nor do we conceive that this woman is in a position to object that administration was granted to one out of the state. No doubt the register required satisfactory security within the state to be given, and seeing that the appellant has no right to be preferred in the administration, we see no ground for vacating the letters that have been issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">The decree is aflirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
