The other defendants agreed to become security for the <em>first </em>year\u2019s rent, and for that purpose executed with Davis the bond in suit, conditioned for the payment of $700 in one year, payable in quarterly payments. Davis occupied the premises nearly three years, and during all the time there was a running account between him and the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-8\">At the end of the first year the account against the plaintiff, without taking the rent into consideration, was $504.38, and at the end of the second year the amount of Davis\u2019s whole account against the plaintiff was $1188.90.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-9\">On the trial Van Camp, a witness of the plaintiff, testified that at the plaintiff\u2019s request, in February 1864, he got Davis\u2019s books to make a statement of their accounts, and that he found a balance of $386.50 due plaintiff at the end of the first year on account of the rent of that year; on the second year there was a balance due Davis on his accounts, the rent of that year being deducted ; that he showed Davis the way the account was made up, and he said nothing. No application of the Davis\u2019s accounts was made by either of the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-10\">The court (Barrett, P.

The sureties of Davis were interested in the appropriation which the law had made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-12\">\u201c The law having appropriated the payments to the oldest indebtedness of Davis, and to the relief of the sureties, the plaintiff cannot recover upon this bond.

He had a book account running through some two or three years, which after deducting from it the plaintiff\u2019s account which he also kept, he introduced the balance due him as a set-off. There seems to have been no objection to the account as evidence, but only to its effect. The learned judge was of opinion that it was a good set-off,, and directed it to be allowed by the jury, inasmuch as there was no evidence that it had been appropriated by either of the parties on any other account or to any other claim. We see nothing in the testimony to show error in this; and the law undoubtedly is, that where parties make no appropriation of payments, the law will, and generally to the first, or oldest indebtedness. That was just what was done here. Neither the nature of the transaction, nor the manner in which the defendant kept his accounts, nor the examination by Yan Camp, and his report of the statement he had made of them, amounted to an appropriation of each year\u2019s book account to each year\u2019s rent; and certainly Davis\u2019s reticence as to whether he assented to it or not, does not prove he did. Yan Camp and he were alone when the former communicated how he had cast up the accounts, and he made no reply. He was not Davis\u2019s agent in doing it, but examined the books at the request of the plaintiff. This, therefore, made out no appropriation to interfere with the set-off offered. The court could not go outside of the case, in the absence'' of an appropriation to see whether or not there were other parties interested in the subject of the set-off. They could only deal with the case of the parties before them, and in doing it, we cannot discover any error that was made. We must therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
