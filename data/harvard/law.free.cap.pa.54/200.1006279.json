Hegins, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-16\">On the 30th of December 1857, Judge Iiegins executed a mortgage to George H. Olay in the sum of $4000, in trust, to secure the appellants and other creditors of the judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-17\">The mortgage was on certain real estate in Northumberland county, and was signed by the judge, but not witnessed, acknowledged or recorded, but was sent to the judge, who was then in Sunbury. It remained in his possession at his death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-18\">The account of his administrator showed a balance of personal estate in his hands amounting to $1578.96. The real estate on which the mortgage was given was sold by order of the Orphans\u2019 Court for the payment of his debts, and after paying judgments against it, there remained a balance of $1087.39. This, together with the balance on the administration account, the auditor, to make distribution, divided amongst all the remaining creditors, including those for whom the mortgage was given. They claimed that they were entitled by virtue of the mortgage to all the balance of the proceeds of the land after paying judgments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-19\">On exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report, the court confirmed it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-20\">The error assigned was that the fund arising from the sale of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>the land, after paying judgment-creditors, should have been awarded to the mortgage-creditors.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AqSu\">February 25th 1867,</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b201-6\"><em>F.

But it has been held that an unrecorded mortgage is not wholly inoperative. It will avail against the mortgagor himself, or his alienee or mortgagee with notice or a voluntary assignee for creditors ; and a mortgage for purchase-money is good against a judgment-creditor with actual notice before his debt was contracted: Mellon\u2019s Appeal, 8 Casey 121; Brittain\u2019s Appeal, 9 Wright 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">The reason seems to be, that the Act of 1715 being intended to protect subsequent mortgagees and others from injuries caused by secret pledges of property; where actual notice exists no injury is <em>done </em>\u2014 eessante <em>ratione eessat ipsa lex. </em>But though the letter of the law gives way to promote the equity of the spirit, still an unrecorded mortgage is a forbidden thing; and this exemption is not to be allowed to prejudice a necessary system for the government of decedents\u2019 estates, and the policy which gave it birth. We are asked to extend the exemption of an unrecorded mortgage, lying dormant at the death of the mortgagor, from the legislation which forbids it and limits its operation, and to give it precedence over the lien of the general debts of the decedent. The argument to support this claim is specious \u2014 that as the mortgage was good against the mortgagor himself while he lived, it must intercept claims which attach only at death and must be in the order of time an instant later. However plausible this might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>appear against heirs and devisees whose rights are inferior to those of creditors, it is inadmissible against the lien of the general debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">So long as a man lives his estate follows him, is guided by his hand, and floats with his interests. But death casts it into an unchangeable mould, the law then fixing its condition and prescribing its management and its distribution. His real estate becomes assets for the payment of debts. An Orphans\u2019 Court sale converts it, and transfers the title discharged of all liens. But an unrecorded mortgage has no lien, a lien being prohibited by the express terms of the Act of 28th March 1820.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">It must operate therefore on the estate, if it avail at all. To avail as an estate it must resist the power of the Orphans\u2019 Court sale, and this is not conceded to the recorded mortgage, which is neither prohibited by the Act of 1715 nor limited by the Act of 1820: Bowers <em>v. </em>Oyster, 3 Penna. 240; Moore <em>v. </em>Shultz, 1 Harris 98; Foster\u2019s Appeal, 3 Barr 79. If it be neither a lien nor such an estate as stands in the way of an Orphans\u2019\u2019 Court sale for payment of debts, it is manifestly no higher than a specialty debt, and this is the precise position given to it by this court in Adams\u2019s Appeal, 1 Penna. 447. \u201cIn fact,\u201d remarks Justice Smith, \u201c to give it now the validity of a regular mortgage would repeal the Acts of 28th May 1715 and 25th March 1820, and the 14th section of the Act of 1794.\u201d To those I may add the 21st section of the Act of 24th February 1834, establishing the order for the payment of debts, and the 24th section of that act controlling the lien of the general debts by a limitation of five years. It excepts the lien of mortgages and judgments, but this evid\u00e9ntly refers to recorded mortgages, for none others become a lien at law. An unrecorded mortgage to which a lien is prohibited, must therefore intercept the proceeds of sale between the recorded mortgage or judgment and the general debts. To allow this, is to give it a place unprovided for in the system established for the regulation of decedents\u2019 estates, and upon a principle of an imperishability of interest, which is forbidden by the law of Orphans\u2019 Court sales for the payment of debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">We therefore hold that a debt secured by an unrecorded mort-. gage without possession taken under it in the lifetime of the decedent, has no right to take precedence of the general debts, but must come in for its share as one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">The decree of the court below is affirmed, with costs to be paid by the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
