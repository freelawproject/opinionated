Y. Pennypacker sold a house and lot in West Chester to Clinton Frame for $2200, and took a bond with warrant of attorney for $1700, upon which judgment was entered March 30th 1854, as part of the purchase-money, as appeared by the record of the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-13\">This judgment was marked to the use of Isaac Ruth, April 2d 1855, and revived March 25th 1859. Rebecca Worthington, to the use of Edward Ruth, recovered, December 29th 1863, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>revival, a judgment against Frame for $550. Nimrod Strickland, the appellee, became the owner of this judgment April 4th 1866.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AHF\">February 4th 1867,</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-6\">The Pennypacker judgment was not revived a second time until April 7th 1864, thirteen days after its statutory lien expired.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-7\">By virtue of a <em>venditioni exponas </em>issued upon this judgment the house and lot were sold by the sheriff, July 20th 1866, for $2500, and at the same time all the other real estate of Frame for $1100.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-8\">The money made by the sheriff\u2019s sale was sufficient to pay all the intermediate judgments in full, but not sufficient to pay both the Pennypacker and the Worthington judgments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-9\">The contest was between these two judgments, and the question was whether a judgment given for purchase-money, whose lien had been permitted to expire, is, because given for purchase-money, to be preferred to a subsequent judgment, whose lien continued after the expiration of the statutory lien of the purchase-money judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-10\">The court below (Butler, P. J.) confirmed the report of the auditor awarding the money to N. Strickland, the owner of the Worthington judgment. Isaac Ruth the owner of the Pennypacker judgment appealed, and assigned the decree for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b174-11\"><em>W.

It is, however, supposed, that because Pennypaeker\u2019s original judgment was for the purchase-money of the property, and was entered upon a bond and warrant of attorney, stating that fact, which appeared on the record, as stated by the auditor, that this is equal to a recorded mortgage, and that its lien cannot be lost, although not revived within five years. It has been assimilated to the case of an unrecorded mortgage, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>which a judgment-creditor had notice, but Britton\u2019s Appeal, 9 Wright 172, shows clearly that mortgages have very different properties from judgments. \u201c They are in form defeasible sales, and in substance, grants of specific security, or interests in land for the purpose of security: Ejectment may be maintained by a mortgagee or he may hold possession on the footing of ownership, and with all its incidents.\u201d An unrecorded mortgage with notine to a subsequent mortgagee or purchaser or judgment-creditor retains its priority, but can it be said that a bond and warrant of attorney with notice to a subsequent judgment-creditor can make the judgment entered on it afterwards a prior lien ?</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Pennypacker\u2019s judgment lost its lien by want of statutory revival, and of course the Worthington judgment held by Mr. Strickland has the prior lien and must be first paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
