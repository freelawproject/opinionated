Williamson, deceased, for certain household goods.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-13\">The decedent carried on business as a mantua-maker, under the name of Miss Agnes M. Williamson. Being indebted to George E. Womrath, who had obtained judgment against her, a fieri facias to March Term 1863 was issued on the judgment, and she claimed to retain property to the value of $300, under the Exemption Act of April 9th 1849. Household furniture appraised at $263.90 was set apart for her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-14\">On the 6th of March 1865, she executed a bill of sale of all these goods to the plaintiff, in consideration of $244.62 which she owed him, and the further sum of $133.43 then paid to her. She died insolvent, on the 8th of January 1866, and administration of her estate was granted to the defendant.

There was evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>also that at the time of the execution of the hill of sale to Bain, it was agreed between her and Bain that she should have the use of the goods for 10 per cent, on what he paid for them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-6\">The plaintiff submitted no points to the court below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-7\">Judge Stroud charged:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-8\">\u201c If you find from the evidence that the deceased was a married woman at the date of the bill of sale, and that she died leaving a husband, you should find for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-9\">\u201c If you find that at the date of said alleged sale the deceased was insolvent; that she never gave up the possession of the goods, but retained them to the day of her death in her own possession, these circumstances, even if she had not been a married woman, would have justified her administrator to claim the goods as he does.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-10\">The jury found for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-11\">The plaintiff in the Supreme Court assigned for error that the court thus charged.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b125-12\"><em>Z).

He said: \u201cIf you find from the evidence that the deceased was a married woman at the date of the bill of sale, and that she died leaving a husband, you should find for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">There was no error in this ; but it was argued that there was error because the proof shows that the husband had deserted the plaintiff\u2019s vendor, the deceased, and neglected to provide for her. The learned judge said nothing about that, and was not asked to say anything as to the law arising on that state of facts, so far as the record shows. We have very often decided that the omission of a judge to charge on a particular aspect of a case,, when not asked so to charge, is not error: 12 Harris 277; 6 Casey 454; 10 Id. 32; 4 Wright 160 ; and this case is exactly within that rule. The issue joined in this court, as in other courts, is the only thing that can be tried. If that be so narroAV as not to reach the merits of the controversy, it is the fault of others, and not of the courts. The allegation here is, that it was error to charge as stated. The replication to that is that there is no error. Manifestly there is not. But it is said there is error by reason of something not appearing on the record. But that is outside of the issue, and we should present a singular record if we were to hold that there was error but not in the record, and reverse. We cannot reach the supposed error here without a violation of all our rules of practice and pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">Not being able to disturb the ruling on the 1st point, the 2d is but an abstraction, and of no practical value to the plaintiff in error. If she had a husband and could not execute a bill of sale, as the jury have found, she could make no delivery of property for the same reason. So the one point decides the other. For these reasons we must affirm this judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
