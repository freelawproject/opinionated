J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9n\">his motion to suppress evidence (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1538.5) was denied, defendant James Douglas Lively pleaded guilty to one count of driving while having .08 percent or higher blood alcohol (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23152, subd. (b)) and one count of driving while his license was suspended (Veh. Code, \u00a7 14601.2, subd. (a)). Defendant also admitted allegations that within the past seven years he suffered four prior convictions for violating Vehicle Code section 23152, subdivision (a), one prior conviction for violating Vehicle Code section 23152, subdivision (b), and three prior convictions for violating Vehicle Code section 14601.2, subdivision (a). A third count for driving under the influence of alcohol (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23152, subd. (a)) was dismissed pursuant to a negotiated plea. Defendant was sentenced to 16 months in state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">On appeal, defendant contends his breath test results should have been suppressed because warrantless misdemeanor arrests are permissible only if the offense is committed in the officer\u2019s presence (Pen. Code, \u00a7 836, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1367\">*1367</page-number>subd. 1) and the officer who arrested defendant for <em>driving </em>under the influence of alcohol did not see him drive. <em>(Mercer </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 753 [280 Cal.Rptr. 745, 809 P.2d 404].) The trial court found that defendant could have been arrested for public intoxication (Pen. Code, \u00a7 647, subd. (f)), which occurred in the officer\u2019s presence, and on that basis could have been required to submit to a breath test. We agree, notwithstanding an arguably inconsistent position taken by the Appellate Department of the Los Angeles Superior Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Engleman </em>(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d Supp. 14 [172 Cal.Rptr. 474], Accordingly we shall affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">As Francis Groce was backing into his driveway at 3074 Woodmont Drive in San Jose at 9:15 p.m. on May 10,1991, he noticed defendant sitting alone in a car across the street. From his kitchen window about five minutes later, Groce saw defendant\u2019s vehicle \u201cstarted up, went to one end of the street, pulled in a driveway, backed up, came down to the other end of the street, made a U-ball.\u201d Defendant then \u201cpulled back where he was parked the first time. Sit [sic] there for a little bit, then he started up again, and he pulled about two houses down. There was another parked vehicle, he pulled up behind it, stopped there, sit their [sic] for a few minutes, backed up, then back down, turned around in the same driveway, turned. So he drove slowly down the curve, went down and made another U-turn and then turned all the way around without stopping this time, drove all the way up, made an [sic] U-turn in the driveway, came all the way back, then he parked across the street again where he first parked.\u201d Groce became suspicious and called police.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">Officer Wong responded to a dispatch call of \u201csuspicious person in a . . . white over blue Dodge Plymouth, dark-type vehicle\u201d on Woodmont Drive. When he saw the vehicle, which was legally parked, Wong asked the defendant who was in the driver\u2019s seat behind the steering wheel \u201cto step out of the vehicle ... to make sure he didn\u2019t have any weapons.\u201d As defendant was getting out of the car, Wong noticed signs of intoxication: \u201cslurred speech; red, bloodshot eyes; he was staggering when he was walking; and he had an odor of alcohol on his breath.\u201d Wong felt the engine, which was warm, and noticed keys in the ignition. He administered various field sobriety tests, including the nystagmus test, balancing test, and finger dexterity test, and determined that defendant was intoxicated. He had no doubt defendant was \u201cquite impaired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">When Wong asked for identification, defendant produced his driver\u2019s license, which proved to be suspended. At that point, Wong arrested defendant for driving under the influence of alcohol. Breathalyzer tests revealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1368\">*1368</page-number>blood-alcohol levels of .28 and .29 percent. At the station, Wong learned that defendant had five prior convictions for driving under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">Penal Code section 836, subdivision 1, permits a warrantless arrest for a misdemeanor only when the officer \u201chas reasonable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has committed a public offense <em>in his presence.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)  Misdemeanor \u201cdrunk driving\u201d (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23152) occurs in the officer\u2019s presence if the officer personally observes the arrestee (1) driving (2) a vehicle (3) while under the influence of intoxicants, or having .08 percent alcohol in the blood.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Driving means any volitional movement of the vehicle. <em>(Mercer </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d 753, 756.) Where, as here, the officer does not personally observe the driving element of the offense, a warrantless arrest for drunk driving is invalid. <em>(Padilla </em>v. <em>Meese </em>(1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 1022, 1027 [229 Cal.Rptr. 310].)</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">The issue we address is whether the arrest can be justified on the ground that <em>another </em>public offense was committed in Officer Wong\u2019s presence: to wit, public intoxication in violation of Penal Code section 647, subdivision (f ).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This offense is complete if the arrestee is (1) intoxicated (2) in a public place and <em>either </em>(3) is unable to exercise care for his own safety or the safety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>of others <em>or </em>(4) interferes with or obstructs or prevents the free use of any street, sidewalk or public way.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">In the present case, the first two elements are met (defendant was intoxicated and was in a public place<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>) and the fourth element is inapplicable (defendant was not obstructing free use of the streets). Thus, a valid warrantless arrest for public intoxication hinges on whether the third element is met.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Defendant asserts \u201cthere is no evidence in the record to show that Appellant was unable to exercise care for his own safety or the safety of others. (Penal Code section 647(f).) The requirement that explicit facts be in the record in order for the court to make such a finding is mandated by <em>People </em>v. <em>Rich </em>[(1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 115, 122 [139 Cal.Rptr. 819] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Engleman, supra, </em>[116 Cal.App.3d Supp. 14]. . . . [T]his aspect of <em>Engleman </em>has been cited with approval by the California Supreme Court in <em>Mercer </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra. Mercer </em>is binding on this court.\u201d (Italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">Defendant points to the factual similarity between <em>Engleman </em>and the instant case. In <em>Engleman, </em>the defendant was found asleep at the steering wheel of his car, parked with the engine running, on the shoulder of a highway. It took police officers two minutes to wake him up. The officers noticed signs of intoxication and saw an open beer can on the dashboard of the car. They administered field sobriety tests, which defendant failed, and then arrested him for driving under the influence of alcohol. A breath test was subsequently taken. On appeal defendant argued the officers\u2019 observations of him, the field sobriety tests, and the breath test were products of an unlawful arrest in that he did not drive his car in the presence of officers and therefore could not validly be arrested for drunk driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">The appellate department of the superior court held there was no reason to suppress the officers\u2019 observations and field sobriety test results because these were taken prior to defendant\u2019s illegal arrest. On the other hand, it was error to admit the breath test results into evidence because they were products of an illegal arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>The court explicitly rejected the People\u2019s attempt to justify the evidence on the basis that defendant could have been arrested for illegal parking, having an open container of an alcoholic beverage in the vehicle, or \u201cbeing plain drunk.\u201d The first two offenses, the court noted, would not justify a breath test. Being \u201cplain drunk\u201d would justify a breath test, \u201c[b]ut the facts in our record show no justification for such an arrest under Penal Code section 647, subdivision (f). The settled statement says, \u2018No evidence was presented as to defendant\u2019s ability to care for his own safety or the safety of others.\u2019 That is a necessary element of a plain drunk arrest. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rich </em>(1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 115, 122 [parallel citation].) While the facts of our case are similar to those in <em>People </em>v. <em>Kelley, supra, </em>3 Cal.App.3d 146 [83 Cal.Rptr. 287], the <em>Kelley </em>opinion states that, \u2018[T]he circumstances indicated that prompt and efficient police action was necessary for the defendant\u2019s safety, as well as that of the public.\u2019 Thus the record in <em>Kelley </em>supported all the elements of Penal Code sections 647, subdivision (f) whereas our record is lacking in the element of ability to care for oneself, etc.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Engleman, supra, </em>116 Cal.App.3d at p. Supp. 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">We disagree. The facts as recited in <em>Engleman </em>clearly justified an arrest for public intoxication. The defendant was intoxicated; Ms motor skills were impaired; and he was beMnd the steering wheel of a car parked with the engine runmng on the shoulder of a Mghway. These circumstances posed a clear threat both to defendant and to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">WMle the court in <em>Engleman </em>attempted to distinguish its facts from those in <em>People </em>v. <em>Kelley </em>(1969) 3 Cal.App.3d 146 [83 Cal.Rptr. 287]<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> on the ground that in <em>Kelley </em>\u201cefficient police action was necessary for the defendant\u2019s safety, as well as that of the public,\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 150) we see no meamngful distinction. One reason \u201cefficient police action was necessary\u201d was because the defendant in <em>Kelley </em>was intoxicated and beMnd the steering wheel of a potentially deadly instrumentality. As the <em>Kelley </em>court observed in the very next sentence, Kelley\u2019s \u201capparent condition threatened even greater danger if he were allowed to move his vehicle.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 150.) Likewise the defendant\u2019s condition in <em>Engleman </em>tMeatened danger if he were allowed to move Ms veMcle.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">Nevertheless, the <em>Engleman </em>court concluded that its record, unlike the record in <em>Kelley, </em>was \u201clacking in the element of ability to care for oneself, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1371\">*1371</page-number>etc.\u201d <em>(Engleman, supra, </em>116 Cal.App.3d at p. Supp. 19.) In this respect <em>Engleman </em>considered its facts similar to those in <em>People </em>v. <em>Rich </em>(1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 115 [139 Cal.Rptr. 819]. In <em>Rich, </em>a police officer noticed the defendant inside a \u201c \u2018Mom and Pop\u2019 \u201d market. The defendant\u2019s speech was slow, his eyelids drooped, his head hung low, and he swayed. The officer arrested him for public intoxication, and a search of his person yielded a red balloon containing heroin. After the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence, the People appealed. The Court of Appeal reversed. Although the arrest under Penal Code section 647, subdivision (f) was improper because the \u201cdescribed symptoms indicated only that defendant was under the influence of an opiate, and not that he was incapacitated as a result,\u201d the defendant could have been arrested for being under the influence of an opiate in violation of Health and Safety Code section 11550 and could have been searched on that basis. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 122.)</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">We believe the <em>Engleman </em>court\u2019s reliance on <em>Rich </em>is misplaced. The defendant in <em>Rich </em>was not behind the steering wheel of a car; thus, the court did not need to consider the destructive potential of a motor vehicle at the hands of an intoxicated person. There was no other evidence that he posed a threat to himself or others. The facts in <em>Engleman </em>and in the present case are more analogous to those in <em>Kelley. </em> In our view whenever a person <em>so intoxicated that his motor skills are impaired </em>is found as a potential driver behind the steering wheel of a car, this constitutes evidence the person is unable to exercise due care for his safety or the safety of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Defendant also purports to rely on <em>Mercer </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d 753. However, that opinion supports our conclusion that an intoxicated person behind the steering wheel of a car, with keys in the ignition, is unsafe to himself and others in his way. In <em>Mercer, </em>the defendant was found slumped over the steering wheel of his car. His seat belt was fastened, the car lights were on, and the engine was running. As here, the car was legally parked against the curb of a residential street. The officer had to rock on the car to wake up the defendant. \u201c[W]hen Mercer \u2018finally [came] around, he started pulling gears [on the manual transmission] as if. . .in his mind, he was already driving or about ready to drive.\u2019 \u201d <em>{Id., </em>at p. 757.) Eventually, he ceased attempting to drive and rolled down his window. At that point, the officer detected a heavy odor of alcohol and asked Mercer to exit the vehicle. Mercer stumbled to the sidewalk. The officer noticed slurred speech and red, watery eyes. He arrested Mercer without a warrant for driving under the influence of alcohol. Mercer refused to take a chemical test, and his license was revoked. (Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 13353, 23157.) The Supreme Court held that because the officer who arrested Mercer did not see his vehicle move, Mercer was not lawfully arrested for a violation of Vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>Code section 23152, subdivision (a), and thus could not be subjected to the license revocation provisions of Vehicle Code sections 13353 and 23157.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">At two points in the opinion, however, the court noted that Mercer could have been arrested for public intoxication. Specifically, the court stated: \u201c[T]he Court of Appeal (and the DMV as well) appears to have overlooked the fact that the officer did not have to wait for Mercer to move his vehicle before making an arrest. On these facts, Mercer could have been arrested for attempted drunk driving <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, 5 [parallel citation]) or public intoxication (Pen. Code, \u00a7 647, subd. (f); see <em>People </em>v. <em>Engleman, supra, </em>116 Cal.App.3d Supp. 14, 19, and cases cited), and thereafter\u2014pursuant to <em>Schmerber, supra, </em>384 U.S. 757 [16 L.Ed.2d 908, 86 S.Ct.186]\u2014he could have been forced to submit to a chemical test, <em>regardless </em>whether he met the separate requirements of section 23157 (i.e., \u2018lawful arrest\u2019 for a violation of \u00a7 23152).\u201d <em>(Mercer, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at pp. 762-763.) Later on in a footnote, the <em>Mercer </em>court again observed that \u201c[o]n these facts it appears Mercer violated Penal Code section 647, subdivision (f), because (i) he was intoxicated in a public place (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Kelley </em>(1969) 3 Cal.App.3d 146, 150, fn. 2 [parallel citation]) <em>and </em>(ii) he was unable to exercise care for his own safety or the safety of others (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Engleman, supra, </em>116 Cal.App.3d Supp. 14, 19, and cases cited).\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 769, fn. 25.)</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">In <em>Mercer, </em>the defendant was intoxicated, at the helm of a vehicle, and with the capability of putting the vehicle in motion. No <em>additional </em>evidence was presented as to defendant\u2019s ability to care for his own safety or the safety of others. The facts were identical in <em>Engleman, </em>with one additional twist: the settled statement said, \u201c \u2018No evidence was presented as to defendant\u2019s ability to care for his own safety or the safety of others.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Engleman, supra, </em>116 Cal.App.3d at p. Supp. 19.) However, the facts as recited provided evidence of the defendant\u2019s inability to care for his own or others\u2019 safety: he was behind the steering wheel of a car; the motor was running; therefore, he had the present ability to drive the car; he was intoxicated; he could not pass field sobriety tests; and an open beer can was observed on the dashboard. The claim in the settled statement that \u201c \u2018[n]o evidence was presented\u2019 \u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>on the issue of defendant\u2019s incapacity can only mean that no <em>additional </em>evidence was presented other than the facts as recited.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">In an arrest for public intoxication, the totality of circumstances must be considered in determining whether the intoxicated person can exercise care for his or her own safety or the safety of others. An inebriated person behind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1373\">*1373</page-number>the wheel of a car or power boat or plane or train poses a greater danger to himself or herself and others than the same person lying on a park bench. Under the facts of this case, defendant could properly have been arrested for public intoxication. His blood-alcohol level was almost four times the legal limit. He was unable to walk without staggering. His speech was slurred, his eyes bloodshot, his balance and his motor skills were impaired. Behind the wheel of a car, he was a danger to himself and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Accordingly, we hold that defendant could properly have been arrested for public intoxication, an offense committed in Officer Wong\u2019s presence, and subsequently \u201ccould have been forced to submit to a chemical test, <em>regardless </em>whether he met the separate requirements of section 23157 (i.e., \u2018lawful arrest\u2019 for a violation of \u00a7 23152).\u201d <em>(Mercer, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at pp. 762-763.) Therefore, the trial court did not err when it denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">Bamattre-Manoukian, J., and Gordon, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied February 18, 1993. Kennard, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b926-7\">Two exceptions to this rule\u2014for arrests made at or near an accident scene or where the vehicle is obstructing a roadway\u2014are not applicable here. (See Veh. Code, \u00a7 40300.5.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b926-8\">Penal Code section 647, subdivision (f) provides that any person \u201c[w]ho is found in any public place under the influence of intoxicating liquor, any drug, controlled substance, toluene, or any combination of any intoxicating liquor, drug, controlled substance, or toluene, in such a condition that he or she is unable to exercise care for his or her own safety or the safety of others, or by reason of his or her being under the influence of intoxicating liquor, any drug, controlled substance, toluene, or any combination of any intoxicating liquor, drug, or toluene, interferes with or obstructs or prevents the free use of any street, sidewalk, or other public way\u201d is guilty of disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">The magistrate denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence on two alternative grounds: first, that the officer had sufficient circumstantial evidence of driving, and second, that the arrest could be justified on the ground defendant was drunk in a public place. The magistrate stated: \u201cLet me say I have a tendency to agree with [the deputy district attorney], I recognize what the most recent case law has indicated about the need for there to have to been [j\u00edc] the evidence of driving. I don\u2019t think it says, however, that the officer must specifically observe the driving. The element of the offense can also be supplied both by the observations of the officer, together with the other evidence provided by the witness that actually saw the driving without the need to have that witness take the defendant into custody. [1] It would also appear to the court that in this case there\u2019s the additional factor that we have evidence that the defendant, although he was booked for the driving under the influence, could nevertheless have the legitimate arrest based on the overwhelming condition of drunkenness that he actually was drunk in public as well. And it seems to me that in this case, given that additional element there was a valid arrest as well. . . . And I\u2019m just clarifying for the record my view. You can make whatever arguments you want at the superior court level, but it does seem to me that there are two things: one, it\u2019s sufficient probable cause for arresting for drunk in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>public. And secondly, that there was sufficient probable cause, though it was initially a misdemeanor arrest for vehicle code 23152(A) and (B) violation because although the officer</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">did not observe the driving itself, he had circumstantial evidence of the driving given where the defendant was seated, the fact that the keys were in the ignition; that the hood was hot, and added to that, then, the statement of the witness who actually saw the driving. So there was evidence of driving. And the court believes that is sufficient.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b927-11\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Belanger </em>(1966) 243 Cal.App.2d 654, 656-657 [52 Cal.Rptr. 660], the \u201csole question presented\u201d was whether an individual found drunk in his automobile parked at the curb of a public street was in \u201ca public place\u201d within the meaning of Penal Code section 647, subdivision (f).
