Proc., \u00a7 340.6)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the plaintiff suffers \u201cactual injury.\u201d (\u00a7 340.6, subd. (a)(1).) \u201cActual injury,\u201d the Supreme Court recently explained, occurs when a plaintiff suffers an adverse judgment or order of dismissal in the underlying action on which the malpractice action is based. <em>(Laird </em>v. <em>Blacker </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 606 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 550, 828 P.2d 691].)</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">Relying on <em>Laird, </em>plaintiff argues the trial court erred in entering judgment for defendant on statute of limitations grounds. Plaintiff\u2019s suit was filed less than a year after he obtained an adverse judgment in his underlying personal injury suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">Defendant also claims to rely on <em>Laird. </em>(More accurately, defendant relies on an Indiana case cited with approval by the <em>Laird </em>court.) The Indiana case holds that where the attorney malpractice consists of not filing an underlying action within the applicable statute of limitations, the statute on attorney malpractice begins to run when the underlying statute of limitations is missed. Although the Indiana statute is distinguishable, we believe the rule stated therein is sound and is consistent with the <em>Laird </em>court\u2019s admonition that \u2018the focus of the statute of limitations for legal malpractice should be on discovery of the <em>fact </em>of damage . . . .\u201d (2 Cal.4th at p. 612, italics in original.) Accordingly we hold that in those circumstances where the malpractice consists of missing a statute of limitations, a plaintiff sustains \u201cactual injury\u201d when the underlying action is lost due to the attorney\u2019s malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1439\">*1439</page-number>Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">A. <em>The 1983 Legal Malpractice Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">In 1983 plaintiff filed a legal malpractice action (the 1983 action) against his former attorney. He alleged he had been injured from exposure to asbestos and asbestos-related insulation and building materials while employed as a sheet metal worker from 1952 to 1981. He retained defendant in 1981 to represent him on a workers\u2019 compensation claim and to pursue \u201cthe possibility] of other remedies of compensation for his injuries.\u201d Defendant advised plaintiff he would \u201cprotect] his legal right regarding any and all claims arising out of his asbestos-related illness.\u201d However, defendant failed to file \u201ca third party civil action against the manufacturers and suppliers of asbestos and asbestos related products for his injuries.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a result, plaintiff \u201csuffered pecuniary and other losses.\u201d Based on these allegations, plaintiff sought damages for legal malpractice, negligent misrepresentation, and negligent infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">In February 1989, after the court denied his motion to extend the five-year statute for bringing an action to trial (\u00a7 583.310), plaintiff dismissed this legal malpractice action.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-8\">B. <em>The 1983 Third Party Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b997-9\">In 1983 plaintiff (through his new attorney) also filed a third party action against the asbestos manufacturers and suppliers he claimed defendant should have brought suit against.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Several of the manufacturers and suppliers raised the asbestos statute of limitations as an affirmative defense in their answers; two settled. In 1988 some manufacturers and suppliers obtained summary judgment on the grounds plaintiff\u2019s suit was time-barred. The record does not indicate whether this action ever went to trial against the remaining defendants; however, the record does indicate it had not gone to trial by February 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">C. <em>The 1989 Legal Malpractice Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b997-11\">On February 6, 1989, the same day plaintiff dismissed his 1983 legal malpractice action, he filed a new legal malpractice action. The allegations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1440\">*1440</page-number>in the 1989 action were virtually identical to the allegations in the 1983 action. This time, however, he alleged he \u201csustained actual injury on or about May 26, 1988 when summary judgment on limitations grounds was granted in favor of certain asbestos manufacturers/suppliers and against plaintiff in his asbestos personal injury action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">Defendant law firm demurred to the complaint on the ground that all causes of action were time-barred. The court sustained without leave to amend the demurrer as to the legal malpractice and negligent misrepresentation causes of action. Later the court granted summary judgment as to the remaining cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress. It is from the ensuing judgment that plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">Relying on <em>Laird </em>v. <em>Blacker, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th 606, plaintiff contends he suffered \u201cactual injury\u201d in May 1988 when the court granted summary judgment in favor of numerous asbestos defendants. It was at that point that plaintiff suffered an \u201cadverse judgment or order of dismissal in the underlying action on which the malpractice action is based.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>at p. 609.) Plaintiff argues that because the 1989 action was filed within nine months of \u201cactual injury\u201d as defined by the <em>Laird </em>court, it was therefore timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-7\">Defendant contends the rule expressed in <em>Laird </em>v. <em>Blacker </em>is that in failure to file cases, a client suffers \u201cactual injury\u201d on the date the statute of limitation expires. However, <em>Laird </em>did not involve a failure to file case, and it never enunciated such a rule. In <em>Laird </em>the attorney malpractice consisted of failing to prosecute an action, which resulted in its dismissal pursuant to section 583.410. <em>Laird's </em>holding assumed an \u201cunderlying action.\u201d It framed the question before it as \u201cwhat constitute[d the] \u2018actual injury\u2019 [necessary to commence the running of the legal malpractice statute of limitations (\u00a7 340.6)]\u2014the judgment against plaintiff [in the underlying action], or the finality of the appeal therefrom?\u201d (2 Cal.4th at p. 609.) The court \u201cconclude[d] the limitations period . . . commences when a client suffers an adverse judgment or order of dismissal in the underlying action on which the malpractice action is based.\u201d <em>{Ibid:, </em>see also p. 620 [\u201cthe limitations period of section 340.6 commences on adverse judgment or dismissal of the underlying action\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b998-8\">The court noted its decision was \u201csupported by the majority of jurisdictions with statutes substantially identical to our own.\u201d <em>(Laird </em>v. <em>Blacker, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 618.) It then cited eight sister state opinions, with brief summaries of each case. The fourth citation read: <em>\u201cBasinger </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1441\">*1441</page-number>(Ind.Ct.App. 1989) 540 N.E.2d 91, 94 [malpractice action accrued when clients learned attorney failed to file suit prior to expiration of statute of limitations, even though alternative avenues of relief not yet exhausted] . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 619.) <em>Basinger </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>(Ind.Ct.App. 1989) 540 N.E.2d 91, and the other sister state opinions, were cited for the proposition that they supported the court\u2019s conclusion. That conclusion, as noted above, was that the limitations period of section 340.6 commences when a client suffers an adverse judgment or order of dismissal in the underlying action. The court did not conclude, merely by citing <em>Basinger, </em>that in \u201cmissed statute\u201d cases, the malpractice statute begins to run when the underlying statute of limitations expires.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">Defendant claims that two other California <em>cases\u2014Johnson </em>v. <em>Haberman &amp; Kassoy </em>(1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 1468 [247 Cal.Rptr. 614] (hereafter <em>Haberman), </em>and <em>Panattoni </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 1092 [250 Cal.Rptr. 390] (hereafter Panattoni)\u2014also \u201cheld\u201d that the malpractice statute of limitations in \u201cmissed statute\u201d cases commences on the day the underlying lawsuit is lost.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, the issue before the courts in <em>Haberman </em>and <em>Panattoni </em>was whether the <em>second </em>tolling provision of section 340.6, relating to continued representation by the allegedly negligent attorney,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> applied, and not whether the <em>first </em>tolling provision, relating to \u201cactual injury,\u201d applied. Before determining whether the attorney continued to represent the client in <em>Panattoni, </em>the court observed, almost in passing, that plaintiff \u201cagrees\u201d the cause of action for malpractice accrued when the statute of limitations on the third party tort claim was lost. This was not the opinion\u2019s holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">Similarly, in <em>Haberman, </em>the court observed that \u201ceven by the most liberal calculation,\u201d plaintiff \u201cadmittedly\u201d (201 Cal.App.3d at p. 1474) was irreparably damaged in 1978 when the statute of limitations on fraud was barred. It then moved on to the real issue: whether the attorney owed a continuing duty to the plaintiff limited partner, which would be considered \u201ccontinuing representation\u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>within the meaning of section 340.6, subdivision (a)(2). The court held that under the circumstances of that case, where the attorneys also represented the general partner, they should be estopped from claiming that representation of plaintiff did not continue. Accordingly, the court held the statute was tolled until April 1981 because \u201cplaintiff neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1442\">*1442</page-number>discovered nor should have discovered the attorneys\u2019 wrongdoing until\u201d then. (201 Cal.App.3d at p. 1478.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">Thus, none of the California cases defendant cites holds that in \u201cmissed statute\u201d cases, the limitations period of section 340.6 commences when the statute of limitations for the underlying cause of action expires.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, for reasons we shall explain, we so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">First, there can be no doubt the Legislature intended to commence the statute upon discovery of the fact of damage rather than upon final confirmation of the amount of damage. The fact of damage is apparent when a right or remedy is lost due to an attorney\u2019s failure to file within a statutory limitation. As one treatise explains, \u201cCalifornia, in the drafting of its 1978 legal malpractice \"statute of limitations, addressed the issue of the \u2018amount\u2019 of damage necessary to commence accrual of the statute. In the legislative proposal, the \u2018appreciable and actual\u2019 test of <em>Budd </em>v. <em>Nixen </em>was replaced by \u2018significant\u2019 injury, but the final statutory enactment required only \u2018actual\u2019 damage. The change was motivated by pragmatic reasons rather than favoritism for lawyers. For a statute of limitations to effectively preclude litigation of stale claims, the inquiry of damage should not invariably raise an issue of fact subjecting the lawyer to uncertainty and the expense of litigating both the merits of the claim and statute defense. The financial and emotional impact of having to defend a professional liability suit is often a greater burden than the actual risk of liability. The California approach reduces the hazard of its statute creating factual issues for litigation by focusing upon the <em>fact </em>of damage rather than upon the <em>amount.'1'\u2019 </em>(2 Mallen &amp; Smith, Legal Malpractice (3d ed. 1989) \u00a7 18.11, p. 105, fns. omitted, italics in original.) In a footnote, the authors point out that \u201c[sjome California decisions appear to be unaware of the legislative change and erroneously still cite to the \u2018actual and appreciable\u2019 standard but usually not even in the context where there is an issue concerning the amount of damage. E.g., Robinson v. McGinn, 195 Cal.App.3d 66, 240 Cal.Rptr. 423 (1987) (\u2018irremediable\u2019 damages).\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 105, fn 18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">Second, after <em>Laird, </em>it can no longer be argued that damage must be \u201cirremediable\u201d before it becomes \u201cactual injury\u201d for purposes of the legal malpractice statute of limitations. The <em>Laird </em>court specifically repudiated <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>McGinn </em>(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 66 [240 Cal.Rptr. 423], <em>Bell </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1443\">*1443</page-number>Hummel (1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 1009 [186 Cal.Rptr. 6881, <em>Heyer </em>v. <em>Flaig </em>(1969) 70 Cal .2d 223 [74 Cal.Rptr. 225, 449 P.2d 161], and <em>Southland Mechanical Constructors Corp. </em>v. <em>Nixen </em>(1981) 119 Cal.App.3d 417 [173 Cal.Rptr. 917] to the extent they embraced the \u201cirremediable\u201d standard. <em>(Laird, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 617.) Thus plaintiff\u2019s attempts to \u201cremedy\u201d some of the harm by filing a third party action (see, <em>ante, </em>fn. 3) did not delay accrual of the statute of limitations. Once plaintiff\u2019s right was lost, he was damaged even though the amount of his damages had not yet been ascertained.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">The <em>Basinger </em>case, which is cited by <em>Laird, </em>is also instructive even though the Indiana statute on which it is based is distinguishable from California\u2019s legal malpractice statute. Specifically, Indiana does not have provisions tolling the limitations period while the attorney continues to represent the client or until a plaintiff suffers \u201cactual injury.\u201d However, the statute, like California\u2019s, does not begin to run until the cause of action is complete. \u201cThe elements of a claim for legal malpractice [under the Indiana statute] have been described as (1) employment of the attorney which creates a duty; (2) failure of the attorney to exercise ordinary skill and knowledge (the breach); proximate cause, and <em>injury </em>to the plaintiff <em>resulting in damage. </em>[Citations.]\u201d <em>(Basinger </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra, </em>540 N.E.2d 91, 93, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">In <em>Basinger, </em>the attorney failed to file an action for medical malpractice within the statutory limitation period. Immediately upon missing the deadline, the attorney notified the clients and told them he \u201cfelt a basis existed for still pursuing the claim against the physician through a declaratory judgment action. He advised them that they could sue him for his mistake and that he had insurance to pay for the claim.\u201d (540 N.E.2d at p. 92.) Another attorney whom clients contacted told them Sullivan was a good attorney and to follow his advice. Accordingly they authorized him to file the declaratory relief action. Six months later summary judgment was granted against them. Sullivan again invited them to file a claim against him, and he gave them his malpractice insurer\u2019s name and address.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">The plaintiff-clients did not file suit, however, until one and one-half years later. (The Indiana statute of limitations is two years.) The trial court entered judgment against the plaintiffs and they appealed. They argued they were not damaged until summary judgment was entered in the declaratory relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1444\">*1444</page-number>action. The appellate court disagreed, stating, \u201cThe argument confuses the distinction between the occurrence of damage and the amount of the damage. . . . [ft] For a wrongful act to give rise to a cause of action and thus to commence the running of the statute of limitations, it is not necessary that the extent of the damage be known or ascertainable but only that damage has occurred. . . . [ft] The injury and the damage (whatever it may be) occurred to Basingers\u2019 chose in action against the physician when the limitation period expired without suit having been commenced. At that point the value, if any, of the chose in action was damaged and injury occurred.\u201d <em>(Basinger, supra, </em>540 N.E.2d at pp. 93-94.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Although the result in <em>Basinger </em>might have been different here because of California\u2019s provision tolling the limitation period while the attorney continues to represent the client, the discussion of when damage occurs is highly relevant. An attorney\u2019s liability for failing to file within a statutory limitation arises when the client\u2019s action is proscribed. The client must act when the attorney\u2019s omission becomes, or with reasonable diligence, would become reasonably apparent to the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">We believe this conclusion is consistent with <em>Laird\u2019s </em>explanation \u201cthat the focus of the statute of limitations for legal malpractice should be on discovery of the <em>fact </em>of damage, not the amount.\u201d (2 Cal.4th at p. 612, paraphrasing <em>Budd </em>v. <em>Nixen </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 195 [98 Cal.Rptr. 849, 491 P.2d 433], italics in original.) Although <em>Laird </em>repeatedly asserted without qualification that \u201cactual injury\u201d for purposes of section 340.6 occurs when a client suffers an adverse judgment or order of dismissal in the underlying action (2 Cal.4th at pp. 609, 615, 618, 620), we believe that the rule must be qualified to those situations in which there exists a timely filed underlying action. If the <em>Laird </em>rule demanded an adverse judgment in missed statute cases, the limitations period could be indefinitely extended simply by filing a time-barred action however late and then waiting until an adverse judgment is rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that in missed statute cases, \u201cactual injury\u201d for purposes of section 340.6 occurs when the client\u2019s cause of action is proscribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-7\">Under the facts of this case, plaintiff\u2019s action became time-barred some time in 1984.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (The record does not permit us to be more precise; however, the specific date is one year from the time defendant ceased representing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1445\">*1445</page-number>plaintiff on his asbestos-related injury claim.) As section 340.6 instructs, an \u201caction against an attorney for a wrongful . . . omission . . . shall be commenced within one year after the plaintiff discovers ... the facts constituting the wrongful. . . omission.\u201d The wrongful omission here (i.e., the failure to bring a third party action within one year after plaintiff discovered that his disability was caused by exposure to asbestos) occurred in 1982.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That omission resulted in the loss of plaintiff\u2019s cause of action against potential asbestos defendants and constituted \u201cactual injury\u201d to plaintiff. Plaintiff discovered the facts constituting the wrongful omission no later than 1983 when he filed his first legal malpractice action against defendant law firm, alleging that the firm\u2019s failure to file a third party action had caused him injury. Also in 1983, defendant ceased representing plaintiff \u201cregarding the specific subject matter in which the alleged wrongful act or omission occurred.\" (\u00a7 340.6, subd. (a)(2).) Accordingly, the limitations period of section 340.6 commenced in 1983 and plaintiff\u2019s 1989 malpractice action was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">Bamattre-Manoukian, J., and Gordon J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied December 10, 1992, and appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied January 28, 1993.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b996-7\">All further statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure.
