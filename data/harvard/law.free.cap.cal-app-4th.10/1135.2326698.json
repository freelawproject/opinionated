(FHP) for damages and injunctive relief, asserting violations of several California statutes arising from FHP\u2019s allegedly unfair and misleading advertising practices in soliciting subscribers for its \u201cSenior Plan,\u201d a coordinated care plan designed for Medicare beneficiaries. The question before us is whether the federal statute regulating Medicare-qualified health maintenance organizations (HMO\u2019s) preempts the field and deprives the states of jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief to these and other individuals dissatisfied with the manner in which an HMO solicits and enrolls Medicare recipients. Our answer is that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b771-12\">Plaintiffs, each of whom receives Medicare and Medi-Cal benefits, were visited at home by FHP\u2019s agents, urged to enroll in FHP\u2019s Senior Plan, and assured they could continue to be treated by their non-FHP physicians for a \u201cnominal\u201d additional charge. All three plaintiffs enrolled and agreed to assign their Medicare and Medi-Cal benefits to FHP. To their dismay, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>discovered that, contrary to the agents\u2019 representations, treatment by non-FHP physicians was not covered except for emergency care provided outside FHP\u2019s service area and the only covered services were those offered by FHP\u2019s own physicians and affiliated hospitals. They discovered the problem when their own doctors turned them away or billed them in full for noncovered services.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Plaintiffs disenrolled and filed this action, asking for injunctive relief to stop FHP\u2019s alleged unfair competition, deceptive trade practices and deceptive advertising. In addition, Plaintiffs sought general and punitive damages on common law theories of fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress. FHP demurred to Plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint, moved to strike the punitive damage claims and moved for judgment on the pleadings against the causes of action seeking injunctive relief. The trial court overruled the demurrer and denied both motions, and FHP petitioned for a writ of mandate <em>(Family Health Plan, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Feb. 3, 1992) B064462 [nonpub. opn.]) compelling the trial court to grant the motion for judgment on the pleadings on preemption grounds. Although at that stage we were undecided about the merits of FHP\u2019s claims, we recognized the need for an early determination of the question and therefore issued an alternative writ which, unfortunately, used the historically correct but currently confusing command to the trial court to either vacate its order denying the motion for judgment on the pleadings or show cause why it should not be ordered to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The trial court took us literally, vacated its order and entered a new order granting the motion. We, in turn, dismissed FHP\u2019s petition as moot. Not surprisingly, Plaintiffs then filed this petition for a writ of mandate to compel the trial court to reinstate its original order denying the motion for judgment on the pleadings. This time we issued an order to show cause instead of an alternative writ.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">Plaintiffs contend their injunctive relief claims are not preempted by federal law. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">Federal Preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">(1) Congressional intent, whether explicitly stated or implicitly contained in the structure or purpose of a statute, determines whether a law of the United States preempts regulation by the states of the same subject matter. <em>(Cipollone </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc. </em>(1992) 505 U.S._[120 L.Ed.2d 407, 422-423, 112 S.Ct. 2608]; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Rath Packing Co. </em>(1977) 430 U.S. 519, 525 [51 L.Ed.2d 604, 613-614, 97 S.Ct. 1305].) In the absence of an express congressional command, state law is preempted (1) if it actually conflicts with federal law or (2) if federal law so thoroughly occupies a legislative field by a pervasive and complex regulatory system as to make reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for the states to supplement it. <em>(Fidelity Federal Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>De La Cuesta </em>(1982) 458 U.S. 141, 153 [73 L.Ed.2d 664, 675, 102 S.Ct. 3014].) Everyone agrees there is no express preemption in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">Where, as here, Congress regulates a field historically within the police powers of the states (public health), the party asserting preemption must establish \u201cthat preemption was the \u2018clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Pennsylvania Medical Soc. </em>v. <em>Marconis </em>(3d Cir. 1991) 942 F.2d 842, 846, quoting <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. </em>v. <em>Energy Resources Comm\u2019n. </em>(1983) 461 U.S. 190, 206 [75 L.Ed.2d 752, 766, 103 S.Ct. 1713]; see also <em>Perdue </em>v. <em>Crocker National Bank </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 913, 937 [216 Cal.Rptr. 345, 702 P.2d 503].) To meet this burden, FHP claims congressional intent to preempt California\u2019s regulation of HMO marketing practices is implicit in the Health Care Financing Administration\u2019s (HCFA) pervasive regulation of the manner in which HMO\u2019s solicit and enroll Medicare-eligible beneficiaries. Alternatively, FHP claims a potential conflict exists between federal regulation of HMO marketing practices and state regulation of the same activities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Medicare and Coordinated Care Plans</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Medicare is a two-part federal health insurance program for people 65 or older and certain disabled people. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395 et seq.) Part A helps pay for inpatient hospital care (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395c et seq.) and part B helps pay for physicians\u2019 services and other outpatient care (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395j et seq.). Part A benefits are available to most people without payment of a premium but a monthly premium ($31.80 in 1992) is charged for part B benefits. Both parts have deductibles and coinsurance provisions (noncovered amounts which the beneficiary must pay personally or through other insurance).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Most Medicare beneficiaries receive medical care through the traditional \u201cfee-for-service\u201d delivery system. These people consult private physicians and use private hospitals, and bills for services rendered are sent by the healthcare providers to Medicare for payment. Medicare determines whether it will pay all or part of the fee (rates of reimbursement are based on the particular medical procedure and the geographic area in which the services are rendered) and any noncovered balance (including any deductible) is the patient\u2019s responsibility.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Some services are not covered at all (such as routine physical examinations, eyeglasses, etc.) and are entirely the responsibility of the Medicare beneficiary. Privately purchased \u201cmedigap\u201d insurance plans afford coverage for deductibles, copayments and excluded expenses for Medicare beneficiaries using a fee-for-service delivery system.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">A growing segment of the population has switched from the fee-for-service system to coordinated care plans\u2014prepaid, managed care plans, most of which are HMO\u2019s or competitive medical plans (CMP\u2019s).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> HMO\u2019s provide or arrange for all Medicare covered services, generally charging fixed monthly premiums and small copayments and frequently offering benefits not covered by Medicare for little or no additional cost. The major difference between receiving care from a private physician on a pay-as-you-go basis and receiving care from an HMO is that an HMO charges the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>patient a basic premium covering virtually all medical care rendered by physicians, hospitals and other health care providers employed by or affiliated with the HMO.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (See \u201cThe Medicare 1992 Handbook,\u201d published by HCFA and available through the Consumer Information Center, Department 59, Pueblo, Colorado 81009; see also \u201cMedicare and Coordinated Care Plans,\u201d HCFA Publication No. 02195 (1991).)</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">An HMO may contract with HCFA to provide services to Medicare beneficiaries. Unlike the private physician who bills Medicare directly for each individual procedure performed on each patient, a contracting HMO receives reimbursement from HCFA on a \u201ccapitation\u201d basis\u2014in simple terms, this means the HMO\u2019s reimbursement rate is calculated on a per capita basis, with a flat rate paid for each individual enrolled in the plan during a particular time period. The rate is calculated by an actuarial projection taking into account the expenses historically paid for a given category of Medicare beneficiaries in a given geographical area on a traditional fee-for-service basis, with the rate varying widely depending upon the location of the HMO. Once the rate is set, HCFA pays 95 percent of the rate to the HMO.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It follows that it is to the government\u2019s benefit to encourage Medicare beneficiaries to participate in an HMO, since Medicare ends up paying only 95 percent of what it typically would pay for the same services rendered on a fee-for-service basis. Other savings to the government result from the streamlined reimbursement plan and elimination of individual claim processing costs. (See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395mm.)</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The Federal Statutes</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">As noted at the outset, there is no express preemption statement in the Medicare statute.  As will now appear, neither is there an implicit expression of congressional intent to preempt state regulation of marketing efforts directed at Medicare beneficiaries.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">In general terms, section 1395 of title 42 of the United States Code prohibits federal interference with the practice of medicine, the manner in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>which medical services are provided, the hiring practices of institutions and agencies providing health services and the administration and operation of such institutions. (See <em>Massachusetts Medical Soc. </em>v. <em>Dukakis, supra, </em>815 F.2d at p. 791 [construing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395 as explicitly stating an intent to minimize federal intrusion into the area of medical services for the elderly and holding that state regulation of balance billing is not preempted]; see also <em>Pennsylvania Medical Soc. </em>v. <em>Marconis, supra, </em>942 F.2d at p. 846, fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">More specifically, section 1395mm of title 42 of the United States Code addresses the interaction between Medicare and private medical plans, including HMO\u2019s, by giving HCFA authority to prescribe procedures and conditions under whdch an HMO may inform and enroll Medicare beneficiaries. The same section prohibits the distribution of brochures, application forms and other promotional materials to or for eligible individuals unless the materials have been submitted to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Resources for review and approval.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the exercise of his discretion, the Secretary must disapprove materials which are materially inaccurate or misleading or which otherwise make a material misrepresentation. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395mm(c)(3)(C).) At the time of enrollment and at least annually thereafter, each enrollee must be advised of his or her rights to benefits from the HMO, the restrictions on payments for services furnished other than by or through the HMO, out-of-area coverage provided by the HMO, the coverage available for emergency services and urgently needed care, and appeal rights. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395mm(c)(3)(E).)</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">If HCFA determines that an HMO has misrepresented or falsified information furnished to any individual, the Secretary may provide, \u201cin addition to any other remedies authorized by law,\u201d for specified civil money penalties, for a suspension of the HMO\u2019s enrollment of individuals, and for a suspension of payment to the HMO. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395mm(i)(6)(A), (7)(B).)</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">The Federal Regulations</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">Regulations implementing 42 United States Code section 1395mm are set out in title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations, section 417.100 et seq., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1143\">*1143</page-number>and enrollment procedures are covered by 42 Code of Federal Regulations, section 417.223. Among other things, these regulations require an HMO to provide to interested persons the HMO\u2019s rules and regulations regarding membership; an adequate written description of the HMO\u2019s basic benefit package and available supplemental benefit packages; the liability of an enrollee for deductible and coinsurance amounts, noncovered services and out-of-plan services; enrollment eligibility and procedures; and such other information (e.g., hours of operation) as may be necessary for the beneficiary to make an informed decision about whether to enroll in the HMO. (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 417.223(c) (1).) Subdivision (c)(2) of section 417.223 requires an HMO to submit \u201call brochures, applications, and promotional and informational material which deal with enrollment of health insurance program beneficiaries with the HMO, to the [HCFA] for approval prior to issuance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">Subdivision (d) of section 417.223 of the Code of Federal Regulations lists proscribed marketing activities. \u201cThe HMO may not engage in any of the following activities in marketing its plan to health insurance program beneficiaries: [ft (1) Practices which are discriminatory or unethical in nature; [ft (2) Activities which would mislead, misinform, confuse, or defraud health insurance program beneficiaries, or misrepresent the HMO, its marketing representatives, or the [HCFA], such as claims that the HMO is recommended or endorsed by the [HCFA] (other than that the organization is approved as an HMO for purposes of participation in the health insurance program . . .), or claims that the [HCFA] recommends that the beneficiary enroll in the HMO or deceptive door-to-door solicitation; [ft (3) Offers of gifts or payment as an inducement to enroll in the HMO (this does not proscribe the explanation of any legitimate benefits the beneficiary might obtain as an HMO enrollee, such as eligibility to enroll in a supplemental benefit plan which covers such items as deductibles and coinsurance, preventive services, etc.); and [ft (4) Promises, claims, or other statements, written or oral, which conflict with, materially alter, or erroneously expand upon the information contained in the marketing materials approved by the Secretary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">The HMO/CMP Manual</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">The \u201cHealth Maintenance Organization/Competitive Medical Plan Manual\u201d is published by HCFA to provide \u201cinstructions for implementation of the provisions of Medicare law and regulations particularly as they relate to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1144\">*1144</page-number>[HMO] benefits.\u201d (Manual, Forward, \u00a7 B(l).)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Among other things, the manual covers marketing by HMO\u2019s. After defining \u201cmedicare required marketing activities\u201d (open enrollment periods, etc.), and before identifying in detail the permitted and required content of preenrollment marketing materials, the manual explains to the HMO\u2019s that \u201c[y]our HMO/CMP member rules cannot conflict with Medicare rules. <em>You also must meet all State (and local) requirements for marketing activities (e.g., State licensure and in some States, review of marketing material).\u201d </em>(Manual, \u00a7 2201, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">F.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The State Statutes</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">1. <em>The Health Care Service Plan Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Without regard to the identity of enrollees as Medicare recipients or otherwise, California\u2019s Department of Corporations regulates HMO\u2019s under the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, sections 1340 et seq. of the Health and Safety Code.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">The Health Care Service Plan Act is intended, among other things, to ensure that enrollees are informed of available benefits and services to enable a rational consumer choice in the marketplace and to prevent fraudulent solicitations, deceptive advertising and misrepresentations in the enrollment process. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1342, subds. (b), (c).) To this end, the act requires that plans be licensed (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1349), that they disclose their financial records to the Commissioner of Corporations (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1351.1), and that specified fees be paid to cover costs and expenses of administering the act (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1356). Detailed provisions cover persons and firms engaged in the solicitation of enrollees (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1359), solicitation materials (Health &amp; Saf. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1145\">*1145</page-number>Code, \u00a7 1360), advertising (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1361) and disclosure forms (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1363).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">By its express terms, the Health Care Service Plan Act applies to plans accepting Medicare beneficiaries as enrollees. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1367.12, 1367.15; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 10, \u00a7\u00a7 1300.67.50-1300.67.55.) Without any exclusions for Medicare-qualified HMO\u2019s, the act permits the Commissioner of Corporations to suspend or revoke a plan\u2019s license for a violation of the act (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1386), to sue for civil penalties of up to $2,500 for each violation (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1387), to issue cease-and-desist orders (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1391), to seek injunctive relief (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1392) and to seek involuntary dissolution of the plan (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1394.1-1394.3). A person who willfully violates the act is subject to criminal prosecution. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1390.)</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 requests for injunctive relief are not based on the Health Care Service Plan Act and the act is relevant only insofar as it helps us understand the interaction between the state and federal governments in regulating HMO\u2019s. FHP has not attacked the Commissioner of Corporations\u2019 right to enforce the Health Care Service Plan Act against FHP (for illegal marketing practices or otherwise) but has, as noted above, limited its attack to a private party\u2019s civil suit for injunctive relief. From our perspective, we have a conceptual problem with FHP\u2019s position in light of its express admission that it is covered by the act and its tacit admission that the <em>Medi-Cal </em>statute expressly permits state regulation\u2014taken together, these concessions mean the Commissioner of Corporations could seek injunctive relief and civil penalties against FHP for the very conduct complained of by Plaintiffs but that Plaintiffs cannot seek injunctive relief and can only sue for damages. We reject the temptation to dispose of the issue on this basis and address the preemption issue on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>2. <em>Injunctions Prohibiting Unfair Trade Practices</em></p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleges a right to injunctive relief on the basis of three state statutes. The first, section 17200 of the Business and Professions Code, prohibits unlawful, unfair and fraudulent business practices and unfair, deceptive, untrue and misleading advertising. The second, section 17500 of the Business and Professions Code, makes it unlawful for any person or entity to induce someone to enter a contract by disseminating untrue or misleading information. The third, section 1770 of the Civil Code, prohibits deceptive practices in consumer transactions. These statutes are the bases of FHP\u2019s assertion that Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cad hoc\u201d requests for injunctions prohibiting misleading comments about FHP\u2019s lock-in provisions are \u201cunfocused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">G.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The Field Has Not Been Preempted</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">1. <em>Federal Regulation Is Not Pervasive</em></p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">Plaintiffs contend the federal statute and regulations are not pervasive and do not sufficiently occupy the field to displace state regulation of FHP\u2019s marketing practices. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">As our review of the federal law (pts. B, C, D and E, <em>ante) </em>reflects, the statute and regulations are neither extensive nor particularly detailed and there is ample room for the states to fill in gaps in the regulatory scheme. This is true not only with regard to a Medicare-qualified HMO\u2019s marketing practices, but to Medicare regulations generally and, for this reason, the courts have consistently rejected arguments that other parts of the federal Medicare regulations are sufficiently pervasive to preclude state regulation. (See, e.g., <em>Massachusetts Medical Soc. </em>v. <em>Dukakis, supra, </em>815 F.2d 790; <em>Pennsylvania Medical Soc. </em>v. <em>Marconis, supra, </em>942 F.2d 842.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">Even if the federal Medicare statute is viewed as \u201ccomprehensive,\u201d that fact does not persuade in favor of preemption <em>(Hillsborough County </em>v. <em>Automated Medical Labs., Inc. </em>(1985) 471 U.S. 707, <em>717 </em>[85 L.Ed.2d 714, 723-724, 105 S.Ct. 2371]) where, as here, Congress has expressed an intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>to minimize federal intrusion into the administration of the Medicare program (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395) and where, as here, the subject of regulation (public health) is a matter traditionally left to the police powers of the states. <em>(Pennsylvania Medical Soc. </em>v. <em>Marconis, supra, </em>942 F.2d at p. 846; <em>Massachusetts Medical Soc. </em>v. <em>Dukakis, supra, </em>815 F.2d at p. 795 [\u201ca state is ordinarily as concerned as the federal government to see that its elderly citizens enjoy medical care\u201d]; <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. </em>v. <em>Energy Resources Comm\u2019n., supra, </em>461 U.S. at p. 206 [75 L.Ed.2d at pp. 766-767].)</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">When Congress intends to fully occupy a field to the exclusion of state regulation, it knows how to do so. <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>Rath Packing Co., supra, </em>430 U.S. at pp. 530-532 [51 L.Ed.2d at pp. 616-618]; <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Santa Fe Elevator Corp. </em>(1947) 331 U.S. 218, 230-236 [91 L.Ed. 1447, 1459-1462, 67 S.Ct. 1146].) That is not what it did here and it is clear that preemption of marketing practices was not intended. As HCFA explains in its HMO/CMP manual (see fn. 9, <em>ante), </em>an HMO soliciting Medicare beneficiaries must meet all state and local requirements for marketing activities. HCFA has construed the federal law in the only logical fashion\u2014against preemption and in favor of joint regulation with the states, to ensure that the elderly and infirm are not victimized by deceptive advertising practices. The Department of Corporations shares this view and has filed an amicus curiae brief asserting its right to regulate FHP under the Health Care Service Plan Act (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1340 et seq.) and providing examples of enforcement actions it has pursued against other Medicare-qualified health care plans without objection on preemption grounds. While we do not find persuasive another HMO\u2019s failure to raise the preemption issue, we do consider it significant that both HCFA and the state interpret the federal statute to permit state regulation. <em>(Mudd </em>v. <em>McColgan </em>(1947) 30 Cal.2d 463, 470 [183 P.2d 10].)</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">2. <em>Federal Law Does Not Conflict With State Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">FHP contends state court injunctive relief potentially conflicts with federal regulation of an HMO\u2019s marketing practices because California <em>might </em>impose a penalty greater than any of those available under the federal regulations. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">First, a state\u2019s imposition of a stiffer penalty or a higher standard of care than mandated by federal law does not preclude state regulation. <em>(California </em>v. <em>ARC America Corp. </em>(1989) 490 U.S. 93, 105 [104 L.Ed.2d 86, 97, 109 S.Ct. 1661] [\u201cstate causes of action are not preempted solely because they impose liability over and above that authorized by federal law\u201d]; <em>Silkwood </em>v. <em>Kerr-McGee Corp., supra, </em>464 U.S. at pp. 257-258 [78 L.Ed.2d at pp. 458-459] [punitive damage award 10 times greater than allowable federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>fine upheld against federally licensed nuclear plant operator].) Second, the conflict requiring preemption is a conflict between state and federal law which arises when \u201ccompliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility\u201d <em>(Florida Avocado Growers </em>v. <em>Paul </em>(1963) 373 U.S. 132, 142-143 [10 L.Ed.2d 248, 257, 83 S.Ct. 1210]; see also <em>Hillsborough County </em>v. <em>Automated Medical Labs., Inc., supra, </em>471 U.S. at pp. 715-716 [85 L.Ed.2d 714, 722-723]) or when state law \u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress\u201d (Hi<em>nes </em>v. <em>Davidowitz </em>(1941) 312 U.S. 52, <em>61 </em>[85 L.Ed. 581, 587, 61 S.Ct. 399]).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Neither condition is present here, and mere speculation about a hypothetical conflict is not the stuff of which preemption is made. <em>(Younger </em>v. <em>Jensen </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 397, 408-409 [161 Cal.Rptr. 905, 605 P.2d 813]; <em>Exxon Corp. </em>v. <em>Governor of Maryland </em>(1978) 437 U.S. 117, 130-131 [57 L.Ed.2d 91, 102-104, 98 S.Ct. 2207].).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Our review of the federal statute, regulations and operating manual on the one hand, and of Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint and the California statutes and regulations on the other, reveals no conflict, present or potential. Indeed, the federal and state regulatory schemes are strikingly similar, consistently parallel systems working together to prevent the very practices Plaintiffs allege\u2014misrepresentations about the lock-in provisions of FHP\u2019s Senior Plan.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">3. <em>Congress Did Not Intend to Preempt the Field</em></p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Another persuasive argument against preemption is the fact that, at the time of the most recent (1990) amendments to the Medicare marketing statute (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395mm(i)(6)(A) [the penalty provision]), Congress presumably was aware of the fact that some states (including California) had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>statutes restricting the marketing practice of HMO\u2019s.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Congress nevertheless did not include a specific preemption provision in the 1990 amendment to 42 United States Code section. 1395mm. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>California Federal Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Guerra </em>(1987) 479 U.S. 272, 287-288 [93 L.Ed.2d 613, 627-628, 107 S.Ct. 683], when Congress remains silent regarding the preemptive effect of its legislation on state laws it knows to exist at the time it passes such legislation, Congress has failed to express an intent to supersede those state laws. (See also <em>Pennsylvania Medical Soc. </em>v. <em>Marconis, supra, </em>942 F.2d at p. 850.)</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Congress clearly recognized the need for state and local assistance in regulating the marketing of HMO\u2019s and other supplemental health care packages to the elderly and disabled and, quite the opposite of intending preemption, appears to have intended a call to the states (and private parties) for all the help it can get. Accordingly, Plaintiffs\u2019 petition for writ of mandate is granted. Let a writ issue directing the trial court to vacate its April 29, 1992, order granting FHP\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings and to reinstate its order of January 7, 1992, overruling FHP\u2019s demurrer to the first amended complaint and denying FHP\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Spencer, P. J., and Ortega, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">On December 1, 1992, the opinion was modified to read as printed above. The petition of real party in interest for review by the Supreme Court was denied February 11, 1993.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b772-8\">Contrary to popular belief, we sometimes issue <em>Palma </em>notices <em>(Palma </em>v. <em>U.S. Industrial Fasteners, Inc. </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 171, 180 [203 Cal.Rptr. 626, 681 P.2d 893]), alternative writs and orders to show cause not because we have made up our minds that the petition ought to be granted but because we perceive a genuine dispute and want to hear the other side of the story.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b773-9\">In the trial court and in its initial papers filed here, FHP did not assert preemption as a defense to Plaintiffs\u2019 common law damage claims but only to their claims for injunctive relief. While this case was pending, the United States Supreme Court clarified a previously murky issue by holding in <em>Cipollone </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc., supra, </em>505 U.S__[120 L.Ed.2d 407, 112 S.Ct. 2608], that, for purposes of preemption analysis, the phrase \u201cstate law\u201d includes common law claims, statutes and regulations. Because we conclude that the federal laws before us do not preclude state regulation of HMO\u2019s, it is in any event irrelevant whether Plaintiffs are seeking injunctive relief or damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-12\">And although FHP originally argued that the statute authorizing appropriations for MediCal (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 et seq.) also preempts the field, this position has been abandoned, perhaps because Medi-Cal is a joint state and federal program expressly subject to state regulation. (See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b(q)(3).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b774-8\">The practice of billing Medicare beneficiaries for that portion of fees not reimbursed by Medicare is commonly known as \u201cbalance billing\u201d and is the subject of regulation in many states.

FHP is an HMO, not a CMP but, insofar as we can tell, there are no differences relevant to the preemption issue before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b775-9\">This is referred to as a \u201clock-in\u201d requirement because (subject to exceptions for emergency treatment) the patient is \u201clocked in\u201d to receiving care from HMO affiliated physicians and facilities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b775-10\">HMO\u2019s are not eleemosynary organizations.

Instead, FHP focuses solely on the conduct condemned by Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint and asserts that marketing practices cannot be subjected to state regulation by an \u201cunfocused, ad hoc request for injunctive relief in the sort of civil lawsuit asserted [by these Plaintiffs].\u201d This rather myopic view of the issue incorrectly assumes that the identity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>plaintiff is relevant to the preemption analysis. It is not, and FHP cites no authority suggesting that it is. On the other hand, it is possible for Congress to preempt one area (but not others) of a federally regulated field <em>(Silkwood </em>v. <em>Kerr-McGee Corp. </em>(1984) 464 U.S. 238, 249-256 [78 L.Ed.2d 443, 452-458, 104 S.Ct. 615]; <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. </em>v. <em>Energy Resources Comm\u2019n., supra, </em>461 U.S. at pp. 205, 211-212 [75 L.Ed.2d at pp. 765-766, 769-770]) and we therefore accept FHP\u2019s \u201cmarketing practices\u201d limitation of the area at issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b776-15\">HCFA, which is headed by a \u201cDirector,\u201d operates under the umbrella of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which is headed by a \u201cSecretary.\u201d (See 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 417.100.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b778-9\">The manual lodged by the parties was revised most recently in July 1992.

At least two courts have nevertheless permitted state regulation of Medicare billing practices, rejecting preemption arguments virtually identical to those asserted by FHP. <em>(Pennsylvania Medical Soc. </em>v. <em>Marconis, supra, </em>942 F.2d 842; <em>Massachusetts Medical Soc. </em>v. <em>Dukakis, supra, </em>815 F.2d at pp. 792-794.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b782-7\">In each of the cases relied upon by FHP, simultaneous compliance with state and federal regulations was a physical impossibility. <em>(Fidelity Federal Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>De La Cuesta, supra, </em>458 U.S. 141; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Rath Packing Co., supra, </em>430 U.S. 519; <em>Franklin Nat.
