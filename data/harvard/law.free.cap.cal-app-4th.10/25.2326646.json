J.</author>\n<p id=\"AaA\">Plaintiff Richard T. Polis was elected to the La Palma City Council in 1984, and reelected in 1988. With the 1992 election looming, Polis decided to run again; he took out nomination papers and, after receiving the requisite number of signatures, presented them to the La Palma City Clerk. The clerk refused to file the papers, however, citing La Palma Initiative Ordinance No. 82-1, which limits city council members to two 4-year terms.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Polis then successfully petitioned the superior court for a writ of mandate compelling the clerk to accept his nomination papers. The City of La Palma and its clerk (collectively the City) appeal. Prior to briefing, Polis requested that the City\u2019s appeal not operate to stay the superior court judgment. We granted this request; thus, we directed the City to place Polis\u2019s name on the November 1992 ballot in La Palma. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">Term limits are not a new idea; in fact, some of the original 13 colonies had them prior to the Declaration of Independence. (See Note, <em>Congressional </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number><em>Term Limits: Unconstitutional by Initiative </em>(1992) 67 Wash. L.Rev. 415, 417.) And term limits are enjoying something of a renaissance today; witness the passage of Proposition 140 in the November 1990 election, which imposed term limits on state legislators and various other state officials. (See generally <em>Legislature </em>v. <em>Eu </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 492, 501-502 [286 Cal.Rptr. 283, 816 P.2d 1309].) But we are not concerned here with the pro\u2019s and con\u2019s of term limits. As the City correctly observes, this appeal presents a narrow issue of law: Does state law preempt the power of general law cities to impose term limits on local elected officials?</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Two prior Court of Appeal decisions have dealt with this question. In <em>Younger </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 864 [155 Cal.Rptr. 921], the court struck down a voter-approved amendment to the San Diego County Charter which imposed term limits on elected county officials. The key to <em>Younger </em>is its conclusion that a term limit would render an incumbent <em>ineligible </em>for office if he or she had already served the maximum number of terms. Government Code section 24001<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> sets forth the eligibility requirements for county office, and the <em>Younger </em>court found that section 24001 expressed a legislative intent to preempt local regulation aimed at adding further eligibility requirements. <em>(Younger, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.3d at p. 872.)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\"><em>Younger </em>also found preemptive intent from article XI, section 4 of our Constitution. That provision draws a distinction between nonelected county personnel and elected county officials; it allows county charters to set the qualifications of the former, but not the latter. This dichotomy led the <em>Younger </em>court to conclude that the Constitution envisioned statewide control over the qualifications of elected local officials. <em>(Younger, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.3d at pp. 871-872.)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\"><em>Younger </em>was followed in <em>Steinkamp </em>v. <em>Teglia </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 402 [258 Cal.Rptr. 265], a case which the City conceded is on \u201call fours\u201d with the present appeal. In <em>Steinkamp, </em>a South San Francisco city ordinance limited council members to two terms. Just as in <em>Younger, </em>there was a Government Code provision\u2014section 36502\u2014which set forth eligibility requirements for local offices in a general law city such as South San Francisco. (Significantly, La Palma is also a general law city.) The <em>Steinkamp </em>court held that section 36502, along with the statutes at issue in <em>Younger, </em>established a legislative intent \u2018to preempt local regulation of eligibility for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>election to local governing bodies, whether they are charter counties or general law cities.\u201d (210 Cal.App.3d at p. 404.)</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">We realize that <em>Younger </em>and <em>Steinkamp </em>are not binding on us. <em>(Auto Equity Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937]; see 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Appeal, \u00a7 772, pp. 740-741.) Nonetheless, the City would be required to present compelling reasons before we declined to follow those decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Not surprisingly, the City\u2019s first salvo is what it calls \u201cthe national term-limitation movement.\u201d It cites <em>County of Alameda </em>v. <em>Sweeney </em>(1957) 151 Cal.App.2d 505, 513 [312 P.2d 419] for the proposition that \u201clegislative enactments\u201d should be construed to take into account changed conditions and the growing needs of the people. The City contends: \u201cIf ever there was an expression of \u2018changed conditions\u2019 and \u2018growing needs of the people,\u2019 the national term-limitation movement would seem to be a classic example.\u201d Were we construing constitutional provisions, such as those to which the <em>County of Alameda </em>court was referring, the City\u2019s argument could conceivably have some validity. However, we are concerned here with statutes; indeed, whole statutory schemes. Interpretation of statutes is not something that is subject to the whims of the latest public opinion poll. We are therefore not persuaded to part company with <em>Younger </em>and <em>Steinkamp </em>simply because it might now be fashionable to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The City\u2019s second argument is based on section 36812, which states in pertinent part: \u201cAfter incorporation, the city council is judge of the qualifications of its members . . . .\u201d The City correctly observes that neither <em>Younger </em>nor <em>Steinkamp </em>addressed section 36812; further, it contends that section 36812 shows there is no \u201cintent for statewide control over the qualifications\u201d of local elected officials, the linchpin of <em>Younger </em>and <em>Steinkamp. </em>However, the City reads too much into the statute. The key word in section 36812 is \u201cjudge\u201d; that word implies a factual dispute, here as to the qualifications of a potential council member. For example, if there were a question as to whether Polis actually resided in La Palma, or whether he was old enough to serve, it would be up to the city council to sit as a fact finder and resolve the issue. But section 36812 grants no power to a city council to change the qualifications for an elected office. (See <em>Powell </em>v. <em>McCormack </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 486 [23 L.Ed.2d 491, 89 S.Ct. 1944] [although Congress has the right to determine the qualifications of its members under art. I, \u00a7 2 of the federal Constitution, it had no power to add an \u201cethics\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>qualification to constitutional requirements to be a member of the House of Representatives].) If a city council has no power to change the qualifications for local office, obviously the populace of a city is similarly constrained.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The City next contends that, because section 36502 is phrased in the \u201cnegative,\u201d it is not meant as an exclusive listing of qualifications for local office. Section 36502 provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is not eligible to hold office as a councilman . . . unless he is at the time of assuming such office an elector of the city, and was a registered voter of the city at the time nomination papers are issued to the candidate . . . .\u201d The City asserts that, had the Legislature intended to preempt the field, it would have phrased the statute in a positive manner, such as: \u201cA person is eligible to hold office if he or she is a registered voter and an elector of the city,\u201d etc. The City cites no authority to support its argument that a \u201cnegatively phrased\u201d statute infers a legislative intent not to preempt. Significantly, in <em>Powell </em>v. <em>McCormack, supra, </em>395 U.S. 486, the United States Supreme Court declined to infer such an intent from the negatively phrased qualifications clause (U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We decline to infer a \u201cnonpreemptive\u201d intent to section 36502 simply because it is phrased in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The City also relies on <em>Gluck </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 121 [155 Cal.Rptr. 435] for the proposition that implied preemption is \u201cdisfavored.\u201d Of greater significance to us is <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>City of Berkeley </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 644 [209 Cal.Rptr. 682, 693 P.2d 261], not cited by the City, where our Supreme Court stated: \u201cWe will be reluctant to infer legislative intent to preempt a field covered by municipal regulation where there is a significant local interest to be served that may differ from one locality to another.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 707, citing <em>Gluck, supra.) </em>We would be \u201creluctant\u201d to imply preemption in this case as well if there were something about cities like La Palma which provided them with a greater interest in term limits than other cities. We are unable to identify that certain \u201csomething.\u201d Simply stated, there is nothing peculiar about La Palma to suggest that interest in term limits is more significant there than elsewhere. This is not like <em>Gluck, </em>where sensitivities to X-rated newspapers may vary from county to county. Nor are we faced with a situation like <em>Fisher, </em>which involved a rent control ordinance that is greatly affected by demographics and local property values.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Finally, the City attacks the findings of preemption made in <em>Younger </em>and <em>Steinkamp, </em>claiming those courts incorrectly found implied preemption. There is no rigid test to determine implied preemption; the best statement probably emanates from a case decided by our Supreme Court 30 years ago; \u201cIn determining whether the Legislature intended to occupy a particular field to the exclusion of all local regulation, we may look to the \u2018whole purpose and scope of the legislative scheme\u2019 and are not required to find such intent solely in the language used in the statute.\u201d <em>(In re Lane </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 99, 102-103 [22 Cal.Rptr. 857, 372 P.2d 897]; accord, <em>Gluck </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.3d at p. 131.) For the reasons expressed in <em>Younger </em>and <em>Steinkamp, </em>we believe the subject of local term limits meets the <em>Lane </em>standard. In addition, and as Polis points out, a number of other statutes, predominantly collected in the Government Code, make it clear that the Legislature wishes to \u201cmicromanage\u201d city councils. For example, section 36513 provides that if a council member misses all council meetings for a period of 60 days, the office becomes vacant, unless the council meets less than once a month, in which case the period is 70 days. Similarly, state law provides that a council member forfeits his or her office upon conviction of any felony and certain misdemeanors (\u00a7 1770, subd. (h); see also \u00a7 3001 [intoxication] and Pen. Code, \u00a7 165 [bribery]). Nothing in the statutes allows city councils to remove members for other reasons. In sum, we find no error in the preemption analysis of either <em>Younger </em>or <em>Steinkamp, </em>and agree that the Legislature has expressed its desire to preempt the field of local regulation of term limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Moore, J., and Wallin, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b54-12\">Initiative Ordinance No. 82-1 was adopted by vote of the residents of La Palma on April 13, 1982, and provides in pertinent part: \u201cLa Palma City Council person [sic] shall not serve more than two consecutive terms (each term is four years) in office and no person who has been appointed to the office of Councilperson for more than two years shall be eligible for more than one additional term.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b55-8\">All statutory references are to the Government Code unless otherwise specified.
