Pursuant to an October 31, 1984, agreement, Fluor agreed to sell the two parcels to Crow Irvine No. 1. Two subsidiaries of Crow would be the eventual specific buyers\u2014the headquarters area was to be purchased by Crow Winthrop Operating Partnership (CWOP), and the remaining land by Crow Winthrop Development Limited Partnership.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1351-6\">Paragraph 12.01 of the agreement provided: \u201cPrior to the closing, Seller, as owner, and FEI [Fluor\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary, Fluor Engineers, Inc.], as tenant, shall enter into three (3) leases covering the Leased Improvements in the form of the three (3) lease agreements attached hereto . . . .\u201d FEI would be made a 50-year tenant of the headquarters area. Then the sale would go forward, subject to the three long-term leases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-7\">In January 1985, Fluor requested an opinion from the State Board of Equalization (SBE). The letter stated that Fluor \u201chas signed a written agreement to sell the property to an unrelated purchaser . . . and to <em>lease back </em>all or part of the property for an indefinite term\u201d (italics added) and asked whether the planned structure for the transaction would trigger a change-in-ownership reassessment of the headquarters property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The SBE, by tax counsel Eric Eisenlauer, advised that \u201c[s]ince [Fluor] and the Subsidiary ... are members of an \u2018affiliated group\u2019 within the meaning of Section 64(b) [Revenue and Taxation Code] and Property Tax Rule 462(j)(2)(A) (Title 18, Cal. Admin. Code), the transaction would not constitute a change in ownership.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1351-8\">In May 1985, Crow Irvine No. 1 transferred its interest in the agreement to its two related entities. Pursuant to the original agreement, Fluor and FEI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1852\">*1852</page-number>executed and recorded the master leases on July 26, each for a term of 50 years and 4 days, beginning on July 26. Title was transferred to CWOP by grant deed, dated the 26th and recorded on the 30th.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-5\">In April 1986, the county assessor announced the sale would be treated as a change in ownership and requested the SEE reconsider its prior letter advice to Fluor. In its answer, the SEE stated that it had asked Eisenlauer for his \u201ccurrent comments,\u201d which were cited as follows: \u201c\u2018. . . if all the relevant documents, facts and circumstances indicate that, in substance, a reappraisable sale and leaseback has occurred in this case, the Assessor has strong arguments to treat the transaction in question as a change in ownership notwithstanding the exclusionary provisions of Sections 62(g) and 64(b).\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-6\">The headquarters property was reassessed as of July 30, 1985, and the imposed taxes were paid by CWOP. CWOP unsuccessfully sought relief from the Assessment Appeals Board. Application to the County Board of Supervisors remained unanswered, and CWOP filed a complaint for refund in the superior court. The court found there was no change in ownership because the sale was subject to preexisting 50-year leases. A tax refund was ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-8\">\n<em>Applicable Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-9\">In 1978, California, by initiative, adopted Proposition 13, setting the maximum amount for ad valorem taxes on real property at one percent \u201cof the full cash value of such property.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XIII A, \u00a7 1, subd. (a).) Full cash value is defined, in section 2, subdivision (a), as that amount appearing on the 1975-1976 roster \u201cor, thereafter, the appraised value of real property when purchased, newly constructed, or a change in ownership has occurred after the 1975 assessment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-10\">\u201cChange in ownership\u201d is defined as \u201ca transfer of a present interest in real property, including the beneficial use thereof, the value of which is substantially equal to the value of the fee interest.\u201d (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 60.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specific examples include <em>creation </em>of a lease of 35 or more years or \u201cany transfer of a lessor\u2019s interest in taxable real property subject to a lease with a remaining term (including renewal options) of less than 35 years.\u201d (\u00a7 61, subd. (c)(1).) Transfers among parent and subsidiary corporations or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1853\">*1853</page-number>partnerships are generally not subject to reassessment procedures. (\u00a7 64, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-5\">A list of specific transactions which <em>do not </em>constitute a change in ownership are contained in section 62, including (1) \u201cAny transfer of a lessor\u2019s interest in taxable real property subject to a lease with a remaining term (including renewal options) of 35 years or more\u201d (\u00a7 62, subd. (g)), and (2) \u201cAny transfer by an instrument whose terms reserve to the transferor an estate for years or an estate for life . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 62, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-7\">The sole issue is whether Fluor\u2019s sale of the 15-acre parcel to CWOP constitutes a change in ownership, where the sale is subject to long-term master leases executed (1) pursuant to an agreement of sale, and (2) just prior to transfer of title. The trial court concluded the sale was not a change in ownership because it was subject to a lease of over 35 years; this, in turn, precluded the receipt of a present or beneficial interest, or one substantially equivalent to the fee value of the property. It determined the transfer was not a sale and leaseback, but a reservation of an estate for years. We conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-8\">Generally, a change in ownership occurs upon \u201c[t]he creation of a leasehold interest in taxable real property for a term of 35 years or more . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 61, subd. (c)(1).) However, here the original transfer, in the form of three 50-year leases from Fluor to its wholly owned subsidiary, does not, standing alone, trigger reassessment under Proposition 13: \u201c[A]ny transfer of real property among members of an affiliated group . . . shall not be a change of ownership.\u201d (\u00a7 64, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-9\">CWOP claims the next step in the transaction, the sale subject to a long-term lease, is shielded from reassessment pursuant to section 62, subdivision (g): No change in ownership occurs upon the \u201ctransfer of a lessor\u2019s interest in taxable real property subject to a lease with a remaining term (including renewal options) of 35 years or more.\u201d Under the circumstances of this case, the tax-proof armor cannot be passed on to CWOP.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-10\">We first note that in the trial court, CWOP filed a supplemental pretrial brief, citing a recently filed opinion by the Second District, <em>Pacific Southwest Realty Co. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(B044028), although a petition for review was pending in the Supreme Court. The Court of Appeal had held that a sale subject to a leaseback was <em>not </em>a change in ownership under section 62, subdivision (e) and the applicable SBE rules. Thus, CWOP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1854\">*1854</page-number>argued (1) the leases in its case were in existence <em>prior to </em>the sale and transfer, and (2) even if read as a sale subject to a leaseback, <em>Pacific Southwest </em>was \u201ccontrolling authority\u201d for exempting the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-5\">On review, however, in <em>Pacific Southwest Realty Co. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 155 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 536, 820 P.2d 1046], the Supreme Court held that \u201cwhen a vendor sells a fee simple interest to a purchaser and simultaneously acquires from the latter a leasehold interest in the property, a change in ownership has occurred.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 159.) The <em>Pacific Southwest </em>purchase agreement contained a condition similar to that in the original agreement to purchase in the present case: \u201cOne <em>condition precedent </em>to the sale was the execution of the lease, which conveyed an estate for years . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.) There, too, the SEE had originally recommended a no-change-in-ownership determination for the leased portion of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-6\">Addressing first the section 60 three-prong test for determining whether a transfer is a change in ownership, the court stated there <em>was </em>a transfer of a present interest, regardless of the presence of a long-term lease. The lease was a present possessory interest, but <em>not </em>a fee interest. \u201cThe entire fee was transferred to [CWOP]; the simultaneous creation of a different interest in [the seller or its subsidiary] will not defeat the first prong of section 60.\u201d (1 Cal.4th at p. 163, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-7\">As to the \u201cbeneficial use\u201d of the property, the court declined to find the long-term lessee held that interest as opposed to the buyer. It cited with approval <em>Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 999, 1005 [267 Cal.Rptr. 445]: \u201c \u2018The fact that [the buyer] may not occupy the property during the lease period does not deprive it of its right to enjoy the <em>value </em>of the property represented by the rent. [Citations.] The sale and leaseback constituted a transfer of the beneficial use of the property within the meaning of section 60.\u2019 \u201d So, too, with consideration of the value transferred as substantially equal to the value of the fee interest. CWOP \u201cacquired the entire fee [and] not only did the value of the interest transferred \u2018substantially equal ... the value of the fee interest,\u2019 it was of identical value because it was a transfer of the fee itself. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Pacific Southwest Realty Co. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th 155, 164.) This third prong was meant to shield only those transfers conveying an estate of lesser <em>value </em>(such as short-term leases and reservations of life estates); and there was \u201cno indication that the property would resell for less than the market price.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1354-8\">Turning to the exclusions under section 62, the court found neither subdivision (g) nor (e) applicable. Subdivision (g) states no change in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1855\">*1855</page-number>ownership, for property tax purposes, occurs upon transfer of a lessor\u2019s interest in real property subject to a lease exceeding 35 years. Because the estate for years in <em>Pacific Southwest </em>was reserved in the grant deed, and although execution of the lease was a condition precedent to the sale, the court stated \u201cthere was no existing lease and hence no remaining term.\u201d <em>(Pacific Southwest Realty Co. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th 155, 167.) But the court relied as well on an examination of the legislative intent behind subdivision (g). Excluding transfer of a lessor\u2019s interest in property subject to an <em>existing </em>long-term lease from reassessment protects against a \u201ctax increase for a lessee that has erected major capital improvements on the land and whose lease requires the lessee to pay property taxes. The increase could occur merely because the lessor has sold that interest to a third party\u2014a transfer over which the lessee has no control.\u201d (1 Cal.4th at p. 168.) That was <em>not </em>the situation in <em>Pacific Southwest. </em>There, both parties changed positions. They \u201cestablished their relationship at the time of the conveyance . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1355-5\">Similarly, the court found section 62, subdivision (e), which exempts a transfer reserving an estate for years, did not apply. Because the transaction before it <em>was </em>subject to a finding of change in ownership pursuant to section 60, a contrary result under section 62, subdivision (e) would conflict with the drafters\u2019 intention: \u201cthe examples set forth in sections 61 and 62 were to be derivative or explanatory, and not to conflict with section 60\u2019s general rule.\u201d (1 Cal.4th at p. 169.) Moreover, it was clear the drafters meant the term to include only those reservations in which the transferor retained the <em>beneficial </em>use of the property.  Pacific Southwest \u201cdid not retain a beneficial use of the property for itself; it pays rent to [the new owner], which enjoys the entire beneficial interest in the property.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 170-171; <em>Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco, supra, 218 </em>Cal.App.3d 999, 1006.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1355-6\">To the extent that CWOP contends its situation is not analogous to <em>Pacific Southwest, </em>we observe the following. First, the transfer of the over-35-years lease from Fluor to FEI is not recognized as a change in ownership because it essentially <em>is not one. </em>The parent remains in control. As such, Fluor remained the controlling party of the lease, when it was assigned to CWOP. Second, the transfers\u2014of the fee to CWOP and the tenancy to FEI through its parent\u2014were essentially simultaneous. The contract of sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1856\">*1856</page-number>(executed <em>long </em>before the leases) required the leases as a precedent condition of the purchase, just as did the agreement in <em>Pacific Southwest. </em>The grant deed, from Fluor to CWOP, \u201csubject to all. . . leases . . . whether or not of record,\u201d was executed on July 26, the same day the leases were executed. The assignment of the leases was similarly executed by <em>both </em>parties on July 26 and specifically provides: \u201cThis Assignment is made concurrently with and as an incident to the conveyance by Assignor to Assignee of the real property . . . pursuant to the [purchase agreement] dated as of October 31, 1984.\u201d <em>All of the transfers </em>were consummated on the same day. The leases \u201cpreexisted\u201d the conveyance, if at all, by a matter of minutes. The transaction is in substance a sale/leaseback.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-5\"><em>Shuwa Investments Corp. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 1635 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 783] supports our conclusion. There, Flower Street Limited, whose equal partners were Atlantic Richfield and Bank of America, owned the ARCO Plaza, which Shuwa desired to purchase. They devised a three-step process: Atlantic Richfield sold its 50 percent partnership interest to Shuwa; Bank of America and Shuwa liquidated the partnership and distributed to themselves undivided interests in ARCO Plaza; and Shuwa purchased Bank of America\u2019s interest in the Plaza. A letter opinion from the SBE indicated the transaction should generate only a 50 percent change-in-ownership assessment. A purchase agreement outlined the plan, which was completed through escrow. The county assessor, however, determined there had been a 100 percent change in ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-6\">On appeal, the court agreed that, if each of the steps of the transaction were examined individually and in a vacuum, the result would be but a 50 percent change in ownership. Step one\u2014sale of the 50 percent interest in the partnership to Shuwa\u2014would be exempt under section 64, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Step two\u2014liquidation of the partnership and distribution to the partners\u2014 would be exempt under section 62, subdivision (a)(2).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That leaves only the sale of one-half of the Plaza by Bank of America to Shuwa, suggesting reassessment of only one-half of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-7\">The court declined to adopt the subterfuge, choosing instead to apply the \u201cstep transaction\u201d doctrine \u201cto determine whether the transaction should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1857\">*1857</page-number>treated as a whole or whether each step of the transaction may stand alone.\u201d <em>(Shuwa Investments Corp. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.4th 1635, 1648.) This essentially recognizes \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe familiar principle that in applying the [tax laws], the substance rather than the form of the transaction is controlling.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1650.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-5\">Three relevant tests were addressed\u2014\u201cend result,\u201d \u201cinterdependence\u201d and \u201cbinding commitment.\u201d Under the \u201cend result\u201d test, the procedures can be treated as a single transaction if each step was intended, from the beginning, \u201cto be taken for the purpose of reaching the ultimate result.\u201d (1 Cal.App.4th at p. 1650.) In <em>Shuwa, </em>all three steps were contemplated by the parties to achieve one purpose\u2014acquisition of ARCO Plaza by Shuwa.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-6\">The \u201cinterdependence\u201d test looks to whether the actions are \u201c \u2018so interdependent that the legal relations created by one transaction would have been fruitless without a completion of the series.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d (1 Cal.App.4th at p. 1651.) Shuwa wanted the entire Plaza; a one-half interest through the partnership did not accomplish its purpose and was but a means to buy the remaining interest held by Bank of America. And that latter purchase \u201cwas only necessitated by the existence of the prior two steps to effectuate Shuwa\u2019s desire for all of the property.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1652.) Thus, \u201ceach individual step would have been useless without a completion of the series . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1357-7\">The \u201cbinding commitment\u201d test addresses whether the first step, once taken, requires taking the remainder. Under the sale agreement, the parties agreed to structure the purchase pursuant to the three-step procedure, binding them to the plan. Because all three tests were met, the court ruled the transfer-in-series resulted in a 100 percent transfer of ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-8\">CWOP fares no better. Under the \u201cend result\u201d approach, it is clear the parties intended CWOP would purchase the fee interest in the property and become the landlord in a long-term lease of the property. As early as October 1984, their contract spelled out the sale particulars and stated the leases, yet to be arranged between Fluor and FBI, were <em>required </em>to consummate the sale. \u201cMaster Lease,\u201d as defined in the contract, \u201cmeans collectively the three leases entered into between Seller, as Landlord, and [FBI], a wholly-owned subsidiary of Seller, as Tenant, as to which, upon Closing, Buyer will become Landlord . . . .\u201d CWOP in its opening brief insists \u201c[t]he main criteria for such a sale was <em>Fluor </em>retaining control of the use of the Headquarters Facility on a long-term basis.\u201d (Italics added.) That could have been accomplished by the simple expedient of a sale/leaseback. However, that <em>would </em>have been subject to reassessment. Based on the series of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1858\">*1858</page-number>letters to and from the SBE, the intent was that CWOP would acquire the property <em>without </em>triggering a reassessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-5\">Pursuant to the \u201cinterdependence\u201d test, we ask \u201cwhether one step would have been taken without any of the others.\u201d <em>(Shuwa Investments Corp. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.4th 1635, 1652.) Clearly, Fluor had been operating without the necessity of setting up a lease with its subsidiary. Nonetheless, one was required by the 1984 sale agreement, but was <em>not </em>consummated until all other aspects of the sale were complete. The master lease was not signed by Fluor and FEI until July 26, 1985, the same day the grant deed, subject to those leases, was signed by Fluor. The leases had no independent meaning\u2014they were clearly the determinative factor in completing the sale and long-term lease without incurring a reassessment of this extremely valuable piece of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-6\">The \u201cbinding commitment\u201d test, usually the most restrictive, is most easily met here. The sale agreement recognized the necessity of the subsidiary lease. Once in place, there was no obstacle to the intended purchase by CWOP. The two-step process was agreed upon from the inception; once the initial step was taken, the conditions for transfer of the fee were met. The intent of the entire transaction was to sidestep what would otherwise have been a reassessment of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-7\">Judgment reversed. The matter is remanded to the trial court to enter judgment for the County of Orange.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-8\">Sills, P. J., and Wallin, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1351-9\">There was no challenge to change in ownership status for the surrounding property sold to the development partnership, although there is apparently a dispute over the amount of the reevaluation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1351-10\">The request offered three possible configurations for the transaction: (1) as it actually occurred\u2014Fluor rents to FBI, then sells to CWOP; (2) Fluor transfers fee to FEI, retaining long-term lease in the deed; FEI sells to CWOP; and (3) Fluor sells to CWOP, reserving in the deed a long-term lease.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1351-11\">The letter contained the following caveat: \u201cThe views expressed in this letter are, of course, only advisory in nature.
