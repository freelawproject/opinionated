She was convicted after a jury trial and received probation, together with a jail sentence of 100 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">Appellant raises numerous arguments on appeal: (1) A minor error of transcription by the court reporter requires that the jury\u2019s felony verdict be thrown out; (2) section 368 is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and violates substantive due process and equal protection rights; (3) appellant was denied effective assistance of counsel at trial; (4) the trial court erred in certain evidentiary rulings; (5) the conviction is not supported by substantial evidence; (6) the jury instructions were inaccurate; and (7) the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>should not have required that appellant abstain from abuse of drugs and alcohol as a condition of probation. We reject these arguments and affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The facts of this case are gruesome; we summarize them briefly. Appellant resided with her helpless 79-year-old mother, who almost died from lack of food and water, and from infections left untreated. After the victim was rescued by paramedics, the emergency room doctors and other examining physicians observed that the victim was near death and had suffered one of the worst cases of dehydration and neglect they had ever seen\u2014her body and clothes were caked with dried feces; she was suffering from burns caused by sitting in the same position, in her own urine, for at least a week; she had not been given any fluids for about a week and had not eaten for 10 days to 2 weeks; her flesh was literally rotting away, causing a horrible stench which filled appellant\u2019s house and permeated the entire emergency room. Appellant was charged with a felony violation of section 368, subdivision (a), endangering the health of an elder and dependent adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">It is possible for a violation of section 368 to be either a felony or a misdemeanor. If the circumstances are such as would likely lead to the great bodily harm or death of the victim, it is a violation of subdivision (a) of section 368 and a felony. If a lesser degree of harm is shown, it is a violation of subdivision (b) of section 368 and a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">The signed jury verdict form shows that the jury found appellant guilty of the <em>felony </em>as charged in section 368, subdivision (a). Appellant also made a motion for a new trial, referring to her conviction of a felony. In that motion, she explicitly stated that \u201cthe jury found the defendant guilty of violation of Penal Code Section 368(a), a felony.\u201d The trial court sentenced appellant to felony probation, on condition that appellant serve one hundred days in the county jail. She timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">A. <em>Challenge to Felony Conviction</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">B. <em>Unconstitutionality Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">Appellant next claims section 368 is unconstitutional. Section 368 provides in relevant part as follows: \u201c(a) Any person who, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>circumstances or conditions likely to produce great bodily injury or death, willfully causes or permits any elder or dependent adult, with knowledge that he or she is an elder or a dependent adult, to suffer, or inflicts thereon unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering, or having the care or custody of any elder or dependent adult, willfully causes or permits the person or health of the elder or dependent adult to be injured, or willfully causes or permits the elder or dependent adult to be placed in a situation such that his or her person or health is endangered, is punishable by imprisonment. . .</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">The Fifth District in <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Holvey) (1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 51 [252 Cal.Rptr. 335], and the Second District in <em>People </em>v. <em>McKelvey </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 399 [281 Cal.Rptr. 359] have upheld the constitutionality of this statute; and we generally adopt their analysis. We also note that a unanimous Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 798, 809-810 [201 Cal.Rptr. 311, 678 P.2d 886] held, per Justice Mosk, that a child endangerment statute with almost identical wording, section 273a, subdivision (1), passed constitutional muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">It is true that in <em>McKelvey, supra, </em>the Second District, though upholding the conviction in issue, also criticized the wording of section 368 in dicta as \u201cuncertain.\u201d (230 Cal.App.3d at pp. 403-404.) We agree that the clause criticized in <em>McKelvey </em>(\u201cAny person who . . . willfully . . . permits any . . . dependent adult... to suffer . . . .\u201d) could perhaps be improved; as written, appellant contends the statute would seem to criminalize the conduct of a passerby who does not take action to help an elder who is in pain. It was for precisely this reason that the Fifth District in <em>Holvey, supra, </em>closed the statutory gap, by a process of limiting interpretation, so as to construe the statute as reaching only \u201ccriminal negligence.\u201d (205 Cal.App.3d at p. 60.)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">As so construed, the statute clearly reaches the conduct of appellant. By any standard, appellant\u2019s action in permitting her mother to literally rot away in appellant\u2019s house, from simple lack of food or water and untreated infections resulting from failure to move the victim out of a chair for a week at a time, would be considered \u201ccriminal[ly] negligen[t].\u201d Since criminal negligence only arises from a gross violation of an already existing duty of care\u2014a duty clearly assumed by appellant with respect to her helpless mother\u2019s care while the mother lived in appellant\u2019s house, the statute would not reach the conduct of a passerby who noticed such a situation but did nothing. Of course, such a passerby would have a moral, if not a legal, duty to report the problem to competent authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Appellant argues that the differences between children and adults support her claim that the statute is impermissibly vague in failing to give proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>notice. We are dubious as to whether appellant actually raised this theory in her briefs in the rather more effective form she gave it at oral argument, but out of (perhaps excessive) caution we will address this point. According to appellant\u2019s theory, the child endangerment statute in issue in <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d 798 passed constitutional muster as to a vagueness challenge only because children are not generally presumed to be competent to make decisions as to their health or welfare; being subject in any event to adult supervision, children do not have countervailing independent rights of decision in these areas which must be overborne by the adult who cares for them. Adults, by contrast, have these rights to make their own decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Appellant, therefore, argues that where the victim of neglect or abuse is an elderly adult, as here, the statute must face an additional hurdle in specifying the circumstances in which criminal liability would attach to a person caring for such an elder who does not overrule the victim\u2019s desires.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">This distinction appellant draws between victims who are children and those who are adults is not one which goes to any vagueness issue appellant could properly raise in this case. This is not a case in which, for instance, the victim sought to refuse a necessary operation. Contrary to appellant\u2019s rhetoric at oral argument, the medical evidence disclosed profoundly disturbing neglect and abuse over a period of at least 10 days to 2 weeks, attended by signs obvious to any reasonable layperson that the victim had been suffering from a number of complications which do not arise suddenly or without warning, and which produce symptoms impossible not to observe, such as the stench of rotting flesh; the victim\u2019s life was in grave danger from simple neglect of her basic human needs, in these circumstances obviously amounting to cruel abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">More fundamentally, the distinction appellant draws concerning the lesser degree of autonomy customarily granted to children (which was not at all the articulated basis of Justice Mosk\u2019s analysis in <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d 798) would not really aid appellant\u2019s vagueness challenge as to elderly adults in any event; it would go to the statute\u2019s definition of the class of victims whose hypothetical competence to make independent medical decisions has been supplanted by another adult\u2019s duty of care\u2014i.e., to the issue of criminal negligence which we have already discussed and found dispositive here. We, therefore, reject this belated refinement to appellant\u2019s argument; in the words of Justice Mosk in <em>Smith: </em>\u201cMoreover, we agree that these statutes are not so uncertain or indefinite as to render them invalid: they provide both notice to those whose activities are proscribed and guidance for the courts called on to apply them.\u201d (35 Cal.3d at p. 810.)</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Further, as our Supreme Court noted in <em>Smith, supra, </em>\u201cWe are not obligated to \u2018consider every conceivable situation which might arise under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>the language of the statute\u2019 [citation], so long as it may be given \u2018a reasonable and practical construction in accordance with the probable intent of the Legislature\u2019 [citation],  Defendant\u2019s conduct here clearly falls within the intended prohibition of [the statute].\u201d (35 Cal.3d at p. 810; accord, <em>Evangelatos </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 1188, 1201 [246 Cal.Rptr. 629 [753 P.2d 585].)</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">We also reject appellant\u2019s unusual claim that section 368 violates the due process rights of elderly persons who might prefer to neglect their medical needs. First, appellant is not an elderly person who wants to suffer from lack of food or water, or wishes to have her flesh slowly rot away; we cannot understand how appellant would acquire standing to assert a victim\u2019s supposed \u201cright\u201d to be suffering such conditions. In any event, the argument is obviously frivolous in the factual context of this case, and we reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Appellant next attempts to argue that prosecution under section 368 would burden the right of Christian Scientists and others to determine their own medical care. However, she does not establish personal standing as such a person; nor does this case actually involve medical care, but the failure to provide food, drink, or movement from a chair for over a week. We are not aware that any creed, or indeed any person, actually counsels or requires such conduct or regards this as an appropriate choice as to medical care. The statute is aimed, in any event, at neglect, not valid choices as to medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Moreover, the statute is not defective due to overbreadth (see <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1987) 482 U.S. 451, 457-458 [96 L.Ed.2d 398, 409, 107 S.Ct. 2502]; <em>In re Andre P. </em>(1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1164, 1174-1176 [277 Cal.Rptr. 363]), or because criminalizing the neglect of the elderly supposedly burdens the claimed associational rights of people of different ages; the Legislature may validly conclude that the special problems of the aged require particular statutory protection against criminal neglect, and may make statutory distinctions accordingly\u2014even though those distinctions may have some effect upon the behavior of certain groups of people (see the decision of this panel in <em>People </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1700, 1709 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 631]).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">We also reject the claim that section 368 is invalid because the statute fails to define the word \u201ccare\u201d in the phrase \u201cAny person who, . . . having the care or custody of any elder or dependent adult, willfully causes or permits the person or health of the elder or dependent adult to be injured [is guilty]. . . .\u201d We disagree. The word \u201ccare\u201d as used in section 368 is not at all recondite or mysterious; no definition is necessary in order to give fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>notice, and we doubt any definition could be given which would use simpler words or ones more likely to be understood. We note that any definition of the word \u201ccare\u201d would include having in one\u2019s house a helpless relative, such as the victim, who could not feed herself due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. We also note our Supreme Court has granted review in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Reiner </em>(1991) 7 Cal.App.4th 1582 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 472] (review granted Apr. 3, 1992 (S024925)), in which a panel of the Second District found to be impermissibly vague another statute (\u00a7 272) which criminalized the conduct of parents who, among other things, failed to exercise \u201creasonable care\u201d over their children\u2019s activities in street gangs. Regardless of the outcome in <em>Williams, </em>the statute in question here uses \u201ccare,\u201d in apposition to \u201ccustody\u201d and in the common sense of supervision or control, to define the class of persons who have elderly persons under their care\u2014it does not use the word as a shorthand and arguably vague formulation of a standard of conduct as in <em>Williams.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">We conclude section 368 is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">C.-G.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">III.
