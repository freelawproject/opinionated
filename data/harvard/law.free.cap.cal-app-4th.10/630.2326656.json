J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVP\">Probate Code section 6540, subdivision (b)(2) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA parent of the decedent who was actually dependent in whole or in part upon the decedent for support . . . may be given such reasonable family allowance out of the estate as the court in its discretion determines is necessary for [his or her] maintenance according to [his or her] circumstances during administration of the estate.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold that the probate court did not abuse the discretion granted by this statute when it denied a parent\u2019s application for a family allowance solely in order that a judgment creditor of the estate could be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Background<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The decedent, Paul M. Herrera, died intestate in December of 1987 without wife or issue. His mother, Marie Herrera, was appointed administrator of his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Upon petition of an unsatisfied judgment creditor of the estate, and because Mrs. Herrera had failed to submit an accounting as ordered, the probate court suspended her powers as administrator. The court subsequently removed Mrs. Herrera from that position and found her liable for the amount of the creditor\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">In June of 1991, after this creditor had its claim satisfied, another judgment creditor, Farrell Construction Company, Inc. (Farrell), moved to have Mrs. Herrera surcharged for the amount of its claim\u2014approximately $10,000 plus nine months of accrued interest<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\u2014against the estate. Two days later Mrs. Herrera filed a verified petition for a family allowance of $1,000 per month, retroactive to January 1, 1988, for the support of herself and her husband, Ralph Herrera, the decedent\u2019s father. Farrell alone objected on the grounds that, among other things, (1) Mrs. Herrera had not shown that the financial needs of herself and her husband could not be met from other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>sources, and (2) \u201cThere may be insufficient property, money or income of the estate ... for the payment of any family allowance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The basis for Farrell\u2019s second objection became apparent when Mrs. Herrera filed an accounting for the period she had been the estate\u2019s administrator. Mrs. Herrera sought the court\u2019s approval for slightly more than $20,000 of estate funds that had already been \u201c[ujtilized on a monthly basis by decedent\u2019s parents for basic living expenses to replace support given by decedent prior to his death.\u201d If these expenditures were judicially ratified, there would not be sufficient estate assets to pay the family allowance sought by Mrs. Herrera (and certainly not enough to satisfy Farrell\u2019s judgment). Farrell objected to this item of Mrs. Herrera\u2019s account, and asked that she be surcharged for it as well as the amount of Farrell\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The account, the motion for surcharge, and the petition for the family allowance were argued and decided together in September of 1991. During the course of the hearing the probate court was advised that the estate had assets of only about $2,000. Mrs. Herrera\u2019s account was approved except for the $20,000 she had withdrawn for living expenses; she was surcharged for this amount. As to the requested family allowance, the court\u2019s ruling was made in these terms: \u201cI\u2019m not going to award a family allowance at this time. If there\u2019s more in the estate, that might make it a different story. But I don\u2019t think that\u2014Under the circumstances, I think this creditor [i.e., Farrell] should be paid. If it can\u2019t be paid in full, I think after seeing the accounting, it\u2019s obvious that just $20,000 was taken without any Court order, and it\u2019s possible that I might award something. But it seems to me this creditor should be paid under the circumstances. So I\u2019ll deny the family allowance at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Mrs. Herrera appeals only from the ensuing written order denying her petition for a family allowance. That order is appealable. (\u00a7 7240, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Review</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Unknown at common law, the family allowance is the exclusive creature of statute. <em>(Hills </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1929) 207 Cal. 666, 667 [279 R 805, 65 A.L.R. 266]; <em>Estate of Silverman </em>(1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 180, 183 [57 Cal.Rptr. 379, 27 A.L.R.3d 856].) The necessary statutory authorization for the family allowance has been a feature of California law since the earliest days of statehood. Originally provided only for surviving wives and minor children (see Stats. 1850, ch. 129, \u00a7\u00a7 121-124, pp. 386-387; Stats. 1851, ch. 124, \u00a7\u00a7 120-123, pp. 462-463), allowances were subsequently extended to surviving husbands (Stats. 1951, ch. 1089, \u00a7 1, p. 2823), to \u201cadult children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>who have been declared incompetent\" (Stats. 1953, ch. 1215, \u00a7 1, p. 2772), and then to \u201cadult children who are physically or mentally incapacitated from earning a living and were actually dependent in whole or in part upon the decedent for support\u201d (Stats. 1972, ch. 569, \u00a7 1, p. 973).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">These are what may be called mandatory allowances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Their purpose is to ease the economic hardship presumably suffered by those whom the decedent either had a duty to support or actually provided support, during the period from the decedent\u2019s death until distribution of the estate. (See e.g., <em>Estate of Brooks </em>(1946) 28 Cal.2d 748, 755 [171 P.2d 724]; <em>Estate of Anderson </em>(1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 1010, 1014 [137 Cal.Rptr. 727]; <em>Estate of Jacobs </em>(1943) 61 Cal.App.2d 152,155-156 [142 P.2d 454].) By virtue of this humane purpose, and because they have priority over most other debts, charges, and liabilities of the estate (see \u00a7 11420, quoted at fn. 5, <em>post), </em>these family allowances are said to enjoy a \u201chighly preferential position\u201d <em>(Estate of Blair, supra, </em>42 Cal.2d 728 at p. 730) and to be \u201c \u2018strongly favored in the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Estate of Filtzer </em>(1949) 33 Cal.2d 776, 783 [205 P.2d 377] [citing and quoting <em>Estate of Jacobs, supra, </em>at p. 155].)</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">In 1982 the Legislature introduced a new category of recipients\u2014\u201cOther adult children who were actually dependent in whole or in part upon the decedent for support\u201d\u2014who could be granted \u201csuch reasonable allowance out of the estate as the court in its discretion determines is necessary for their maintenance according to their circumstances during the progress of the settlement of the estate.\u201d (Former \u00a7 680, subd. (b); Stats. 1982, ch. 520, \u00a7 6, p. 2444.) As part of a massive reorganization of the Probate Code enacted in 1983, the Legislature adopted a proposal from the Law Revision Commission (Tent. Recommendation Relating to Wills and Intestate Succession (Nov. 1982) 16 Cal. Law Revision Com. (1982) pp. 2301, 2341-2342) and added dependent parents as possible discretionary recipients of a family allowance. (Stats. 1983, ch. 842, \u00a7 55, p. 3088.)</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The statute presently governing both mandatory and discretionary family allowances is section 6540, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">\u201c(a) The following are entitled to such reasonable family allowance out of the estate as is necessary for their maintenance according to their circumstances during administration of the estate:</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>\u201c(1) The surviving spouse of the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">\u201c(2) Minor children of the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">\u201c(3) Adult children of the decedent who are physically or mentally incapacitated from earning a living and were actually dependent in whole or in part upon the decedent for support.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">\u201c(b) The following may be given such reasonable family allowance out of the estate as the court in its discretion determines is necessary for their maintenance according to their circumstances during administration of the estate:</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">\u201c(1) Other adult children of the decedent who were actually dependent in whole or in part upon the decedent for support.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">\u201c(2) A parent of the decedent who was actually dependent in whole or in part upon the decedent for support.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">\u201c(c) If a person otherwise eligible for family allowance has a reasonable maintenance from other sources and there are one or more other persons entitled to a family allowance, the family allowance shall be granted only to those who do not have a reasonable maintenance from other sources.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">The essence of Mrs. Herrera\u2019s position is that the probate court erred in refusing a family allowance for herself and her husband in order that Farrell\u2019s judgment could be satisfied from the estate\u2019s limited funds. Her supporting arguments, incorporating an impressive array of established principles governing family allowances, proceed along these lines: When presented with a request by a qualified applicant for a family allowance, the probate court has no discretion to deny the request (see <em>Estate of Baldwin </em>(1961) 190 Cal.App.2d 78, 80 [11 Cal.Rptr. 604]; <em>Estate of Secord </em>(1948) 84 Cal.App.2d 783, 785-786 [192 P.2d 81]; but see fn. 4, <em>ante), </em>which \u201cmust be granted.\u201d <em>(Estate of Blair, supra, </em>42 Cal.2d 728 at p. 730.) In conformity with the payment hierarchy established by statute,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> family allowances have priority over creditors\u2019 claims even when reduced to judgment. (See <em>Estate of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number><em>Secord, supra, </em>at pp. 786-787; <em>Estate of Ettlinger </em>(1943) 56 Cal.App.2d 603, 604-605 [132 P.2d 895].) The probate court has no authority to alter this preference. (See <em>Estate of Black </em>(1976) 65 Cal.App.3d 112, 117 [135 Cal.Rptr. 115].) A family allowance is not lost by either delay in seeking it, or by the fact that the applicant has previously received estate funds from the estate\u2019s administrator without proper authorization. (See <em>Estate of Fretwell </em>(1908) 154 Cal. 638, 639 [98 P. 1058].)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Mrs. Herrera\u2019s initial mistake is viewing herself as having an \u201centitlement\u201d or \u201cright\u201d to an allowance. Section 6540 differentiates between classes of claimants covered by subdivision (a)\u2014who \u201care entitled\u201d to a family allowance\u2014and those covered by subdivision (b)\u2014who \u201cmay be given\u201d an allowance. This plain language establishes that Mrs. Herrera has no entitlement because she is a subdivision (b) claimant. The only right unquestionably belonging to her was the right to apply for an allowance (see <em>Cunha\u2019s Estate </em>v. <em>C.I.R. </em>(9th Cir. 1960) 279 F.2d 292, 297), a right which has now been exhausted. Unless and until granted one by the probate court, she had neither an entitlement (see <em>In re Lux </em>(1896) 114 Cal. 73, 87 [45 P. 1023] (dis. opn. of Temple, J.)) nor a vested right <em>{Estate of Blair, supra, </em>42 Cal.2d 728 at p. 733) to an allowance. Without an order to that effect, Mrs. Herrera does not stand on an equal footing with Farrell, the unstated premise underpinning most of her arguments. Whereas Farrell has its conclusive final judgment in the form required by law (see fn. 3, <em>ante), </em>Mrs. Herrera has only her hope of a family allowance. There is consequently no basis for treating Mrs. Herrera as someone with a family allowance who is to be kept waiting while a creditor improperly gets ahead of her in the line for payment from the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Given that all of the authorities cited by the parties deal only with mandatory allowances, they obviously cannot be dispositive on the issue of whether the probate court wrongly denied the discretionary allowance requested by Mrs. Herrera. Upon discovering the absence of any reported decision addressing the nature and extent of the discretion recently granted by section 6540, we requested supplemental briefing as to the scope of the probate court\u2019s discretion and whether equitable considerations could figure in the exercise of that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Mrs. Herrera submits that \u201cThe reason for granting discretion to the Court in connection with a family allowance to certain categories of claimants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>such as dependent parents, clearly does not imply that the Court is entitled to place the interests of creditors above the interests of the dependent parents.\u201d She sees the probate court\u2019s discretion as confined to these factors: (1) \u201cWas the parent(s) actually dependent in whole or in part on the decedent for support?\u201d (2) \u201cWhat were the circumstances of the dependent parent(s) at the time of the decedent\u2019s death?\u201d and (3) \u201cWhat is the amount necessary or what is a reasonable amount for the maintenance of the dependent parent(s)?\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This view of the probate court\u2019s discretion is too restrictive.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The gist of Mrs. Herrera\u2019s view is that if a parent can show a continuing need for maintenance previously supplied by the decedent, the only real issue for decision is the amount of the allowance. The similarity between this approach and that used for awarding a mandatory allowance (see fn. 4, <em>ante) </em>is striking. It would in effect require parents such as the Herreras to be found dependent as a matter of law, which would in turn make it virtually obligatory that they be awarded an allowance. For all intents and purposes, this would create a new class of mandatory allowance. It would not only obliterate the distinctions between the groups of applicants so carefully delineated in subdivisions (a) and (b) of section 6540, it would stultify the discretion that the statute expressly gives to the probate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Judicial discretion must be informed, so that its exercise does not amount to a shot in the dark, (See e.g., <em>In re Cortez </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 78, 85-86 [98 Cal.Rptr. 307, 490 P.2d 819]; <em>Gossman </em>v. <em>Gossman </em>(1942) 52 Cal.App.2d 184, 194 [126 P.2d 178].) As previously mentioned, Mrs. Herrera\u2019s petition for a family allowance came on for hearing at the same time as the account she was submitting, together with Farrell\u2019s motion to have her surcharged. As is apparent from the probate court\u2019s ruling, information developed in reviewing Mrs. Herrera\u2019s stewardship of the estate played a part in the decision to deny her petition. This was entirely appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">It would be equally appropriate for equitable considerations to have motivated that decision.  Equity is implicit in the exercise of discretion (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Crandell </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 833, 863 [251 Cal.Rptr. 227, 760 P.2d 423] and decisions cited), and has long been recognized as inhering in the jurisdiction of the probate court. (See e.g., <em>Schlyen </em>v. <em>Schlyen </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 361, 371 [273 P.2d 897]; <em>Verdier </em>v. <em>Roach </em>(1892) 96 Cal. 467, 478 [31 P. 554].) Accordingly, equitable principles could be consulted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>court when it evaluated Mrs. Herrera\u2019s petition for a family allowance. (See <em>Estate of Yoell </em>(1913) 164 Cal. 540, 554-555 [129 P. 999].)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">A hallmark of equity is comparing the relative merits and faults of parties with respect to the controversy. (See <em>Blain </em>v. <em>Doctor\u2019s Co. </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1048,1059 [272 Cal.Rptr. 250]; Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3514, 3525, 3527, 3529.) Such a comparison does not work to Mrs. Herrera\u2019s advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Entrusted with administering the estate, Mrs. Herrera was removed as administrator after three years in that position for failing to perform her responsibilities. During that period, while Farrell\u2019s undisputed claim for work done while decedent was still alive went unpaid, she was withdrawing more than $20,000 of estate funds for her private use without the requisite authorization from the probate court. This went undiscovered until Mrs. Herrera filed an accounting, 10 months after the deadline set by the court when it suspended her powers as administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">By the time it heard Mrs. Herrera\u2019s petition for a family allowance, the probate court knew that the estate\u2019s financial resources were meager and inadequate to its liabilities. The court could conclude that granting the allowance as requested might produce several undesirable consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">First, it would burden the estate with a new liability of approximately $30,000, which would have the dual effects of making the estate insolvent and Farrell\u2019s judgment worthless.  Existing precedent holds that a probate court has discretion to deny or terminate a mandatory allowance if necessary to avoid insolvency threatened by pending litigation. (See <em>Estate of Anderson, supra, </em>68 Cal.App.3d 1010 at pp. 1013-1015 and decisions cited.) There is no reason in either law or logic why a comparable latitude should not extend to discretionary allowances. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3511.)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">Second, the family allowance might be used by Mrs. Herrera as a credit to offset the $20,000 she had already spent, should the court order that the latter sum be repaid to the estate, as indeed occurred. Although the fact that an applicant for a family allowance has improperly received estate funds from the administrator does not preclude a mandatory allowance (see <em>Estate of Fretwell, supra, </em>154 Cal. 638 at p. 639), the situation is materially different if the applicant for a discretionary allowance is herself the administrator and thus paid the funds to herself. Such an applicant would not have the benefit of the defense of good faith reliance on the acts of another. The applicant\u2019s own conduct being a fit subject for equitable scrutiny (see <em>Estate of Lankershim </em>(1936) 6 Cal.2d 568, 573-574 [58 P.2d 1282]), the probate court could conclude that a number of factors relative to Mrs. Herrera\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>actions weighed against granting her application. Her delay in submitting her accounting in the face of an express order, plus her unauthorized removal of estate funds, hindered settlement of the estate and also moved it to the brink of insolvency. The probate court could take these matters into consideration. (See <em>Estate of Dougherty </em>(1951) 102 Cal.App.2d 785, 788 [228 P.2d 857].)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">It is true that a mandatory family allowance will not be denied solely by reason of delay in making the application for it. (See e.g., <em>Estate of Fretwell, supra, </em>154 Cal. 638.) Nevertheless, the probate court could infer from the timing of Mrs. Herrera\u2019s application that her motive was to consume all of the estate\u2019s assets and ensure that Farrell\u2019s judgment would ultimately go unsatisfied. (Cf. <em>Estate of Secord, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.2d 783 at p. 785.)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">With the family allowance petition, the accounting, and the motion to surcharge all presented to it for decision, the probate court had jurisdiction to effect an equitable resolution of the entire controversy between Mrs. Herrera and Farrell. (See <em>Estate of Baglione </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 192, 196-197 [53 Cal.Rptr. 139, 417 P.2d 683]; <em>Estate of Eilert </em>(1933) 131 Cal.App. 409, 416-417 [21 P.2d 630].) But, whereas Farrell had a valid claim perfected in a timely and proper fashion, Mrs. Herrera had a demonstrated history of noncompliance with established procedures and an express court order. These wrongful acts could be deemed to amount to an equitable disqualification of her subsequent petition for a family allowance. (See <em>DeGarmo </em>v. <em>Goldman </em>(1942) 19 Cal.2d 755, 764 [123 P.2d 1]; <em>Estate of Helwinkel </em>(1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 283, 287-288 [18 Cal.Rptr. 473].) In ruling that \u201cUnder the circumstances, I think this creditor should be paid,\u201d the probate court accepted that it would be inequitable for Mrs. Herrera to become the indirect beneficiary of her prior misconduct at the expense of an innocent party who might already have been paid but for the misconduct delaying settlement of the estate. (See Civ. Code, \u00a7 3517; <em>Newhall </em>v. <em>Newhall </em>(1964) 227 Cal.App.2d 800, 819 [39 Cal.Rptr. 144].) In light of the circumstances discussed above, it cannot be said that the probate court\u2019s ruling constitutes an abuse of the discretion granted by section 6540.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The order is affirmed.

After commencing an action in municipal court, Farrell obtained an uncontested judgment in the amount of $10,332.12.
