Code, \u00a7\u00a7 459/460), two counts of unlawful taking of a vehicle (Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851, subd. (a)) and one count of receiving stolen property (Pen. Code, \u00a7 496).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">On appeal, defendant has raised the following contentions: (1) The trial court committed \u201cper se\u201d reversible error by conducting a portion of the voir dire proceedings in its chambers and outside the presence of the public, thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>violating defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a public trial; (2) there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for receiving stolen property; (3) there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction on one of the counts of unlawful taking of a vehicle; (4) the trial court committed reversible instructional error by giving the \u201cflight\u201d instruction; (5) the trial court violated section 654 in sentencing defendant; and (6) the trial court improperly relied on several sentencing factors in imposing consecutive sentences on defendant. We shall conclude that defendant\u2019s first contention is meritorious and, consequently, that the judgment entered below must be reversed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n                   Given our conclusion as to defendant\u2019s first contention, there is no need to address defendant\u2019s other contentions on appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Given the singular ground upon which we have determined to reverse the judgment entered below, there is no need for a lengthy and seamless rendition of the facts underlying the charges brought against defendant. It suffices to note that defendant, together with a female companion (Portillo), was charged with various counts of burglary and unlawfully taking a vehicle\u2014which counts referred to events occurring on two distinctly different occasions. Defendant pled not guilty to all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Jury trial as to both defendant and codefendant Portillo thereafter commenced. At the very beginning of the jury selection proceedings, and outside the presence of the venirepersons, the trial judge proposed a particular procedure for selecting the jury\u2014which procedure was new to counsel and is best explained by simply setting forth the following somewhat condensed and edited version of exchanges which took place between the trial judge and counsel:</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">\u201cThe Court: Back on the record. My proposal is, counsel, that I\u2019ll voir dire on all\u2014in all areas and I\u2019ll receive, as I have Mrs. McGuire\u2019s [Portillo\u2019s counsel], all your concerns and questions you wish to ask I\u2019ll address to the jury for you. I will also give you each ten minutes with the .panel beyond my extensive voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">\u201cMr. Levine [counsel for defendant]: And by \u2018the panel,\u2019 the Court means the\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">\u201cThe Court. The first 20, right.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">\u201cMr. Levine: I didn\u2019t count. There\u2019s gonna be 20 people sitting up there?</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">\u201cThe Court: A total of 20, right.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">\u201cMr. Levine: So we would have ten minutes each, for a total of 30 minutes, since there\u2019s three counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">\u201cThe Court: Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-13\">\u201cMr. Levine: To question the first 20 people?</p>\n<p id=\"b404-14\">\u201cThe Court: Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>\u201cMr. Levine: And then if we have preempts [sic] or for cause, what about the individual jurors that come up there?</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">\u201cThe Court: We\u2019ll do a chambers striking, as I suggested to you, and then if we have to have additional jurors beyond that, we\u2019ll discuss how much time is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">\u201cMr. Harrison [prosecutor]: The chambers striking, I\u2019m uncertain what the Court intends on that.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">\u201cMr. Levine: Are we going to wait until all of them are questioned? \u201cThe Court: All questioned and all the for cause [challenges] passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">\u201cMr. Levine: Then we\u2019ll go inside and exercise peremptories back and forth with the people seated?</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">\u201cThe Court: Filling the chairs of those\u2014 \u201cMr. Levine: On this side of the box?</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">\u201cThe Court: If you exercise a perempt on chair one, we\u2019ll fill it with\u2014 \u201cMr. Levine: Chair 14?</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">\u201cThe Court: Shall we have two alternates in this case? I think one will be enough. So we\u2019ll fill it with chair 14, right. And then so we\u2019ll have a jury of 13 eventually impaneled, but we\u2019ll fill chair one with chair 13 [sfc], then we\u2019ll go on the [s/c] to the other side and then we\u2019ll fill\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">\u201cMr. Harrison: You just go through the in-chambers striking, peremptory striking, one time, and subsequent excus\u00e1is\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b405-13\">\u201cThe Court: My hope is that we\u2019ll have a jury as a result of that. If we don\u2019t, we\u2019ll do that striking, then fill the additional chairs, those seven chairs with an additional seven and qualify them and then go through a similar striking process.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-14\">\u201cMr. Harrison: Out of the presence of the jury? \u201cThe Court: Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-15\">\u201cMr. Harrison: I\u2019m not sure if I want to do it that way.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-16\">\u201cThe Court: Well, I do. And then I\u2019ll come out and announce who\u2019s to leave the box and who\u2019s to replace who.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>\u201cMr. Harrison: I think we have the right to do our jury selection in the open court room in front of the jury. I understand the desire of moving it along speedily and that sort of thing, but at the same time, I think the panel has a right to know who\u2019s excused by whom.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\u201cThe Court: Well, we\u2019ll do it my way, counsel. Thank you.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\u201cMr. Harrison: I want to make a record on the jury selection process, specifically on 13259 of the pamphlet given to the Court, the second column, the fourth paragraph, \u2018while concluding.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">\u201cThe Court: That\u2019s interesting and it\u2019s informative. I\u2019ll be happy to select 12 and not 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">\u201cThe Court: It admonishes us to consider a jury of 12 as opposed to 14, . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">\u201cMr. Harrison: There\u2019s one other issue that needs to be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">\u201cMr. Harrison: In addition, the peremptory challenge outside the jury, let me cite to the Court the Press Enterprise Company versus Superior Court, a 1984 case, U.S. Supreme Court, 464 U.S. 501 [78 L.Ed.2d 629, 104 S.Ct. 819], for the proposition that the voir dire process is a public process. The public has right to be here. The People and the defense and the public have a right to a public trial, and the exercise of peremptory challenges in chambers, sequestered away from the public area, the jury itself, violates that public process.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">\u201cMr. Levine: I think the public just spoke and told us that voir dire is something the public doesn\u2019t want.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">\u201cThe Court: I am, I acknowledge to you, experimenting with these procedures to expedite the jury selection, and I think the process that I used previously in the Kolstead case, which I suggest to you now is one that is\u2014does not violate any basic right of anyone, indeed it can be argued, perhaps persuasively, that it\u2019s an even better process because nobody is prejudiced by the exercise of peremptory challenges in this manner. [][] There\u2019s always a tendency, when those are exercised in front of the jury, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>suggest, by the number exercised or not exercised, that one party is more blameless than the other in that challenging process. So I think that this may be\u2014this more sanitized method of selection may be preferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\u201cMr. Harrison: It may be preferred, but it\u2019s contrary to Statute 226 of the Civil Code of Procedure\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">\u201cThe Court: I just read 226, and it doesn\u2019t say a thing about that. Point to me what my proposed process abridges in 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">\u201cMr. Harrison: Challenges shall be taken first by the defendants and then by the People. Peremptory challenge, under 231, prescribes the method of peremptory challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">\u201cThe Court: That\u2019s the way we\u2019ll do it, taking first by the defense, then by the People, in the striking manner that I\u2019ve suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">\u201cMr. Harrison: If we\u2019re going to do it one at a time, it does nothing to speed the the [sic] jury selection process.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">\u201cThe Court: Well, it sure does.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">\u201cMr. Harrison: Are you requiring me to make all of my peremptory challenges out of the first batch at the very beginning of the selection process?</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">\u201cThe Court: No. We\u2019ll do it just as we would do it here except we\u2019ll do it in the privacy of chambers, moving through those that have been qualified and passed on for cause. We\u2019ll move through that panel first, and it may be that you\u2019re satisfied with the number that you have within that panel. And if you\u2019re not, we\u2019ll bring another group forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">\u201cThe Court: Are you understanding what I\u2019m\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b407-14\">\u201cMr. Harrison: No, I don\u2019t, not at all. This is very burdensome.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-15\">\u201cThe Court: All right. We\u2019ll qualify all 20, then we\u2019ll each retreat to chambers. I\u2019ll ask the People for their exercise of their first peremptory, and then we\u2019ll move juror number 13 into that first challenged chair. And then we\u2019ll move to the defendants jointly\u2014they have ten jointly\u2014and they\u2019ll exercise their perempt. Then chair number 14 will occupy that seat. [][] We\u2019ll go back to the prosecution to exercise their second perempt, and if you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>exercise a perempt at that point, we\u2019ll move the 15th juror into that chair, [f] Do you follow me? Back and forth, just like we would do out here\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">\u201cMr. Harrison: Up to the point I\u2019ve exercised 20?</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u201cThe Court: \u2022 Up to the point where we\u2019ve basically exhausted this panel, if we reach that point and you\u2019re not happy with the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\u201cMr. Harrison: This is unduly lengthening the process. I\u2019ve selected juries in this courtroom before and as the Court is aware, I do not spend a whole lot of time on the individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">\u201cThe Court: I thought we would try this, folks. I\u2019ve found it\u2014other judges in the state with whom I\u2019ve discussed this found it to be expeditious. I found it, in the one case where I tried it, to be remarkably expeditious. We chose a Murder One jury in the first 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">\u201cMr. Harrison: If I were inclined to go back and exercise my objection to three or four people all at one time\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">\u201cThe Court: It wouldn\u2019t be at one time. We\u2019d just go back and forth, as we do out here, basically, until we\u2019ve exhausted that panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">\u201cMs. McGuire: It would be all at one sitting?</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">\u201cThe Court: It would be very quick. Instead of having people move back and forth and further examination by the Court and counsel, that\u2019s where you save that time. The block of time is saved in the movement of people and in further questioning by all of us.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">\u201cMr. Harrison: I think it\u2019s going to result in a lengthening of the process, but that\u2019s your prerogative.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">\u201cThe Court: So, we\u2019ll give it a shot this time and see how it flies.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-14\">\u201cMr. Harrison: Has the Court addressed the public nature of the trial issue that I brought up, The Press Enterprise Case versus Superior Court?</p>\n<p id=\"b408-15\">\u201cThe Court: I don\u2019t see that this violates any public trial provisions, and it will be interesting, if that is your objection, or is that the objection by the defense?</p>\n<p id=\"b408-16\">\u201cMr. Levine: I might as well join.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Okay. Well, we have armed the defense with a new possibility for reversal. That\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll go with it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The trial court thereafter conducted the voir dire proceedings in accordance with the procedure set forth above, to wit:</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">(1) Once the trial counsel had \u201cpassed for cause\u201d on a panel of 20 prospective jurors, the trial court addressed the prospective jurors as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Members of the jury, all three attorneys have passed for cause, which means none of the attorneys have any legal cause why any among you should be excused from the panel. M] I\u2019m going to, however, recess with them now and discuss with them their peremptory challenges. The law provides that each attorney comes equipped with a number of challenges that can be made without cause given. The reasons for those challenges are best known to the attorney who makes the challenge and may be apparent to no one else, ffl What I\u2019m saying is if you\u2019re asked, when we return to the courtroom, to step from the box because of one of these challenges, please don\u2019t feel put down. Don\u2019t feel embarrassed by it. It happens to the very best among us, I can assure you. ffl If you\u2019ll relax right there just for a few minutes, we\u2019ll return and we\u2019ll have further instructions for you on these peremptory challenges. Just relax in your chairs, if you will. [1] Counsel, will you join me, please. [][] (The following proceedings were held in chambers, out of the presence and hearing of the prospective jurors.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">(2) In chambers, trial counsel proceeded to exercise their peremptory challenges in an alternating fashion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">(3) Once trial counsel had exercised a total of eight peremptory challenges (leaving twelve prospective jurors \u201cin the box\u201d), the trial judge and trial counsel returned to the courtroom and the trial judge made the following announcement:</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">\u201cThe Court: All right. The Court is going to thank and excuse the following persons now before the bar, with the Court\u2019s thanks for your being here today and being part of this important jurisprudence process: [ft] We\u2019ll thank and excuse Gene Trudo, Linda Herbel, Merriana Nunez, Ann Trunnelle, Vicki Munden, John Conway, Ronald McPherson and Ben Wolff. [1] You can all now absent yourself from the box and you are free to go.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>(4) The entire process was repeated a second time. After another \u201csub-panel\u201d of prospective jurors had been \u201cpassed for cause,\u201d the trial judge and trial counsel retreated once again to chambers and trial counsel once again exercised peremptory challenges in the same alternating fashion. Upon returning to the courtroom, the trial judge announced:</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">\u201cThe attorneys have asked me to thank and excuse the following members of the panel now in the box and before the box: We\u2019ll thank and excuse Lucinda Rodriguez. . . . Leamon Alexander. . . . Renato Urmanita, . . . Marceline Lucero, . . . Otis Jordan, . . . Bill Lawrence, . . . Cezar Rodriguez, . . . Judy Schiffer, . . . Margaret Goss, . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">(5) Inasmuch as the general consensus of trial counsel was that only one trial juror and one alternate juror remained to be chosen, the trial judge and trial counsel thereafter conducted the remainder of the voir dire and the exercise of the remainder of the peremptory challenges in open court.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Thus, a total of 17 prospective jurors were peremptorily challenged in chambers.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">The case was thereafter tried to the jury. Following the evidentiary phase of the trial, the jury found defendant guilty of one count of first degree (residential) burglary, two counts of an unlawful taking of a vehicle and one count of receiving stolen property as a lesser related offense of burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">At the sentencing hearing, the trial court imposed the midterm of four years for the conviction on the first degree burglary count, consecutive terms of one year each for the two unlawful taking of a vehicle counts and a consecutive term of eight months for the receiving stolen property count\u2014 for an aggregate sentence of six years and eight months in state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">Additional facts will be referred to, as needed, in the discussion which follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">Defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s \u201cchamber striking\u201d procedure for conducting the peremptory challenge process violated his constitutional right to a public trial. The constitutional provisions to which defendant has reference are:</p>\n<p id=\"b410-12\">(1) Under the United States Constitution\u2014(a) the Sixth Amendment (\u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>public trial, . . .\u201d) and (b) the Fourteenth Amendment (\u201c. . . ; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; . . (See <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 39, 41 [81 L.Ed.2d 31, 35, 104 S.Ct. 2210].)</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">(2) Under the California Constitution\u2014article I, section 15, clause 1 (\u201cThe defendant in a criminal cause has the right to a speedy public trial, . . .\u201d).

[Citations.] <em>Proceedings for the impanelment of the jury are included within the term \u2018public trial.' (People </em>v. <em>Teitelbaum </em>(1958) 163 Cal.App.2d 184, 206 [329 P.2d 157].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d 134, 157, fn. 7, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Federal authority is to the same effect. In <em>Press-Enterprise Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 464 U.S. 501 [78 L.Ed.2d 629, 104 S.Ct. 819], the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cthe voir dire process must be open\u201d (464 U.S. at p. 509, fn. 8 [78 L.Ed.2d at p. 638]) to the public and the press on First Amendment grounds. In <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court stated that \u201cthere can be little doubt that the explicit Sixth Amendment right of the accused is no less protective of a public trial than the implicit First Amendment right of the press and public.\u201d (467 U.S. at p. 46 [8.1 L.Ed.2d at p. 38].)</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">The peremptory challenge process, precisely because it is an integral part of the voir dire/jury impanelment process, is a part of the \u201ctrial\u201d to which a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a public trial extends. Thus, in this case, the trial court\u2019s \u201cchamber striking\u201d method of conducting a portion of the peremptory challenge process was at least a prima facie violation of defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a public trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">In reaching this conclusion, we reject two arguments to the contrary:</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">(1) It cannot reasonably be argued that the presence of a certified court reporter during the in camera peremptory challenge proceedings (recording verbatim the verbal statements of all who are present), and the resultant after-the-fact availability of transcripts of the reporter\u2019s notes of those proceedings, render those proceedings \u201cpublic.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court noted that: \u201cThe requirement of a public trial is for the benefit of the accused; that the public may see he is fairly dealt with and not unjustly condemned, and that the presence of interested spectators may keep his triers keenly alive to a sense of their responsibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>and to the importance of their functions . . . .\u201d (467 U.S. at p. 46 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 38], citations, internal quotation marks and fn. omitted.) This benefit of public oversight or superintendence accruing to a criminal defendant as a result of the openness inherent in a truly public trial is largely lost if the only openness attending the trial proceedings (or any portion thereof) is to be found in an after-the-fact review of a cold written record of proceedings to which the public had no access.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">(2) Nor can it reasonably be argued that the \u201cchamber striking\u201d methodology used by the trial court in this case is no more a violation of a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a public trial than the commonly accepted procedure of holding \u201cside bar conferences\u201d (i.e., conferences between court and counsel, either at the trial judge\u2019s bench or elsewhere but, in any event, outside the hearing of other persons present in open court).  It has long been recognized that \u201c[t]he trial of the action, so far as the term \u2018public trial\u2019 is concerned, consists in the proceedings for the impanelment of the jury, the opening statements of counsel, the presentation of evidence, the arguments, the instructions to the jury and the return of the verdict,\u201d but does not include conferences between court and counsel where \u201cthe subject matter of the conferences between court and counsel was a question or questions of law, and not matters advanced for consideration of the triers of fact.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Teitelbaum </em>(1958) 163 Cal.App.2d 184, 206-207 [329 P.2d 157], see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Murphy </em>(1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 905, 925-926 [111 Cal.Rptr. 295].)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">B. <em>Limiting Exceptions or Qualifications to a Criminal Defendant\u2019s Right to a Public Trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">In <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court announced a limitation/qualification on and to a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a public trial, a limitation/qualification which the Supreme Court \u201cimported\u201d from <em>Press-Enterprise Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">\u201c[T]he Court has made clear that the right to an open trial may give way in certain cases to other rights or interests, such as the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial or the government\u2019s interest in inhibiting disclosure of sensitive information. Such circumstances will be rare, however, and the balance of interests must be struck with special care. We stated the applicable rules in Press-Enterprise: [f] \u2018The presumption of openness may be overcome only by an overriding interest based on findings that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest. The interest is to be articulated along with findings specific enough that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>reviewing court can determine whether the closure order was properly entered.\u2019 464 US, at 510 .. . .\u201d (467 U.S. at p. 45 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 38].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">In this case, the trial court did articulate the \u201cinterests\u201d sought to be served by utilizing the \u201cchamber striking\u201d method of conducting the peremptory challenge process: (1) \u201c[T]o expedite jury selection\u201d; and (2) to avoid, by using a \u201cmore sanitized method of selection,\u201d a trial counsel\u2019s being prejudicially disfavored by a juror or jurors as a result of that counsel\u2019s exercise of peremptory challenges. However, even if we were to assume arguendo that there is empirical evidence to support the trial court\u2019s proposition that the \u201cchamber striking\u201d method of conducting peremptory challenge proceedings effectively serves the interests of expediting and \u201csanitizing\u201d those proceedings, no cogent argument can be mounted that either of these interests involves \u201chigher values\u201d than that of a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a public trial. Thus, the trial court\u2019s closure of the peremptory challenge process to public view was not justified under the <em>\u201cPress-Enterprise!Waller </em>balancing test.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">C. <em>Preservation of the \u201cPublic Trial Issue\u201d for Appellate Review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">At oral argument, the People contended for the first time that defendant had failed to preserve this issue for appellate review.  It is a clearly understood principle of appellate review, so well established as to need no citation to authority, that contentions raised for the first time at oral argument are disfavored and may be rejected solely on the ground of their untimeliness.  However, given the constitutional importance of the issue here in question, we will address the People\u2019s argument to the limited extent needed to disclose its lack of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">The People argue that the prosecuting attorney objected to the trial court\u2019s proposed \u201cchamber striking\u201d method of conducting the peremptory challenge process only on the ground of the press/public\u2019s <em>First Amendment </em>right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>to a public trial, and not on the ground of a criminal defendant\u2019s <em>Sixth Amendment </em>right to a public trial\u2014and, thus, when defendant\u2019s counsel joined in the prosecuting attorney\u2019s objection to the \u201cchamber striking\u201d procedure he (defense counsel) was <em>not </em>asserting his client\u2019s individual right to a public trial. From this, the People go on to argue that defendant, by failing to object to the \u201cchamber striking\u201d procedure on Sixth Amendment grounds in the trial court, waived his right to make that argument on appeal. In making this waiver argument, the People rely on two recent opinions by our Supreme Court: (a) <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d 134, at page 157 (\u201cIt is well settled that [the right of a criminal defendant to a public trial] may be waived by the failure to assert it in timely fashion. [Citations.]\u201d); and (b) <em>People </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 787, at page 813 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 696, 819 P.2d 436] (\u201cA defendant \u2018may, by his own acts or acquiescence, waive <em>his right </em>[to a public trial] and thereby preclude any subsequent challenge by him of an order excluding the public.\u2019. . . [Citations.]\u201d) The People\u2019s argument is fundamentally flawed in two respects:</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">(1) The Supreme Court authorities relied on by the People address factual scenarios which differ materially from the factual scenario presented by the instant case. In <em>Thompson, </em>defense counsel did not object (either explicitly or implicitly) to the \u201csequestered voir dire\u201d procedure utilized by the trial court in that case. In <em>Edwards, </em>defense counsel specifically objected to <em>allowing </em>certain portions of the voir dire proceedings to be conducted in public. In neither case did defense counsel make a specific objection, such as the one which was made in this case by defendant\u2019s counsel (by way of joinder in the prosecuting attorney\u2019s objection), to the \u201cclosing\u201d of portions of the jury selection process. The facts extant in <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Edwards </em>made the application of a \u201cwaiver of argument on appeal\u201d doctrine appropriate in those cases\u2014but no such facts exist in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">(2) The record on appeal in this case does not convincingly support the People\u2019s assertion that only a First Amendment objection was made to the trial court\u2019s proposed \u201cchamber striking\u201d procedure. The prosecuting attorney specifically pointed out to the trial court that \u201c[t]he People <em>and </em>the defense <em>and </em>the public have a right to a public trial.\u201d (Italics added.) In the same vein, the trial court stated that \u201cI don\u2019t see that this violates <em>any </em>public trial provisions, . . .\u201d (Italics added.) While it is true that the only specific authority cited by the prosecuting attorney in support of his objection was <em>Press-Enterprise Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>464 U.S. 501 (which opinion concerned the press/public\u2019s First Amendment right to a public trial), we do not find that that fact, alone, is determinative of the issue. The record is ambiguous. Given the fact that defense counsel made a specific objection to the precise judicial procedure in question, we are not inclined to find a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>waiver of a fundamental constitutional right based on suppositions, speculation and conjectural inferences drawn from a strained reading of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">D. <em>The Appropriate Remedy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Defendant has made no showing\u2014indeed, has not attempted to show\u2014 that he was actually prejudiced by the \u201cchamber striking\u201d method of conducting the peremptory challenge proceedings in this case. However, defendant argues, correctly, that a violation of a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a public trial constitutes \u201cper se\u201d reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Case authority is virtually unanimous to the effect that a violation of a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a public trial constitutes \u201cper se\u201d reversible error:<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">(a) In <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court agreed with \u201cthe consistent view of the lower federal courts that the defendant should not be required to prove specific prejudice in order to obtain relief for a violation of the public-trial guarantee.\u201d (467 U.S. at p. 49 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 40], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">(b) Just this last year, in <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante </em>(1991) 499 U.S._[113 L.Ed.2d 302, 111 S.Ct. 1246], the United States Supreme Court reaffirmed the position it had taken on this issue in <em>Waller: </em>\u201cSince our decision in Chapman [v. California (1967) 386 U.S. 18 (17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824)], other cases have added to the category of constitutional errors which are not subject to harmless error the following: ... the right to public trial, Waller v. Georgia, 467 US 39, 49, n 9, 81 L Ed 2d 31, 104 S Ct 2210 (1984). Each of these constitutional deprivations is a similar structural defect affecting the framework within which the trial proceeds, rather than simply an error in the trial process itself.\u201d (499 U.S. at p._[113 L.Ed.2d at p. 331].)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">(c) California authority is to like effect. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Byrnes </em>(1948) 84 Cal.App.2d 72, 78-80 [190 P.2d 290], expressly approved in <em>People </em>v. <em>Pompa-Ortiz, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 527.)</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">We do not lightly reverse criminal convictions in the total absence of any showing of specific prejudice or harm to the defendant flowing from the proceedings had below. In short, we are loath to \u201cexalt form over function.\u201d Further, we are sympathetic and sensitive to the needs and desires of the trial bench to find new and creative ways to make the trial process more efficient and streamlined; indeed, we would be remiss if we were not to <em>encourage </em>the trial bench, at every reasonable opportunity, to be creative and innovative in finding ways to increase the efficiency of the public trial process. In this case, however\u2014notwithstanding the lack of any showing of prejudice or harm to the defendant, and irrespective of the trial bench\u2019s need for efficiency\u2014we are constrained to conclude that the \u201cchamber striking\u201d procedure adopted and applied by the trial court in this case to direct and manage the exercise of peremptory challenges violated defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a public trial. Consequently, the implementation of that procedure constitutes \u201cper se\u201d reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The judgment entered below is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Hollenhorst, Acting P. J., and McDaniel, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">Respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied February 2, 1993.

We granted the People an opportunity to respond to defendant\u2019s letter brief. Defendant\u2019s supplemental letter brief, and the People\u2019s response thereto, addressed a recent opinion issued by the First District concerning a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a public trial, <em>People </em>v. <em>Woodward </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 114 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 624]). Our Supreme Court granted review in <em>Woodward </em>on July 9, 1992 (S026586). Consequently, we have disregarded <em>Woodward, </em>as well as the parties\u2019 letter briefs concerning <em>Woodward, </em>in analyzing the issue of a criminal defendant\u2019s right to a public trial in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Although there is no need to address defendant\u2019s contention concerning the giving of the \u201cflight\u201d instruction in the specific context of this case, we do want to address it, if only briefly, in general terms. Because we find ourselves confronting this issue on a recurring basis, we want to disabuse defense counsel generally of the notion that the contention has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"AGU\">CALJIC No. 2.52 states: \u201cThe flight of a person immediately after the commission of a crime, or after [he] [she] is accused of a crime, is not sufficient in itself to establish [his] [her] guilt, but is a fact which, if proved, may be considered by you in the light of all other proved facts in deciding the question of [his] [her] guilt or innocence. The weight to which such circumstance is entitled is a matter for the jury to determine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AlT\">Defendant argues that the giving of CALJIC No. 2.52 in this case favored the prosecution and constituted an improper \u201cpinpoint\u201d instruction contrary to the guidance of <em>People </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 1126 [248 Cal.Rptr. 600, 755 P.2d 1049]. Defendant is in error.</p>\n<p id=\"A01T\">In <em>Wright, </em>our Supreme Court held that it was improper to give requested instructions \u201cthat improperly impl[y] certain conclusions from specified evidence\u201d because such instructions run afoul of \u201cthe well settled rule against argumentative instructions on a disputed question of fact.\u201d (45 Cal.3d at p. 1137.) CALJIC No. 2.52 is not the type of instruction to which <em>Wright </em>had reference:</p>\n<p id=\"Aiv\">(1) CALJIC No. 2.52, in and of itself, refers to no specific evidence. Indeed, the instruction acknowledges the possibility that the fact of a flight is a matter which the jury might find not to have been shown by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"AnQ\">(2) Apropos of the above, the trial court almost always also instructs the jury (as it did in this case) with CALJIC No. 17.31 (5th ed.), which states in part: \u201cWhether some instructions apply will depend upon what you find to be the facts. Disregard any instruction which applies to facts determined by you not to exist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ab1\">No credible argument (apparent to us, at any rate) can be made that CALJIC No. 2.52, especially when given in conjunction with CALJIC No. 17.31, constitutes a \u201cpinpoint\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>\u201cargumentative instruction on a disputed question of fact.\u201d (We word our conclusion in this fashion out of appreciation for the fact that \u201cwisdom never says \u2018never.\u2019 \u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b409-11\">These challenges were \u201ctracked\u201d by the trial judge and trial counsel on paper. As each side exercised a peremptory challenge against one of the twelve prospective jurors already tentatively \u201cin the box,\u201d the trial judge would \u201cscratch\u201d the name of the challenged prospective juror and substitute in lieu thereof the name of one of the supplemental prospective jurors who had already been \u201cpassed for cause.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b411-11\">A California criminal defendant also enjoys a statutory right to a public trial.

Given the superior authority of constitutional law, this statutory provision has no particular bearing on our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b411-12\">In their respondent\u2019s brief, the People argue that \u201cthe actual peremptory challenges were made and announced in open court in the presence of the jury.\u201d Frankly, we are somewhat at a loss to understand how the People can hold to this position when the record on appeal (in particular, the augmented supplemental reporter\u2019s transcript) is so clearly to the contrary. The <em>net result </em>of the peremptory challenges may have been (and were) <em>announced </em>in open court\u2014but the peremptory challenges themselves were actually \u201cmade\u201d (exercised) in chambers.
