J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEO\">This case concerns secret law. It arises on a writ of review of a judgment, issued under the California Public Records Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 6250 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, which directs the State Board of Equalization (Board) to disclose to Associated Sales Tax Consultants (Associated) documents (from which confidential taxpayer information has been excised) which show the Board\u2019s practice in interpreting and applying Sales and Use Tax Regulations 1660 and 1667 (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 18, \u00a7\u00a7 1660, 1667).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-12\">The Board concedes the documents are public records but would withhold them on the ground the public interest in their disclosure is outweighed by the burden of excising confidential taxpayer information. In the published <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>portion of this opinion<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we will conclude that the taxpayer information is segregable from the documents sought and that the public interest in disclosure far outweighs the burden and cost of excision, which will largely be borne by Associated. We also will conclude that the Board must prepare a list of the documents at Associated\u2019s expense to permit it to narrow its request by eliminating unwanted records.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">We will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Associated is engaged in the business of advising taxpayers on the construction and application of the California sales and use tax law. It provides tax planning services, represents taxpayers in audits and other matters before the Board and counsels them about the tax consequences of particular transactions. Much of its business involves the application of sales and use tax regulations to its clients\u2019 cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">Associated requested the Board to provide it with copies of documents relating to the Board\u2019s interpretation and application of Sales and Use Tax Regulations 1660 and 1667<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, including Tax Counsel opinions, published opinions, internal memoranda and correspondence, preliminary hearing officer reports on audit protests, replies to taxpayer inquiries, and audit staff training materials. It asserts that the material is used by Board staff in administering and enforcing these regulations and is therefore pertinent to the services it provides its clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">The Board denied the request on the ground the documents contain confidential taxpayer information under Revenue and Taxation Code section 7056 that would have to be excised before disclosure.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Associated agreed to excision and to pay the necessary fees for doing so and the costs of copying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number>the records. Nonetheless the Board asserted that \u201c[t]he burden of producing these documents far exceeds the benefits of disclosure.\u201d The Board also claimed the request lacks sufficient specificity.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">Associated petitioned the superior court for declaratory relief and for an order compelling the Board to disclose the documents. The Board answered, admitting the documents are public records within the meaning of the Public Records Act (see \u00a7 6252, subd. (d)) but denying impropriety in not disclosing them. At the hearing on the petition the Board produced three boxes of documents comprising the requested records. The court declined to examine them (see \u00a7 6259, subd. (a))<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, choosing to hear argument why the Board found it too onerous to go through the boxes, an \u201cidentifiable quantity\u201d and \u201cwithin the realm of reason,\u201d as the court found, and excise confidential taxpayer information, provided that Associated paid the cost of so doing. The Board claimed the task would involve careful reading and editing of the records and would consume about a month and one-half of a staff counsel\u2019s time that otherwise could be devoted to other Board business.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">The court responded that the California Public Records Act necessarily contemplates that staff time will be used to process record requests and that, in any event, the Board could contract with outside counsel to perform the task of identifying and excising the confidential portions of the records. The Board claimed that in some instances the business activities described are so unique to a particular company or location (e.g., video rentals to motels, or crane hauling in \u201cx\u201d town, or the company doing \u201cy\u201d in Oakland) that the information would indirectly disclose the taxpayer\u2019s identity to an informed or inquisitive reader and therefore have to be excised to preserve confidentiality. What would be left, the Board maintained, would be abstract statements of the law, divorced from the salient facts. The court disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Finally, the Board argued that, assuming the request to be appropriate, there are 96 other sales and use tax regulations, and, \u201cas day follows night,\u201d this request will be followed by seriatim requests for documents relating to the remaining regulations, requests which on the whole will be overly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>burdensome to the Board and therefore unreasonable. The court responded that the propriety of requests not yet made was not before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">The court granted Associated\u2019s petition. It weighed the relative public interests and found that, in light of the circumscribed nature of the request and Associated\u2019s willingness to pay reasonable costs for its processing, the public interest in disclosure outweighed any burden to the Board. At Associated\u2019s behest, the court further ordered the Board to prepare a list of the requested documents, for which Associated would deposit $1,000 toward its cost. The purpose of the list was to permit Associated to refine its request to exclude unwanted documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The Board seeks review of this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">\n<em>Scope of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">Preliminarily we digress to discuss the scope of appellate review. The Board filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment. Associated moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that review may be had only by writ of review, as provided by section 6259, subdivision (c), and that the test of such review is whether the trial court acted in excess of its jurisdiction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We granted the motion and dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">The Board petitioned for a writ of review and we granted the writ to hear the case on its merits. In considering the scope of appellate review we sought briefing on the validity of the provision of section 6259, subdivision (c), which precludes review by appeal of an order granting or denying the disclosure of public records. The resolution of that issue was foreshortened by the decision of the California Supreme Court in <em>Times Mirror Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325 [283 Cal.Rptr. 893, 813 P.2d 240],</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">In <em>Times Mirror </em>the court declined to consider the validity of section 6259, subdivision (c), decided it could hear the matter upon a writ of review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number>and construed subdivision (c) to permit review of trial court orders \u201con their merits.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That construction equates the scope of review by writ of review, as therein provided, with the scope of review on appeal. Accordingly, we will consider the merits of the trial court\u2019s order as if this case were on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">\n<em>The Public Interest in Disclosure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The superior court ordered the Board to provide to Associated \u201ccopies of all records maintained by the Principal Auditor\u2019s Office regarding the history and current interpretation of Sales and Use Tax Regulations 1660 and 1667, including copies of all Tax Counsel\u2019s letter opinions concerning said regulation issued through the date of [the] request.\u201d The request specified that such records should include \u201call documents relating to Regulations 1660 and 1667 upon which the Board\u2019s audit staff would rely or be able to rely, in the process of interpreting and applying these regulations including ... all Tax Counsel\u2019s opinions . . . ; internal memorandum . . . ; the decisions . . . that constitute the preliminary hearing officer\u2019s reports on audit protests . . . ; replies to taxpayer inquiries . . . and training materials or other matter intended for the guidance of the audit staff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">The Board concedes that these records are public records. Indeed, it must. The Public Records Act was enacted against a \u201cbackground of legislative impatience with secrecy in government. . . .\u201d (53 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 136, 143 (1970); <em>San Gabriel Tribune </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 762, 772 [192 Cal.Rptr. 415].) It so provides. (\u00a7 6250; see also \u00a7 54950.)</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">The Board asserts the records requested are of no precedential effect within the agency. Whether or not the Board is legally bound by its working law is not controlling. The records sought will disclose the Board\u2019s practices in applying its regulations to the cases coming before it and therefore its working law. This is a matter of interest to the public and to the persons who come before the Board regardless of the precedential effect of the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">There is a manifest public interest in the avoidance of secret law and a correlative interest in the disclosure of an agency\u2019s working law. (See <em>NLRB </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1186\">*1186</page-number>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>(1975) 421 U.S. 132, 153 [44 L.Ed.2d 29, 49, 95 S.Ct. 1504]; <em>Citizens for a Better Environment </em>v. <em>Department of Food. &amp; Agriculture </em>(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 704, 714, fn. 7. [217 Cal.Rptr. 504]) The revelation of an agency\u2019s working law promotes its accountability to the public and the consistent, predictable and nonarbitrary application and enforcement of the law. (See <em>CBS, Inc. </em>v. <em>Block </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 646, 651 [230 Cal.Rptr. 362, 725 R2d 470].) This working law is found in the application of an agency\u2019s regulations to cases coming before it and in the opinions of its counsel and audit staff training materials which guide the Board\u2019s employees in the performance of their duties. It is in the application of a rule to the facts of a case that its meaning is frequently disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">\n<em>The Records Are Identifiable</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">There is no serious question whether Associated\u2019s request \u201creasonably describes an identifiable record\u201d, as required by section 6257;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the records were in fact produced.  The size of the request is not the measure, as the Board suggests, but whether the records can be located with reasonable effort. <em>(Sears </em>v. <em>Gottschalk </em>(4th Cir. 1974) 502 F.2d 122, 125; see <em>Irons </em>v. <em>Schuyler </em>(D.C. Cir. 1972) 465 F.2d 608, 613 [151 App.D.C. 23].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">The Board\u2019s reliance on this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Rosenthal </em>v. <em>Hansen </em>(1973) 34 Cal.App.3d 754 [110 Cal.Rptr. 257] is misplaced. It determined only that a government agency did not have to <em>provide </em>copies of records regardless of their nature and bulk. It did not quarrel with the requester\u2019s right to \u201cmake copies of any documents involved under reasonable conditions.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 758.)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1187\">*1187</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">\n<em>Confidential Taxpayer Information Is Segregable</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">The Board spills much ink in defense of the interest of taxpayers in the privacy of information which may identify them. That is not in issue. Such information may not be disclosed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But the fact that a public record may contain some confidential information does not justify withholding the entire document. <em>(CBS, Inc. </em>v. <em>Block, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pp. 652-653.)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">The Public Records Act provides that \u201c[a]ny reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt by law.\u201d (\u00a7 6257; see <em>Northern Cal. Police Practices Project </em>v. <em>Craig </em>(1979) 90 Cal.App.3d 116, 123-124 [153 Cal.Rptr. 173].) \u201c \u2018[W]here nonexempt materials are not inextricably intertwined with exempt materials and are otherwise reasonably segregable therefrom, segregation is required to serve the objective of the [Public Records Act] to make public records available for public inspection and copying unless a particular statute makes them exempt.\u2019 \u201d <em>(American Civil Liberties Union Foundation </em>v. <em>Deukmejian, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 453, fn. 13, citing to <em>Northern Cal. Police Practices Project </em>v. <em>Craig, supra, </em>at p. 124.)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">The exempt information consists not only of taxpayer names but also \u201cinformation which might lead the knowledgeable or inquisitive to infer the identity of the individual in question.\u201d <em>(American Civil Liberties Union Foundation </em>v. <em>Deukmejian, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at pp. 449-450.) The Board does not assert the task is impossible, only that it is \u201cimpractical\u201d because, so it says, the law and the facts are so inextricably intertwined in (60 percent of) the materials (see fn. 6, <em>ante) </em>that editing will \u201ccompletely eviscerate\u201d the utility of the information to Associated.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">This assumes that <em>all </em>of the facts involving an application of the tax regulations constitute identifying information. The correctness of this assumption is not facially evident (\u00a7 6255). More to the point the Board\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>assistant chief counsel acknowledged that the Board has honored similar requests from Associated. He said the Board did this \u201cuntil [Associated\u2019s] intentions to abuse the system became apparent as the requests asked for successively larger numbers of documents to be perused, reviewed, and \u2018sanitized\u2019 . . . .\u201d In his view, Associated\u2019s request is frivolous and vexatious. This tells us that the Board\u2019s only legitimate objection to the request is its size.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">We have been supplied exemplars of excised records of similar documents the Board has disclosed pursuant to its past practice with confidential information excised. The examples before us do not contain substantial deletions and do not reveal identifying information. In one, for example, there is an extensive analysis why tax counsel for the Board considers that a diet product is not a \u201cfood product\u201d as that term is used in Sales and Use Tax Regulation 1602, subdivision (5) (Cal. Code Regs; tit. 18, \u00a71602, subd. (5).) In another, a tax counsel formal ruling addresses the question whether a corporation\u2019s distribution of its tangible personal property assets to a trust constitutes a transaction which is exempt from the California sales and use tax. In each case the primary deletion is the name of the taxpayer. The excision of the name leaves a complete and intelligible analysis of a tangible sales tax problem. These exemplars show that it is likely that excision will not destroy the utility of the documents which Associated seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">\n<em>The Burdens of Production</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">The burden of showing a request is too onerous lies with the Board. (\u00a7 6255.) It relies on <em>American Civil Liberties Union Foundation </em>v. <em>Deukmejian, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d 440, which \u201crejected] the suggestion that in [weighing the benefits and costs of disclosure under section 6255] the courts should ignore any expense and inconvenience involved in segregating nonexempt from exempt information. Section 6255 speaks broadly of the \u2018public interest,\u2019 a phrase which encompasses public concern with the cost and efficiency of government. To refuse to place such items on the section 6255 scales would make it possible for any person requesting information, for any reason or for no particular reason, to impose upon a governmental agency a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>limitless obligation. Such a result would not be in the public interest.\u201d (32 Cal.3d at pp. 452-453, fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had sought to inspect and copy certain index cards and computer printouts held by the California Department of Justice. The index cards were compiled by a network of law enforcement departments known as the Law Enforcement Intelligence Unit (LEIU) and listed persons suspected of involvement in organized crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The Supreme Court examined the records and concluded that, with respect to the LEIU index cards, the burden of segregating exempt from nonexempt material would be \u201csubstantial,\u201d because the cards did not indicate which material was confidential, which material might reveal a confidential source or which material might identify the subject of the report, a circumstance which in many instances would require the agency to make further inquiries of the law enforcement department that supplied the information. On the other side of the scale, the court found the utility of disclosure to the ACLU \u201cquestionable\u201d and of \u201cmarginal and speculative benefit\u201d; the deletion from the cards of confidential information and personal identifiers would reveal at best only certain generalities about the operation of the criminal indexing systems. <em>(American Civil Liberties Union Foundation </em>v. <em>Deukmejian, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at pp. 453-454.)</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">The court distinguished the Interstate Organized Crime Index printouts, which could be revealed. They presented much less of a burden because the information they contained was derived from public records and was not confidential. Thus the task of segregating exempt material was simply to excise personal identifiers, the burden of which did not clearly outweigh the benefit of disclosure. <em>(American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 454.)</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\"><em>American Civil Liberties Union Foundation </em>does not compel nondisclosure in this case. The Supreme Court was careful to observe: \u201cSection 6255 requires the courts to look to \u2018the facts of the particular case\u2019 in balancing the benefits and burdens of disclosure under the [Public Records] Act. Thus our decision against requiring disclosure [of the LEIU cards] is necessarily limited to the facts of this particular case; in another case, with different facts, the balance might tip in favor of disclosure of nonexempt information . . . .\u201d (32 Cal.3d at p. 454, fn. 14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b808-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>Here, the public interest in disclosure is substantial, the manifest public interest in the avoidance of secret law and a correlative interest in the disclosure of an agency\u2019s working law. On the other side of the equation, the Board overstates the burden of segregating the exempt from the nonexempt material. As noted, the record contains exemplars of similar documents the Board has disclosed in the past with confidential information excised. They show that the primary deletions were the names of the taxpayers. Unlike <em>American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, </em>segregation here would not impose a burden on the Board to inquire from numerous outside sources whether information contained on the documents is confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">To the extent the Board complains of staff inconvenience and expense, we are given no reason to reject the trial court\u2019s finding that the burden is sufficiently alleviated by retaining outside counsel with expertise in these matters to perform the task and by the fact that Associated will pay the attendant costs.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The Board asserts there is a risk that confidential material may be inadvertently disclosed despite careful editing. The Board worries that if disclosure is ordered taxpayers will no longer voluntarily comply with the sales and use tax laws for fear their identities and business operations will be revealed. The past practice of the Board and the exemplars of documents provided under that practice show the Board\u2019s fears to be unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Lastly, the Board fears that if this request is allowed, it will be followed by seriatim requests for documents relating to the remaining 96 sales and use tax regulations. As the trial court noted, the propriety of such requests is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Lastly, the Board discounts the public interest in disclosure because Associated is a commercial entity and intends to use the material for commercial purposes. The Public Records Act does not differentiate among those who seek access to public information. It \u201cimposes no limits upon who may seek information or what he may do with it.\u201d <em>(American Civil Liberties Union Foundation </em>v. <em>Deukmejian, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 451; see <em>Black </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number><em>Panther Party </em>v. <em>Kehoe </em>(1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 645, 656 [117 Cal.Rptr. 106].) What is material is the <em>public </em>interest in disclosure, not the private interest of a requesting party; section 6255 does not take into consideration the requesting party\u2019s profit motives or needs. (See Comment, <em>The California Public Records Act: The Public\u2019s Right of Access to Governmental Information </em>(1976) 7 Pacific LJ. 105, 118-119.) Although Associated is a commercial entity it serves the public interest in making available the Board\u2019s working law.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">The Board\u2019s reliance on <em>Shippen </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 1119 [208 Cal.Rptr. 13] for the proposition that the Public Records Act gives less deference to commercial users is misplaced. The only issue in <em>Shippen </em>was whether the government agency was overcharging the requesting party for the costs of duplication. We held that, although access to information under the Public Records Act is a fundamental right to which <em>all </em>are entitled, \u201c[n]owhere does the [Public Records] Act intimate that access to bulk records by commercial users may not be circumscribed by reasonable conditions regarding format and price.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 1126-1127.) There is no implication in <em>Shippen </em>that, because the requesting party intended to use the information for commercial purposes, it was not entitled to access in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">\n<em>The Board May Be Required to Prepare a List</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">The Board contends the trial court had no authority to order it to prepare an index of the documents included in Associated\u2019s request. Associated responds that the order was for the Board to prepare a \u201clist,\u201d not an \u201cindex.\u201d We can conceive circumstances in which an indexing requirement could involve the exercise of policy discretion and improperly be used to manufacture novel policy determinations in the guise of seeking existing documents. That is not this case. The listing called for is ministerial; there is no practical distinction whether it is called a list or an index and nothing is served by engaging in this word play. We find nothing in the Public Records Act or in the decisional law that prohibits such an order.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\"><em>Rosenthal </em>v. <em>Hansen, supra, </em>34 Cal.App.3d 754 is not authority for the proposition that, under the Public Records Act, a government agency may not be required to prepare a document list. The requesting party had sought certain existing records plus \u201cthe amendments, deletions, additions, supplements, updates and all other changes in these materials as such amendments, deletions, additions, supplements, updates and other changes become available.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 756.) The trial court ruled, in part, \u201cThe California Public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>Records Act does not require [the government agency] to provide [the requesting party] with copies of public records not yet in existence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 758.) On appeal, the requesting party limited his request to existing documents <em>(id. </em>at p. 757), and we observed, \u201cThere is no argument with the [trial court\u2019s] conclusion that records not in existence but to be prepared in the future are not required to be furnished as they appear.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 758.) Thus the original request for nonexisting documents was mooted by the time the case was heard on appeal. In any event, the request involved in <em>Rosenthal </em>significantly differs in that it imposed on the government agency an open-ended, continuing task of enormous proportions; the existing records alone consisted of over 80,000 documents. In contrast, here the preparation of the required index of 2,100 documents is a one-time affair and does not involve an unreasonable amount of effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\"><em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., supra, </em>421 U.S. 132 [44 L.Ed.2d 29] is also distinguishable. In that case, involving a request for appeals memoranda, the trial court required the government agency to produce or create explanatory material in those instances in which a memorandum refers only to the \u201ccircumstances of the case.\u201d The Supreme Court held that the FOIA \u201cdoes not compel agencies to write opinions in cases in which they would not otherwise be required to do so. It only requires disclosure of certain documents which the law requires the agency to prepare or which the agency has decided for its own reasons to create.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 161-162 [44 L.Ed.2d at p. 53].) In this case the trial court\u2019s order does not require the Board to expand upon or supplement the material contained in the requested documents; it calls for the Board to simply list the documents. This is a ministerial task, and the Board\u2019s resistance is obstructionist in light of the fact that it has provided Associated with similar lists in the past and that, in fact, appears to routinely maintain subject matter indexes with respect to these types of files.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">List preparation correlates with the requirement that records requests reasonably describe identifiable documents. (See \u00a7\u00a7 6256, 6257; <em>ante, </em>p. 1186 &amp; fn. 9.)  The identification requirement may not be used by a government agency as a method of withholding records, e.g., by refusing to provide a requesting party with the means by which he may reasonably describe an identifiable document. This puts part of the responsibility for identifying records with the agency itself. (See <em>National Cable Television Association, Inc. </em>v. <em>F.C.C., supra, </em>479 F.2d at pp. 190-191 &amp; fn. 17.) The FOIA requires government agencies to maintain and make available for public inspection and copying current indexes that provide identifying information as to material required to be made available to the public. (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(2).) The index gives the public an adequate basis on which to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>reasonably specific records requests. <em>(Irons </em>v. <em>Schuyler </em>(D.D.C. 1970) 321 F.Supp. 628, 629, affirmed and remanded on other grounds ((D.C. Cir. 1972) 465 F.2d 608 [151 App.D.C. 23].)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">Although the Public Records Act does not, like the FOIA, require the maintenance of an index of records available for public inspection and copying, it does not prohibit a court from ordering the preparation of a list of the documents which are sought. Providing such a list is consistent with the language and spirit of the Public Records Act. For these reasons the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering the Board to prepare a list (index) of the requested documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">VII<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">\n<em>Collateral Estoppel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">The judgment is affirmed and the writ is discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">Sims, J., and Davis, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">Petitioners\u2019 application for review by the Supreme Court was denied January 28, 1993.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-13\">All references to a section are to the Government Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b800-9\">The Reporter of Decisions is directed to publish the opinion except for part VII of the Discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b800-10\">Regulations 1660 (Cal.

While the question is an interesting one, we need not decide it in this case. Whatever the merits of the provision purporting to preclude review by appeal, we discern no constitutional impediment to the Legislature providing, as it has here, an avenue of relief by means of writ review.

The records are categorized by regulation number and are maintained in the Board\u2019s principal auditor\u2019s office. For that reason we reject the Board\u2019s assertion that Associated\u2019s request, to be sufficiently specific, must reference individual documents by date, author and subject matter. Associated need not have provided the Board with \u201ca complete description down to the last detail of title and file number.\u201d (See <em>National Cable Television Association, Inc. </em>v. <em>F.C.C. </em>(D.C. Cir. 1973) 479 F.2d 183, 190 [156 App.D.C. 91].) It would be impossible for Associated to be so specific unless it possessed a document index, which the Board refuses to provide. By this ploy, the Board would place Associated into a classic \u201cCatch-22\u201d situation. We consider in a later portion of this opinion the issue with respect to Associated\u2019s right to a document index.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b804-9\">The Public Records Act is modeled upon the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552) and we may look to the legislative history of the federal act and its judicial construction as aids in interpreting the California act. <em>(American Civil Liberties Union Foundation </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 440, 447 [186 Cal.Rptr. 235, 651 P.2d 822].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b805-9\">Revenue and Taxation Code section 7056 <em>{ante, </em>p. 1182, fn. 4) provides that information obtained by the Board about a retailer\u2019s business affairs and operations is protected from public scrutiny.

Nothing less will suffice, however, if the underlying legislative policy of the [Public Records Act] favoring disclosure is to be implemented faithfully.\u201d].)
