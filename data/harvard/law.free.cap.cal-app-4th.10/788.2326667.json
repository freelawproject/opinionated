J.\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">In the published portion of this opinion, we are asked to determine whether the Legislature intended in Vehicle Code section 13202.5 to penalize youthful offenders with drivers licenses who commit certain drug or alcohol related offenses more severely than youthful offenders without drivers licenses who commit the same offenses. We conclude the Legislature intended they be punished equally.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">Minor Melchor P. was found to be a person described by Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 and was found to have committed the following offenses: one count of possession for sale of a controlled substance (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11351) and two counts of sale of a controlled substance (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11352, subd. (a)). The court imposed a maximum term of commitment of seven years and four months in the California Youth Authority (CYA). It also ordered that Melchor\u2019s driving privilege be delayed for three years pursuant to Vehicle Code section 13202.5, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">A. <em>Did the Court Abuse its Discretion in Committing Melchor to CYA?</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">B. <em>Did the Court Err in Delaying for Three Years Melchor\u2019s Ability to Apply for a Driver\u2019s License Pursuant to Vehicle Code Section 13202.5?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">Melchor contends the court erred in delaying his driving privilege for three years. He points out that the first sentence of Vehicle Code section 13202.5, subdivision (a)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> applies only to persons already licensed. That sentence mandates a one-year suspension for each offense committed. The second sentence of section 13202.5, subdivision (a) applies to persons not yet licensed. It refers only to a one-year delay. Based on the apparent discrepancy between the two sentences, Melchor argues he may receive only a one-year delay in his driving privilege regardless of the number of offenses he committed. As we shall explain, neither the language of the statute nor the legislative intent supports Melchor\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">Section 13202.5, subdivision (a) provides: \u201cFor each conviction of a person for any offense specified in subdivision (d), committed while the person was under the age of 21 years, but 13 years of age or older, the court shall suspend the person\u2019s driving privilege for one year. If the person convicted does not yet have the privilege to drive, the court shall order the department to delay issuing the privilege to drive for one year subsequent to the time the person becomes legally eligible to drive. However, if there is no further conviction for any offense specified in section 13202.5, subdivision (d) in a 12-month period after the conviction, the court, upon petition of the person affected, may modify the order imposing the delay of the privilege. For each successive offense, the court shall suspend the person\u2019s driving privilege for those possessing a license or delay the eligibility for those not in possession of a license at the time of their conviction for one additional year.\u201d Subdivision (d) includes the three controlled substance offenses Melchor committed. Section 13105 specifies that a \u201c \u2018conviction\u2019 includes a finding by a judge of a juvenile court. . . that a person has committed an offense . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>\u201cThe starting point in statutory construction is to read and examine the text of the act and draw inferences concerning the meaning from its composition and structure.\u201d (2A Sutherland, Statutory Construction (5th ed. 1992) \u00a7 47.01, p. 136, fn. omitted.) \u201cThe meaning of a statute may not be determined from a single word or sentence; the words must be construed in context, and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized to the extent possible. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Lungren </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 727, 735 [248 Cal.Rptr. 115, 755 P.2d 299].) This requires reading each sentence not in isolation but \u201cin order to harmonize the statutory scheme and not to produce absurd results.\u201d <em>(In re Catalano </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 1, 10-11 [171 Cal.Rptr. 667, 623 P.2d 228].) \u201cIt is also a rule of statutory construction that if there exists an uncertainty or ambiguity in a statute, qualifying words, phrases or clauses are construed as referring to the words, phrases and clauses immediately preceding . . . .\u201d <em>(Addison </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 486, 496 [138 Cal.Rptr. 185]; see also <em>Oliva </em>v. <em>Swoap </em>(1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 130, 138 [130 Cal.Rptr. 411].) \u201c[I]f a statute is amenable to two alternative interpretations, the one that leads to the more reasonable result will be followed [citation].\u201d <em>(Lungren </em>v. <em>Deukmejian, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 735.)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Applying these rules of construction, it is clear that Melchor\u2019s interpretation fails. The second sentence must be read in the context of the first sentence and in light of the entire statutory scheme. It cannot be read in isolation. For example, the second sentence begins, \u201cIf the person . . . ,\u201d but it does not define who is a \u201cperson.\u201d Without reference to the first sentence, one would apply the \u201cplain meaning rule\u201d and \u201cperson\u201d would mean any human being. By examining the text of the entire statute, however, it is clear that the Legislature included as persons only those individuals who committed the enumerated offenses while under the age of 21, but 13 years of age or older. The second sentence continues, \u201cIf the person convicted . . . ,\u201d but does not specify any particular offenses. Read in isolation, this sentence would mandate delay of driving privileges for any person convicted of any offense. Again, this could not have been the result intended by the Legislature. To give meaning to the sentence, one must look to the antecedent sentence, \u201cthe words, phrases and clauses immediately preceding . . . .\u201d <em>(Addison </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>69 Cal.App.3d 486.) Applying this rule, \u201cconvicted\u201d means convictions for offenses specified in section 13202.5, subdivision (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">In fact, the structure and composition of the statute suggests that the introductory phrase of the first sentence was intended to precede both the main clause in the first sentence and the entire second sentence. An \u201cor\u201d between the two sentences would have made Melchor\u2019s arguments moot. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>\u201cbad grammar,\" as one commentator points out, \u201cdoes not vitiate a statute if the legislative intent is clear.\" (2A Sutherland, Statutory Construction, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 47.01, p. 136.) Here it is clear that the Legislature intended the introductory phrase to define who was included within the statute\u2019s purview and in what circumstances (for each conviction of the enumerated offenses). In contrast, the main clause in the first sentence and the entire second sentence merely instruct the court how to penalize the two categories of persons (i.e., those with licenses and those not yet licensed) affected by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Additionally, the legislative history of the current version of section 13202.5 establishes a clear intent to treat those with licenses and those without, and those who were driving at the time they committed the offense and those who were not, similarly. The original 1984 version of the statute applied only to minors found to have committed alcohol or substance abuse offenses <em>while </em>driving a motor vehicle.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">In 1987, the Orange County branch of Mothers Against Drunk Driving proposed, and Senator William Campbell sponsored, a bill (Sen. Bill No. 1300) to, inter alia, amend section 13202.5.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Senate Third Reading of Senate Bill No. 1300 (as amended Aug. 25, 1988) explained that the revised section 13202.5: \u201cExpands the number of offenses for which a minor may have his or her license suspended to include possession of prescription drugs without prescription; possession of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); the sale, possession, or consumption of alcohol or drugs; possession of a false identification; vehicular manslaughter; and vessel manslaughter, [f] 4) Authorizes the court to suspend the driver\u2019s license of a minor between the ages of 13 and 21 for the above listed offenses, [f] 5) Eliminates the current alternative of a license restriction for conviction of the above listed offenses, [ft] 6) Increases the number and types of offenses, conviction of which must be reported to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).\u201d The same report noted under \u201cConstitutional Issues\u201d that the \u201cbill would require suspension of a driver\u2019s license or delay in application for a driver\u2019s license for <em>offenses </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>unrelated to driving. For example, this bill would provide that a minor involved in a situation constituting possession of an open container in a park is prevented from applying for a driver\u2019s license . . . .\u201d (Sen. 3d Reading of Sen. Bill No. 1300 (as amended Aug. 25, 1988); italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">In a letter to Governor Deukmejian urging him to sign the bill, Senator Campbell explained that Senate Bill No. 1300 \u201ccontains a provision that would mandate a one year suspension of driving privileges for young people over 13 years and under 21 years who have been convicted of an alcohol other [sic] other illegal drug-related offense. The bill will also mandate a one year delay in obtaining a driver\u2019s license for unlicensed drivers 13 years or older, convicted of these offenses. Also, school officials will be permitted, if they so desire only, to report to law enforcement authorities alcohol or illegal drug-related suspensions or expulsions. These provisions indicate the seriousness of our need to stop drunk driving at the earliest possible age, by using perhaps the most important privilege a young person can have\u2014 driving a car\u2014as leverage.\u201d As the above quoted legislative history makes clear, the 1988 amendments no longer distinguished between minors driving a vehicle and minors not driving a vehicle. The emphasis was on discouraging drug and alcohol use in general, which would have the beneficial effect of also discouraging driving under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">In enacting the 1988 amendments to section 13202.5, the Legislature made the following findings: \u201c(a) The Legislature finds and declares as follows: (1) It is unlawful to use, purchase, possess, or distribute controlled substances unless expressly permitted by law. [1] (2) It is unlawful for any driver to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. []Q (3) Individuals who abuse drugs or alcohol demonstrate a dangerous disregard for the safe legal operation of motor vehicles. The risk is particularly acute for individuals under the age of 21. [][] (4) The increased potential for teenage deaths in vehicle collisions and other nondriving accidents, homicides, and suicides, while being under the influence of drugs or alcohol, requires special attention in order to reduce the statewide youth fatality rate and to control unlawful and unsafe driving practices. H] (b) It is, therefore, the intent of the Legislature to enact this measure in an attempt to reduce the incidence of young drivers on the highways and roads of this state who, because of their use of alcohol or other illegal drugs, pose a danger to the health and safety of other drivers by all or a combination of the following methods: [f] (1) To prevent use of motor vehicles by drivers under the age of 21 years by suspending their driving privileges for one year from the date of conviction, because a one year suspension of these drivers\u2019 privileges may provide a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>means of deterring use of alcohol and other illegal drugs by these young persons, [ft] (2) to make the one year suspension of driving privileges a mandatory requirement for any person under the age of 21 years who has been convicted of possessing or using alcohol or other illegal drugs, [ft] (3) In order to discourage the possession and use of alcohol and other illegal drugs by potential drivers of motor vehicles, a one year delay of the ability to apply for a driver\u2019s license if the potential driver is 13 years of age or older and is convicted of possession or use of alcohol or other illegal drugs.\u201d (Stats. 1988, ch. 1254, \u00a7 1, pp. 4175-4176.) No distinction was drawn between the \u201cone year\u201d suspension in section 13202.5, subdivision (b)(1) and the \u201cone year\u201d delay in subdivision (b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">In 1990, further amendments were made to section 13202.5. In the Legislative Counsel\u2019s Digest to Senate Bill No. 1756, existing law was described as \u201crequiring] a court to suspend, restrict, or delay for one year the driving privilege of persons under age 21, but 13 years of age or older, convicted of offenses relating to alcohol or controlled substances.\u201d Again, no distinction was drawn between the penalties imposed on licensed drivers as compared with unlicensed drivers. Senate Bill No. 1756 \u201cwould require a court to suspend, restrict, or delay for one year the driving privilege of persons [under 21 but 13 years of age or older] who commit additional offenses [reckless driving with alcohol (\u201cwet reckless\u201d), drunk bicycling, and drunk boating] relating to alcohol and controlled substances when operating a vehicle# bicycle, or vessel . . . .\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary Report, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 1756 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) Mar. 20, 1990, p. 1.) In Senate Bill No. 2635, the list of offenses was again expanded and the term \u201ccritical need to drive\u201d was defined. These changes became effective January 1, 1992, and manifested a further attempt by the Legislature to use the driving privilege sanction as a means of discouraging alcohol and drug use among those between 13 and 21 years of age. (Stats. 1990, ch. 1696, \u00a7 3, pp. 6886-6887.)</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Nothing in the legislative history suggests that the Legislature intended to punish individuals who were licensed more severely than individuals who were not. Likewise, the text of the statute, though imperfectly drafted, makes sense only if the introductory phrase (\u201cfor each conviction\u201d) is prefatory to both the main clause in the first sentence and the entire second sentence. Accordingly, Melchor\u2019s claim that the court erred in delaying his driving privilege for three years is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Bamattre-Manoukian, J., and O\u2019Farrell, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-12\">In the unpublished portion of this opinion, section III A, we address and reject the contention that the court abused its discretion in imposing a California Youth Authority commitment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b483-11\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 788.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b483-12\">All further statutory references are to the Vehicle Code unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b485-7\">That version provided,, in pertinent part: \u201cUpon conviction of a person for any offense specified in subdivision (d)r committed while the person was under the age of 18 years and while driving a motor vehicle, the court may suspend or restrict the person\u2019s driving privileges on conditions that the court deems appropriate or, in the case of a person who does not yet have the privilege to drive, order that the privilege be delayed.
