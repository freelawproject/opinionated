Code, \u00a7\u00a725101, 25120-25139), as applied to domestic-parent unitary corporate groups, is unconstitutional under the foreign commerce clause of the United States Constitution. (U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Using the dormant foreign commerce clause analytical framework set forth in <em>Japan Line, Ltd. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1773\">*1773</page-number><em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1979) 441 U.S. 434 [60 L.Ed.2d 336, 99 S.Ct. 1813] and <em>Container Corp. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 159 [77 L.Ed.2d 545, 103 S.Ct. 2933], we originally concluded that the tax method does not violate that clause. Several months after we issued our decision, the California Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Barclays Bank Internal, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 708 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 31, 829 P.2d 279] <em>(Barclays). </em>On June 18, 1992, the Supreme Court directed us to vacate our original decision in this case and refile it after modification in light of <em>Barclays. </em>The parties then filed supplemental briefs. As we explain, <em>Barclays </em>effects a substantial change in our foreign commerce clause analysis but no change in our original result. Consequently; we still reverse that part of the judgment regarding the foreign commerce clause issue and affirm that part of the judgment regarding the statutory and constitutional distortion issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-4\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-5\">\n<em>The Methods of Allocating Income</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-6\">When a corporation, either on its own or through subsidiaries, conducts business across state or national boundaries, the allocation of income to each relevant jurisdiction for purposes of taxation becomes an issue. To resolve this issue, two general methods of income allocation have been created: the arm\u2019s length/separate accounting method and the unitary business/formula apportionment method. Each of these two general methods can be applied in varying ways. <em>(Container Corp. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., supra, </em>463 U.S. at pp. 182, 191, 196 [77 L.Ed.2d at pp. 564, 570, 573]; Langbein (1986) 23 Tax Notes 625, 626; Note, <em>State Worldwide Unitary </em>Taxation: <em>The Foreign Parent Case </em>(1985) 23 Colum. J. of Transnat'l L. 445, 451, hereafter 23 Columbia Journal.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-7\">Under separate accounting, the related corporations of a multijurisdictional enterprise are viewed as distinct from one another; taxable income is determined separately for each individual corporation by the jurisdiction in which that corporation actually conducts business or has a permanent establishment. Any improper shifting of value between the related corporations to avoid taxes is corrected by requiring \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d pricing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1774\">*1774</page-number>related corporate transactions. In other words, the related corporations must act as if they were unrelated entities dealing at arm\u2019s length in the marketplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-4\">In contrast, under the unitary business/formula apportionment method of allocating income at issue in this case\u2014the worldwide unitary method\u2014the related corporations of a multijurisdictional enterprise are treated as units of a single business\u2014that is, as a \u201cunitary group.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 18, \u00a7 25137-6.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If a corporation doing business in California is deemed to be part of a unitary group, the total income for that group worldwide, including corporations operating wholly outside the United States, is apportioned to California by a three-factor formula. Under the formula, the property, payroll, and sales figures for the group in California are arithmetically compared to the property, payroll, and sales figures for the group worldwide. (See Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 25128-25136.) This comparison results in a proportion that is multiplied against the unitary group\u2019s worldwide income, producing an apportioned amount of such income taxable by California.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Simply put, if 25 percent of the property, payroll, and sales of the unitary group is located in California, then 25 percent of the group\u2019s worldwide income is apportioned to California. Under this method, it is unnecessary to make \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d corrections because intercorporate transactions are disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-5\">Aside from a few minor exceptions, the income allocation method used by the United States and all of the other nations of the world is the separate accounting method, although, as noted, this method varies in practice. However, the United States has basically limited the application of its tax treaties to federal taxes. <em>(Container Corp. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd.., supra, </em>463 U.S. at p. 196 [77 L.Ed.2d at p. 573],)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1275-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1775\">*1775</page-number>The present controversy involves Colgate-Palmolive Company, Inc. (Colgate), a domestic-parent unitary corporate group with approximately 75 foreign subsidiaries operating in about 54 foreign counties.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Colgate was directed to pay additional taxes for the years 1970 through 1973 after California applied the worldwide unitary tax method to the group. Under protest, Colgate paid the additional taxes and this suit ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-4\">\n<em>The Issues on Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-5\">At trial, Colgate challenged the federal constitutionality of these additional taxes on foreign commerce clause grounds. The thmst of Colgate\u2019s argument below was that the federal executive branch acted decisively after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1776\">*1776</page-number>the <em>Container </em>decision to communicate its longstanding position that California\u2019s worldwide unitary tax method impermissibly interferes with American foreign policy; according to Colgate, this decisive action eliminated the factual ambiguity that resulted in the <em>Container </em>decision. The trial court agreed with this argument and determined that California\u2019s worldwide unitary tax method was unconstitutional on this ground. The Franchise Tax Board (the Board) appeals that decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-4\">Colgate also argued at trial that California\u2019s three-factor unitary formula unlawfully \u201cdistorted\u201d the amount of Colgate\u2019s income apportioned to California. The trial court found against Colgate on this issue, which Colgate again raises in its respondent\u2019s brief.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-5\">Finally, two peripheral issues are raised by the Board in this appeal. First, the Board claims the trial court abused its discretion in denying the Board\u2019s motion for discovery sanctions. Secondly, the Board asserts the court below erroneously awarded certain costs to Colgate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-6\">\n<em>The Foreign Commerce Clause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-7\">Article I, section 8, clause 3 of the United States Constitution empowers Congress \u201cTo regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes.\u201d As the United States Supreme Court has long emphasized, this clause limits the power of the states even in the absence of congressional legislation. <em>(Boston Stock Exchange </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n. </em>(1977) 429 U.S. 318, 328 [50 L.Ed.2d 514, 523, 97 S.Ct. 599]; <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Hewit </em>(1946) 329 U.S. 249, 252 [91 L.Ed.2d 265, 271, 67 S.Ct. 274].) In this respect, the commerce clause indirectly allocates the relative powers of states and the federal government. <em>(Star-Kist Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 1, 9 [227 Cal.Rptr. 391, 719 P.2d 987].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-8\">As noted in <em>Star-Kist, </em>\u201c[determining whether a state tax exceeds the bounds of permissible state action under the [commerce] clause is often a difficult task.\u201d (42 Cal.3d at p. 10.) In the context of the foreign commerce clause, there are three United States Supreme Court decisions that have delineated the test under which this determination is made: <em>Japan Line, Ltd. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>441 U.S. 434; <em>Container Corp. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., supra, </em>463 U.S. 159; and <em>Wardair Canada </em>v. <em>Florida Dept. of Revenue </em>(1986) 477 U.S. 1 [91 L.Ed.2d 1, 106 S.Ct. 2369].</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-9\">Applying the foreign commerce clause test it created, the court in <em>Japan Line </em>held that instrumentalities of commerce\u2014in that case, seagoing cargo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1777\">*1777</page-number>containers\u2014which are foreign-owned, -based, and -registered and which are used solely in international commerce may not be subjected to a state\u2019s apportioned ad valorem property tax. (441 U.S. at pp. 436, 444 [60 L.Ed.2d at pp. 340, 345].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-4\">In creating the foreign commerce clause test, the <em>Japan Line </em>court noted that the issue of taxation between nations is more complicated than the issue of taxation between American states. This increased complexity results from a number of factors, including the greater sensitivity to national as opposed to state sovereignty, the lack of an authoritative tribunal capable of resolving transnational disputes, and the fact that actions by individual states can work to the detriment of the whole country. (441 U.S. at pp. 447-451, 456 [60 L.Ed.2d at pp. 347-350. 352].) In light of these circumstances, said <em>Japan Line, </em>the foreign commerce power of Congress is greater than its interstate commerce power and the need for one national voice in regulating commercial relations with foreign nations is paramount. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 448-449 [60 L.Ed.2d at pp. 347-348].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-5\">From this comparison of the interstate and the foreign contexts, the foreign commerce clause test was born. That test was engendered by adding two inquiries onto the already existing four-part test for interstate commerce clause review. <em>(Japan Line, supra, </em>441 U.S. at pp. 444-445, 451 [60 L.Ed.2d at pp. 345-346, 349-350].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-6\">Under the four-part interstate test, a state tax will survive an interstate commerce clause challenge if the tax \u201c \u2018[i] is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, [ii] is fairly apportioned, [iii] does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and [iv] is fairly related to the services provided by the State.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Japan Line, supra, </em>441 U.S. at pp. 444-445, 449, 454 [60 L.Ed.2d at pp. 345, 348, 352], quoting <em>Complete Auto Transit, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brady </em>(1977) 430 U.S. 274, 279 [51 L.Ed.2d 326, 331, 97 S.Ct. 1076].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-7\">The two additional inquiries prompted by the foreign context are: first, whether the tax creates a \u201csubstantial risk of international multiple taxation\u201d (441 U.S. at p. 451 [60 L.Ed.2d at p. 349]); and, second, whether the tax \u201cmay impair federal uniformity in an area where federal uniformity is essential\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 448 [60 L.Ed.2d 347]), and prevents \u201cthe Federal Government from \u2018speaking with one voice when regulating commercial relations with foreign governments.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 451 [60 L.Ed.2d at p. 349], quoting <em>Michelin Tire Corp. </em>v. <em>Wages </em>(1976) 423 U.S. 276, 285 [46 L.Ed.2d 495, 503, 96 S.Ct. 535]; see also <em>Container, supra, </em>463 U.S. at pp. 193-194 [77 L.Ed.2d at pp. 571-572].) If a state tax violates either of these precepts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1778\">*1778</page-number>it is unconstitutional under the foreign commerce clause. (441 U.S. at p. 451 [60 L.Ed.2d at p. 349].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-4\">Because the foreign commerce clause is self-executing, the judiciary applies this test when Congress or the federal government has not acted or purported to act. <em>(Merrion </em>v. <em>Jicarilla Apache Tribe </em>(1982) 455 U.S. 130, 154-155 [71 L.Ed.2d 21, 40-41, 102 S.Ct. 894]; <em>Wardair, supra, All </em>U.S. at pp. 7-8, 18 [91 L.Ed.2d at pp. 9-10, 16].) In such \u201cdormant\u201d foreign commerce clause situations, the judiciary must determine whether a particular state action unduly threatens the purpose of the clause: to ensure a unified national voice in foreign commerce matters raising inherently national concerns and to ensure that individual states do not work to the detriment of the whole nation. <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also <em>Japan Line, supra, </em>441 U.S. at pp. 448-449 [60 L.Ed.2d at pp. 347-348].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-5\">In <em>Japan Line, </em>the state tax at issue was found to violate both of the additional foreign commerce clause considerations. Multiple taxation resulted because the foreign country involved, Japan, taxed the cargo containers at full value. (441 U.S. at pp. 451-452 [60 L.Ed.2d at pp. 349-350].) The \u201cone-voice\u201d standard was violated because the United States and Japan had signed a convention reflecting a national policy to preclude such taxes. Furthermore, American-owned cargo containers were not taxed in Japan; this created an asymmetry in international taxation disadvantageous to Japan and, under such circumstances, the risk of Japanese retaliation against the whole nation was substantial. Finally, if other states enacted their own taxing schemes, taxation would vary port by port, making speaking with one voice impossible. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 452-453 [60 L.Ed.2d at pp. 350-351].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-6\">That brings us to the decision in <em>Container Corp. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., supra, </em>463 U.S. 159. <em>Container </em>involved the precise issue presented here: the constitutionality under the foreign commerce clause of California\u2019s worldwide unitary tax method as applied to a domestic-parent unitary corporate group (hereafter, domestic-parent group) with foreign subsidiaries. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 163, 171 [77 L.Ed.2d at pp. 551-552, 557].) Applying essentially the dormant foreign commerce clause test set forth in <em>Japan Line, </em>the court in <em>Container </em>held the tax method constitutional. (463 U.S. at pp. 185-197 [77 L.Ed.2d at pp. 566-574].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-7\">In applying <em>Japan Line\u2019s </em>first additional foreign commerce clause consideration\u2014the enhanced risk of international multiple <em>taxation\u2014Container </em>noted that separate accounting did not inevitably end double taxation and California\u2019s worldwide unitary method did not inevitably lead to it. Given this state of affairs, said <em>Container, </em>it would be perverse constitutionally to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1779\">*1779</page-number>require one method of taxation over another when both could result in a double tax. (463 U.S. at pp. 189-193 [77 L.Ed.2d at pp. 568-571].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-4\"><em>Container </em>refined <em>Japan Line's </em>second additional foreign commerce clause consideration\u2014the \u201cone voice\u201d standard\u2014by stating: \u201cIn conducting this inquiry, ... we must keep in mind that if a state tax merely has foreign resonances, but does not implicate foreign affairs, we cannot infer, \u2018[a]bsent some explicit directive from Congress, . . . that treatment of foreign income at the federal level mandates identical treatment by the States.\u2019 [Citations.] Thus, a state tax at variance with federal policy will violate the \u2018one voice\u2019 standard if it <em>either </em>implicates foreign policy issues which must be left to the Federal Government <em>or </em>violates a clear federal directive. The second of these considerations is, of course, essentially a species of pre-emption analysis.\u201d (463 U.S. at p. 194 [77 L.Ed.2d at pp. 571-572], italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-5\">According to <em>Container, </em>the most obvious foreign policy implication of a state tax is the threat it might pose of offending foreign trading partners, leading them to retaliate against the whole nation. The court in <em>Container </em>noted that the judiciary has little competence in making this determination and emphasized that the nuances of foreign policy \u201care much more the province of the Executive Branch and Congress than of this Court.\u201d (463 U.S. at pp. 194, 196 [77 L.Ed.2d at pp. 571-573].) The best a court can do, said <em>Container, </em>is try to develop objective standards reflecting general observations about international trade and relations. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 194 [77 L.Ed.2d at pp. 571-572].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-6\">Doing just that, the court in <em>Container </em>set forth three reasons that weighed strongly against the possibility of justifiable and significant foreign retaliation. First, California\u2019s worldwide unitary tax method as applied to domestic-parent groups did not create an <em>\u201cautomatic </em>\u2018asymmetry\u2019 \u201d in international taxation disadvantageous to a foreign entity. (463 U.S. at pp. 194-195 [77 L.Ed.2d at pp. 571-572], italics in original.) Second, the tax method was applied to a domestic corporation rather than to a foreign entity. Finally, stated <em>Container, </em>even if foreign nations have a legitimate interest in reducing the tax burden of domestic corporations, that burden results more from tax rate than allocation method, and California can simply raise its tax rate to achieve the same foreign economic effect. <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1279-7\">Of course, noted <em>Container, </em>the threat of retaliation is not the only foreign policy implication a state tax may have. However, the court also noted there was no amicus curiae brief from the executive branch opposing the tax at issue and setting forth other foreign policy implications. Although not conclusive on the issue, the lack of such a brief did suggest American <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1780\">*1780</page-number>foreign policy was not seriously threatened by California\u2019s worldwide unitary method as applied to domestic-parent groups with foreign subsidiaries. (463 U.S. at pp. 195-196 [77 L.Ed.2d at pp. 572-573].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-4\">The court in <em>Container </em>then turned to specific indications of congressional intent in discussing the \u201cclear federal directive\u201d principle and found little there.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-5\">No federal statute provided the preemptive force. Although the federal government was bound by numerous tax treaties to use some form of separate accounting in taxing the domestic income of multinational enterprises, that requirement was generally waived regarding the taxes imposed by each of the contracting nations on its own domestic corporations. If nothing else, said the <em>Container </em>court, this fact \u201cconfirms our view that such taxation is in reality of local rather than international concern.\u201d <em>(Container, supra, </em>463 U.S. at p. 196 [77 L.Ed.2d at p. 573].) The tax treaties, moreover, did not generally cover state taxes; none of them prohibited states from using nonseparate accounting methods of taxation. The United States Senate had on one occasion declined to give its two-thirds consent to a treaty provision that would have prohibited the states from using such methods. Finally, the court in <em>Container </em>noted that Congress had long debated but had not enacted legislation regulating state taxation of income. On this record, the court could not conclude that California\u2019s worldwide unitary method as applied to domestic-parent groups with foreign subsidiaries was preempted by federal law or fatally inconsistent with federal policy. (463 U.S. at pp. 196-197 [77 L.Ed.2d at pp. 573-574].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-6\">The last of the three United States Supreme Court decisions critical to our dormant foreign commerce clause analysis is <em>Wardair Canada </em>v. <em>Florida Dept. of Revenue, supra, 477 </em>U.S. 1. The court in <em>Wardair, </em>however, did not have occasion to apply the dormant foreign commerce clause test created in <em>Japan Line </em>and refined in <em>Container. </em>This was because the <em>Wardair </em>court found it \u201cabundantly clear\u201d that the federal government had affirmatively acted to permit the state tax at issue there. That tax was levied by Florida and applied to all airline aviation fuel sold within the state regardless of the airliner\u2019s destination or the amount of intrastate business the airliner did. <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 9, 12 [91 L.Ed.2d at pp. 10, 12].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-7\">The foreign airliner and the United States as amicus curiae in <em>Wardair </em>argued there was a federal policy prohibiting Florida\u2019s unlimited tax. The policy was allegedly manifested by (1) the 1944 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation (1944 Convention), which the United States had signed; (2) a 1966 Resolution of the International Civil Aviation Organization (1966 Resolution), an organization to which the United States belonged; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1781\">*1781</page-number>and (3) more than 70 bilateral aviation agreements, including the 1974 United States-Canadian Aviation Agreement (Agreement). (Wardair was a Canadian airline.) The <em>Wardair </em>court viewed this evidence in a completely different light\u2014in fact, as manifesting a federal policy <em>permitting </em>Florida\u2019s tax. Accordingly, the dormant foreign commerce clause test of <em>Japan Line </em>and <em>Container </em>did not come into play\u2014the federal government had made its position clear in permitting such state action. (477 U.S. at pp. 8-12 [91 L.Ed.2d at pp. 9-12].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-4\">The court\u2019s analysis was as follows. The 1944 Convention prohibited only state taxation of aviation fuel \u201c \u2018on board an aircraft... on arrival. . . and retained on board on leaving.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Wardair, supra, All </em>U.S. at p. 10 [91 L.Ed.2d at p. 11].) Consequently, according to the court, the international community had considered the issue of state taxation of aviation fuel and had decided to limit only certain state taxes while implicitly preserving the right of states to tax in nonprohibited ways. Although the 1966 Resolution indisputably sought to exempt airline fuel tax from all foreign national and subnational customs and duties, neither the executive branch nor Congress had acted in any way to make the 1966 Resolution legally binding. Furthermore, after the 1944 Convention came into force, the United States entered into more than 70 bilateral aviation agreements; not one of these agreements prohibited states from imposing a Florida-like tax. The Agreement was limited to \u201c \u2018national duties and charges.\u2019 \u201d This limitation was particularly significant, reasoned the <em>Wardair </em>court, because the Agreement was entered into eight years after the 1966 Resolution\u2014which addressed the concern of foreign subnational taxation\u2014and because both parties to the Agreement were federalist nations. Finally, during the Agreement, other American states and some Canadian provinces had imposed Florida-like fuel taxes without challenge; this evidenced a course of conduct by the Agreement parties that such taxation was permissible. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 10-12 [91 L.Ed.2d at pp. 11-12].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-5\">According to the court in <em>Wardair, </em>\u201call of this makes abundantly clear\u201d that the federal government has affirmatively acted to permit the states to impose these sales taxes on aviation fuel. (477 U.S. at p. 12 [91 L.Ed.2d at p. 12].) Consequently, the foreign commerce clause test of <em>Japan Line </em>and <em>Container </em>was inapplicable. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1281-6\">With this background in mind, we turn to the foreign commerce clause issue presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1782\">*1782</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-4\">1. <em>Does Wardair Apply Here to Preclude a Dormant Foreign Commerce Clause </em>Analysis?</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-5\">The first issue we must consider is whether the Board is correct that this case is akin to <em>Wardair </em>and that there is an affirmative federal policy permitting California to apply the worldwide unitary tax method to domestic-parent groups with foreign subsidiaries. If the Board is correct, such affirmative action by the federal government will end our constitutional analysis because there will be no need to apply the dormant foreign commerce clause framework of <em>Japan Line </em>and <em>Container. </em>As we explain, the Board is correct in light of the interpretation of <em>Wardair </em>set forth in <em>Barclays.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-6\">The Board finds such an affirmative federal policy in the following five matters: (1) The United States income tax treaties with foreign countries bind the federal government to use some form of separate accounting but do not similarly bind the states; (2) the executive branch has adopted a Model Income Tax Treaty that does not apply to state taxation and has reserved its position on the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Model Convention\u2019s application to subnational taxes; (3) the United States Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation (FCN) treaties with foreign countries do not contain any state taxation restrictions; (4) Congress has not enacted any legislation prohibiting or restricting state use of the worldwide unitary method; and (5) the United States Senate refused to give its two-thirds consent to article 9(4) in the United States-United Kingdom Tax Treaty, which would have prohibited states from applying the worldwide unitary method to United Kingdom-parent unitary corporate groups.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-7\">These same factors were presented to the court in <em>Barclays. </em>The court concluded they were sufficient to invoke the <em>Wardair </em>principle, thereby obviating the need to apply a dormant foreign commerce clause analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-8\">As the <em>Barclays </em>court saw it, <em>Wardair </em>\u201creflects a diminution in the reach of dormant foreign commerce clause analysis in favor of an expanded recognition that, under circumscribed conditions, governmental silence may constitute a ratification of state taxation of foreign commerce, rendering a dormant analysis inapposite.\u201d (2 Cal.4th at p. 714.) As <em>Barclays </em>explains, \u201c[i]n some cases where Congress affirmatively declines to adopt certain measures, the resulting governmental \u2018silence\u2019 is not the sort that triggers use of a dormant foreign commerce clause analysis.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 728.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-9\">In concluding that the factors cited by the Board here were sufficient under <em>Wardair to </em>preclude a dormant foreign commerce clause analysis, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1783\">*1783</page-number><em>Barclays </em>court noted that the \u201cSenate\u2019s action with respect to article 9(4) is only the most explicit example of a persistent congressional refusal to enact curbs on the states\u2019 use of worldwide formula apportionment reaching back well before 1977, the tax year at issue in this case\u201d; that \u201cCongress, after being repeatedly pushed and pulled in both directions, at least for the present has decided <em>not </em>to prohibit state use of formula apportionment in cases of this kind\u201d; and that \u201can extensive pattern of executive branch-negotiated diplomatic texts parallels, in our view, Congress\u2019s own unwillingness to disallow legislatively the states\u2019 application of formula apportionment methods to foreign-controlled multinational taxpayers, and bespeaks a coordinate \u2018acquiescence.\u2019 \u201d (2 Cal.4th at pp. 733, 736, 738-739, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-4\">The <em>Barclays </em>court then rendered the following conclusion: \u201cIt is clear that federal limitations on the states\u2019 use of worldwide formula apportionment is a controversial political and economic issue of which Congress has long been aware. In light of that history, we cannot turn away from the substantial evidence of Congress\u2019s repeated refusal to intervene in the regulation of state division of income methods for tax purposes, even one that provokes continuing international complaint. Under the compulsions of established constitutional doctrine, the courts sometimes are required to divine what foreign commerce policy Congress would pursue in the absence of any indication that it has thought about the subject; it is a quite different matter, however, for a court to ignore a pattern of congressional action that evidences both an awareness of an issue and a refusal to adopt the remedy urged upon it by executive officials and resisted by its state constituencies. The latter, we believe, viewed in context alongside additional treaty materials, is a governmental silence that is eloquent. . . . H] We adhere to the central meaning of the high court\u2019s opinion in <em>Wardair </em>in holding that Congress\u2019s refusal to legislate restrictions on state use of worldwide formula apportionment is not the sort of governmental silence that triggers a dormant foreign commerce clause analysis.\u201d (2 Cal.4th at pp. 741-742.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-5\">Of course, <em>Barclays </em>involved the question of whether California\u2019s worldwide unitary method of taxation as applied to foreign-parent groups was unconstitutional under the foreign commerce clause. Here we deal with the same question as applied to domestic-parent groups. Nevertheless, for purposes of whether <em>Wardair </em>applies in light of the factors cited by the Board, there is no distinction between this case and <em>Barclays. </em>For that reason, we are obligated to adopt the analysis in <em>Barclays </em>regarding <em>Wardair's </em>applicability. (A<em>uto Equity Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455-456 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-6\">Accordingly, the dormant foreign commerce clause analysis set forth in <em>Japan Line </em>and <em>Container </em>does not apply here. Congress has acted. \u201cWhen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1784\">*1784</page-number>Congress has struck the balance it deems appropriate, the courts are no longer needed to prevent States from burdening commerce .... Courts are final arbiters under the Commerce Clause only when Congress has not acted.\u201d <em>(Merrion </em>v. <em>Jicarilla Apache Tribe, supra, </em>455 U.S. at pp. 154-155 [71 L.Ed.2d at p. 40]; see <em>Barclays, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at pp. 722, 725, fn. 9.) California\u2019s worldwide unitary method of taxation, as applied to domestic-parent groups with foreign subsidiaries, does not violate the foreign commerce clause of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-4\">2. <em>Did California Unlawfully \u201cDistort\u201d the Amount of Colgate\u2019s Income Apportioned to </em>California?</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-5\">Although Colgate did not file a cross-appeal, it argues the trial court erroneously determined that California\u2019s application of the worldwide unitary tax method to Colgate did not unlawfully \u201cdistort\u201d the amount of Colgate\u2019s income apportioned to California. We denied the Board\u2019s motion to strike this argument from Colgate\u2019s respondent\u2019s brief. Accordingly, we consider the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-6\">Colgate\u2019s argument is premised on what <em>Container </em>described as the \u201cexternal consistency\u201d requirement of fairness in an apportionment formula. Under that requirement, the application of a tax apportionment formula, such as California\u2019s worldwide unitary tax method, must be fair to pass constitutional scrutiny under both the due process and the commerce clauses; stated another way, the formula must actually reflect a reasonable sense of how income is generated. <em>(Container, supra, </em>463 U.S. at pp. 169-170 [77 L.Ed.2d at pp. 555-556]; <em>Trinova Corp. </em>v. <em>Michigan Dept. of Treasury </em>(1991) 498 U.S. 358 [112 L.Ed.2d 884, 111 S.Ct. 818].) Under this constitutional edict, an apportionment formula will be invalidated if the taxpayer can prove by clear and cogent evidence that the income attributed to the state is \u201c \u2018out of all appropriate proportion to the business transacted by the [taxpayer] in that State\u2019 \u201d or has \u201c \u2018led to a grossly distorted result.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Container, supra, </em>463 U.S. at pp. 170, 181 [77 L.Ed.2d at pp. 556, 563]; <em>Trinova, supra, </em>498 U.S. at pp. 379-381 [112 L.Ed.2d at pp. 908-909].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-7\">In addition to the constitutional \u201cexternal consistency\u201d requirement, there is a statute in California on the subject. Revenue and Taxation Code section 25137 provides: \u201cIf the allocation and apportionment provisions of this act do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer\u2019s business activity in this state, the taxpayer may petition for or the Franchise Tax Board may require, in respect to all or any part of the taxpayer\u2019s business activity, if reasonable: ffl (a) Separate accounting; [f] (b) The exclusion of any one or more of the factors; [][] (c) The inclusion of one or more additional factors which will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1785\">*1785</page-number>fairly represent the taxpayer\u2019s business activity in this state; or [ft] (d) The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer\u2019s income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-4\">Colgate argues that California\u2019s worldwide unitary tax method apportioned 70 percent more income to California in comparison to separate accounting and that such apportionment contravenes both the constitutional and the statutory distortion principles. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-5\">As noted by one commentator in reviewing <em>Container\u2019s </em>discussion of the constitutional distortion principle of \u201cexternal consistency,\u201d the taxpayer\u2019s burden of proof on this issue is \u201csteep if not insurmountable.\u201d (23 Colum. J., <em>supra, </em>at p. 457.) This is an accurate comment. In <em>Container, </em>the court noted that the three-factor formula used by California has not only \u201cmet our approval\u201d but has become \u201csomething of a benchmark against which other apportionment formulas are judged.\u201d (463 U.S. at p. 170 [77 L.Ed.2d at p. 556].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-6\"><em>Container </em>also noted the distortion figures in that case were based essentially on separate accounting methods that failed to account for the flow of value between the parts of the unitary business. (463 U.S. at pp. 181-184 [77 L.Ed.2d at pp. 563-565].) The same can be said here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-7\">Colgate argues the distortion arises here because Colgate\u2019s foreign subsidiaries are substantially more profitable than its California operations. That is, the foreign subsidiaries\u2019 lower property, payroll, and sales figures for the same level of productivity result in a distorted apportionment to California under the three-factor formula. In <em>Container, </em>the taxpayer made the same argument. The court in <em>Container </em>rejected this argument, stating: \u201cThe problem with this argument is obvious: the profit figures relied on by [the taxpayer] are based on precisely the sort of formal geographical accounting whose basic theoretical weaknesses justify resort to formula apportionment in the first place.\u201d (463 U.S. at p. 181 [77 L.Ed.2d at p. 563].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-8\">Apparently, there is only one United States Supreme Court decision that has invalidated a state tax apportionment formula applied to a corporate income tax or a franchise tax of a manufacturing or mercantile company like Colgate. (23 Colum. J., <em>supra, </em>at pp. 450-451; see also <em>Container, supra, </em>463 U.S. at pp. 182-184 [77 L.Ed.2d at pp. 564-565].) That decision is from 1931 and is entitled <em>Hans Rees\u2019 Sons Inc. </em>v. <em>North Carolina </em>ex rel. <em>Maxwell </em>(1931) 283 U.S. 123 [75 L.Ed. 879, 51 S.Ct. 385]. In that case, a one-factor unitary tax method was applied to a domestic company. Although the company\u2019s income in <em>Hans Rees </em>was derived from a variety of far-flung activities\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1786\">*1786</page-number>including buying, selling and manufacturing\u2014North Carolina\u2019s statutory formula allocated the entire wholesale profit to North Carolina, where the manufacturing occurred. This allocation resulted in 250 percent more income attributed to the state. (283 U.S. at pp. 126-128 [75 L.Ed.2d at pp. 889-898]; see 23 Colum. J., <em>supra, </em>at p. 450; <em>Container, supra, </em>463 U.S. at pp. 183-184 [77 L.Ed.2d at pp. 564-565].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-4\">Colgate\u2019s 70 percent figure\u2014which does not account for the flow of value between the parts of Colgate\u2019s unitary business\u2014is not comparable to the 250 percent tally in <em>Hans Rees. </em>Colgate has not met the steep burden imposed by the constitutional distortion principle of \u201cexternal consistency.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1286-5\">Colgate realizes this and pins its hopes on Revenue and Taxation Code section 25137. Colgate faces an uphill battle here as well.  Under section 25137 and California case law, the Board is given discretion to select the factors to be used in a tax formula. <em>(McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 506, 512 [72 Cal.Rptr. 465, 446 P.2d 313].) Where a taxpayer petitions for an alternative formula under section 25137, the taxpayer bears the burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that the formula used by the Board reaches an unreasonable result in his or her case. (69 Cal.2d at p. 512; Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 25137; <em>Communications Satellite Corp. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 726, 746-749 [203 Cal.Rptr. 779]; see e.g., <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>County of Monterey </em>(1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 382, 387-388 [272 Cal.Rptr. 745].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-6\">Colgate argues that the trial court used the constitutional \u201cout of all proportion\u201d test to dismiss Colgate\u2019s statutory assertion under Revenue and Taxation Code section 25137. Additionally, Colgate argues that testimony from the Board\u2019s counsel for multistate tax affairs establishes that the Board unlawfully fails to consider separate accounting as an alternative for unitary companies under section 25137. The first of these arguments is meritless, rendering a discussion of the second unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-7\">As noted by the Board, the trial court did not apply the constitutional \u201cout of all proportion\u201d test to the statutory issue. In reviewing the Board\u2019s denial of Colgate\u2019s Revenue and Taxation Code section 25137 petition, the trial court cited <em>Container's </em>\u201cflow of value\u201d concept and upheld the Board\u2019s determination that Colgate had not demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that California\u2019s apportionment formula unfairly represented the extent of Colgate\u2019s business activity in California. <em>(Container, supra, </em>463 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1787\">*1787</page-number>U.S. at pp. 181-184 [77 L.Ed.2d at pp. 563-565].) This constituted a correct application of the statutory standard set forth in section 25137. <em>(McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., supra, </em>69 Cal.2d at p. 512; see <em>Amoco Production Company </em>v. <em>Armold </em>(1974) 213 Kan. 636 [518 P.2d 453, 463-465].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-4\">Citing <em>Hunt-Wesson Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Alameda </em>(1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 163, 176 [116 Cal.Rptr. 160], Colgate contends the right to recover taxes paid under protest is a fundamental vested right; therefore, the trial court was obligated to exercise its independent judgment on the Revenue and Taxation Code section 25137 evidence. We disagree with Colgate for two reasons. First, the <em>Hunt-Wesson </em>court did not hold that the right to recover taxes paid under protest is a fundamental vested right. That court said the argument could be made. (41 Cal.App.3d at p. 176.) Second, and more importantly, the precise issue involved here concerns the application of a particular tax method that is within the discretion of the Board under statutory directive. <em>(McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., supra, </em>69 Cal.2d at p. 512; Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 25120-25139; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 18, \u00a7 25137-6; see <em>Amoco Production Company </em>v. <em>Arnold, supra, </em>518 P.2d at pp. 463-465; see e.g., <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>County of Monterey, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.3d at pp. 387-388.) Colgate can hardly ascribe an individually \u201cvested\u201d status to this process. (See <em>Hunt-Wesson, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.3d at p. 174.) As noted, <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>is the relevant decision on this limited issue. (69 Cal.2d at p. 512.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\">Our resolution of the statutory distortion issue renders irrelevant Colgate\u2019s argument that the Board unlawfully fails to consider separate accounting as an alternative for unitary companies under Revenue and Taxation Code section 25137. Colgate has not shown that California\u2019s apportionment formula unfairly represented the extent of Colgate\u2019s business activity in California. The alternatives set forth in section 25137 are invoked only if the taxpayer makes that showing. Consequently, we do not address this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-6\">3. <em>The Sanctions and Costs Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1287-7\">The Board claims the trial court abused its discretion in denying the Board\u2019s motion for sanctions against Colgate. In that motion, the Board argued that Colgate unduly delayed in producing certain documents evidencing the unitary nature of Colgate\u2019s operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-8\">This matter arose when Colgate, during the first two days of trial, belatedly produced to the Board\u2019s counsel five boxes of documents pursuant to the Board\u2019s requests for production of documents and a court order based on those requests. Included in this belated production were documents relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1788\">*1788</page-number>to the operation of Colgate\u2019s Danish subsidiary and therefore relevant to the issue of whether Colgate\u2019s subsidiaries operated in a unitary fashion with the domestic parent corporation. This production occurred in mid-July 1988. It was not until mid-February 1989, however, that the Board moved for sanctions on this matter; this was after the trial was over and after the Board had won on the unitary issue. On these facts, the trial court declined to award sanctions because the motion was untimely and failed to evidence prejudice against the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-4\">The trial court has broad discretion in imposing discovery sanctions, subject to reversal only for arbitrary, capricious or whimsical action. (See <em>Sauer </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 213, 228 [240 Cal.Rptr. 489]; <em>Kahn </em>v. <em>Kahn </em>(1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 372, 380-381 [137 Cal.Rptr. 332] [although these cases were not decided under the current discovery statutes, the general principle of review they enunciate remains valid. (See Code Civ. Proc., former \u00a7 2034.)]) Code of Civil Procedure section 2023, subdivision (b)(1), upon which the Board relies, does not alter this well-settled principle and the Board concedes as much. That section and subdivision provides in pertinent part that \u201c[i]f a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision of this article, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-5\">The Board argues that the trial court\u2019s finding of no prejudice conveys the message that it is acceptable to abuse discovery and conceal evidence, so long as the party seeking discovery cannot prove how those actions prejudiced its case. Of course, prejudice is difficult to prove in the face of victory. The Board\u2019s real concern is that such discovery abuse will go unpunished. The Board can rest assured that the trial court possesses an array of weapons to counter parties abusing the discovery process. These weapons include a \u201cMonetary sanction,\u201d an \u201cIssue sanction,\u201d an \u201cEvidence sanction,\u201d a \u201cTerminating Sanction,\u201d and a \u201cContempt Sanction.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2023, subd. (b)(l)(2)(3)(4)(5).) The problem for the Board here is that a timely motion for sanctions is required to make these sanctions effective. The Board made its motion after the trial was over and after it had won on the issue for which it sought sanctions. And the Board cannot claim it did not know about the discovery abuse until it made its motion in February 1989. The Board admits it uncovered the abuse in July 1988 during the first days of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-6\">The Board argues it was prejudiced because it could have moved for summary judgment on the unitary issue had the documents been timely produced, and the trial could have been shortened if not eliminated. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1789\">*1789</page-number>doubt seriously that operational documents concerning one of Colgate\u2019s seventy-five foreign subsidiaries were the only evidence standing in the way of a summary judgment motion on the unitary issue. In any event, the nature of the unitary issue is essentially factual and particular to the corporate enterprise being examined. For that reason, the issue would not usually be amenable to summary adjudication resolution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We also doubt that Colgate\u2019s timely production could have eliminated or significantly shortened the trial. The testimony part of the trial also encompassed the distortion issues, and the heart of the lawsuit concerned the foreign commerce clause issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-4\">The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Board\u2019s motion for discovery sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-5\">Our partial reversal of the judgment resolves the issue of costs awarded below to Colgate. Under our decision, Colgate is no longer the prevailing party and is therefore not entitled to costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-7\">The portion of the judgment regarding the foreign commerce clause issue is reversed. The portion of the judgment regarding the constitutional and statutory distortion issues and on the matter of sanctions is affirmed. The Board is awarded its costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-8\">Puglia, P.

An accounting restriction to the water\u2019s edge of the United States in the present context would mean that California could rely only on income derived from permanent establishments of Colgate in the United States, and not on income derived from wholly foreign interests, to calculate Colgate\u2019s franchise tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-8\">To qualify for the \u201cwater\u2019s-edge\u201d election, the corporate taxpayer must (1) consent to the taking of depositions from key corporate personnel and to the production of documents to ensure the Franchise Tax Board has the information necessary to make genuine arm\u2019s length adjustments and unitary business investigations, and (2) agree that dividends received by any affiliated entity from corporations significantly related to the unitary business constitute business income of the taxpayer. (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 25110, subd. (b)(2).) Additionally, to qualify the corporate taxpayer must enter into a five-year contract with the Franchise Tax Board, pay an annual fee, and subject itself to various conditions. (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 25111-25115.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-9\">A domestic-parent multinational corporation that does not make this election is subjected essentially to the 1970-1973 taxation method at issue here. (See fn. 1, <em>ante.) </em>We emphasize, however, that the principal issue in this case is the foreign commerce clause constitutionality of California\u2019s worldwide unitary tax method as applied to domestic-parent unitary corporate groups with foreign subsidiaries (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 25101 et seq.). Because California\u2019s \u201cwater\u2019s-edge election\u201d is not involved in this case, we do not express any views regarding it. (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 25110 et seq.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1275-10\">Reversing its position below, Colgate on appeal does not dispute that it is a domestic-parent unitary corporate group.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1276-10\">The Board moved to strike this argument on appeal, contending it was improperly raised in these proceedings.
