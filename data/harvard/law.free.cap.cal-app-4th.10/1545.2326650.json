They have been superseded by the enactment of Penal Code section 1203.1k when the probationer consents to this procedure. Probationers who thereafter disagree with the amount or manner of restitution, may bring a motion in the trial court and object thereto. If still not satisfied the probationer may then appeal from the trial court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-6\">Alfred John DiMora was convicted by plea of two counts of communicating untrue material facts or omitting material facts in a private security offering. (Corp. Code, \u00a7 25401.) Probation was granted for five years on various terms and conditions, inter alia, that appellant serve two hundred seventy days in the county jail and that he pay restitution \u201cas recommended by probation.\u201d He challenges the restitution order because the probation department subsequently notified him that he owes over a half million dollars in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-7\">Appellant originally pled no contest to these two counts in a negotiated disposition before Judge McMahon. The terms of that disposition were: (1) other counts would be dismissed, (2) no state prison, (3) five years probation, (4) up to one year in the county jail at the court\u2019s discretion, (5) $39,000 restitution to one of the victims, Mr. Van Damme, and (6) no other restitution to be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-8\">At the outset of the originally scheduled sentencing hearing, Judge McMahon declared that he was \u201cbiased and prejudiced\u201d against appellant and his counsel, apparently based on the letter appellant\u2019s counsel sent to the probation department. Judge McMahon reset the matter for sentencing or withdrawal of the pleas before Judge Adams.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-9\">Thereafter, appellant\u2019s retained counsel withdrew and newly retained counsel was substituted in his stead. Appellant\u2019s new counsel moved to withdraw his previously entered pleas. The motion was granted. Appellant reentered no contest pleas to the same counts without any limitation on the amount of restitution. In taking the pleas, the prosecutor and appellant engaged in a lengthy colloquy which comprises 17 pages of the reporter\u2019s transcript and refers to the 8-page written plea agreement. The salient excerpts of the reporter\u2019s transcript are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-10\">\u201cMr. Glogow [Prosecutor]: ... the agreement that your lawyer and I have entered into is that you will spend no more than one year in a county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1548\">*1548</page-number>jail as a term and condition of five years formal probation, . . . <em>that\u2019s the only deal? Those are the terms of the </em>deal? [j[] The Defendant: <em>Correct.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">\u201cMr. Glogow: If that happens [you violate probation], that judge who sends you to state prison can make you pay actual restitution up to $10,000. It does not mean that you will not be ordered to make restitution if you\u2019re placed on probation. <em>The matter of restitution, in any amount, is going to be up to this judge here.\u201d </em>[f] The Defendant: <em>I understand that.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-5\">\u201cMr. Glogow: There\u2019s something called a Harvey Waiver. <em>[People </em>v. <em>Harvey </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 754 [159 Cal.Rptr. 696, 602 P.2d 296].] Let me read you what it says here. It says: [][] \u2018You understand that for the purpose of aggravating or enhancing your sentence in this case, the court will consider the underlying facts of the charges and enhancements which are to be dismissed by the People in exchange for your plea of no contest to the other charges.\u2019 [f] The Defendant: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-6\">\u201cMr. Glogow: Do you understand that you have the right to be tried on the charges and enhancements which are to be dismissed, and that if those charges and enhancements were tried, you would have and could exercise all of the Constitutional rights that I have discussed with you up till this point; that is, specifically, your right to an attorney, to a jury trial, to testify or remain silent as you choose, to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against you, and to compel the attendance of witnesses for your defense, [f] <em>Do you also understand that as to any dismissed charges at the time of the sentencing, the judge could order you to pay restitution for the dismissed charges? </em>[][] <em>The Defendant: Yes.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-7\">At the sentencing hearing, the prosecutor reminded the trial court that \u201c[o]n the day of trial, as your Honor will recall, he reentered those pleas without, I want to stress, without the agreement that the restitution would be in the amount previously agreed on, nor to the individual to whom it was to go. <em>Restitution was left wide open.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-8\">The original probation report prepared as a result of the first plea recommended $39,000 restitution to Mr. Van Damme which was consistent with the original negotiated disposition. The supplemental report prepared for the instant hearing requested restitution as directed by the probation department. At the sentencing hearing the prosecutor argued for broader restitution claiming the original figure was too low. The prosecutor argued that the investors had lost about three-quarters of a million dollars. Appellant did not claim that restitution was limited to $39,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1549\">*1549</page-number>Judge Adams sentenced appellant in accordance with the second negotiated disposition. Appellant was placed on probation for five years, ordered to serve two hundred seventy days in jail, and ordered to pay restitution \u201cas recommended by the probation department.\u201d In doing so, Judge Adams expressly indicated that appellant could and would successfully abide by the terms and conditions of probation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\">Appellant signed the probation order below a paragraph which stated: \u201cI have read and fully understand the above terms and conditions and accept them. . . .\u201d Thus, appellant not only failed to object, he expressly and at the very least impliedly consented to the probation department\u2019s determining the amount and manner of restitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-6\">Appellant\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in leaving the amount of restitution and the manner of its payment to the probation officer is without merit. Penal Code section 1203.1k, enacted in 1987 and subsequent to cases relied on by appellant (e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Cervantes </em>(1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 353, 358-361 [201 Cal.Rptr. 187]), provides in pertinent part: \u201cFor any order of restitution made under Section 1203.1, the court. . . may, with the consent of the defendant, order the probation officer to set the amount of restitution and the manner in which restitution shall be made to a victim. The defendant shall have the right to a hearing before the judge to dispute the determinations made by the probation officer in regard to the amount or manner in which restitution is to be made to the victim. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-7\">When appellant pleaded no contest the second time, he was expressly warned that the amount of restitution was at the trial court\u2019s discretion and could embrace restitution for the dismissed counts. He consented to this term. There is no requirement of written or verbal admonition and waiver pursuant to Penal Code section 1203.1k akin to <em>Boykin-Tahl </em>admonitions and waivers. <em>(Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 238; [23 L.Ed.2d 274, 89 S.Ct. 1709]; <em>In re Tahl </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 122 [81 Cal.Rptr. 577, 460 P.2d 449].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-8\">If appellant is dissatisfied with the probation officer\u2019s determination, his remedy is to move for a hearing to dispute it. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1203.1k.) If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1550\">*1550</page-number>he is still dissatisfied with this order, made after judgment which affects his substantial rights, he may appeal therefrom. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1237, subd. (b); <em>People </em>v. <em>Voumazos </em>(1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 948, 953 [244 Cal.Rptr. 82].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\">Finally, appellant argues that Judge Adams\u2019s phrase, \u201cas recommended by the probation department,\u201d refers to the prior $39,000 figure that was specified in the withdrawn negotiated disposition. If that is so, then Judge Adams will presumably so order should appellant ask for relief in the trial court. At no time has appellant sought to withdraw from the negotiated disposition. He may not retain the favorable aspects of the negotiated disposition while at the same time jettison its unfavorable aspects. <em>(In re Blessing </em>(1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 1026, 1028 [181 Cal.Rptr. 590]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Blessing </em>(1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 835, 839, fn. 3 [155 Cal.Rptr. 780].) Appellant\u2019s request that we order that restitution be limited to $39,000 is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-6\">Stone (S. J.), P. J., and Gilbert, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1101-9\">We summarily reject appellant\u2019s claim that Judge McMahon\u2019s remarks tainted Judge Adams\u2019s and the probation department\u2019s ability to be fair. Nothing in the record so shows and the claim is pure speculation. Given the comments of Judge Adams at the time probation was granted, it is readily apparent that he was, in no way, affected by Judge McMahon\u2019s earlier remarks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1101-10\">We are aware that a related issue pends in the Supreme Court whether a defendant waives the right to appeal a condition of probation by failure to object before the sentencing court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Welch </em><footnotemark>*</footnotemark>(Cal.App.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-11\">Our opinion is not premised upon simple \u201cfailure to object.\u201d It is premised upon actual warning of \u201cwide open\u201d restitution and appellant\u2019s consent thereto.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1101-12\">See 5 Cal.4th 228 for Supreme Court opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
