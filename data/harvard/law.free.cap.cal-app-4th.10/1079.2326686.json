J.</author>\n<p id=\"AeJ\">Ronnie P. appeals from an order of the juvenile court committing him to the California Youth Authority. We will reverse because (1) the fact that appellant left the company of a custodian, which was the only fact before the court at the jurisdictional hearing, was an insufficient basis for sustaining the petition; and (2) the commitment to the Youth Authority rested not on the required assessment of present circumstances and statutory criteria, but on an earlier order purporting to impose a \u201csuspended\u201d Youth Authority commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">On June 4, 1991, the juvenile court sustained a petition alleging that appellant, then 15, had violated Health and Safety Code section 11351.5 (possession of cocaine base for sale). At the dispositional hearing following the June 1991 finding, the probation officer recommended that appellant be committed to the Youth Authority. The transcript of that hearing is not included in the record, but counsel and one Dr. Staggers apparently argued against a Youth Authority commitment on grounds stemming from the fact that appellant had been attacked with a baseball bat, sustaining serious head injuries which were being treated by Dr. Staggers at Children\u2019s Hospital in Oakland. The court directed the probation department to make a more thorough search for alternative placements. At a continued hearing on July 16, 1991, the court ordered appellant into placement, with the expectation that he would enter a Sacramento program called Positive Transitions. In the course of the hearing the court indicated that it was also imposing a \u201cstayed\u201d or \u201csuspended\u201d Youth Authority commitment. (See fn. 4, <em>post.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">On August 14 a supplemental petition was prepared under Welfare and Institutions Code section <em>111,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>alleging that the previous dispositional order had been ineffective in that appellant had left his court-ordered placement on July 30 and his whereabouts were unknown. The petition also alleged that in previous proceedings appellant had been found to have committed drug offenses on four occasions, carried a concealed weapon, and escaped from custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">At a pretrial hearing on August 23, the petition was amended to state that appellant left the custody of a transportation officer on July 30. Appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>attorney was willing at that time to stipulate to jurisdiction, but during the course of admonitions appellant stated that he wanted a trial. The matter was continued to September 4, at which time counsel stated that appellant was prepared to \u201csubmit the matter of 777 insofar as the allegations were that he departed from the company of a custodian.\u201d The court asked whether there was a \u201cfactual basis,\u201d to which counsel replied, \u201cYes.\u201d The court then stated, \u201cPursuant to his submission, we\u2019ll find that he\u2019s described under . . . 777(A) of the Welfare and Institutions Code in that he violated his probation and that the previous order has not been effective in his rehabilitation as alleged in the petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">According to the probation officer\u2019s report prepared for the dispositional hearing on September 18, the proceeding arose from events on July 30, when the program director of Positive Transitions took appellant from Sacramento to Oakland in the mistaken belief that his attendance was required at a placement review hearing. After the hearing they stopped at an East Oakland restaurant, whereupon appellant \u201cwent AWOL.\u201d The report recommended that appellant be returned to placement at Positive Transitions, noting that the director of that program \u201cbelieves that Ronnie is workable, and that if he does not return to the Oakland area for some time he could make progress in her program.\u201d The report observed that \u201cRonnie is still 15 years old, and there will be plenty of time to send him to the California Youth Authority should he fail placement again.\u201d It also noted that appellant \u201ccontinues to have physiological consequences from the head trauma he suffered last December\u201d and that \u201c[i]t should be at least another year for him to heal fully.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">At the dispositional hearing, the deputy district attorney reminded the court of its earlier order that appellant would be sent to the Youth Authority if he got in any further trouble. The court found this argument dispositive and committed appellant to the Youth Authority. (See fn. 5, <em>post.) </em>This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">Ineffectiveness of Earlier Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">Appellant first contends that there was insufficient evidence before the court at the September 4 hearing to warrant finding jurisdiction under section 777. We agree. The limited nature of appellant\u2019s admission, coupled with the absence of any competent evidentiary showing in support of the petition, deprived the court of an adequate evidentiary basis on which to sustain the jurisdictional allegations of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>An adjudication under section 777 must rest on \u201cfacts sufficient to support the conclusion that the previous disposition has not been effective in the rehabilitation or protection of the minor.\u201d (\u00a7 777, subd. (a)(2); see <em>In re Angel E. </em>(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 415, 418-421 [223 Cal.Rptr. 4].) The petition must contain a \u201cconcise statement\u201d of these facts. (\u00a7 777, subd. (a)(2).) The facts must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(In re Arthur N. </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 226, 240 [127 Cal.Rptr. 641, 545 P.2d 1345].) The showing must be made by competent evidence. (See <em>In re Martin L. </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 534, 540-541 [232 Cal.Rptr. 43]; <em>In re Gladys R. </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 855, 860 [83 Cal.Rptr. 671, 464 P.2d 127].)</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Appellant correctly points out that aside from his admission that he \u201cdeparted from the company of a custodian,\u201d there was <em>no </em>evidence before the court at the jurisdictional hearing. There was no indication that the court proposed to or did take judicial notice of any matter, including its own files. Certainly it did not apprise the parties of any intention to do so, as is required by Evidence Code section 455, subdivision (a). (Compare <em>In re Martin L., supra, </em>187 Cal.App.3d 534, 544 [judicial notice with counsel\u2019s consent]; <em>In re John G. </em>(1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 242, 246-247 [139 Cal.Rptr. 849] [dispositional order supported by whole record, which was fully discussed and not objected to].) If the court relied on earlier probation reports, or even its own memory of prior proceedings, it thereby erred. (See <em>In re Angel E., supra, </em>177 Cal.App.3d 415, 419.)</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Indeed the court seems to have found subsidiary facts for which there is no evidentiary support, competent or otherwise, in this record. The court declared that appellant\u2019s conduct \u201cviolated his probation,\u201d which we take to mean that appellant violated some directive previously imposed concerning his own conduct. But there is no indication that appellant had ever been ordered to remain in the custody of Positive Transitions or of the person whose company he left. In the absence of such evidence \u201cit cannot be said that, as a factual matter, the minor violated a court order.\u201d <em>(In re Denise C. </em>(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 761, 765 [119 Cal.Rptr. 735].)</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Assuming the admonitions not to \u201cscrew[] up\u201d or \u201cget in any further trouble\u201d (see fn. 4, below) can be viewed as orders, they were too general to support a finding that appellant violated a court order. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1970) 12 Cal.App.3d 621, 627-628 [90 Cal.Rptr. 811].) This is particularly true since the admitted conduct was not a violation of criminal law. Section 871 makes it a misdemeanor for a minor to escape or attempt to escape from a county juvenile home, ranch, camp, or forestry camp, or to escape during transportation to or from such a place. However, since appellant was not in custody of any of the specified institutions, his conduct did not violate that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>statute. <em>(In re Steven E. </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1162, 1163, 1167 [280 Cal.Rptr. 540].)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Nor was the sole fact of appellant\u2019s leaving the company of a custodian legally sufficient to establish \u201cthat the previous disposition [was] such a complete failure that any further effort at that dispositional level would be unavailing.\u201d <em>(In re Joe A. </em>(1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 11, 26 [227 Cal.Rptr. 831].) A single \u201cdeviation] from the paths of rectitude\u201d will not automatically demonstrate such a \u201ccomplete failure.\u201d <em>(In re Donna G. </em>(1970) 6 Cal.App.3d 890, 895 [86 Cal.Rptr. 421]; <em>In re Denise C., supra, </em>45 Cal.App.3d at p. 767.) Here appellant had been at Positive Transitions less than two weeks\u2014hardly enough time for anyone to reasonably conclude that he would not respond to the program. (See <em>In re Scott K. </em>(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 273, 277 [203 Cal.Rptr. 268] [effectiveness of latest disposition cannot be assessed until it has been \u201cexecuted\u201d].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There was nothing before the court which would permit a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the previous disposition was ineffective. Accordingly, the finding of jurisdiction under section 777 was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The error in sustaining the petition was prejudicial because far from establishing the inevitability of the trial court\u2019s finding, much of the evidence later presented tended to rebut the notion that the single instance of misconduct alleged in the petition established the rehabilitative failure of the placement at Positive Transitions. Not only had there been insufficient time to assess the efficacy of the program in appellant\u2019s case, there was also considerable evidence that his \u201cgoing AWOL\u201d was situational, i.e., a reaction to circumstances which need not recur. He did not escape from the Positive Transitions facility in Sacramento, but left the company of a worker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>who had stopped to eat in appellant\u2019s own neighborhood in Oakland.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant told the probation officer that he left because he was \u201ctempted by the proximity to his grandmother\u2019s home.\u201d It appears that he should not have been in Oakland in the first place, but only found himself there because a program employee \u201cmistakenly believed the minor needed to attend placement review that had been calendared.\u201d The program director at Positive Transitions continued to believe appellant was \u201cworkable,\u201d particularly if kept away from Oakland.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">We conclude that had the court relied only on admissible evidence concerning the rehabilitative effectiveness of the prior placement order, it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to appellant would have followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">\n<em>Youth Authority Commitment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Appellant contends that the juvenile court abused its discretion in committing him to the Youth Authority.  He asserts among other things that the court erred by relying on its previous dispositional order purporting to impose \u201cstayed\u201d or \u201csuspended\u201d Youth Authority commitment. This contention is meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">At the July 1991 dispositional hearing the court stated that it was imposing a \u201csuspended\u201d Youth Authority commitment under which appellant would go to the Youth Authority if he \u201cscrew[ed] up\u201d or got in \u201cany further trouble.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the September dispositional hearing from which this appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>arose, the court concluded that commitment to the Youth Authority necessarily followed from the fact that appellant \u201cran\u201d in supposed violation of these admonitions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">First we note the complete absence of authority for an order imposing a \u201csuspended\u201d or \u201cstayed\u201d Youth Authority commitment. Courts have permitted the imposition of a brief juvenile hall detention stayed on condition that other dispositional orders be performed. (E.g., <em>In re Mark M. </em>(1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 873 [167 Cal.Rptr. 461]; see <em>In re Ricardo M. </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 744 [125 Cal.Rptr. 291].) This practice has been codified at section <em>111, </em>subdivision (e), which permits the court to enforce, upon a violation of \u201ca condition or conditions of probation,\u201d a \u201cstayed\u201d order for confinement in a county institution for up to 30 days. The expression of this narrow authorization implies the exclusion of any broader authority for \u201cstayed\u201d dispositions, under the doctrine of <em>\u201cexpressio unius est exclusio alterius.\" </em>(See <em>In re Michael G. </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 283, 291 [243 Cal.Rptr. 224, 747 P.2d 1152].)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Nor do we find anything suggesting that the court may forego a thorough review of dispositional considerations in favor of a previously \u201cstayed\u201d Youth Authority commitment. Such a notion runs contrary to the basic purposes, principles, and procedures of juvenile law.  The stated central objective of the law with respect to delinquent children is to provide the \u201ccare, treatment and guidance which is consistent with their best interest, which holds them accountable for their behavior, and which is appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>for their circumstances.\u201d (\u00a7 202, subd. (b).) To determine what is appropriate under a given set of circumstances, a court must review those circumstances every time the minor appears for a dispositional hearing. Thus, \u201c[j]uvenile courts . . . shall consider the safety and protection of the public and the best interests of the minor in <em>all </em>deliberations pursuant to this chapter.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (d), italics added.) <em>\u201cEach time </em>a ward comes before the court. . . , the goal of any resulting dispositional order is to rehabilitate the minor.\u201d <em>(In re Scott K., supra, </em>156 Cal.App.3d 273, 277, italics added.) A lockstep escalation of dispositions \u201cfalls short of the particularized consideration which underlies the entire juvenile court system.\u201d <em>(In re Joe A., supra, </em>183 Cal.App.3d at p. 29.)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">We have found no decisions discussing a \u201cstayed\u201d Youth Authority commitment, but several cases make it clear that a juvenile court errs by purporting to determine dispositional issues in advance of the dispositional hearing. In <em>In re J. L. P. </em>(1972) 25 Cal.App.3d 86 [100 Cal.Rptr. 601], the court purported to give the minor a choice whether to be tried as an adult or under the juvenile court law. The court said that if the minor chose the latter and the petition were sustained, the minor would be committed to the Youth Authority. The minor so chose and the court so ordered, refusing to receive evidence concerning the possible efficacy of less restrictive dispositions. The commitment order was reversed, principally because the procedure involved an impermissible predetermination of dispositional issues prior to any hearing. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 90.)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Two other cases recognize the impropriety of a dispositional order which purports to be \u201cself-executing\u201d <em>(In re Jonathan M. </em>(1981) 117 Cal.App.3d 530, 538 [172 Cal.Rptr. 833]), or to impose an \u201cautomatic\u201d penalty for misconduct. <em>(In re Gerald B. </em>(1980) 105 Cal.App.3d 119, 126-127 [164 Cal.Rptr. 193].)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The commitment here was improperly \u201cpredetermined\u201d by the \u201cstayed\u201d Youth Authority commitment purportedly imposed at the previous dispositional hearing. This fact is unequivocally established by the court\u2019s explicit reliance on the following syllogism: \u201cI told him that if he ran, he\u2019s going to go to the Youth Authority.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] So he\u2019s going to the Youth Authority. That\u2019s just the way it works.\u201d But as we have noted, that is <em>not </em>\u201cthe way it works\u201d; the court is required to examine the entire dispositional picture whenever the minor comes before the court for disposition. It cannot treat an earlier order as \u201cself-executing\u201d or \u201cautomatic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>Nor could the court properly impose a \u201cstayed\u201d Youth Authority commitment by analogy to criminal law.  It is commonplace to grant probation to an adult offender subject to a stayed or suspended sentence which may be executed more-or-less automatically if the conditions of probation are violated. (See 3 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (2d ed. 1989) Punishment for Crime, \u00a7\u00a7 1695, 1715, pp. 2005, 2027.) However, a dispositional hearing on a supplemental juvenile court petition \u201cis only superficially analogous to an adult probation revocation hearing because neither the purposes nor the consequences of these proceedings are the same .... [J]uvenile probation is not, as with an adult, an act of leniency in lieu of statutory punishment; it is an ingredient of a final order for the minor\u2019s reformation and rehabilitation. A grant of juvenile probation is not revoked upon sustaining a supplemental petition; rather, the entire underlying order is subject to modification \u2018as the judge deems meet and proper.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Antonio A. </em>(1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 700, 706 [275 Cal.Rptr. 482], quoting \u00a7 775; see <em>In re Bernardino S. </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 613, 622, fn. 5 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 746], quoting 1 Cal. Juvenile Court Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1981) \u00a7 9.52, p. 256 [\u201cjuvenile probation is not an act of leniency or an alternative to a more rigorous prescribed penalty, but \u2018a final order made in the minor\u2019s best interest\u2019 \u201d]; <em>In re Arthur N., supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 226, 236.)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">In making a dispositional order, of course, the juvenile court can not only direct an appropriate placement but may also issue orders concerning the minor\u2019s conduct. (\u00a7 727, subd. (a) [where minor adjudged a ward of court]; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1493(d) [same]; <em>In re Michael G. </em>(1977) 76 Cal.App.3d 872, 875 [143 Cal.Rptr. 163] [where not adjudged a ward]; <em>In re Bacon </em>(1966) 240 Cal.App.2d 34, 59-60 [49 CaLRptr. 322] [same].) In content these orders are often comparable to adult probation conditions, and regrettably the similarities have led both legislators and courts to refer to them as \u201cconditions of probation.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> They differ, however, in the critical respect that with narrow statutory exceptions, violation of such an order cannot lead automatically to imposition of some reserved measure, but requires a complete review of the order and such amendments as the court finds \u201cmeet and proper\u201d under the governing statutory criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">This brings us to respondent\u2019s assertion that appellant \u201csquandered his chances at a lesser alternative.\u201d Underlying this argument is the concept of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>retributive justice which is explicitly incorporated in adult penal law (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170, subd. (a)(1)) and just as explicitly excluded from the juvenile court law (\u00a7 202, subd. (e)). A juvenile disposition is not an act of graceful abstention by the state, the benefits of which the minor forfeits by misconduct. The significance of subsequent misconduct in juvenile cases is that it may reveal the ineffectiveness of a current disposition in achieving the statutory objectives of rehabilitating the minor and protecting the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">A \u201cstayed\u201d Youth Authority commitment has no place in this scheme.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The law presumes that at a given point in time the statutory criteria are best satisfied by one dispositional alternative. If commitment appears to be that alternative, then the minor should be committed. If some lesser alternative appears preferable, the court should choose the alternative. The court cannot determine in advance that if the lesser alternative fails, commitment will become the optimal disposition. Instead a failure of the lesser disposition calls for a complete reassessment of dispositional issues in light of then-prevailing circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">By relying on the \u201cstayed\u201d commitment, the court here failed to \u201cconsider\u201d the dispositional evidence, including the social study. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1492(b); Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 706; <em>In re L. S. </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 1100, 1107 [269 Cal.Rptr. 700] [failure to consider current dispositional report was reversible error not subject to harmless error analysis]; <em>In re Devin J. </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 1096, 1101 [202 Cal.Rptr. 543] [reliance for dispositional purposes on limited social study prepared for fitness hearing constituted denial of fair and complete hearing, warranting reversal].)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This inference is reinforced by the fact that when counsel for appellant pointed out the brevity of appellant\u2019s stay at Positive Transitions, the court\u2019s only reply was, \u201cIt\u2019s not their fault.\u201d (See fn. 5, <em>ante.) </em>This strikingly irrelevant comment suggests a refusal to consider the facts noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>in the report, or any other facts tending to support a disposition less restrictive than Youth Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">By failing to consider any of the prescribed dispositional factors the court also failed to make a finding on critical ultimate issues<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and failed to exercise a discretion conferred and compelled by law. Such error constituted the denial of a fair hearing and deprivation of fundamental procedural rights compelling reversal.

Having committed a new criminal act, the minor in the cited example is subject to a complete reassessment of disposition under a \u201csubsequent\u201d section 602 petition, without the proof of dispositional failure required in a section 777 proceeding. (See <em>In re Michael B. </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 548, 553 [169 Cal.Rptr. 723 , 620 P.2d 173].) Furthermore, the hypothetical, and the court\u2019s overall criticism of <em>Scott K., </em>rests on a false synonymy between the terms \u201cexecuted\u201d and \u201ccompleted.\u201d Indeed it <em>would </em>be absurd to suggest that a new disposition cannot be imposed until the previous one has been \u201ccompleted.\u201d The teaching of <em>Scott K. </em>is that a dispositional order cannot be found ineffective under section <em>111 </em>before it has a reasonable chance to succeed. We can find no fault with that proposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b720-9\">According to the addresses of record, East Oakland is the home of the grandmother with whom appellant lived, as well as his father and other grandmother.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b720-10\">The court itself first proposed the idea of a \u201cstayed\u201d Youth Authority commitment:</p>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">\u201cThe Court Officer: .... We\u2019d ask that\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b720-12\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Williams\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b720-13\">\u201cThe Court Officer: \u2014he be continued to be a ward of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-14\">\u201cThe Court: \u2014I think Y.A. stayed with placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-15\">\u201cThe Court Officer: Pardon?</p>\n<p id=\"b720-16\">\u201cThe Court: Y.A. stayed and then placement so we have some\u2014I mean, if he screws up in placement, then he goes to the Youth Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-17\">\u201cWhat do you think?</p>\n<p id=\"b720-18\">\u201cThe reason I interrupted is because we\u2019re about where you say that part; or do you want it just to be placement?</p>\n<p id=\"b720-19\">\u201cWhat do you feel more comfortable with?</p>\n<p id=\"b720-20\">\u201cThe Court Officer: Probably placement with a CYA suspended. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Suspended?</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">\u201cThe Court Ofhcer: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. That\u2019s fine. Go ahead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">After the court made its dispositional order, it stated to the minor, \u201cI\u2019m suspending Youth Authority, so if you get in any further trouble, you\u2019re going to the Youth Authority.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b721-11\">\u201cMs. Hayes: ... I would call the court\u2019s attention to a statement made to minor on July 16th when CYA was suspended and your honor indicated to the young man \u2018any screw up or if you run, CYA is certain.\u2019 And the young man ran.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-12\">\u201cI would say that under those circumstances, even if he\u2019d only been at his placement for several weeks, he did in fact run, he did in fact screw up, and he should in fact go to the Youth Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-13\">\u201cThe Court: That\u2019s pretty persuasive. Do you want to answer that, Mr. Norman?</p>\n<p id=\"b721-14\">\u201cMr. Norman: Your honor, insofar as the minor . . . was only in placement for a relatively short period of time, they have not had an opportunity to assess whether or not he can conform his behavior and benefit from the placement there.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-15\">\u201cThe Court: It\u2019s not their fault. I told him that if he ran, he\u2019s going to go to the Youth Authority. So he\u2019s going to the Youth Authority. That\u2019s just the way it works. [J] The previous order is set aside with the exception of wardship and any financial orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-16\">tt</p>\n<p id=\"b721-17\">\u201cThe Court: gone.\u201d It\u2019s your own choice, Ronnie; sorry. I told you if you run, you\u2019re</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b722-7\">In fact the court never told appellant \u201cthat if he ran, [he was] going to the Youth Authority.\u201d It made no reference to running away. The statements were that \u201cif he <em>screws up </em>in placement, then he goes to the Youth Authority,\u201d and, as stated to appellant, \u201cif you <em>get in any further trouble, </em>you\u2019re going to the Youth Authority.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b723-7\">This court has previously commented upon the inappropriateness of \u201cprobation\u201d terminology in juvenile statutes and cases. <em>(In re Bernardino S., supra, </em>4 Cal.App.4th at p. 622, fn. 5 [\u201csomewhat misleading\u201d]; see 1 Cal. Juvenile Court Practice, <em>supra </em>(Supp. 1991) \u00a7 11.41, p. 189 [statutory language \u201creflects a misunderstanding of the nature of juvenile disposition orders\u201d].) A better term might be \u201cconduct orders\u201d or \u201cconduct terms.\u201d This would focus on the nature of the order without importing unwanted resonances from criminal law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Of course, the threat of Youth Authority commitment may have a salutary effect on a particular minor\u2019s attitude, and nothing said here should be understood to restrict the court\u2019s ability to employ such a threat to encourage the minor\u2019s reform. Further, a minor\u2019s failure to heed such a warning may be taken as some evidence of resistance to rehabilitation. Aside from these purposes and effects, however, such a warning can have no legal bearing on a subsequent dispositional proceeding. Certainly it cannot operate to foreclose the imposition or continuation of a less restrictive placement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b724-13\">Appellant contends that the record lacks the required recital that the court had read the social study. (\u00a7 706; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1492(b).) Such a recital is made, or rather the appropriate box is checked, on the form dispositional order. Whether the court took any note of the contents of the report is another matter. At the hearing, the deputy district attorney asked the court whether the report recommended \u201ca CYA commitment stayed,\u201d to which the court replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d In fact that <em>was </em>the recommendation: \u201cplacement with a stayed Youth Authority commitment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b725-9\">For these purposes it is important to distinguish between a tribunal\u2019s failure to address and resolve a issue, and its failure to expressly recite its determination on that issue. (See <em>In re Jose R. </em>(1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 55, 61 [195 Cal.Rptr. 633] [failure to state finding as to probable benefit of Youth Authority commitment was harmless error].) Here the court did not merely fail to state a finding, but apparently failed to address or resolve the governing issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
