Code, \u00a7\u00a7 664/187). The jury also found Moore guilty of second degree robbery with the personal use of a firearm (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 211 &amp; 12022.5) and found Webb had personally used a firearm and inflicted great bodily injury in the commission of the offense (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 12022.5 &amp; 12022.7). Both defendants waived jury as to allegations that Moore had suffered two prior serious felony convictions and that Webb had suffered one. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667, subd. (a).) The court found the allegations true.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-5\">We affirm the judgments and deny Moore\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus. In the unpublished portion of this opinion we deal with appellants\u2019 contentions on appeal that the evidence was insufficient, that the trial court improperly admitted evidence regarding gang practices, and that the trial court committed instructional error; we also address therein Moore\u2019s habeas corpus contention that he was denied effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-6\">In the published portion of this opinion we determine that a felony battery committed by means of \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 243, subd. (d)) may be used to enhance a sentence under the \u201cserious felony\u201d provisions of Penal Code sections 667, subdivision (a), because the term \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d is essentially equivalent to and synonymous with the term \u201cgreat bodily injury,\u201d as required by Penal Code section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-7\">Statement of Facts<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1362-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-9\">I-IV*</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-10\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-11\">Moore urges that the trial court erred in enhancing his sentence by five years pursuant to the prior serious felony provisions of Penal Code section 667. He contends that his prior conviction for battery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 243, subd. (d)) does not come within the purview of section 667. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1871\">*1871</page-number>Subdivision (d) of section 667 defines a serious felony for enhancement purposes as a felony listed in Penal Code section 1192.7, subdivision (c). Although felony battery is not one of the numerous offenses specified in the catalog of serious felonies in Penal Code section 1192.7, subdivision (c), the offense comes under the statute\u2019s general category of \u201cany other felony in which the defendant personally inflicts great bodily injury on any person, other than an accomplice, or any felony in which the defendant personally uses a firearm.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)(8).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-5\">A felony battery, of which Moore had been previously convicted, is defined as an offense in which \u201cserious bodily injury is inflicted on the person.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 243, subd. (d).) Our Supreme Court has held that the term \u201cserious bodily injury,\u201d as intended in section 243, subdivision (d), is \u201cessentially equivalent\u201d with the element of \u201cgreat bodily injury\u201d presented in other criminal statutes. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burroughs </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 824, 831 [201 Cal.Rptr. 319, 678 P.2d 894]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Villarreal </em>(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1140-1141 [219 Cal.Rptr. 371].) Other courts, in comparing the \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d element of felony battery to the \u201cgreat bodily injury\u201d requirement of another enhancement statute (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.7), have held that the two terms are \u201csubstantially similar\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kent </em>(1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 130, 137 [158 Cal.Rptr. 35]) and \u201cessentially equivalent\u201d (P<em>eople </em>v. <em>Corning </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 83, 90 [194 Cal.Rptr. 27]). Nothing indicates the Legislature intended that these two terms should have separate and distinct meanings with regard to a \u201cserious felony\u201d sentence enhancement, and we perceive no reason to make any distinction between the two terms. We therefore find that the element of \u201cserious bodily injury,\u201d as required for felony battery, is essentially equivalent to or synonymous with \u201cgreat bodily injury\u201d for the purpose of a \u201cserious felony\u201d sentence enhancement pursuant to Penal Code sections 667, subdivisions (a) and (d), and 1192.7, subdivision (c)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-6\">In the present case, the trial court took judicial notice of and examined the entire superior court file in the prior battery case and observed, in part, that Moore was the only defendant charged in that case and was the sole perpetrator of the crime. The court properly went behind the minimum elements of the offense and considered the entire record of the conviction in determining the validity of the prior serious felony conviction allegation. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Guerrero </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 343, 348-356 [243 Cal.Rptr. 688, 748 P.2d 1150].) In determining that Moore was the only defendant charged in the prior battery offense, the court necessarily determined that Moore \u201cpersonally\u201d inflicted the great bodily injury and that he did so on a person \u201cother than an accomplice,\u201d as required by the defining language in Penal Code section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(8). Accordingly, the court properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1872\">*1872</page-number>imposed a five-year enhancement for the prior serious felony conviction (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667, subd. (a)) of battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-5\">The judgments are affirmed, and Moore\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-6\">Turner, P. J., and Grignon, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-7\">Appellants\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied March 10, 1993.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1362-12\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1868.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
