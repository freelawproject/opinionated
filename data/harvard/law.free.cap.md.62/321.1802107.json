Talbott Denmead accepted said trust, gave bond, and upon his petition filed the 22nd of May, 1868, the Circuit Court of Baltimore City assumed jurisdiction of the same. Talbott Denmead, the trustee named in said deed, departed this life on the 21th of March, 1816, and upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>report and petition of Lis executors, and tLe recommendation of Edward Denmead, and Henrietta M.

TLe decree appointing Lim trustee, allowed Lim seven and a Lalf per cent, commissions upon all Lis receipts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-5\">Erancis Denmead, tLe new trustee, immediately entered upon tLe discLarge of Lis duties, made reports of Lis proceedings to tLe Court, and made investments of tLe principal of said estate as safe and profitaLle securities presented tLemselves. In tLe meantime Le allowed six per cent, interest on all Lalances of principal remaining in Lis Lands uninvested; and Leing desirous to retire from Lis trust, and preparatory to an application to t-Lat end, on tLe 31st of May, 1883, Le filed Lis petition and report, witL detailed statements of Lis receipts and disLursements, sLowing Lis management of said estate from tLe time of filing Lis previous accounts to tLe said 31st of May, 1883, and accompanied tLe same witL a list of tLe property Lelonging to said trust estate.

Testimony was taken, and on the 15th of September, 1883, the cause was argued, and on the same day orders were passed sustaining the exceptions to the allowance of the commissions. From these orders the trustee appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b347-5\">The cause was argued before Alvey, C. J., Yellott, Miller, Ritchie, and Bryan, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b347-6\"><em>Frank Gosnell, </em>and <em>Bradley T.

The auditor\u2019s accounts, filed June 6th, 1883, allowed him such commissions, but the appellee excepted to the allowances, and these exceptions were sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">The appellant had an absolute right to these commissions by the terms of the decree, subject to be forfeited for causes which do not exist in this case. He had waived them in the accounts which had been stated previously to those in question. But this waiver was entirely a voluntary matter on his part. We find in the record no evidence which establishes a contract that he should relinquish them; and we do not wish to be understood as intimating that such a contract could be enforced in the face of the decree, by objections to the auditor\u2019s account. It is not necessary to decide this question. In the \u25a0 opinion of the learned Judge of the Circuit Court, the appellant was equitably estopped to claim these commissions by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>effect of the recommendation of certain persons, including the appellee,' that the appellant should he appointed trustee to sell the property mentioned in the case of <em>Denmead vs. </em>Denmead, instituted in November, 1881; and by the decree of the Court making the appointment in accordance with the recommendation. This latter case originated, it will be seen, many years after the appellant\u2019s appointment in the present case. The recommendation states, among other things, that the persons who signed it have always understood, and do believe that Francis Denmead, (this appellant), while trustee for Jane Broadbent and Edward Denmead, has never received one dollar for his services as such ;\u2022 that the commissions, whenever allowed .him, were passed over to said <em>cestuis que trust, </em>because of their needy .circumstances, and that the management of said trusts have been gratuitous on his part, from beginning to end.' \u2019And the decree-of the Court appointed Francis Denmead trustee to make the sale. The recommendation states a number of reasons for this appointment; such as: that the proposed trustee was the representative of all the interests in the property except those held by three of the signers of the recommendation; that he was in possession Of the property and thoroughly conversant with it; and that he was an eminently suitable and proper person for the trust. It sets forth, as a circumstance which ought to entitle him to the favorable consideration of the Court, the benevolence which he had shown in bestowing commissions previously earned on the necessitous <em>cestuis que trust. ' </em>The praise thus given to him was justly bestowed, and no doubt had its influence with the Court. But'his bounty was entirely voluntary; and it by no means followed that, because he had given away commissions in the past, he was obliged to continue to do so in the future. He was still free to do as he chose with his own. His acceptance of the trusteeship could not be an equitable renunciation of commissions, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>might thereafter he allowed, unless it could he construed to be a contract with the Court to this effect. Trustees are appointed because of their fitness to perform their duties, and the commissions are the legitimate compensation for their services. It would he unprecedented and improper for the Court to exact from a trustee, as the condition of his appointment, a promise to make a pecuniary sacrifice. We certainly do not believe that such a thing was intended by the Court.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AeO\">(Decided 18th June, 1884.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">It has been argued that the appellant was delinquent in keeping a large sum of money uninvested, which belonged to the trust estate. But he regularly paid the estate six per cent, interest on the amount, and no safe investments could he made which would yield so much. The money was most abundantly secure in the appellant\u2019s hands, and the circumstances of the case satisfy us that he was acting from an honest purpose to promote the best interests of the <em>cestuis que trust, </em>and with no view whatever to his own advantage. The orders sustaining the exceptions must be reversed, and the auditor\u2019s accounts filed June 6th, 1883, must he ratified and confirmed in their entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\"><em>Orders reversed, and the auditor\u2019s accounts filed June 6th, </em>1883, <em>ratified and confirmed, and cause remanded; the costs to be paid out of the fund in Court.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
