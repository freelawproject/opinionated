And this depends upon whether they constituted <em>part of the machinery actually used by it in the manufacture of gas </em>?\u2014 the language of the ordinance, being \u201cany machinery, \u2022etc., actually employed and used in the business of manufacturing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">The process of manufacturing gas is, according to the testimony, as follows : The coal is put in air-tight <em>retorts </em>and heated to a temperature sufficient to drive off the volatile matter, which, in fact, contains everything to be found in illuminating gas, the <em>residuum </em>in the retort being coke. This <em>volatile matter </em>or <em>gas </em>then passes into a <em>condenser </em>of a lower temperature, to free it from the tar which is present with the gas; \u2014 it then goes into what is called a <em>\u25a0scrubber, </em>by which the ammonia is washed out in the form of ammoniacal liquor; thence it. is drawn by an <em>exhauster, </em>driven by a steam engine, through <em>purifiers </em>over slacked lime, and thus freed of all impurities. It then passes through the <em>station metres </em>for the purpose of ascertaining the quantity produced; thence to the <em>gasometer </em>and then through the <em>mains </em>or <em>service pipes </em>to the house of the -consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\"><em>The gasometer </em>is a huge, air-tight reservoir for the stor\u2022age of the gas thus produced, and the' pressure which is necessary to force the gas through the mains to the consumer. The pressure is generated by the <em>exhauster, </em>which forces the gas through the purifiers into the gasometer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>The gasometer being automatic, it rises or falls according to the supply and consumption of gas, the pressure which is communicated to it by the exhauster being regulated and modified by what is called a <em>governor </em>inside of the gasometer.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The gas when it passes into the gasometer is ready for illumination, and all that is required to make it available for use, is pressure sufficient to force it through the mains \u25a0and pipes to the house of the consumer, then coming into \u25a0contact'with the oxygen in the air, it becomes when lighted, \u25a0an illuminating gas. This pressure is furnished, as we have said, by the <em>exhauster, </em>communicated to the gasometer -and regulated according to the supply and consumption by the <em>governor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">If this he so, then it is clear the gasometer performs no function whatever in the manufacture of the gas itself. It is used merely for the storage of the gas, and the pressure necessary for its distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">We do not understand the decision in <em>Commonwealth vs. Lowell Gas Light Co., </em>12 <em>Allen, </em>75, to be in conflict with this view. The statute in that case provided, that whenever the market value of all the shares of the capital stock of a corporation, shall exceed the value of its Teal estate and machinery, as returned by the assessors, \u25a0such excess in value shall he liable to taxation. The question was whether the commissioners appointed to \u25a0ascertain and fix the value of the capital stock, and to \u25a0deduct therefrom, the real estate and machinery of a gas company, ought to have included in the valuation of the latter, the gasometer and mains, belonging to the company, and the Court decided, in that <em>sense, </em>and for that purpose, that is, for the purpose of ascertaining the value \u25a0of its real estate and machinery, the gasometer and mains must be considered as part of the machinery. Whether umachinery\u201d as used in its broadest and most comprehensive sense includes a <em>gasometer, </em>it is unnecessary to decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>in <em>this </em>case. Be that as it may, it is not part of the <em>machinery actually used </em>and <em>employed </em>in the <em>manufacture of the gas.</em></p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AC8\">(Decided 19th December, 1884.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Eor the same reasons the mains are not part of the manufacturing plant which is exempted hy the city ordinance from taxation. They are merely pipes used for the purpose of distributing the gas and pressure to the point of illumination.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The question as to the power of the Legislature to authorize the city authorities to pass an ordinance <em>exempting the manufacturing plant </em>from taxation, was not argued in this case, and we are not to be understood as expressing any opinion in regard to this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">For these reasons the decree will he affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
