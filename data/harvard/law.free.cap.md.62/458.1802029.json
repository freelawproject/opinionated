Cunningham, a married woman, by her husband, as next friend, against John Emig, Jr., and Lewis H. Robinson, to recover certain goods and chattels, being the sole and separate property of the plaintiff Susan, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>had been taken by the defendants for rent due the defendant John, by the husband of the plaintiff Susan. The defendants filed an avowry to the <em>narr., </em>claiming that the plaintiff Susan, was indebted to the avowant Emig, in the sum of $462.50, upon a demise by him to her of a certain dwelling-house in the City of Baltimore. After-wards, the death of the defendant Emig was suggested, and his administrators were made parties. Five pleas were filed to the avowry, the third of which only, was finally relied upon by the plaintiffs. The third plea alleged that the \u201csaid John Emig, Jr., did not demise the premises in which, &amp;c., to the plaintiff Susan E. Cunningham, as alleged in said avowry and cognizance, but did demise the same to her said husband Thomas A. Cunningham, and that the rent on said demise was due and owing by her said husband, and not by the said Susan, and that the goods and chattels aforesaid, taken in the place where, &lt;fcc., were the sole and separate property of the plaintiff Susan E. Cunningham, at and before the taking thereof by the defendants, and as such were exempted from said distress.\u201d To this third plea the defendants demurred. The case was submitted to the Court without the intervention of a jury. The Court, (Brown, C. J.,) overruled the demurrer, and rendered judgment for the plaintiffs for the property replevied, and verdict and judgment for the plaintiffs for one cent damages, with interest from date, and costs. From this judgment the defendants appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-5\">The cause was argued befor Alvey, C.

Under the operation of this principle, cases of grievous hardship frequently occurred, and it appeared wise to the law-making power to change it. In this State, a series of alterations were made in the law which finally culminated in the provision made in the Constitution of 1867.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">By the 43rd section, of the third Article, of that instrument, it is declared that the property of the wife shall be protected from the debts of the husband. Her property was secured from her husband\u2019s creditors, as \u2022 fully as if she had remained unmarried. But it is obvious that none of the enactments on the subject of the property of married women, were intended to have any reference to the law of distress for rent, or to interfere in any way with the relations of landlord and. tenant. The landlord has the right to distrain for rent due any goods and chattels on the demised premises, except such as are specially exempted by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">The liability to distraint .arises from the fact that they are found on the premises, and not from the ownership. The goods of a stranger are liable equally with those of the tenant. This right is an ancient privilege of the common law, which had its origin in the feudal tenures. Lord Coke informs us that it was an inseparable incident of the seigniory. It is a remedy which is confined to the land out of which the rent issues, and does not follow the person of the tenant. The tenant, it is true, owes the rent; but the remedy is enforced against the land and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>against him; his personal liability is not regarded, and the proceeding is conducted as if the land were the debtor.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"Aci\">(Decided 19th June, 1884.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Distresses seem to have originated from two more ancient remedies of the common law. By the process of <em>gavelet </em>and <em>cessavit </em>the landlord could seize the land itself for rent in arrear, and hold it until payment was made. These processes have been obsolete for ages, and exist only in the memory of legal antiquaries. When they fell into disuse, distresses appear to have arisen, whereby instead of seizing the land, the lord seized all the movables upon the land, and held them until he received payment. In process of time, he was authorized by statute to make sale of them, and in this way we have the modern distraint. As it is not an execution for debt, the goods of the tenant have never been held to be protected by any of the exemption laws which put the property of a debtor beyond the reach of his creditors. In the present case, if the goods of the wife had been on the premises of any other tenant who was in arrear for rent, they would have been liable to distraint. Or, if she had been an unmarried woman, they could have been seized for the rent involved in this case. We are unable to think that the Constitution intended to give greater immunity to a married woman\u2019s property than was extended to it before marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The question of exemption from distress was distinctly presented in this case by a plea, which the learned Judge sustained on demurrer. Erom what we have said it will appear that the demurrer ought to have been ruled good.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\"><em>Judgment </em>reversed,\u25a0 <em>and cause remanded.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">Stone, J., dissented.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
