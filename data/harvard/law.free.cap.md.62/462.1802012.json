These lots lay between Decker street on the east, and an alley three feet wide on the west, and each lot had a building thereon that covered the entire front. The lots may be designated as the western, central and eastern lots. The back alley at the foot of the lots was fenced on each side, and was used in common by the occupants of all three of the houses for many years, and was the only way of ingress and egress to and from the back yard of the middle tenement, except by or through the front door of the house. There had been for many years at or near the end of the middle lot a water closet or privy, which was used in common by the occupants of the three houses, they having access thereto by means of this alley; and it was only by means of this alley that the privy could be cleaned, unless the contents were taken through the western premises, or through the front door of the middle house. There was also a hydrant on the line dividing the middle from the eastern lot, and the waste water from that hydrant escaped from the back yard of the middle lot to the alley, and by the alley to Deckor street; and without such drainage there would be no escape for the water from that tenemant. In 1859, McN. sold the lots to S., who in 1865, sold them to 0., who paid the purchase money therefor. But there being some difficulty in getting possession of the western and middle lots from the tenants then occupying them, O. took the legal assignment only of the eastern lot, without any reservation whatever for the benefit of the other lots; and in order to get his money back he assisted or co-operated with S. in making sale in 1866, of the westernHot to Mel., and of the middle lot to G.; and upon such sales being made he was reimbursed the money that he had paid S. for these two lots. At the time of the sale of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>lots to G. and Mcl. and long previous thereto, the alley and the drain were in existence, open and apparent, and in constant use. In 1867, O. sold and assigned the eastern lot to B. and they used and allowed the occupants of the middle lot to use the alley and drain as formerly. The deed from C. to B. conveyed the lot and premises by metes and bounds, and made no express reservation whatever for the benefit of the other lots. In October, 1882, B. stopped up and completely obstructed the use of the back alley both as a way and as a drain, thereby depriving the occupants of the middle lot of the use of what they claimed to be a necessary easement to the beneficial enjoyment of their premises. In a suit by the owners of the middle lot against the owners of the eastern lot, to determine the question of the right of the former to the use of the alley, it was Held :</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b487-5\">1st. That the right to the use of the alley, as it had been formerly used, was conceded and confirmed to G., the assignee of the leasehold estate in the central lot, by implied grant, or rather by way of estoppel upon the special facts of the case.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b487-6\">2nd. That C., the equitable vendor of the middle lot to G. was bound and concluded in respect to the easement over the eastern lot retained by 0.; and the defendants claiming and holding that lot under him, with notice, were equally bound with him. They were bound to allow, as he would be bound to allow, the use of the alley as it was used at the time of the sale of the lot to G., under whom the plaintiffs claimed; and being so bound, their obstruction of the alley was illegal.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b487-7\">No easement or <em>quasi </em>easement can be taken as reserved by implication, unless it be <em>de facto </em>annexed and in use at the time of the grant, and it be shown, moreover, to be actually necessary to the enjoyment of the estate or parcel retained by the grantor. And such necessity cannot be deemed to exist if a similar way or easement may be secured by reasonable trouble and expense, and especially not if the necessary way or easement can be provided through the grantor\u2019s own property.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b487-8\">In order to give rise to the presumption of a reservation of an existing easement or <em>quasi </em>easement, where the deed is silent upon the subject, the necessity must be of such strict nature as to leave no room for doubt of the intention of the parties that the adjoining-properties should continue to be used and enjoyed, in respect to existing easements or <em>quasi </em>easements, as before the severance of ownership, for otherwise parties would never know the real purport of their deeds.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>If the grantor intends to reserve any right or easement over the property granted, it should be done by express terms, and not after-wards require a plain grant, it may be for full consideration, to be limited and cut down by any mere implied reservation of privileges over the property granted. It is only in cases of the strictest necessity, and where it would not be reasonable to suppose that the parties intended the contrary, that the principle of implied reservation can be invoked.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b488-5\">Appeal from the Superior Court of Baltimore City.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-6\">This was an amicable suit brought by the appellees against the appellants for the purpose of determining the question of the right of the former to the use of an alley in the rear of their premises, as a way and as a drain. The case is stated in the opinion of the Court.

A house in the city of Baltimore, which has no access to the yard save through the parlor and front door of the house, which has no drainage of any kind, where water must collect and stagnate unless carried away in buckets, where the sink must he cleaned through the parlor, is practically uninhabitable. It could neither he decently lived in, nor sold or mortgaged, at anything approximating its legitimate value. The alley is absolutely necessary for drainage, and strictly necessary, in the rational sense, for all the other purposes connected with the yard, kitchen and sink of a dwelling. <em>Lawton vs. Rivers, </em>2 McCord, 448; <em>Goodall vs. Godfray, </em>53 <em>Vt., </em>222-3; <em>Morris vs. Edgington, </em>3 <em>Taunt., </em>31; <em>Watts vs. Kelson, L.

At this time Coffay remained owner of the servient estate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>and in the grant to Gallagher impliedly <em>granted </em>all apparent and continuous easements, which were at the time reasonably necessary to a fair use of the property granted. There is nothing in the case of <em>Oliver vs. Hook, </em>47 <em>Md., </em>301, opposed to this view, as that case had reference only to an ordinary, open and unenclosed way, (page 309,) and ordinary ways of that character are not regarded as continuous.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Agb\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">This case was tried in the Court helow before the Judge without the assistance of a jury; and the finding of the Judge upon the evidence was for the plaintiffs. The finding is general, without the enumeration of the facts found to be established by the evidence ; and this Court, of course, has no power to review the finding of the Court helow upon the evidence, farther than to determine, upon prayer raising such question, whether there be evidence <em>legally </em>sufficient to be considered. The plaintiffs propounded no legal proposition for the determination of the Court; and the first four prayers offered by the defendants, and which were rejected, were simply to the effect that there was no evidence <em>legally </em>sufficient upon which the plaintiffs could recover; and the fifth prayer of the defendants was based upon what is contended to be the necessary legal conclusion, that upon the conveyances or assignments of title given in evidence, the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover. This prayer was also rejected by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">It is contended for the plaintiffs that their right to recover may be sustained either by an <em>implied reservation </em>of a right to the easement claimed, or by <em>implied grant </em>thereof; but upon which ground the finding and judgment of the Court proceeded does not appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>The undisputed facts would appear to be these : Thomas McNally was possessed, in 1858 or 1859, by virtue of subleases, of three adjoining lots fronting each twelve feet on the north side of Eager street, in the city of Baltimore, and running back for depth sixty feet to an alley two feet two or three inches wide. These adjoining lots lie between Decker street on the east and an alley three feet wide on the west, and each lot has a building thereon that covers the entire front. The lots may be designated as the western, the central, and the eastern <em>lots; </em>that to the west belonging to McIntyre, the central or middle lot to the plaintiffs, and the eastern lot, bounding on Decker street, to the defendants. The back alley at the foot of the lots ran from Decker street to and intersected the three foot alley on the west, which runs out to Eager street. This back alley was fenced on each side, and was used in common by the occupants of all three of the houses or tenements for many years, and was the only way of ingress and egress, to and from the back yard of the middle tenement, except by or through the front door of the house. There has been for many years, at or near the end of this middle lot a water-closet or privy, which has been, until within a few years past, used in common by the occupants of the three houses, they having access thereto by means of this alley; and it is only by means of this alley that this privy can be cleaned, unless the contents be taken through the premises of- McIntyre, or through the front door of the plaintiffs\u2019 house. There is also a hydrant on the line dividing the middle from the eastern lot, and the waste water from that hydrant escapes from the back yard of the middle lot to the alley, and by the alley to Decker street; and without such drainage there would be no escape for the water from that tenement. The defendants have stopped up and completely obstructed the use of this alley, both as a way and as a drain, and thereby deprived the plaintiffs of the use of what they claim to be a neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>sary easement to the beneficial enjoyment of their premises ; and the defendants claim the right to close the alley over their lot by virtue of an-unqualified title to the lot in themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The titles to the respective lots were acquired by the present owners thus: In 1859, McNally, who owned the leasehold estate in all three of the lots or tenements, sold and assigned them to Levi Sanders; and the latter, in 1865, by a written contract, sold the three lots to Thomas Coffay, who duly paid the purchase money therefor. But there being some difficulty in getting possession of the western and middle lots from the tenants then occupying them, Coffay took the legal assignment only of the eastern lot, being that now owned by the defendants, without any reservation whatever for the benefit of the other lots; and in order to get his money back, he assisted or co-operated with Sanders in making sale of the other two lots, \u2014 the middle or central lot to Arthur Gallagher, under whom the plaintiffs claim, and the westerly lot to McIntyre. \u2014 and upon such sales being made, he was reimbursed the money that he had paid to Sanders for these two lots. These lots were sold to Gallagher and Mclnytre in 1866, and the deeds of assignments were made in that year, Coffay remaining owner of and holding the title to the easterly lot, that is now owned by the defendants. At that time, and long previous thereto, the alley and the drain were in existence, open and apparent, and in constant use ; and they have so remained open and apparent, and in constant use, until October, 1882, when the alley was closed, and the drain obstructed, by the defendants, as before stated. In September, 1867, Coffay sold and assigned the easterly lot, binding on Decker street, to the defendants; and they used, and allowed the plaintiffs to use as formerly, the alley and drain to the time of the obstruction just stated. The deed of assignment from Coffay to the defendants conveys the lot and premises by metes and bounds, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>makes no express reservation whatever in respect to the \u25a0easement now claimed hy the plaintiffs. But notwithstanding the absence of all reservation by express terms in the deed of assignment, the question is, whether the \u25a0defendants took their lot subject to the long existing, open \u2022and apparent <em>quasi </em>easement or servitude, for the benefit of the adjoining lot previously purchased by the party under whom the plaintiffs claim ? If not, the judgment \u25a0of the Court below should have been for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Now, if we regard Sanders as remaining the owner of the westerly and central lots, after the deed of assignment to Coffay of the easterly lot, as the defendants contend he was in legal contemplation, there would seem to be great \u25a0difficulty in concluding that there was any implied reservavation of the use of the alley and the drain to Decker street, for the benefit of the central lot. Being owner of the western lot, binding on the three foot alley, he could provide a way \u2022and a drain over that lot to the three foot alley for the benefit of the central lot, and thus relieve the easterly lot from the burden of maintaining the alley and drain to Decker street, as a servient tenement to the plaintiffs\u2019 lot. And that being reasonably possible, there would be no implied reservation of an existing easement or servitude through the lot granted for the benefit of an adjoining lot retained by the grantor. Eor the principle is well \u2022settled, and it is founded' in reason and good sense, that no easement or <em>quasi </em>easement can be taken as reserved by implication, unless it be <em>de facto </em>annexed and in use at the time of the grant, and it be shown moreover to be <em>\u25a0actually necessary </em>to the enjoyment of the estate or parcel retained by the grantor. And such necessity cannot be deemed to exist if a similar way or easement may be secured by reasonable trouble and expense, and especially not if the necessary way or easement can be provided through the grantor\u2019s own property. In order to give rise to the presumption of a reservation of an existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>easement or <em>quasi </em>easement, where the deed is silent upon the subject, the necessity must be of such strict nature as to leave no room for doubt of the intention of the parties that the adjoining properties should continue to he used and enjoyed, in respect to existing easements or <em>quasi </em>easements, as before the severance of ownership; for otherwise parties would never know the real purport of their deeds. If the grantor intends, to reserve any right or easement over the property granted, it should he done by express terms, and not after-wards require a plain grant, it may be for full consideration, to he limited and cut down by any mere implied reservation of privileges over the property granted. It is. only in cases of the strictest necessity, and where it would not be reasonable to suppose that the parties intended the contrary, that the principle of <em>implied reservation </em>can he invoked. <em>Mitchell vs. Seipel, </em>53 <em>Md., </em>251; <em>Wheeldon vs. Burrows, </em>12 <em>Ch. Div., </em>31; <em>Johnson vs. Jordan, 2 Metc., </em>234; <em>Carbrey vs. Willis, </em>7 <em>Allen, </em>364; <em>Randall vs. McLaughlin, </em>10 <em>Allen, </em>366. Whether the learned Judge below found, as matter of fact on the evidence before him, the existence of such necessity for the use of the alley,, does not appear, and we cannot infer that he did so find.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">But notwithstanding the right to the easement claimed may not be supported upon the principle of implied reservation, yet we think, upon the evidence before him, the learned Judge was well justified in concluding that the right to the use of the alley, as it had been formerly used, was conceded and confirmed to Gallagher, the assignee of the leasehold estate in the central lot, by implied grant, or rather by way of estoppel upon the special facts of the case. At the time of the assignment to Gallagher, in 1866, Coffay was in fact'and reality the owner of all three-lots, and remained the owner of the defendants\u2019 lot until 1867, and, of course, was able and competent to grant or impose upon the latter lot any easement or servitude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>that he might think proper. He had purchased and paid for all three of the lots, under written contract, and it was for his benefit that the middle and westerly lots were sold and transferred to Gallagher and McIntyre, as thereby he was repaid his purchase money. We may suppose these purchasers were induced to buy and pay for the lots, as doubtless they were, because of the existence of the apparent easements and privileges annexed to them: and in order to ascertain what passed to the purchasers under the assignments of the leases, regard must be had to the state of the premises, and the manner of their enjoyment, at the time the assignments were made. The general principle of law is, that where a person makes a grant or conveyance of property he impliedly grants that also which is necessary to make the grant or conveyance of the principal subject effectual and beneficial; and in this case we must suppose that it was the intention, as doubtless it was the expectation, of the parties, that the premises sold and transferred to Gallagher should be used and enjoyed with'the same easements and privileges with which they had previously been used and were then enjoyed. And Coffay being then the owner of the easterly lot, through which the alley ran to Decker street, and being a party to the sale of the middle or central lot to Gallagher, beneficially interested therein, he would be estopped to deny or question the right of the occupants of the latter lot to use the alley as it was then and had been formerly used, through the adjoining lot on the east. He would not he allowed to obstruct the use of the alley; and those claiming under and taking title from him, with notice of the existence, and the nature and extent of the use of the alley, by the occupants of the central lot, can stand in no better position than Coffay himself. Sanders, it is true, executed the legal transfer of title to Gallagher, hut it was done by and with the consent and for the benefit of Coffay; and he should be as much concluded thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>as if he had been a formal party thereto. And that being so, by analogy to the well settled principle that all apparent easements or <em>quasi </em>easements which are <em>necessary </em>to the reasonable enjoyment of the premises granted, and which have been, and are at the time of the grant, used, or allowed to be used, by the owner of the entirety for the benefit of the part granted, will pass to the grantee by implication, Ooffay, the equitable vendor, was bound and concluded in respect to the easement over the eastern lot retained by him; and the defendants claiming and holding that lot under Ooffay, with notice, are equally bound as Ooffay himself. They are bound to allow, as Ooffay would be bound to allow, the use of the alley as it was used at the time of the sale of the lot to Gallagher, under whom the plaintiffs claim. And being so bound, their obstruction of the alley was illegal. Eor the doctrine of <em>implied grant </em>of easements or <em>quasi </em>easements, applied in this case by analogy, and given operation by way of estoppel, we need only refer to the cases of <em>Janes vs. Jenkins, </em>34 <em>Md., </em>1; <em>Mitchell vs. Seipel, </em>53 <em>Md., </em>251; <em>Wheeldon vs. Burrows, </em>12 <em>Ch. Div., </em>31; and <em>Hall vs. Lund, </em>1 <em>Hurl. &amp; Colt., </em>676.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AHV\">(Decided 2nd July, 1884.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Entertaining these views we shall affirm the judgment of the Court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
