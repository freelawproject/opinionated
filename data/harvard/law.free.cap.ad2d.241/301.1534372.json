The record established that the identification procedure, using a book of photographs, was not suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Defendant\u2019s claim concerning preservation of the original photograph page viewed by the complainant is unpreserved and without merit, since production of the photographs was not essential to a determination of suggestiveness under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">We have considered defendant\u2019s remaining contentions and find them to be without merit.
