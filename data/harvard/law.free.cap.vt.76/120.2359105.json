S. 499; National Bank Act &amp; Its Meaning (by Bolles) \u00a7 428; Gluck &amp; Becker on Receivers, 239.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-5\">The receiver may sue for demands due the bank, either in his own name as receiver, or in the name of the bank. <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>17 Wall. 19; <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>8 Wall. 198; <em>Stanton </em>v. <em>Wilkeson, </em>8 Bened. 357; <em>Bank of Bethel </em>v. <em>Fahquioque Bank, </em>14 Wall. 383; <em>Case </em>v. <em>Bovine, </em>22 La.

Not one case can be found that even hints that, a receiver of a national bank can not maintain a suit in his own name. It has been the custom in Vermont, as well as elsewhere in common law states, to bring suit in the federal* courts in the name of receivers of insolvent national banks. These suits have been brought for the collection of notes as w:ell as for stock assessments. There is no statute which authorizes bringing suits in the name of the receiver except for stock assessments, therefore all other suits must have stood on common law grounds. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>the title is not in tlie receiver lie conld no more sue in liis own name for the collection of a note in the federal courts than in the state courts.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b138-3\"><em>Joel C. Baker </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-4\">Title L,XII, of the Revised Statutes of the United States, constitutes statute law under which the national banks of this country are organized, perform their functions, and when insolvent, are wound up. When a national bank is insolvent the Comptroller takes charge. He appoints a receiver. Under his direction the receiver does all that the receiver is authorized to do, and must make his report to- the Comptroller. The powers of a receiver of a national bank are much more limited than those of an ordinary receiver. His duties are confined to' converting the property into cash, and the collection of the assets and placing them in the United States Treasury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-5\">It is well settled that in the case of a receiver appointed by a court of equity, the possession is the possession of the court. <em>In Re Higgins, </em>17 Fed. Rep. 443; <em>Bruce </em>v. <em>R. Co., </em>29-Fed: Rep. 345; <em>Hewitt </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>50 Me. 280; <em>Bilis </em>v. <em>R. Co., </em>107 Mass. 28; <em>Railroad </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>47 Vt. 789. The appointment of a receiver does not change the title to the property. <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>136 U. S. 236.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-6\">The receiver of a national bank has not title to the assets, but holds them in trust for creditors under the direction of the Comptroller. <em>Lease' </em>v. <em>Barschal, </em>106 Fed. Rep. <em>763; Scott </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>146 U. S. 507; <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>17 How. 527-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-7\">The settlement of the affairs of an insolvent bank is one proceeding from beginning to end, and as was said by <em>W\u2018\u2018heeler\u2019} </em>J., <em>In Re Slack, </em>3 Fed. Rep-. 525, in1 reference to the bankruptcy act, the assets are in the custody of the law, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>the bankrupt is seized in his own right, until the property has, gone out of the estate by sale by the trustee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-5\">It is a fundamental rule of the common law that an action at law can only be maintained on a legal title. <em>Lansing </em>v\u201e <em>M.amton, </em>14 Fed. Cas. No. 8077; <em>Hedd </em>v. <em>Warrm, </em>22 Vt. 413; Kerr on Receivers, 206, note 1.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-6\">Congress has no power over the remedy in the state courts. Congress can give a right of action, but when suit is brought in a state court, the state law governs as to the remedy.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b139-7\">Munson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Apz\">It is claimed in support of the demurrer that the receiver of a national bank cannot maintain an action at law in his own name in the courts \u00f3f this state; and <em>Murtey </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>71 Vt. 377, 45 Atl. 752, is one of the authorities cited. It was held in that case that the only remedies at law available in this state to a foreign receiver are those given him by the common law, and that his appointment does not confer the legal title essential to the maintenance of a suit at law. Without considering whether any other or different question can arise in this case because of federal supremacy, we pass at once to the inquiry whether the federal law gives to a receiver of this class the legal title to. the property covered by his appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">The arguments drawn by defendant\u2019s counsel from the general provisions relating to the receiver\u2019s duties are not very conclusive. The legal title may rest in the receiver, whatever the restrictions placed upon his independent action. The fact that he holds the property merely to work out the purposes of a certain trust does not indicate that the legal title is elsewhere. The duties of an ordinary trustee relate wholly to the rights of his beneficiaries, but he holds the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>title for the benefit of his trust. It is not claimed that this question is disposed of by any definite provision of the statute, and we must look to the decisions of the United Statds Supreme Court for whatever may have been said' by way of construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The general relation which the receiver sustains to the scheme of the statute is set forth in <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>8 Wall. 498, where it is said that the receiver is the instrument of the comptroller; that it is for the comptroller to decide when it is necessary to enforce the personal liability of the stockholders; that when the whole amount is sought to be recovered the proceeding must be at law; that the receiver is the statutory assignee of the association, and the proper party to institute all suits; that they may be brought both at law and in equity, in his name or in that of the association. The following cases may also be referred to as bearing upon some or all of these propositions. <em>Bank of Metropolis </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>84 U. S. 19; <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Irons, 121 </em>U. S. 56; <em>Witters </em>v. <em>Sowles, </em>61 Vt. 366, 18 Atl. 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">It is said in <em>Earl </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>178 U. S. 449, that the statute contemplates that all the assets of the suspended bank shall pass in the first instance to the receiver; but the connection is not such as <em>to </em>give the expression any special significance upon the quejstion of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">It was considered in <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>146 U. S. 507, that, the charter having been forfeited and the bank dissolved by decree of the Circuit Court, the title to the assets was necessarily thereby transferred to the receiver. This would seem to imply that no transfer of the title had been effected by the previous appointment of the receiver. In <em>Bank of Selma </em>v. <em>Colby, </em>88 U. S. 609, a case cited in the above opinion, there had also been a decree forfeiting the charter and dissolving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>the bank. Reference should be had in this connection to Bank <em>of Bethel </em>v. <em>Pahquioque Bank, </em>81 U. S. 383, where it is said' that the appointment of a receiver does not work a dissolution of the bank, but that it continues to- exist as a legal entity, and may sue and be sued in all cases where it is necessary that the-corporate name be used for the purpose of closing up its affairs. But whatev\u00e9r the expression in <em>Scott </em>v. Armstrong may be thought to indicate, it is to be noted that in <em>Bushnell </em>v. <em>Leland, </em>164 U. S. 683, decided in 1897, the case of <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Gibson </em>is referred to with the fullest approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-3\">Suits by national bank receivers to enforce the statutory liability of stockholders have been maintained without question in the state courts for many years. Some of these suits were in states where the procedure is in accordance with the rules of the common law, and the views expressed in the decisions of other states, afford support to the claim that the* receiver is vested with the legal title. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Weed, </em>44 Conn. 569; <em>Chicago Fire Proofing Co. </em>v. <em>Park National Bank, </em>145 Ill. 481; <em>Brinckerhoff </em>v. <em>Bostwick, </em>88 N. Y. 52; <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Witherby, </em>111 Cal. 523; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>11 Col. 536; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Schaetzel, </em>2 S. D. 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">We have not found' in our examination of the United\u2019 States cases any direct statement that the receiver has the legal title by virtue of his appointment. The plaintiff does not cite-us to any case which he claims to be in terms conclusive upon this matter; but he insists that when the language of the statute, the judicial comments upon it, and the course of procedure are considered, there is no escape from the conclusion that the receiver is regarded by the federal courts as possessed', of the legal title.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">We are disposed to consider the statement in <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>that the receiver is the statutory assignee of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>.association, a sufficient indication that he has the title required by our courts, notwithstanding the further statement that he has power to sue at law in the name of the association. Indeed, the designation of the receiver as a \u201cstatutory assignee,\u201d if the term is to be given its full significance, definitely classels \u25a0him1 with those receivers who1 have the legal title. The circuit courts of the United States have apparently taken this view \u25a0of the case. Stanton v. <em>Wilkeson, </em>8 Ben. 357; <em>Casey </em>v. <em>La Societe de Credit Mobilier, </em>2 Wood 77. It is said in the case last cited that the receiver\u2019s title is the same as that of an- assignee in 'bankruptcy. Substantially the same is said, but without citation of cases, in Beach on Receivers \u00a7 481, and in High on Receivers \u00a7 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">If it be true that the United States Supreme Court, as .matter of construction, treats the assignee as having the legal .title, we cannot treat him1 differently. It is our duty to follow the construction adopted by that court, whether it be a definite .construction given to' the particular provision, or a construction .apparent from its treatment of the statutory system of which that provision is a part. We think it is clear that the United States Court treats the receiver as having the legal title to the right in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, demurrer overruled, declaration adjudged sufficient, and cause remcmd\u00e9\u00e9.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
