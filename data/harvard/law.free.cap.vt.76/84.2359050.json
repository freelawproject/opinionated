There was no1 fence between this lot and the railroad. Next south of the plaintiff\u2019s lay the lot of another owner also abutting to. the west upon the defendant\u2019s right of way, and likewise unfenced. The plaintiff\u2019s horse, which was tethered to a stone upon the plaintiff\u2019s land, becoming frightened by a passing train, ran with the weight intoi the lot of this adjoining owner and from that lot to the track, in front of the locomotive, and was killed. The question is whether the plaintiff can recover the value of the horse; and this depends upon whether the defendant\u2019s duty to maintain a fence at the place where the horse passed from private land to the defendant\u2019s right of way was a duty from the defendant to the plaintiff as one of the general public or only from the defendant to the abutting owner at that point, \u2014 for the horse was not rightfully upon the land of the abutting owner directly from which he escaped to' the track.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The plaintiff contends that the duty was one which the defendant owed to the general public; but this cannot be held without disregarding that section of the statute which declares that there shall be no1 liability for want of a fence in case the land owner has been paid or settled with for building it; for that clearly recognizes the right of the abutting owner to waive the building of the fence against his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>land, a thing he could not do if it was a duty from the railroad to others than himself and those rightfully in possession under him. In this respect the statute distinguishes between fences and cattle guards. Whether a distinction is made between cattle guards at public or highway crossings and those at private or farm crossings, we are not called upon to decide; nor are we bound to find the statute wise or even logical and consistent throughout. It is enough that the two sections, having stood side by side for more than fifty years, must be read together, and each, if possible, be given some force.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\">We do not understand that our decision is in conflict with any previous holding of this court. In <em>Quimby &amp; Rogan </em>v. <em>B. &amp; M. R. Co., </em>71 Vt. 301, 45 Atl. 223, the horse escaped through a defective cattle guard at a highway crossing. Such was the fact in <em>Harwood </em>v. <em>Bennington &amp; Rutland R. Co., </em>67 Vt. 664, 32 Atl. 721. And those are the only cases claimed to be inconsistent with the view we are now adopting. On the other hand, in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Barre R. Co., </em>64 Vt. 21, 23 Atl. 632, the principle of the present decision was distinctly recognized and applied. There the plaintiff\u2019s horse was being pastured by one whose pasture itself did not abut upon the railroad, but whose meadow, adjoining the pasture, did. The horse escaped from the pasture to the meadow and thence, for want of a sufficient fence,-to the track. The case turned upon the question whether the horse was rightfully in the meadow; and it was considered that he was, because, it being the duty of the owner of the pasture to' confine him, he was in the meadow either by consent or fault of the abutting owner, and so- the owner of the horse stood in the right of the owner of the meadow. \u201cThe statute requiring a railroad to fence its track,\u201d said the court in that case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>\u201cis for the protection of the land owners through whose land it runs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
