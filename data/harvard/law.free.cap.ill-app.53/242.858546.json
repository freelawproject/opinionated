That the power of appointment is a delicate one, and is to be exercised with great circumspection.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-15\" pgmap=\"238\">2. It must appear that the complainant has a claim to the property, and the court must be satisfied by affidavit hat a receiver is necessary to preserve the property.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-3\" pgmap=\"239\">3. That the court never appoints a receiver merely because the measure can do no harm.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-4\" pgmap=\"239\">4. That fraud or imminent danger, if immediate possession is not taken by the court, must be clearly proved, and</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-5\" pgmap=\"239\">5.

It is true the bill alleged, in general terms, that the rights of complainants were in imminent danger of being wholly lost unless the order was made without notice. This was but the conclusion of the pleader. The facts upon which the conclusion was based should have been stated so that the court could see that the apprehension was well founded. If there was really danger that the property would be wasted or removed from the jurisdiction, and that a temporary injunction would not answer the purpose, then it might have been proper to place the property in the hands of a receiver upon the ex parte application.</p> <p id=\"b240-6\" pgmap=\"240\">The only fact stated in the bill tending to show such necessity was, that Reichman, who was in charge of the goods and selling the same, was insolvent. This might have warranted a temporary injunction to prevent further sales until the court could, upon satisfactory proof, ascertain whether the fundamental allegations in the bill were probably true.</p> <p id=\"b240-7\" pgmap=\"240\">It is not requiring too much to put the complainant to specific averment of facts (upon which perjury may be assigned if falsely made) showing clearly the necessity for such interference with the property rights of the defendant.</p> <p id=\"b240-8\" pgmap=\"240\">A further objection urged is that the order as entered seems to be a substantial adjudication of the controlling matters alleged in the bill, and we think the objection is well taken. A reading of the order will show that it is not merely an appointment of a receiver for the temporary purpose of preserving the property until the rights of the parties could be ascertained and determined, but it proceeds to adjudicate those rights without proof, save the affidavit attached to the bill.</p> <p id=\"b240-9\" pgmap=\"240(10) 241(87)\">There was no hearing and no default; indeed, the parties named as defendants were not before the court; and yet the order, as it appears in the record, finds the bill in all its material allegations to be true, and requires the receiver to take possession of the goods, convert the same into cash for the best price obtainable, and to collect the notes, accounts and all choses in action due the said Reichman, and to bring the money arising from these sources into court for such disposition as might thereafter be ordered in the premises.</p> <p id=\"b241-4\" pgmap=\"241\">This, of course, was erroneous, and no doubt it was inadvertent.</p> <p id=\"b241-5\" pgmap=\"241\">The order appointing the receiver will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
