E. Hickman was the father of Ernest Hickman, who \u2022 was the husband of Annie Hickman. Ernest and his wife both died in the latter part of 1891, and at the March term, 1892, of the St. Clair County Court, A. E. Hickman presented for allowance the folio-wing claim against the estate of Annie Hickman, literally copied from the record: \u201c Emil J. Eggmann, administrator, in account with A. E. Hickman, as follows : Itent paid to Louis Mengas, Jr., for residence occupied by deceased and her husband, Ernest Hickman, also deceased, from the 24th day of October, A. D. 1887, to the 24th day of December, 1891, at fourteen dollars ($14) per month, aggregating $700. For moneys advanced to Ernest Hickman and Annie Hickman, for the five years preceding their deaths, the sum of seventy dollars ($70) per month, which said funds (in addition to the amount of rent above named) was used by the said Ernest Hickman and the said Annie Hickman, or paid out by the said A. E. Hickman for their use, in and about the necessary family expenses of the said Ernest Hickman and the said Annie Hickman, such as clothing, food, fuel and doctor bills, and drug bills, aggregating $4,200.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-6\" pgmap=\"558\">This claim was sworn to by A. E. Hickman, March 7, 1892, and at the May term, 1892, of said court, $2,599 was . allowed against said estate on said claim, and ordered to be paid in due course of administration. From this order the administrator appealed to said Circuit Court, and at the January term, A. D. 1893, a jury was waived, the cause was tried by the court, the issue was found for defendant, and judgment was entered on the finding against plaintiff for costs, and plaintiff sued out this writ of error to reverse the same.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b558-7\" pgmap=\"558\">Brief of Plaintiff in Error, Cockrell &amp; Moyers, Attorneys.</attorneys><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-8\" pgmap=\"558(20) 559(91)\">All the items of provisions, clothing; fuel, doctor bills and drug bills, come clearly within the provisions ofisection 15 of the statute.

Ritchey, 55 Iowa 719. The only criterion which the statute furnishes is: Was the expenditure a family expenditure; was it incurred for, on account of, and to be used in the family ? Smedley v.

Hoffman, 30 Ill. App. 77), but a lawyer\u2019s is not. Fitzgerald v.

Davis v.

The right to recover the amount of said claim or any part thereof from the estate of Annie Hickman, deceased, is based entirely upon the provisions of Sec. 15, Chap. 68, Rev. Stat., Avhich reads as follows : \u201c The expenses of the family and the education of the children shall be chargeable upon the property of both husband and wife, or either of them, in favor of creditors therefor, and in relation thereto they may be sued separately or jointly.\u201d The eAddence sIioavs that Ernest Hickman Avas a young man of dissipated habits, Avho spent money recklessly outside of any that Avas used in paying expenses of the family; that he Avorked but little and had no property; that his father, A. R. Hickman, supplied him liberally with money, part of Avhich Avas squandered as above indicated, and part, it is fair to infer, went to pay the family expenses of the son and his Avife. Most, but not all of the rent of the house the son and his wife occupied, was paid by the father.</p> <p id=\"b560-6\" pgmap=\"560\">There was no account kept by the father of the items of expenditure, so far as anything is shoAvn by the eAddence, and the claim itself, consisting as it does of aggregates, and prepared by the claimant, justifies the inference that no such account ever had been kept by A. R. Hickman. This fact, and his declarations, together Avith the other evidence, shedding light upon and giving character to the acts of the father in furnishing money to the son, leads us to the conclusion, doubtless reached by the trial court, that the contribution to the support of Ernest and his wife was a gratuity prompted by parental affection, and Avith no intention at the time it Avas bestowed to claim its repayment. Hnder the clause of the statute we have quoted, \u00edav o facts must be established by the proof to render the estate of Annie Hickman liable. First, the money furnished must be for family expenses; second, that A. R. Hickman furnished money for that, purpose, and was a creditor xvithin the meaning of the statute. The second fact, as we understand the evidence, was not proven. He was not a creditor. The judgment was informal, but Ave will obviate the difficulty by affirming it, and making the order that the costs be paid by plaintiff in error in due course of administration.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
