D, 1893, occupied a store building No. 712 Commercial avenue, in the city of Cairo, Illinois, wherein he was engaged in, and carried on the business of bookseller and stationer, and had and offered for sale to the public a stock of merchandise, consisting of books, periodicals, stationery and other articles of merchandise usually kept by a bookseller and stationer; that on the 2d of March, said defendant sold at and from said store some of the articles of merchandise composing said stock; that at the time of such sale, said defendant had never had any of the merchanclise composing said stock inspected, or made any application to the city marshal of the city of Cairo for an inspection of the same, nor had he paid into the city treasury any money for such inspection, nor had said defendant any certificate of inspection as provided for and required by section 3 of ordinance Ho. 518, of said city, approved December 15, 1892; nor was said store building \u201ca place licensed for the sale of provisions\u201d under section 2 of said ordinance; that thereupon the city of Cairo, upon a warrant duly sworn out before T. F. White, a justice of the peace in and for said city, caused the arrest of defendant, charging him with a violation of the provisions of said section 3 of said ordinance in making sale of merchandise as aforesaid; \u2022 that upon the hearing of the cause, said justice discharged said defendant, and gave judgment against said city for costs; and said city thereupon brings said cause by appeal to the Circuit Court, and the same is there now heard upon the above agreed state of facts, and said ordinance and section 3 thereof offered in evidence by plaintiff in the words and figures following, to-wit:</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b678-6\" pgmap=\"678(198) 679(76)\">Section 3. Every store or building in the city of Cairo not \u201c a place licensed for the sale of provisions,\u201d under the preceding section, and wherein shall be sold or offered for sale to the public, any cotton, tobacco, cigars, dry goods, furnishing goods, millinery goods, jewelry, boots and shoes, stationery, furniture, hardware, crockery, harness or saddlery, sewing machines, gas and plumbing articles, material and fixtures, or any other articles of any kind of merchandise shall be deemed \u201c a public place; \u201d and no such articles of merchandise shall be sold at or from such \u201c public place\u201d until an inspection of such merchandise shall have first been made by the \u201c city inspector of merchandise,\u201d and a certificate of inspection thereof obtained, as in and by this section provided. The city marshal is hereby made \u201ccity inspector of merchandise,\u201d by virtue of his office; and in addition to his other duties it shall be his duty to perform all the duties herein required of the \u201c city inspector of merchandise.\u201d It shall be the duty of every person, copartnership or corporation, being the owner or proprietor of a stock of any articles of merchandise, inspection of which is hereinabove provided for or required, before making sale of any part thereof, to make application to said inspector for an inspection of such stock of merchandise, and pay into the city treasury in advance, an inspection fee of ten dollars for such inspection; and thereupon, upon such application and payment of such inspection fee, it shall be the duty of said inspector to make such inspection.</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b679-4\" pgmap=\"679(327) 680(122)\">If, upon such inspection, said inspector shall discover in such stock of merchandise any article of merchandise the sale of which shall be injurious to the health or public welfare of the citizens of Cairo, or be a fraud upon the public, such articles shall be reported by him to the city clerk as \u201cnot having passed inspection,\u201d and the residue of said stock only reported as having \u201c passed inspection;\u201d otherwise he shall simply report to the said clerk said entire stock as having \u201cpassed inspection,\u201d and he shall also report to the said clerk the name of the applicant for such inspection and the location of the stock so inspected; and thereupon it shall be the duty of the said clerk to issue and deliver to such applicant a proper certificate of inspection, duly signed by said clerk and attested by the mayor, which said certificate shall also state the name of such applicant and the location of the stock so inspected, and the fact that the same has been duly inspected and \u201c passed inspection\u201d or \u201c passed inspection except as to the following articles of merchandise, viz. (he will here specify the articles reported by the inspector as not having passed inspection), as the case may be; said certificate shall bear the date of its issuance, and shall be in force from such date during the fiscal year of the city in which issued; and it shall be lawful for such applicant, under and by virtue of such certificate, and while such certificate shall be in force as aforesaid, to sell to the public any and all of the articles of merchandise composing said stock so inspected, excepting the excepted articles aforesaid, and all like articles of merchandise added to such stock during said period, but unlawful to sell any of said excepted articles or like articles added thereto during said period. Any person, co-partnership or corporation who shall violate any of the provisions of this section shall forfeit and pay for the use of the city a sum not less than five dollars nor more than fifty dollars for each offense; provided, this section shall not apply to any store or building wherein merchandise shall be sold or offered for sale by any commission merchant or auctioneer, keeper of any ordinary, second-hand or junk, or druggist or liquor dealer, who hold a license as such, or by any religious, charitable or benevolent society for religious, charitable or benevolent purposes, nor to merchandise sold at and from licensed lumber yards.\u201d The ordinance shows that it was duly adopted, approved, attested and published December 16, 1892. \u25a0</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b680-5\" pgmap=\"680\">Defendant objected to the same on the grounds that said ordinance and section three thereof is unconstitutional, illegal and void. Upon the agreed facts and evidence aforesaid the court ruled that said section 3 of said ordinance 518 was illegal and void, and that defendant could not be fined for non-compliance with the provisions thereof, to which said ruling by the court plaintiff then and there excepted. Thereupon the court found for defendant; plaintiff then and there excepted, and moved the court to set aside finding and grant a new trial, and filed reasons in writing therefor; but the court overruled motion and gave judgment for the defendant; plaintiff then and there excepted.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b680-6\" pgmap=\"680\">Appellant\u2019s Brief, Green &amp; Gilbert, Attorneys.</attorneys><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b680-7\" pgmap=\"680\">The city of Cairo is incorporated under the general law (Chap. 24, Bev.

The court below held it was invalid, and that ruling is the only question for determination here. The ordinance is said to be authorized by the 54th power of Sec. 1, Art. 5, Part 1. Chap. 24 of the general incorporation act of 1872, under which the city of Cairo is incorporated, which is as follows: \u201c The city council in cities shall have the power to regulate the inspection, weighing and measuring of brick, lumber, firewood, coal, hay, and any article of merchandise.\u201d This right falls under the designation of a police power, and the authority of the city to pass the ordinance in question is said to be reinforced by the 66th power of same section, which is, the city council shall have the power \u201c To regulate the police of the city, and pass and enforce all necessary police ordinances.\u201d The object of the ordinance is said to be to bring all venders of merchandise under police regulation, so as to be able to inspect all stocks of merchandise, and thereby discover and prevent the sale of \u201c merchandise which shall be injurious to the health or public welfare of the citizens of Cairo, or be a fraud upon the public.\u201d The power to regulate the inspection, etc., it is said, includes the power to license. This latter position is not contested by appellee. The law has been so declared in Farwell v. Chicago, 71 Ill. 272; Kinsley v. Chicago, 124 Ill. 362.</p> <p id=\"b683-5\" pgmap=\"683\">The appellee, a vender of stationery, books, periodicals and other articles of merchandise usually kept by a book seller, contends the ordinance is invalid as to him for at least two reasons, 1. The city had no power, under its charter, to pass an ordinance providing for the inspection of such articles of merchandise as were kept and sold by him. 2. That if it had, it could not delegate to the city marshal the arbitrary power of determining what article of merchandise would be injurious to the health or public welfare of the citizens of Cairo, or a fraud upon the public, if sold. The law is, the appellant, being a creature of the legislature, can exercise such powers only, as are expressly conferred and as are necessarily incident thereto. Mather v. City of Ottawa, 114 Ill. 659.</p> <p id=\"b683-7\" pgmap=\"683(10) 684(220)\">\u201c Any fair, reasonable \u201d doubt concerning the existence of power is resolved against the separation, and the power is denied. Emmons v. City of Lewistown, 132 Ill. 380; Seeger v. Mueller et al., 133 Ill. 94. The ordinance in question declared, \u201c Any store or building in the city of Cairo, not a place licensed for the sale of provisions, wherein shall be sold or offered for sale to the public * * * any articles of merchandise, shall be deemed a public place, and no article of merchandise shall be sold at or from such public place until an inspection of such merchandise shall have first been made by the city inspector of merchandise, and a certificate of inspection thereof obtained, under a penalty of not less than five dollars, nor more than fifty dollars for each offense.\u201d The ordinance excepts auctioneers and others licensed to make sales, and religious and benevolent societies and makes the city marshal the city inspector. The authority to pass this ordinance must be found in the 54th grant of power, above set out, or it does not exist. The 66th power does not purport to be a grant of police power, as such, but gives authority to the city to pass and enforce all necessary police ordinances; that is, ordinances relating to matters coming within the police power.</p> <p id=\"b684-5\" pgmap=\"684\">The appellant contends the last general clause, \u201c any article of merchandise,\u201d in the 54th power, sivprco, is not limited in its meaning by the specific articles mentioned preceding it. The appellee contends it is, and must be construed to mean articles of merchandise of the same general kind or class as there specified. In Potter\u2019s Dwarris, p. 247, it is said in regard to construing penal statutes : \u201c If general words follow an enumeration of particular cases, such general words are held to apply only to cases of the same kind as those which are expressly mentioned.\u201d This rule is not limited to penal statutes. In Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, p. 657, it is said in regard to the construction of an act of Parliament, \u201c Where a particular class of persons or things is spoken of, and general words follow, the class first mentioned is to be taken as the most comprehensive, and the general words treated as referring to matters ejusdem generis with such class, the effect of general words when they follow particular words being thus restricted.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b685-3\" pgmap=\"685\">It is there further said, \u201c General words may be aptly restrained according to the subject-matter or persons to which they relate.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b685-4\" pgmap=\"685\">In the case of Ambler v. Whipple, 139 Ill. 317, where the proper construction of section 16 of the law of limitations was involved, and where the particular issue was as to whether the words \u201c or other evidence of indebtedness in writing \u201d included judgments, when they followed an enumeration of different kinds of contracts in writing, it was said: \" It is a general rule of statutory construction, that general words, following an enumeration of particular cases, apply to cases of the same kind and description.\u201d To the same effect, see Wilson v. Board of Trustees, 133 Ill. 470. It is said, however, that the words \u201c any article of merchandise\u201d are as broad and comprehensive as the English language admits of. This is true, if considered alone and by themselves, without reference to the words preceding them, as is said in regard to the general clause under consideration in the Whipple case, 139 Ill. 317, supra. But why ignore those particular and specific words % They were used for a purpose as clearly as the general words. To arrive at the intention of the legislature all the words included in this fifty-fourth power must be considered together. Statutes should be construed so that no clause, sentence or words shall be deemed superfluous. Hunt v. C. H. &amp; D. Ry. Co., 121 Ill. 644. The ordinance is void in our judgment for want of power to pass it. It is also void in that it delegates the power to the city marshal to determine what articles of merchandise, if sold, would be injurious to the health or public welfare of the citizens of Cairo or a fraud upon the public.</p> <p id=\"b685-5\" pgmap=\"685(68) 686(99)\">There would be no stability in such a regulation. Citizens engaged in legitimate business would be subject to the whims and caprice of each city marshal. The best and most intelligent of men frequently differ on such subjects. The determination of one city marshal as to what was injurious would be no criterion for the determination of another. If the power existed to inspect all merchandise, merchants would have the right to know by fixed law what was placed under the ban of official powers. Any other course would be oppressive and intolerable. In such case the power to determine what was injurious would rest in the council and not its agents; one agent can not delegate power to another agent unless authorized to do so by the principal. The city itself is only an agent of the State. It can not delegate its power to another. Dillon on Municipal Cor., Secs. 60, 618; Chicago v. Trotter, 136 Ill. 430. The judgment is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
