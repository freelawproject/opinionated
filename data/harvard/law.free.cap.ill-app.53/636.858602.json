The agreement for the sale and purchase made between the parties was in writing, executed February 10, 1891, acknowledged June 20, 1891, before a notary public in St. Louis, Mo., by the president of appellant, and recorded June 24, 1891, on page 459, book 68 of \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d in the recorder\u2019s office of said Jersey county. By the terms of this agreement the purchase price was fixed at $14,200, which sum the vendee agreed to pay in manner following: One-half when machinery was ready for shipment; one-half, or the balance, by two negotiable promissory notes of $3,550 each, payable in three and six months respectively, after the machinery was put up in running order, with six per cent interest until maturity, and ten per cent thereafter.</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-4\" pgmap=\"634\">The agreement contained an express condition that the title to the property should be and remain in appellant, until the covenants of the agreement to be performed as the consideration of the same, by the vendee, should be complied with, and should not be affected by the delivery and erection thereof, and that if the vendee should sell, remove or dispose of said property, or attempt tovdo so, or assign it, or if it should be seized by process of law, or if default be made in the payment of the purchase money, or any part thereof, or in the performance by the vendee of its covenants, then appellant might take immediate possession of said property.</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-5\" pgmap=\"634(121) 635(156)\">Appellant shipped, erected and put in running order, said brick yard machinery and appliances, upon the land of vendee in Jersey county. It was tested and accepted, the cash payment made, and the notes were executed and delivered for the balance of the purchase money by the vendee, in compliance with the terms of the contract, and these notes were paid except a balance of $2,300, for which a renewal note, dated March 17, 1892, due in ninety days, payable to appellant, with eight per cent interest, executed by H. A. Fisher, president and treasurer of vendee, was received and accepted. Appellant does not claim the vendee broke any of its covenants except by failing to pay this note, and it did not attempt to take or demand possession of said property until after Hiram Kimball, the appellee, had acquired the possession thereof, as purchaser at a sale made to satisfy the execution hereinafter mentioned. Kimball was a stockholder in the \u201cHewbern Press Brick Co.,\u201d and a director when it was organized, but was not a director at the date of said renewal note, or when the note to himself was executed and delivered by said Brick Co., and knew about the said contract between it and appellant. It was admitted the president and secretary of said Brick Go., pursuant to resolutions passed by its board of directors, executed its note for \u00a719,634.58, dated June 13, 1892, the day of its execution, payable to the order of appellee, and it was proved, and not contradicted, that the consideration for said note was money he actually advanced said company to pay its operating expenses.</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-5\" pgmap=\"635\">On June 25,1892, a judgment by confession in his favor, and against said company, for the amount of said note and interest, was duly and properly entered by the clerk of the Circuit Court of said Jersey county, in vacation. On the same day an execution was issued under the judgment to the sheriff of said county, who levied by virtue thereof upon the property in controversy, and the land of said company on which it was then located, and on July 30, 1892, sold all of the property so levied on to the appellee. He took possession of said real and personal property as such purchaser, and when the time had expired within which the real estate could have been redeemed, he received a sheriff\u2019s deed conveying it to him, and retained possession of the property in controversy from and after the day of sale. His possession was open and avowed, he claiming the right thereto as the lawful owner. That right was not disputed nor challenged until January 2, 1893, on which day appellant commenced this action in trover against him, to recover the value of the machinery and appliances before mentioned, alleged in the declaration to be lawfully possessed by appellant on December 2,1892, and unlawfully converted by appellee to his own use.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b636-3\" pgmap=\"636\">Appellant\u2019s Brief, Horatio D.

If, therefore, goods and chattels become the property of the execution debtor by sale and delivery to him, without the preservation of a lien for the purchase money in the form prescribed by the statute, the execution lien immediately attaches. Blatchford et al. v. Boyden, 122 Ill. 657 (p. 669).</p> <opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b637-8\" pgmap=\"637\">Mr. Justice Green</author> <p id=\"AGj\" pgmap=\"637\">delivered the opinion or the Court.</p> <p id=\"b637-9\" pgmap=\"637(64) 638(150)\">The written contract of sale is relied on by appellant, and this suit, based thereon, can not be maintained unless by the contract a lawful lien is created upon the property sold, to secure the unpaid purchase money, or unless the sale is held to be conditional and not absolute. The title to personal property vests immediately in the vendee, upon its sale and delivery to him, and under the law of this State a lien upon personal property, to secure unpaid purchase money, can be preserved as against creditors of the purchaser, in one of two ways only, viz.: By the vendor retaining possession of the property sold until the price is paid, or by the taking of a chattel mortgage upon said property, securing the unpaid purchase money, and properly executed, acknowledged, entered and recorded as required by the chattel mortgage act. And even when a mortgage lien is so lawfully created by strict compliance with the statutory provisions, to be effective as against such creditors, the mortgagee must take immediate possession of the mortgaged property, upon default in the payment of the debt secured when it becomes due. Blatchford v. Boyden, 122 Ill. 657, and other cases decided by our Supreme Court, announce rules substantially as above stated.</p> <p id=\"b638-5\" pgmap=\"638(227) 639(147)\">It is manifest, therefore, the written instrument relied on, created no lawful lien upon the property in controversy as against Kimball, the creditor of the purchaser. It was not acknowledged by the debtor, but by the president of the vendor company. It was not entered as required by the statute, and unless it was acknowledged by a mortgagor it was not entitled to be recorded under Sec. 4 of the act aforesaid, and the recording of it was a mere nullity. Even if the instrument could be given the effect of a chattel mortgage, the laches of appellant, in failing to take prompt possession, would defeat the lien. The unpaid balance of the ' purchase money, evidenced by the renewal note dated March 17, 1892, became due in ninety days, yet no attempt to get possession of said property was made by appellant until months thereafter. The other ground, that the sale was conditional, upon which is based appellant\u2019s right to recover, is also untenable. By the very terms of the contract the property was to be delivered to the purchaser, and the dominion and control of it was thereby given. The price and character of payments were fixed. This price was paid by the vendee in the mode agreed upon, and it was accepted by appellant. An absolute sale was thus consummated and by the act of the vendor the vendee was given full possession of all the property, evidencing ownership, and inducing the extension of credit to the vendee. Where, as in this case, by the terms of the contract, the purchaser is not obliged to, and in fact has no right to return the specific articles, but is at liberty to return the money value thereof, he becomes a debtor, and the title to the property is changed. It is a sale. Chickering et al. v. Bastress, 130 Ill. 206. Where property is sold and delivered by the vendor to the vendee, it makes no difference Avhat conditions may be attached to such sale for the security of the purchase price, by reserving a lien on the thing sold, or providing the title shall remain in the vendor till the property is paid for.</p> <p id=\"b639-4\" pgmap=\"639\">As to execution creditors, the absolute title to the property passes to the vendee. Hadfield v. Berry, 28 Ill. App. 376; citing Brundage v. Camp, 21 Ill. 330; Murch v. Wright, 46 Ill. 487; Lonergan v. Stewart, 55 Ill. 44; Bastress v. Chickering, 18 Ill. App. 198.</p> <p id=\"b639-5\" pgmap=\"639\">It further appears appellee advanced money to the Brick Go. for a laudable and proper purpose and without any fraudulent design. He was a stockholder in said company, but that did not debar him from furnishing pecuniary aid to carry on its legitimate business, nor make invalid the debt thereby created. Reichwald v. Hotel Co., 106 Ill. 439. His knowledge of said contract did not affect his rights. The judgment he obtained for the amount of the debt was duly entered according to law, and the execution thereunder was lawfully issued and levied upon the property in controversy. Appellee was then an execution creditor of the' vendee, within the meaning of that term as used in the decisions cited. The title to said property was vested in the debtor in execution at the time of the levy and sale, and appellee as purchaser at said sale, became and was the legal owner of the property in controversy, and entitled to the possession thereof as against appellant.</p> <p id=\"b639-6\" pgmap=\"639(20) 640(48)\">The court below tried the case by agreement, and found the appellee not guilty. The finding was warranted by the evidence, and the judgment against appellant for costs was right. We perceive no reversible error in holding the propositions as requested by appellee to be the law, nor in refusing to so hold as to the propositions requested on behalf of appellant. The judgment is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
