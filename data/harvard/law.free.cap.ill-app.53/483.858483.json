It is claimed that appellant could maintain replevin for the reason that it had a lien upon the brick. The lien given by the statute to a material-man is a lien on the lot and building in which the material is used. If appellant had a lien upon the material it could enforce it only in the manner provided by statute, i. e., by petition under the mechanic\u2019s lien law. It had no right to reduce the brick to possession by replevin. There were no such conditions shown by the evidence as to support a right of stoppage in transitu,. Ho fraud was practiced by Benway &amp; Iinutz or any one acting for them in purchasing and obtaining possession of the brick.</p> <p id=\"b481-4\" pgmap=\"481\">There was no right of rescission of the sale. Appellant with full knowledge of all the facts brought its action of assumpsit to recover the purchase price of the brick, thereby affirming the sale.</p> <p id=\"b481-5\" pgmap=\"481\">The title to the brick levied upon was in Benway &amp; Iinutz, and if appellant had any right in them it was by virtue of the lien law.</p> <p id=\"b481-6\" pgmap=\"481\">The judgment will therefore be affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
