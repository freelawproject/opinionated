The commission was unpersuaded by claimant\u2019s position, as are we.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The commission\u2019s order contains several reasons for denying IEC compensation, any of which alone could sustain its decision. Evidence of decreased wages, for example, does not establish an impaired earning capacity, which \u201cconnotes not what claimant <em>did </em>earn, but what he or she <em>could have </em>earned.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) State ex rel. Eaton Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 180, 183-184, 610 N.E.2d 992, 995; <em>State ex rel. Johnson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 384, 387, 533 N.E.2d 775, 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The commission also supported with \u201csome evidence\u201d its determination that there was no causal relationship-between claimant\u2019s allowed condition and his alleged IEC. It observed that claimant\u2019s allowed condition consisted solely of what was then a fourteen-year-old strain/sprain for which he no longer received treatment. It accordingly rejected claimant\u2019s assertion of an injury-related inability to work, relying on the reports of Drs. Fallon and Gatens, which established a physical capacity for both rehabilitation and reemployment.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Finally, in speculating as to the true reason for claimant\u2019s unemployment, the commission issued two findings that, in and of themselves, additionally support a denial of IEC compensation. First, the commission noted that the sole condition for which claimant was being treated was a nonallowed psychiatric ailment. Compensation, however, cannot be based in whole or part on nonallowed conditions. <em>State ex rel. Waddle v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 452, 619 N.E.2d 1018. The commission also found that claimant was receiving Social Security benefits and simply had no interest in working \u2014 an assertion that claimant does not vigorously dispute. Because a claimant cannot successfully assert an IEC absent a desire to work, the commission\u2019s finding presents an additional justification for denying IEC compensation. See <em>State ex rel. Pauley v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 263, 559 N.E.2d 1333.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">For these reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b557-10\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
