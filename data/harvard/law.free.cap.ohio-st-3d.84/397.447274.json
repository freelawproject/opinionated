I(12)(C)(6). Evidence of false statements, including material omissions, and lack of candor in the admissions process reflect poorly on an applicant\u2019s present character, fitness, and moral qualifications. See Gov.Bar R. I(ll)(D)(S)(h), (i) and I(ll)(D)(4)(i), (j).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>After reviewing the evidence, we adopt the findings and recommendation of the board. Panepinto\u2019s false and incomplete answers in his application, his continued dishonesty during part of the admissions process, and his attempts to excuse or minimize his conduct at the hearing establish that he does not presently possess the integrity to be admitted to practice law in Ohio. See, <em>e.g., In re Application of Calim </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 96, 694 N.E.2d 896; <em>In re Application of Salisbury </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 403, 632 N.E.2d 1288. Panepinto is permitted to reapply to take the July 1999 bar examination upon the submission of new applications to register as a candidate for admission to the practice of law and to take the bar examination, and upon further submission to a new character and fitness examination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b526-6\">Douglas, Resnick, F.E.

Because I believe that Panepinto has demonstrated that he does not have the requisite fitness and character to be admitted to the practice of law, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">Had he admitted to his deceptive acts, I would agree with the majority. But his continued deception in the application process and his refusal to accept the responsibility for these misdeeds demonstrates a deeper character flaw that cannot be cured by time.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-12\">A lawyer must be honest, ethical, and above reproach. Panepinto clearly has none of these qualities. Therefore, I would permanently deny his application to take the bar exam.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
