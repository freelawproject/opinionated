In determining a sanction to be imposed, we consider the duty violated, the lawyer\u2019s mental state, the injury caused, and the existence of mitigating circumstances. <em>Warren Cty. Bar Assn. v. Bunce </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 112, 115, 689 N.E.2d 566, 568, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">We have previously said that \u201clawyers must not take a cavalier attitude toward their notary responsibilities.\u201d <em>Lorain Cty. Bar Assn. v. Papcke </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 91, 93, 689 N.E.2d 549, 551. Respondents did notarize signatures that were inscribed in their presence, Sylvan did produce accurate renditions of the statements made by the clients over these signatures, and although Bradley failed to accurately reproduce Erdman\u2019s statements, Erdman did not suffer any damage. Nonetheless, respondents\u2019 actions violated the duties imposed upon notaries by R.C. Chapter 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">In <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Fowerbaugh </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 187, 190, 658 N.E.2d 237, 240, and in later opinions, we said that \u201c[w]hen an attorney engages in a course of conduct resulting in a finding that the attorney has violated DR 1-102(A)(4), the attorney will be actually suspended from the practice of law for an appropriate period of time.\u201d See <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Simecek </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 320, 699 N.E.2d 933. Respondents, however, took these improper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>actions in only a .few isolated cases that they believed presented emergency situations, and their actions caused no damage to any client. Respondents\u2019 actions were but a few isolated incidents in otherwise unblemished legal careers, not a course of conduct. Additionally, respondents cooperated with relator in its investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">We therefore adopt the recommendation of the board with respect to respondent Sylvan Reisenfeld. Sylvan Reisenfeld is hereby publicly reprimanded. But in light of the fact that Bradley Reisenfeld inaccurately added a statement \u2014 one that Erdman allegedly never made \u2014 to Erdman\u2019s affidavit, Bradley\u2019s conduct warrants a harsher sanction. Bradley Reisenfeld is hereby suspended from the practice of law for six months, with the entire six months suspended. Costs are taxed to respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b158-7\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.

I concur with the majority with regard to the sanction imposed on respondent Sylvan P. Reisenfeld. I dissent as to the sanction imposed on Bradley A. Reisenfeld. I would impose a public reprimand.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
