For the following reasons, however, we find this assertion to be meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-13\">First, to the extent that Jones requested that Judge O\u2019Connor rule on his motion for jail-time credit, his claim was rendered moot when Judge O\u2019Connor subsequently denied the motion. Mandamus does not lie to compel an act that has already been performed. <em>State ex rel. Wynn v. McCormick </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 420, 421, 696 N.E.2d 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-14\">Second, Jones had an adequate remedy at law by appeal to review any sentencing error by Judge O\u2019Connor in failing to calculate his correct jail-time credit. See, <em>e.g., State ex rel. Sampson v. Parrott </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 92, 93, 694 N.E.2d 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Finally, the duty under R.C. 2967.191 to actually <em>grant </em>pretrial-confinement time credit rests with the Adult Parole Authority rather than Judge O\u2019Connor. <em>State ex rel. Harrell v. Hamilton Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 193, 12 O.O.3d 189, 389 N.E.2d 506; <em>State ex rel. Gooden v. Martin </em>(1990), 67 Ohio App.3d 685, 588 N.E.2d 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b553-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
