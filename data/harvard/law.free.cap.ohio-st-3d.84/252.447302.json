For the following reasons, however, Grove\u2019s claims lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">First, the court correctly dismissed Grove\u2019s procedendo action on remand from this court because Judge Nadel had already performed the requested act, <em>ie., </em>he journalized his January 1997 decision denying Grove\u2019s motion for a copy of his transcript. Neither procedendo nor mandamus will compel the performance of a duty that has already been performed. <em>Martin v. Judges of the Lucas Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 71, 72, 552 N.E.2d 906, 908. The court of appeals appropriately took judicial notice that Grove\u2019s procedendo action was moot based on the journalized entry submitted by Judge Nadel in his second motion to dismiss. See <em>State ex rel. Konoff v. Shafer </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 294, 295, 685 N.E.2d 1248, 1249.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">Second, Grove\u2019s claim that Judge Nadel erred in denying his motion for a copy of his trial transcript should be raised in an appeal from that journalized entry rather than in procedendo. Procedendo will not issue when the relator has an adequate legal remedy. <em>State ex rel. Miley v. Parrott </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 64, 65, 671 N.E.2d 24, 26; <em>State ex rel. Fogle v. Steiner </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 158, 164, 656 N.E.2d 1288, 1294.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b379-13\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
