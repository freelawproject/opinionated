XVIII, the United States District Court certified the question of \u201cWhether punitive or exemplary damages are available in an employment discrimination action arising under Ohio Rev.Code.\u00a7 4112.99.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AH7l\">Our response is \u201cyes.\u201d R.C. 4112.99 authorizes an award of punitive damages in civil employment discrimination actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b544-14\">We begin with the language of the statute. The General Assembly amended R.C. 4112.99 in 1987 to provide \u201ca civil action for damages, injunctive relief, or any other appropriate relief.\u201d 142 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1778. This court recognized the amendment\u2019s creation of an independent civil action to remedy all forms of discrimination prohibited by R.C. Chapter 4112 in <em>Elek v. Huntington Natl. Bank </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 135, 573 N.E.2d 1056. While the parties. agree R.C. 4112.99 affords discrimination plaintiffs the general right to a civil action, they debate whether the word \u201cdamages\u201d is meant to include both compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>\u201cIn construing a statute, a court\u2019s paramount concern is the legislative intent in enacting the statute.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Richard v. Bd. of Trustees of Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Disability &amp; Pension Fund </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 409, 411, 632 N.E.2d 1292, 1295. To this end, we must first look to the statutory language and the \u201c \u2018purpose to be accomplished.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>In assessing the language employed by the General Assembly, the court must take words at their usual, normal, or customary meaning. <em>Id. </em>at 412, 632 N.E.2d at 1295. Most important, it is the court\u2019s duty to \u201cgive effect to the words used [and to refrain from] inserting] words not used.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6 Ed.1990) 389-393, defines approximately forty subtypes of \u201cdamages,\u201d compensatory and punitive being only two of the types listed. Black\u2019s broadly defines the word \u201cdamages,\u201d however, as \u201cpecuniary compensation or indemnity, which may be recovered in the courts by any person who has suffered loss, detriment, or injury, whether to his person, property, or rights, through the unlawful act or omission or negligence of another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389. Generally, \u201cdamages\u201d are \u201can award made to a person by a competent judicial tribunal in a proceeding at law or in equity because of a legal wrong done to him by another.\u201d Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1979) 453, Section 902, Comment <em>a. </em>\u201cDamages\u201d flow from an \u201cinjury,\u201d which \u201cdenotes the invasion of any legally protected interest.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Despite the comprehensive meaning of the word without a limiting context, CertainTeed contends \u201cdamages\u201d is only susceptible of a narrow meaning that excludes any damages other than compensatory. In this same vein, CertainTeed reasons that because the law disfavors punitive damages, so must the Revised Code. And, that although the General Assembly chose to use the broad word \u201cdamages,\u201d specificity is the rule for punitives. We do not agree. \u201cDamages,\u201d absent a restrictive modifier like \u201ccompensatory,\u201d \u201cactual,\u201d \u201cconsequential\u201d or \u201cpunitive,\u201d is an inclusive term embracing the panoply of legally recognized pecuniary relief. Thus, CertainTeed\u2019s contention that \u201cdamages\u201d as used in the statute does not encompass punitive damages works only if we presume imprecision on the General Assembly\u2019s part. The notion that the General Assembly carefully and precisely used the word \u201cdamages\u201d to segregate out compensatory damages seems entirely fanciful. See <em>O\u2019Gilvie v. United States </em>(1996), 519 U.S. 79, 95, 117 S.Ct. 452, 460, 136 L.Ed.2d 454, 467 (Scalia, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Consideration of the totality of Ohio\u2019s anti-discrimination scheme only reinforces the plain meaning of the word \u201cdamages\u201d as used in R.C. 4112.99. Even if the word were ambiguous, a \u201cholistic approach\u201d to statutory construction confirms that a seemingly indistinct provision \u201cis often clarified by the remainder of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>the statutory scheme.\u201d <em>United Sav. Assn. of Texas v. Timbers of Inwood Forest </em>Assoc., <em>Ltd. </em>(1988), 484 U.S. 365, 371, 108 S.Ct. 626, 630, 98 L.Ed.2d 740, 748. R.C. 4112.021(D) permits victims of credit discrimination pursuing a civil action in the court of common pleas to be awarded \u201cpunitive damages of not less than one hundred dollars!.]\u201d While CertainTeed contends this express authorization of punitive damages buttresses its position that the word \u201cdamages\u201d standing alone does not include punitives, we think that the imposition of a floor on punitive damages presupposes their general availability. Likewise, the ceiling on punitive damages contained in former R.C. 4112.051(D) manifested the General Assembly\u2019s intent that where it has armed discrimination victims with the weapon to enforce their rights by way of a civil action in the court of common pleas, punitive damages are generally available.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Inasmuch as R.C. 4112.08 requires this court to construe liberally Ohio\u2019s anti-discrimination law \u201cfor the accomplishment of its purposes,\u201d it is neither beyond the General Assembly\u2019s intent nor otherwise unfair to interpret the statute as we do.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While this court has recognized R.C. 4112.99 as a remedial statute, see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number><em>Cosgrove v. Williamsburg of Cincinnati Mgt. Co., Inc. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 281, 638 N.E.2d 991, syllabus, that acknowledgment does not preclude us from confirming that the statute also possesses a deterrent component concerned with preventing socially noisome business practices. CertainTeed is mistaken in its claim that the availability of punitive damages will render the statute penal in nature and thus contradict our holding in <em>Cosgrove. </em>\u201c \u2018[A] law is not penal merely because it imposes an extraordinary liability on a wrongdoer in favor of a person wronged, which is not limited to damages suffered by him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 289, 638 N.E.2d at 997 (Resnick, J., concurring), quoting <em>Floyd v. DuBois Soap Co. </em>(1942), 139 Ohio St. 520, 523, 23 O.O. 20, 21, 41 N.E.2d 393, 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Because \u201c \u2018most modern social welfare legislation * * * has a <em>dual purpose </em>of remedying harm to the individual and deterring socially inimical business pract\u00edcese,]\u2019 \u201d what is important in classifying a statute as remedial or penal is its primary purpose. (Emphasis <em>sic.) Cosgrove </em>at 288, 638 N.E.2d at 996 (Resnick, J., concurring), quoting <em>Porter v. Household Fin. Corp. of Columbus </em>(S.D.Ohio 1974), 385 F.Supp. 336, 342. Having a primary remedial purpose, however, does not constrain R.C. Chapter 4112\u2019s deterrent aim; the concepts are not mutually exclusive. We conclude that construing the word \u201cdamages\u201d as including only those damages that are compensatory would be inconsistent not only with the definition of the word but also with the purpose and intent of R.C. 4112.99.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">CertainTeed also claims that the existence of \u201cvarious failed bills that have been introduced in the General Assembly, and which would have ostensibly recognized [punitive] damages,\u201d further supports its position. We are not influenced by this argument. A bill may fail for numerous unexpressed reasons that are unrelated to the merit or content of any one proposed provision. \u201cCongress can not express its will by a <em>failure </em>to legislate. The act of refusing to enact a law * * * has utterly no legal effect, and thus has utterly no place in a serious discussion of the law. * * * Congress can no more express its will by not legislating than an individual Member can express his will by not voting.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) United States v. Estate of Romani </em>(1998), 523 U.S. 517,-- -, 118 S.Ct. 1478, 1488-1489, 140 L.Ed.2d 710, 726 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"AnPz\">CertainTeed cautions, however, that the availability of punitive damages will subject disparate-impact defendants to exemplary liability for innocuous acts, and in the process offend our notion that the interpretation of statutes must not lead to absurd results. But CertainTeed\u2019s \u201cconcern about punitive damages being awarded for [benign behavior] ignores the existence of the behavior that punitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>damages are meant to deter, and [incorrectly assumes] that mere indifference can support a punitive damages award.\u201d <em>Moreno v. Consolidated Rail Corp. </em>(C.A.6, 1996), 99 F.3d 782, 795 (Daughtrey, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). In Ohio, punitive damages are awarded only upon a finding of actual malice. <em>Moskovitz v. Mt. Sinai Med. Ctr. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 638, 652, 635 N.E.2d 331, 343. True disparate-impact defendants, therefore, as a matter of law, will not be' subject to exemplary liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Because \u201cdamages\u201d as employed in R.C. 4122.99 cannot be said to preclude the award of punitive damages, we advise the federal court that punitive damages may be awarded upon evidence of actual malice in civil actions brought pursuant to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b548-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"Aqrk\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b546-6\">. Prior to 1992, R.C. 4112.051(D) provided for \u201cpunitive damages of not more than five thousand dollars.\u201d In 1992, the General Assembly amended R.C. 4112.051(D) to remove the $5,000 punitive-damage cap by deleting the phrase \u201cof not more than five thousand dollars.\u201d 144 Ohio Laws, Part III, 4777. The statute now reads that if the court or jury in a civil action brought under R.C. 4112.051 finds a violation has occurred, the court \u201cshall award * * * actual damages * * * and may grant other relief that it considers appropriate, including * * * punitive damages.\u201d R.C. 4112.051(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">CertainTeed contends this indicates the General Assembly\u2019s intent to permit recovery of punitive damages only where expressly authorized. In light of the statute\u2019s previous form, we do not agree. Rather, the amendment merely reflects the General Assembly\u2019s decision to forgo a limitation on the amount of punitive damages recoverable. We see no greater legal significance. To the contrary, Rice\u2019s argument that practical considerations most likely dictated the form of the amendment is persuasive. Because R.C. 4112.051(D) provides actual damages <em>shall </em>be awarded, if the General Assembly intended to continue providing for the recovery of punitive damages in appropriate cases without requiring their award in all cases, it either had to leave the term \u201cpunitive damages\u201d where it was (which it did) or rewrite the entire section. Moreover, leaving the specific reference to \u201cactual damages\u201d without a corresponding reference to \u201cpunitive damages\u201d would indicate that punitive damages are unavailable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b546-8\">. CertainTeed contends \u201cthe unanimous Court in <em>[Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. v. Lysyj </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St.2d 217, 67 O.O.2d 287, 313 N.E.2d 3] rejected a claim that punitive damages were available under [R.C.] 4112.05(G), and did so in the face of [R.C.] 4112.08\u2019s \u2018liberal construction\u2019 command.\u201d <em>Lysyj, </em>however, is inapplicable. Upon reviewing an award of compensatory and punitive damages by the Ohio Civil Rights Commission, this court stated, \u201cthe power to award damages to a person suffering loss as a result of the unlawful action of another has traditionally been limited to <em>judicial proceedings. </em>We are not willing to imply a grant of that power to an <em>administrative agency.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 38 Ohio St.2d at 222, 67 O.O.2d at 290, 313 N.E.2d at 7. The General Assembly eventually abrogated this court\u2019s decision by amending R.C. 4112.05(G) to expressly grant the Ohio Civil Rights Commission the power to award compensatory and punitive damages. Our recognition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>in <em>Lysyj, </em>however, that awarding compensatory and punitive damages is an inherent power of the courts, serves only to reinforce our decision in the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b548-9\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ASc\">concurring.
