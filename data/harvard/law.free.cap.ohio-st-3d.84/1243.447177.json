I believe that this court should address the legal issues presented in this case. I do not agree that this cause should be dismissed' as improvidently allowed, and I therefore write separately to express my views on the merits of the primary issue presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-15\">On August 9, 1995, appellee Marjorie Sudnek, f.k.a. Marjorie L. Blackett, filed an action in Geauga County Common Pleas Court, Probate Division, naming appellant Richard C. Klein, executor of the estate of Ralph M. Lauria, Jr., as defendant. Count one of the complaint alleged that Lauria died on October 22, 1987 and was survived by his wife and three heirs at law (the decedent\u2019s children), as well as by Sudnek, who were all named as beneficiaries in his will. It further alleged that Klein, as executor, owned one hundred percent of the stock of Lauria Excavating Company, Inc. (\u201cthe corporation\u201d) and that, at the time of Lauria\u2019s death, the value of the corporation\u2019s stock was $450,000, comprising eighty-eight percent of the value of Lauria\u2019s estate. It claimed that Klein, as executor, operated the business of the decedent without court authority and that the value of the corporation had been \u201csubstantially lost and wasted\u201d since Lauria\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>In count two, Sudnek claimed that Klein had violated R.C. 2109.37 by failing to properly invest and preserve the assets of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Sudnek sought a declaratory judgment declaring that Klein operated the corporation after Lauria\u2019s death -without court authority, in violation of R.C. 2113.30, and was thus personally liable for alleged financial losses that occurred in the estate while under his control. She further sought a declaration that Klein was liable for losses to the estate attributable to the alleged violation of R.C. 2109.37.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Before Klein answered the complaint, he filed a motion pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B) to dismiss it. Klein contended, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court lacked jurisdiction over the matter in that neither R.C. 2113.30 nor 2109.37 <em>et seq. </em>is applicable. In reference to count one, Klein asserted that R.C. 2113.30 was irrelevant, \u201csince it only applies to businesses being conducted by the decedent at his death in the sole proprietorship and not the corporate form.\u201d Regarding count two, Klein asserted that R.C. 2109.39 was irrelevant \u201cbecause [Klein] did not invest in the shares of [the corporation and] the estate merely succeeded to those shares on the death of the decedent.\u201d Klein did not attach evidentiary material to his pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Sudnek filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion to dismiss. She did not attach evidentiary material to the memorandum but asserted that the corporation was a closely held corporation in which the decedent had been the sole shareholder. She asserted that R.C. 2113.30 applied to corporations of this nature as well as to sole proprietorships. She reiterated her contention that Klein was strictly liable for any decrease in value of the corporation occurring during the administration of the decedent\u2019s estate, in that Klein had failed to obtain court authorization for continuing the business\u2019s operation pursuant to R.C. 2113.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Klein filed a memorandum in reply, which set forth an extensive statement of facts, but which was not supported by affidavits or other sworn statements. He asserted that the business had been operated by the decedent\u2019s adult sons for about one year before Lauria\u2019s death and that decedent was survived by his wife and three adult children and was living with Sudnek at the time of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">Klein further asserted that, on the same day that Lauria executed his last will in which he bequeathed one hundred twenty-six shares of the stock of the corporation to Sudnek, the decedent also executed an agreement between the corporation, Sudnek, and decedent. Pursuant to the agreement, the corporation would purchase those same one hundred twenty-six shares from Sudnek within six months of Lauria\u2019s death for a price of $150,000. Klein attached a copy of this agreement to his brief but did not ask the court to convert his motion to one for summary judgment as authorized by Civ.R. 12(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>Klein further argued that, at the time of Lauria\u2019s death, the estate did not have sufficient cash to pay debts, taxes, and the widow\u2019s election, necessitating redemption of two hundred five shares of the total two hundred fifty shares of the stock of the corporation. (Klein did not, however, indicate the identity of the purchaser.) In addition, he claimed that Sudnek had agreed to defer the sale of whatever was ultimately determined to be her share of the remaining stock and to allow the decedent\u2019s sons to continue operating the corporate business until the proper distribution of the remaining shares was resolved. He contended that, as executor, he had taken no part in operation of the business and had no access to corporate funds or assets. He further asserted that the stock of the corporation was not registered under either state or federal law and that no market existed for the stock even had he resolved to sell it.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The trial court granted executor Klein\u2019s motion to dismiss as to count one only, determining that R.C. 2113.30 applies only to sole proprietorships and not to corporations that have a single shareholder. ' Count two was also dismissed by the court upon Klein\u2019s motion after opening statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">The court of appeals reversed the judgment in the executor\u2019s favor as to both counts of the complaint and remanded the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">The cause came before this court pursuant to the allowance of a discretionary appeal. The appellant has confined his arguments before us to issues concerning the court of appeals\u2019 reversal of the dismissal of count one of appellee\u2019s complaint. More specifically, appellant challenges the court of appeals\u2019 interpretation of R.C. 2113.30, including its determination that R.C. 2113.30 applies to estates where the decedent owned a majority interest of a closely held corporation as well as to sole proprietorships.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">In count one of the complaint, Sudnek alleged that the executor violated R.C. 2113.30, which provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b719-12\">\u201cExcept as otherwise directed by the decedent in his last will and testament, an executor or administrator may, without personal liability for losses incurred, continue the decedent\u2019s business during one month next following the date of the appointment of such executor or administrator, unless the probate court directs otherwise, and for such further time as the court may authorize on hearing and after notice to the surviving spouse and distributees. In either ease no debts incurred or contracts entered into shall involve the estate beyond the assets used in such business immediately prior to the death of the decedent without the approval of the court first obtained. During the time the business is continued, the executor or administrator shall file monthly reports in the court, setting forth the receipts and expenses of the business for the preceding month and such other pertinent information as the court may require. The executor or administrator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>may not bind the estate without court approval beyond the period during which the business is continued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">The weight of authority clearly supports the conclusion of the court of appeals that use of the term \u201cthe decedent\u2019s business\u201d in R.C. 2113.30 renders the statute applicable both to corporations in which the decedent was the sole shareholder and to sole proprietorships. See Bogert <em>&amp; </em>Bogert, Trusts and Trustees (2 Ed. Rev.1980) 303-304, Section 573 (\u201cThe power to authorize continuance [of the business] applies to sole proprietorships, and to cases of partnerships * * *. It also applies to the continuance of a business through complete or majority stock control of a corporation * * *.\u201d). See, also, <em>In re Estate of Kurkowski </em>(1979), 487 Pa. 295, 301, 409 A.2d 357, 360, fn. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">In my view, however, both parties have misinterpreted R.C. 2113.30 and inflated the importance in this case of the question whether R.C. 2113.30 applies to both closely held corporations and sole proprietorships. The statute does not impose a duty whose breach would require strict liability. Rather, the statute provides an executor a means of obtaining authority to continue a decedent\u2019s business, which authority is not recognized under the common law in the absence of a specific grant in the will or the consent of all heirs and devisees. It further provides immunity to an executor who acts in conformance with the statute in continuing a decedent\u2019s business. That this is so is evident from the language of the statute, which provides that \u201can executor or administrator <em>may, without personal liability for losses incurred, continue the decedent\u2019s business \u201d </em>pursuant to the statutory conditions which follow. (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, an executor who in fact continues a decedent\u2019s business after one month from the date of appointment as executor, without obtaining the sanction of the probate court pursuant to R.C. 2113.30, does so at his peril, should losses to the business be incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the factual assertions made by Sudnek in her complaint are true, liability for the depreciation in value of the corporation\u2019s stock, if any, during the years following Lauria\u2019s death has its origins in the common law. Thus, the \u201crule appears to be well established that a decedent\u2019s personal representative who, without testamentary authorization or the consent of all the persons interested, carries on his decedent\u2019s nonpartnership mercantile or manufacturing business except for the purpose of efficiently disposing of the assets is liable, as for a breach of trust, for any resultant losses.\u201d Annotation, Liability of Personal Representative for Losses Incurred in Carrying On, Without Testamentary Authorization, Decedent\u2019s Nonpartnership Mercantile or Manufacturing Business (1958), 58 A.L.R.2d 365, 366. See, also, 33 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1997), Decedents\u2019 Estates, Section 1410 <em>et seq.; Poindexter v. First Natl. Bank of Winston-Salem </em>(1956), 244 N.C. 191, 92 S.E.2d 773. R.C. 2113.30 does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>supplant this common-law rule. Rather, as correctly stated by the court of appeals, R.C. 2113.30 \u201csimply provides the probate court with a method of protecting the interests of the heirs, while at the same time <em>providing immunity </em>for the executor <em>who abides by the terms of the statute.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Both parties agree that the executor failed to seek an order from the probate court pursuant to R.C. 2113.30 authorizing continuation of the business of the corporation by executor Klein after one month from the date of his appointment. The parties similarly agree that Lauria\u2019s will did not specifically grant the executor power to continue operating the business of the corporation after Lauria\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Klein denies, however, as a factual matter, that he himself \u201ccontinued\u201d the business while serving as executor of the Lauria estate. He further asserts that Sudnek acquiesced to continued operation of the business by Lauria\u2019s adult children, thereby implying that Sudnek did not demand either sale of the corporation as a going concern or liquidation of the business. Whether these factual contentions are true is dependent upon evidence. The trial court had no evidence before it at the time it partially granted Klein\u2019s Civ. R. 12(B) motion and dismissed count one of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Irrespective of whether Klein was involved in decisionmaking as to the operation of the corporation or whether Sudnek consented to its continued operation, Sudnek\u2019s contention that Klein \u201cviolated\u201d R.C. 2113.30 is misplaced, in that the statute does not impose a duty upon an executor who does not seek to obtain its benefits. Klein\u2019s liability, if any, is based not upon violation of statutory duty but upon the common-law doctrine of breach of fiduciary trust, in that Klein may have exceeded the scope of his authority as executor or failed to expeditiously liquidate the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">I believe that count one of Sudnek\u2019s complaint, construed broadly, did state a claim of breach of trust on the part of the executor sufficient to overcome Klein\u2019s motion to dismiss and that Klein\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint, asserting lack of jurisdiction based on inapplicability of R.C. 2113.30, lacked merit. I therefore would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals insofar as it remanded count one of the complaint for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b721-9\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
