For the following reasons, however, Johnson\u2019s assertions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-12\">First, neither former R.C. 5145.01 nor 5145.02 imposed any duty on Judge Bettman to redetermine Johnson\u2019s sentence after he had allegedly completed his minimum prison term. See <em>State ex rel. Lanham v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth. </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 425, 427, 687 N.E.2d 283, 284-285.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-13\">Second, Johnson did not allege his entitlement to the requested extraordinary relief with sufficient particularity to withstand dismissal. <em>State ex rel. Fain v. Summit Cty. Adult Probation Dept. </em>(1995), 71 Ohio St.3d 658, 659, 646 N.E.2d 1113, 1114.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-14\">Finally, to the extent that Johnson claims that he is entitled to release from prison, habeas corpus, rather than mandamus, is the proper action. <em>State ex rel. Sampson v. Parrott </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 92, 694 N.E.2d 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-15\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-16\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b187-17\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
