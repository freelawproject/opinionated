Robert C. Muehreke, M.D., his attending physician, documented Petronio\u2019s continued temporary total disability with a series of medical reports; however, some of his reports represented that Petronio\u2019s condition had become permanent and others suggested that other nonallowed conditions had caused his disability. Dr. Muehreke later explained his conflicting reports, but appellee Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation (\u201cBWC\u201d) had already cut off Petronio\u2019s TTD and assessed an overpayment. Today we must decide whether appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio had authority to reject Dr. Muehrcke\u2019s explanation in administratively affirming the BWC\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The Court of Appeals for Franklin County denied Petronio\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus, ordering the commission (1) to vacate its order retroactively terminating TTD as of December 2, 1992, the first date on which Dr. Muehreke referred to Petronio\u2019s condition as \u201cpermanent,\u201d and assessing an overpayment, and (2) to reinstate his continuing TTD. The court of appeals found that the commission, as the exclusive evaluator of evidence, was free to reject Dr. Muehrcke\u2019s explanation for his conflicting reports. But in this appeal as of right, Petronio claims that the commission was required to credit Dr. Muehrcke\u2019s explanation under the rule in <em>State ex rel. Eberhardt v. Flxible Corp. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 649, 640 N.E.2d 815. We agree and, accordingly, reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Like Dr. Muehreke, the doctor in <em>Eberhardt </em>initially supplied information that suggested that the claimant\u2019s condition might have reached maximum medical improvement, or permanency; however, the doctor later clarified that the claimant might improve by participating in a rehabilitation program. We found that the doctor\u2019s reports, when taken together, proved that he had always considered the claimant\u2019s condition temporary. Thus, we held:</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">\u201cWhere a physician renders an ambiguous opinion regarding a claimant\u2019s medical condition but thereafter clarifies the ambiguity, the Industrial Commission may not revive the ambiguity as a basis for rejecting the physician\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Eberhardt </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">No one disputes that Dr. Muehreke explained in his last report to the commission that Petronio\u2019s condition was temporary, total, and the result of his injury at work. The <em>Eberhardt </em>rule required the commission to accept that explanation notwithstanding its authority to determine credibility. No other evidence of record established that Petronio\u2019s condition had become permanent or reached maximum medical improvement. Thus, we can only conclude that the commission abused its discretion in terminating Petronio\u2019s TTD and in declaring an overpayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">Accordingly, the court of appeals judgment is reversed, and a writ of mandamus is granted. The commission is ordered to vacate its order terminating Petronio\u2019s TTD and assessing an overpayment. The commission is further</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>ordered to continue Petronio\u2019s TTD consistent with Dr. Muehrcke\u2019s medical opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and unit granted.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b555-6\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
