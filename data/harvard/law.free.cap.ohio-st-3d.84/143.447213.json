Earlier in <em>Droe I, </em>we noted that \u201cif an attorney expects to remain on the rolls of those permitted to practice law in this state, he must demonstrate respect for his clients.\u201d <em>Droe I, </em>77 Ohio St.3d at 90, 671 N.E.2d at 231. As the stipulations show, respondent demonstrated repeated misconduct and neglect as well as failure to respect his clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">Respondent\u2019s earlier actions occurred in 1984 and 1990 and resulted in <em>Droe I. </em>His misconduct here began in 1990 and extended through 1996. We are satisfied that respondent\u2019s continued misconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation, as well as his neglect of his clients\u2019 legal matters, warrants an indefinite suspension from the practice of law. See <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Rea </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 71, 676 N.E.2d 514; <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Kaigler </em>(1991), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>57 Ohio St.3d 197, 566 N.E.2d 673. Accordingly, respondent is hereby indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Ohio. Costs taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b272-6\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.

Respondent\u2019s neglect and deceit has spanned more than ten years. Though this court sanctioned him before for this same sort of misconduct, respondent was undeterred! I therefore believe that the sanction imposed by the majority (allowing respondent to apply to be readmitted after two years) fails to adequately protect the public. Respondent has demonstrated that he is unworthy of clients\u2019 trust and thus should be permanently disbarred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
