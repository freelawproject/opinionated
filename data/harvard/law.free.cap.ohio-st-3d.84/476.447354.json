For the following reasons, we determine that the commission did not abuse its discretion. We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and deny the claimant\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-14\">The commission has exclusive authority to \u201chear and determine whether or not an injury, disease or death resulted because of the failure of the employer to comply with any specific requirement for the protection of the lives, health or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>safety of employees * * Section 35, Article II, Ohio Constitution. The findings of the commission are subject to correction by an action in mandamus only upon a showing of abuse of discretion. <em>State ex rel. Allerton v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 396, 23 O.O.3d 358, 433 N.E.2d 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">In most circumstances, a claimant\u2019s entitlement to workers\u2019 compensation is a substantive right measured by the law in effect at the time of the industrial injury. <em>State ex rel. Brown v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 45, 46, 623 N.E.2d 55, 56. The claimant in this case contends that 1986 safety regulations are applicable to the forklift in question at the time of Colliver\u2019s industrial injury in 1989. However, the employer claims that the law in effect at the time the forklift was placed into service governs.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Both the commission and the court of appeals determined that the applicable safety requirements were those in place when the forklift was placed into service in 1968, not the date of injury, relying on <em>State ex rel. Ohio Mushroom Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 47 Ohio St.3d 59, 547 N.E.2d 973. In <em>Ohio Mushroom, </em>the claimant suffered an industrial injury in 1982 while using a rototiller-like spawning machine that the employer had used since, 1972. The claimant asserted violations of safety requirements in effect on the date of injury. The commission granted a VSSR award and the court of appeals affirmed. However, this court reversed and issued the writ, holding that the commission incorrectly applied the safety code section effective at the date of the claimant\u2019s injury. The court in <em>Ohio Mushroom </em>explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">\u201cIn the case before us, the commission ruled that, based on claimant\u2019s 1982 date of injury, Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1-5 applied. Code applicability, however, is controlled by the date the machine in question was placed into service, not by the date of injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60, 547 N.E.2d at 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">In <em>Ohio Mushroom, </em>the court implicitly relied on former Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-01(A), which excused workshop or factory employers from compliance with safety requirements for the purpose of a VSSR injury sustained from an \u201cinstallation or construction\u201d built or contracted for after August 1, 1977, the effective date of the safety code.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Although the court in <em>Ohio Mushroom </em>did not specifically declare the spawning machine to be an installation or construction for purposes of Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-01(A), this finding is implicit, since the court grandfathered the machine into compliance with workshop and factory safety regulations that the employer would otherwise have violated. The employer claims that <em>Ohio Mushroom </em>is dispositive of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">The applicable clause, since amended as of January 1,1986, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>\u201cInstallations or constructions built or contracted for prior to the effective date (shown at the end of each rule) of any requirement shall be deemed to comply with the provisions of these requirements if such installations or constructions comply either with the provisions of these requirements or with the provisions of any applicable specific requirement which was in effect at the time contracted for or built.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">On the other hand, The claimant contends that <em>State ex rel. Commercial Lovelace Motor Freight, Inc. v. Lancaster </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 191, 22 OBR 275, 489 N.E.2d 288, controls. In <em>Commercial Lovelace, </em>the claimant was injured on the job in 1978 while driving a forklift truck. He alleged that his employer had violated certain safety requirements in effect on the date of his injury. The commission found the VSSR. The court of appeals denied the employer\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">This court in <em>Commercial Lovelace </em>affirmed, applying the safety regulations in effect at the time of injury. We refused to limit our review to the regulations in effect when the forklift was contracted for or built. The court stated that the \u201cforklift vehicles of the nature in question do not appear to be trade fixtures within the purview of the phrase \u2018installations or constructions.\u2019 \u201d But more importantly, the court reasoned that, even assuming that forklifts were installations or constructions, the employer was unable to objectively substantiate when the forklift was purchased and placed into service. <em>Id. </em>at 194, 22 OBR at 278, 489 N.E.2d at 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">We find that <em>Commercial Lovelace </em>does not definitively decide the issue of whether a vehicle is an \u201cinstallation\u201d or \u201cconstruction\u201d within the scope of Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-01(A). The court\u2019s remark that \u201cforklift vehicles * * * do not appear to be trade fixtures within the purview of the phrase \u2018installations or constructions\u2019 \u201d constitutes <em>dicta. </em>Because the employer was unable to verify or substantiate with any specificity the purchase date of the forklift truck, or when the machine was placed into service, the court did not need to definitively resolve the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">In addition, in <em>Ohio Mushroom, </em>the court made no explicit finding that the spawning machine was an \u201cinstallation\u201d or \u201cconstruction\u201d within the meaning of Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-01(A). Therefore, we find that neither <em>Ohio Mushroom </em>nor <em>Commercial Lovelace </em>is dispositive of this issue. Both cases involved different machines. They reached opposite conclusions for different reasons. Contrary to Armco\u2019s interpretation, <em>Ohio Mushroom </em>did not impliedly overrule <em>Commercial Lovelace.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">Instead, we look to the language of the safety code to see whether the coil tractor, a mobile object, is within the meaning of \u201cinstallations and constructions\u201d as those terms are used in Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-01(A). If the grandfather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>clause does not apply, then the safety regulations in effect when the industrial accident occurred in 1989 are applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The safety code does not define the words \u201cinstallations\u201d or \u201cconstructions.\u201d Armco claims that the drafters of the grandfather clause intended \u201cinstallations\u201d and \u201cconstructions\u201d to encompass everything for which the chapter establishes a safety requirement. This would, in effect, grandfather ladders, scaffolds, portable explosive fastening tools, hand tools, and other motorized vehicles and equipment regulated in the Ohio Administrative Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Armco\u2019s broad interpretation, however, ignores the plain meaning of \u201cinstallations\u201d and \u201cconstructions,\u201d words that customarily refer to something that can be installed or affixed to a structure. Vehicles generally are not thought of as having been installed or constructed. In addition, Armco\u2019s broad interpretation would provide employers with an exemption for a plethora of old machinery or equipment regardless of the size or cost. This would tacitly reward employers who retain outdated tools and other devices at the expense of employees\u2019 safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Although the drafters of the grandfather clause likely were sensitive to an employer\u2019s practical difficulty or undue hardship, we do not believe that they intended a blanket exemption for all pre-rules fixtures and equipment, including vehicles, equipment, and tools. Accordingly, we hold that a coil tractor is not an installation or construction for the purpose of Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-01(A) and is not subject to the grandfather clause. Consequently, Armco may be held liable for any failure to comply with specific safety requirements in effect in 1989 on the date of Colliver\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">With respect to Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1 \u2014 5\u201413(F)(1)(g) (\u201cEmployees shall not be required to operate any truck that is not equipped with an adequate, properly maintained braking system.\u201d), we concur with the commission\u2019s interpretation that the focus of the section is to protect the driver or operator, not bystanders or other employees. The commission concluded that the driver, Ronald Carr, an Armco maintenance person, was not, in fact, \u201coperating\u201d the vehicle. Rather, his only purpose was to test the brakes by moving the truck backward and forward. Therefore, the commission did not abuse its discretion in determining that there is no violation of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">With respect to Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-13(F)(l)(d) (\u201cTrucks shall not be altered * * * by the elimination of any parts.\u201d), there was evidence in the record that the employer\u2019s prior removal of the emergency brake did not cause the accident and Colliver\u2019s death. Therefore, there is no proximate cause and no violation of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">Finally, with respect to Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-13(F)(l)(h) (\u201cOnly employees who have been trained and authorized by their employers shall be required to operate a powered industrial truck.\u201d), the commission again determined that the</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Armco maintenance person was not operating the vehicle but merely testing the brakes. We find that the commission\u2019s narrow construction of \u201coperate\u201d was reasonable. Furthermore, Carr was adequately experienced to test the coil tractor and had trained other employees in using coil tractors. Thus, there is some evidence for the commission\u2019s determination that Armco did not commit a VSSR by authorizing Carr to test the brakes of the coil tractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Therefore, some evidence exists for the commission\u2019s findings, and its decision is not an abuse of discretion. <em>State ex rel.
