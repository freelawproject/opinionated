Dr. William Kay\u2019s March 24, 1997 report specifically attributed claimant\u2019s temporary total disability solely to claimant\u2019s allowed conditions. Recoupment of this payment is, therefore, a moot question.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">No one .contests relator\u2019s right to recover for medical exp\u00e9nses paid for \u201ctraumatic iritis left eye\u201d and \u201cstrain and/or myofascitis of the lumbar area\u201d\u2014 conditions that were ultimately disallowed by the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County. At issue is the statute governing relator\u2019s recovery \u2014 former R.C. 4123.515 or 4123.511(J). Pursuant to our recent decision in <em>State ex rel. Roadway Express v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 510, 696 N.E.2d 1064, we find that relator\u2019s recovery rights are controlled by former R.C. 4123.515.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">A writ of mandamus directing the commission to vacate its award of TTD compensation is denied. A writ of procedendo directing respondent Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation to determine the amount of Surplus Fund reimbursement for medical expenses to which relator is entitled is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b441-12\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
