Watts v. Schottenstein Stores Corp. </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 118, 623 N.E.2d 1202. Therefore, voluntary acts by a claimant that limit income can foreclose wage-loss compensation. <em>State ex rel Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. v. Morse </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 210, 648 N.E.2d 827.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-13\">The commission, in this case, found a voluntary limitation of income, citing claimant\u2019s failure to replace his lost fireman/EMT wages by \u201cincreased labors\u201d in his insurance business or elsewhere. Fatal to this reasoning, however, is the commission\u2019s inherent assumption that claimant was medically capable of increasing his labors. The commission does not dispute claimant\u2019s description of his insurance agent position as having \u201cminimal physical demands.\u201d Dr. Grow nevertheless concluded that claimant\u2019s allowed conditions were such that a restriction in the number of hours that claimant could do such work was necessary. Since there is no evidence that claimant was working fewer hours than the maximum medically permitted, the commission abused its discretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>expecting claimant to devote more hours to either his insurance business or any other employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and return the cause to the commission with instructions that it vacate its denial of wage-loss compensation, determine the dates over which such compensation is payable, and issue an appropriate order.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause returned.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b185-7\">Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b185-8\">Moyer, C.J., Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b185-9\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AJg\">dissenting. I respectfully dissent. I do not find Dr. Grow\u2019s opinion conclusive that DiRosa is unable to work at <em>any </em>employment longer than eight hours per day. Therefore, I agree with the court of appeals that this claimant failed to prove that he qualifies for wage-loss compensation as a result of his allowed conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">The claimant suffers from a soft tissue injury. Dr. Grow opined that DiRosa is medically restricted from any heavy lifting, but that he is capable of returning to his job as an insurance agent. Dr. Grow\u2019s additional statement that DiRosa \u201cis able to work no more than 8 hours a day as an insurance agent\u201d is conclusory and unsubstantiated by the facts or medical evidence. This is insufficient evidence that DiRosa is physically unable to perform any other types of employment in an effort to replace the income lost from his fireman/EMT position.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">Therefore, I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b185-12\">Moyer, C.J., and Cook, J., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
