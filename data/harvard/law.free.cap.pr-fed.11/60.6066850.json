It seems that the. ground of nondelivery of the order made by the local \u25a0clerk is that the Attorney General\u2019s order in question is not part of the record and proceeding in the suit in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The remedy prescribed by \u00a7 35 is not an order to the local \u2022court to deliver copies; but this court shall direct .such, record to be supplied by affidavit or otherwise, as the circumstances of the case may require and allow. It would seem that the circumstances of this case require that the copy of the regulations in question be supplied on the part of the applicant by affidavit, the more particularly as the petition itself says the circular was published in the local press, and, as no objection was made by the Insular Department of Justice, it might tend to show that it was a correct copy. That, however, is a question of evidence, and not of pleading; and all that seems necessary at present is to direct that the paper desired be supplied by affidavit of de- \u2022 fendant. How far it is a true copy would be a matter of pleading, and may be passed on later.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
