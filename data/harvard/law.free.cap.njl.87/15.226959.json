J. L. </em>281; <em>State </em>v. <em>Herron, </em>77 <em>Id. </em>523.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">The legal controversy is whether or not upon the facts so found the conviction can be sustained, which was raised in the trial court by the denial of a motion to direct an acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Counsel for the plaintiff in error correctly contends that both the willful wrong doing that constitutes malice in the law and also, an intention to inflict injury are of the essence of a criminal assault; and that, as a necessary corollary, mere negligence will not sustain a conviction for such crime. With these abstract propositions no fault is to be found, provided it is borne in mind that .the necessary malice may be implied from the doing of an unlawful thing from which injury is reasonably to be apprehended and also that an intention to injure need not be specifically directed to the particular individual that was injured, but may be inferred in law from the consequences that are naturally to be apprehended as the result of the particular act, the doing of which was intentional. \u201cThe prisoner,\u201d said Chief Justice Lord Coleridge, in <em>Queen </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>8 <em>Q. B. Div. </em>54, \u201cmust be taken to have intended the natural consequences of that which he did. He acted unlawfully and maliciously, not that he had any personal malice against the particular individual injured, but, in the sense of doing an act calculated to injure, and by which others were, in fact, ifljured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">The facts of the case from which this language is quoted were that the defendant was in the gallery of a theater which was reached by a staircase lighted by gaslights, at the bottom of which was a pair of folding doors. At the end of the performance the defendant ran quickly down the stairs- turning out, as he went, the gaslights on the-middle and lower landing and closing with a bar the doors of exit, as a consequence of which there was a jam on the staircase in which several persons were injured. These facts and the language of the indictment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>which is quoted render the exposition of the legal rules entirely applicable to the question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Other cases illustrative of the same rules are <em>People </em>v. <em>Moorehouse, </em>6 <em>N. Y. Supp. </em>763; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>100 <em>Pa. St. </em>324; <em>People </em>v. <em>Raher, </em>92 <em>Mich. </em>165; <em>State </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>19 <em>Iowa </em>517; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>157 <em>Mass. </em>551; in which a large number of cases are cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The industry of counsel has not furnished nor have I been able to find a decided case in which the assault was committed with an automobile, a. comparatively modern appliance, but the principles involved are as old as the criminal law itself. Indeed, counsel for the plaintiff in error does not seriously controvert these principles, but, on the contrary bases his argument, as I understand it, upon his other contention, viz., that a mere act of negligence will not sustain a conviction for assault and battery. Eor this proposition, which needs no external support, he cites as authority the <em>dictum </em>of Mr. J uetice Dixon in <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>65 <em>N. J. L. </em>598, who, in commenting upon the ease of <em>State </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>32 <em>Id. </em>169, said: \u201cCertainly, if death had not erisned from his negligence, hut only personal injury, a charge of assault and battery could not have been sustained.\u201d The case of State <em>v. </em>O\u2019Brien was a conviction of manslaughter under an indictment that charged that offence based upon the negligence of the defendant in the tending of a railroad switch, and State <em>v. </em>Thomas was a review of a conviction for assault and battery under an indictment for manslaughter,, which it was hold as\u2019a <em>matter of pleading </em>did not distinctly set forth the offence of which the defendant was * convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">The. <em>dictum </em>quoted went, therefore, fax1 \"beyond the decision in that it dealt hypothetically with the substantive criminal law, whereas the decision was rested solely upon the degree of certainty required by the rules of criminal pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">The line of reasoning on which this <em>dictum </em>rested was that manslaughter -based upon negligence 'and excluding malice had nothing in common with assault and battery, which necessarily includes malice. With the soundness of this reasoning we are not now concerned, since it has no foundation in fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>in the case before us in which we are not dealing with an indictment for manslaughter or with an assault and battery that resulted from negligence. On the contrary, we are dealing with a willful act done under circumstances that rendered likely the infliction of such an injury as that which actually resulted from it. In such a case 'to argue from the- assumed premise that if death had occurred the crime would have been manslaughter is a complete begging of the question; in the very case referred to, <em>i. e., </em>State <em>v. </em>O\u2019Brien, Mr. Justice Dalyrmple was careful to say: \u201cIf the defendant\u2019s omission of duty was willful or, in other words, if his will concurred in his negligence, he was guilty of murder/\u2019 The running of a car at a high rate of speed is an act in which the will of the driver concurs and hence is clearly a willful act as distinguished from merely negligent conduct when considered with respect to the state of mind of the offender, which is what the criminal law considers.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The civil law, on the contrary, disregards this distinction in awarding compensation in damages, and as is pointed out in <em>Evers </em>v. Davis, 86 <em>N. J. L. </em>196, groups together both willful and negligent acts in its effort to compel tort-feasors to make compensation for injuries without regard to the state of mind with which they were inflicted. The civil action of -negligence, therefore, throws no light upon the distinction made by the criminal law between a willful and a negligent act.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">With this misleading test and the fallacious hypothesis of manslaughter out of the way, it requires neither argument nor illustration to show that the excessive rate of speed at which an automobile is driven is a product of the will of its driver and not the result of his mere inattention or negligence. The two cannot be confused any more than the hurling of a baseball bat into a crowd of spectators could be confused with its accidentally slipping from the hand of the batter. If a blow inflicted in the former manner would constitute an assault, so must a blow inflicted by a willful act applied to a much more dangerous agency, since it cannot be that what would be 'a crime if done with a plaything weighing a few ounces ceases to be a crime if committed with an engine weigh<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>ing thousands of pounds driven by many horse powers of force. It has often been held that responsibility increases with the likelihood of injury, but never the reverse, that I am aware of.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">There is, therefore, no legal reason why the crime of assault and battery may not be committed by driving an automobile \u2022on a public highway at a rate of speed that endangers the safety of other persons and actually results in such an injury. This being so it was not error for the trial court to deny the motion to acquit and the judgment of the Hudson Sessions is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
