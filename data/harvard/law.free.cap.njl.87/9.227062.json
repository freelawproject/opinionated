And that afterwards this ticket was presented for passage by the said female plaintiff, and was then taken up by the defendant\u2019s conductor, because it had become forfeited by reason of its having been presented for passage by a person other than herself, contrary to the terms of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The ground of attack upon this plea, as exhibited by the demurrer, is not that the contract of forfeiture is invalid, but that by its provisions the railroad company is only entitled to lift the ticket at the time of its presentation by a person other than him, or her, to whom it is issued. Apparently the pleader overlooked the scope of our decision in <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad Co, </em>77 <em>N. J. L. </em>2.78. In that case we held, not only that a stipu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>lation in a commutation ticket that it is not transferable, and if offered for passage by any other person than him to whom it is issued it will be forfeited and taken up by the conductor, was valid and binding, but we further held that where a commutation ticket containing such a stipulation has been offered by any other person than him to whom it is issued, the right of the company to take it up is not limited to the occasion when it is presented by such person; and that if the condition has been already violated the ticket may be taken up subsequently when presented by the owner himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The rule laid down in that case is controlling in this court, and under it the defendant is entitled to judgment. It will be so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
