The indictment, in express terms, charges that the defendants did <em>unlawfully </em>and <em>injuriously, </em>on a public highway leading from Dover to Landing, in Morris county, put, place and maintain a certain bridge. The public highway upon which the bridge is put is described in the indictment to be the public highway leading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>from Dover to Landing. This is followed by an allegation that the defendants did suffer and permit the same to be and remain in and upon the said public highway. The only public highway designated before as such, in the indictment, is the public highway leading from Dover to Landing. The words \u201cdid suffer and permit the same to be and remain in and upon said public highway\u201d relate to the public highway leading from Dover to Landing. Nowhere in the indictment is the Morris canal designated as a public highway, though the pleader, in describing the unlawful structure on the highway, designates it as \u201cBrown\u2019s bridge, across a certain canal maintained and occupied by the defendants:\u201d hut, since it is wholly unimportant as to the character of the structure on the public highway, whether it is a bridge or something else, if it be unlawfully on the highway, such an allegation may be properly treated as surplusage. The pleader having charged that the bridge ivas unlawfully put by the defendants in and upon a public highway, and that they suffer and permit it to be and remain upon the said public highway, then alleges \u201cwhereby the said public highway (the public highway leading from Dover to Landing) on the day and year aforesaid, &amp;c., was obstructed and straitened,\u201d &amp;c., to the inconvenience and common nuisance of traffic, \u201cthrough and along the public highways.\u201d Here the word \u201chighways\u201d must he read in the singular instead of the plural, in view of ivhat has gone before.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The unlawful placing of an obstruction in a public highway to the inconvenience of and injury of the general public is a nuisance. And it is of no consequence how little or how much of the public highway is encroached upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\"><em>Durant </em>v. <em>Palmer, 29 N. J. L. </em>544, 577; <em>Opdycke </em>v. <em>Public Service Railway Co., </em>78 <em>Id. </em>576, 583, where the cases on the subject are collated by Chancellor Pitney, speaking for the Court of Errors and Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Upon this motion we are not concerned with any other matter except what appears on the face of the indictment. It may turn out that the prosecutor will fail in his proof that the structure was unlawfully put upon the public highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>The fact that the Morris Canal and Banking Company, by section 12 of its charter <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1824, <em>p. </em>158), is authorized in certain cases to make good and sufficient bridges across the canal, &amp;c., and that this is a duty imposed upon them by law, affords no legal excuse to a charge that it has unlawfully and injuriously placed in and upon a public highway a structure to the common nuisance of the travelers on the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">We. cannot, at tlris stage of the case, consider whether the counsel of the state will be able to substantiate, at the trial, by competent evidence, the facts as set out in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The views that we have expressed in discussing the merits of the first two. objections made by counsel of defendants against the validity of the indictment, practically disposes of the other two grounds urged by them adversely to their contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">It is sufficient for us to ascertain whether the indictment charges an indictable offence, and we think it does, and therefore the motion to quash will be denied and the indictment remitted to the Morris County Quarter Sessions Court, to be proceeded with according to law.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
