R. Co., 140 U.S. 91, 11 S.Ct. 673, 35 L.Ed. 339; Kansas City S. R. Co. v. Guardian Trust Co., 281 U.S. 1, 50 S.Ct. 194, 74 L.Ed. 659; Harrison v. McPherson, 8 Cir., 226 F. 198; In re Sanford F. &amp; T. Co., 160 U.S. 247, 16 S.Ct. 291, 40 L.Ed. 414; Ex parte Union Steamboat Company, 178 U.S. 317, 20 S.Ct. 904, 44 L.Ed. 1084; and</p>\n<p id=\"b450-17\">It being further the view of this court that the rule established by the cited cases has not been modified by Rule 60 of the Rules of Civil Procedure for the District Courts of the United States, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, either by reason of sub-division (a) or sub-division (b) thereof, because failure to include interest in the judgment was not through the mistake, inadvertance or neglect 'of the District Judge, or of the clerk, but was in pursuance of the direct command of the court with respect to the verdict and the judgment ; and</p>\n<p id=\"b450-18\">It being further the view of this court that sub-division (a) or (b) of rule 60, while enlarging the power of the District Courts over judgments without respect to the running of the term of court, does not confer upon District Courts the power to alter or amend a judgment affirmed by this court or by the Supreme Court of the United States, for such alteration or amendment would be not the correction of a mistake, judicial or clerical, but an alteration or amendment of a decision of the reviewing court, -which it is not within the power of the District Courts to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-19\">Wherefore, it is hereby ordered that the order entered 'below on August 15, 1939, correcting and amending the judgment, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>hereby set aside with direction to the District Court to comply with the mandate heretofore issued out of this court and on file in the office of the clerk of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
