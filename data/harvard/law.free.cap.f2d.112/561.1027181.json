We are of the opinion that the petition should be denied. The injunction to be issued by the District Court, in accordance with the mandate of this court, will enjoin the appellee from using the word \u201cFriendly\u201d, either in or separate from the name of his business, with re-spent to the display or sale of shoes, in such a way as to be likely to confuse the public and lead them to suppose that his shoes have been made by the appellant. We assume that the appellee will obey the injunction; but if he does not, the appellant may apply to the District Court to issue a rule against him to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt of court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
