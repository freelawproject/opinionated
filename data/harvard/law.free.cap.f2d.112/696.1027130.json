S. Gray and Margaret Gray, individually, and H. S. Gray, as next friend for John Herbert Gray and Peggy Gray,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brought this action against Myrta Blight, administratrix of the estate of H. E. Blight, deceased,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to recover damages for personal injuries and for damages to the automobile of H. S. Gray.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-17\">In their complaint, plaintiffs alleged that the damages resulted from a collision between the automobile of H. S. Gray and an automobile owned, driven, and operated by Blight; that the collision occurred near the town of Winnemucca, Nevada; that it was caused by the negligence of Blight in the management, operation, and control of his automobile; that plaintiffs are residents and citizens of Texas; that at the time of the collision Blight was a resident and citizen of Colorado; that Blight died on or about October 6, 1938; and that Myrta Blight is the duly appointed, qualified, and acting administratrix of the estate of Blight and is a resident and citizen of Colorado.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-18\">The administratrix filed a motion to dismiss the action on the ground that the complaint fails to state a claim against her upon which relief can be granted. The trial court sustained the motion, plaintiffs elected not to plead further, and judgment was entered dismissing the action. Plaintiffs have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-19\">The substantive rights of the parties to an action are governed by the lex loci, that is, the law of the place where the right was acquired or the liability was incurred\" which constitutes the claim or cause of action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under the laws of Nevada a cause of action for personal injuries, whether suit has been brought thereon or not, is not abated by reason of the death of the wrongdoer, but survives against his legal representatives. Nevada Comp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>Laws, 1929, 1938 Pocket Part, Vol. 1, \u00a7\u00a7 240.01, 240.02. It follows that the cause of action survived the death of Blight. On the other hand, the law of the jurisdiction in which relief is sought controls as to all matters pertaining to remedial, as distinguished from substantive rights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The principles are stated in the Restatement, Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 390, which in part reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-4\">\u201cWhether a claim for damages for a tort survives the death of the tort-feasor or of the injured person is determined by the law of the place of wrong. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-15\">\u201c(b) If a claim for damages for injury survives the death of the injured person or the wrongdoer, as the case may be, by the law of the place of wrong, recovery may be had upon it by or against the representative of the decedent, provided the law of the state of forum permits the representative of the decedent to sue or be sued on such a claim. Without such power created by the law of the state of suit, no recovery can be had.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-16\">The Restatement finds support in the adjudicated cases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>Sec. 1, ch. 159, 1935 Colo.Stat.Ann., in part reads as follows: \u201cThe common law of England, so far as the same is applicable and of a general nature, and all acts and statutes of the British parliament, made in aid of or to supply the defects of the common law prior to the fourth year of James the First * * *, and which are of a general nature, and not local to that kingdom, shall be the rule of decision, and shall be considered as of full force until repealed by legislative authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ajs-dedup-0\">Sec. 247, ch. 176, 1935 Colo.Stat.Ann., reads as follows: \u201cAll actions in law whatsoever, save and except actions on the case for slander or libel, or trespass for injuries done to the person, and actions brought for the recovery of real estate, shall survive to and against executors, administrators and conservators.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">Chapter 176 was first adopted in 1868. See. Stat.Colo. 1868, ch. XC, \u00a7 154.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It was re-enacted in 1903. See \u00a7 167, ch. 181, p. 533, 1903, Colo.Sess.Laws. In the reenactment the phrase \u201cactions at law\u201d was changed to read \u201cactions in law\u201d and the words \u201cand conservators\u201d were added at the end of the section. In Letson v. Brown, 11 Colo.App. 11, 52 P. 287, 288, the court said: \u201cThe suit was begun against Brown, who is the administrator of the decedent. The naked question, therefore, is whether the wrongdoer being dead, this suit may be maintained against his personal representative. It could not at the common law, for it was a well-settled principle thereunder that all personal actions, whether by the representatives of a deceased person or against those of one who was dead, died with the injured party; or, as it has been sometimes expressed in other cases as to the wrongdoer, the wrong and the wrongdoer w.ere burie.d in the grave together. We take it to be as well settled in the one case as in the other, and that it is equally true that, where the wrongdoer dies, his personal representative may not be sued for the negligent act, any more than could the representatives of the injured person, he being dead, maintain an action against the living wrongdoer. This principle has been often declared, and it will add nothing to the force of this opinion, nor will it embellish the law, to restate the reasons upon which the rule rests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-11\">The court then held that an action for wrongful death could not be maintained against the administrator of the estate of the wrongdoer. In Mumford v. Wright, 12 Colo.App. 214, 55 P. 744, 746, the court construed the phrase \u201ctrespass for injuries done to the person,\u201d saying: \u201cTorts may be divided into two general classes, \u2014 the first, designated as \u2018property torts,\u2019 embracing all injuries and damages to property, real or personal; the second, known as \u2018personal torts,\u2019 including all .injuries to the person, whether to reputation, feelings, or to the body. A tort which is not an injury to property is a personal tort. * * * It will be readily seen that the chief difficulty lies in determining the exact meaning of the words \u2018trespass for injuries done to the person.\u2019 In a recent case this court, in construing this section, held that these words, as there used, could not be construed to mean only trespass vi et armis, but that the exception embraced, also, torts for which trespass on the case must have been brought. Letson v. Brown, 11 Colo.App. 11, 52 P. 287. We now go further, and hold that the words were intended to embrace, and do embrace, all actions for personal torts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-14\">In Munal v. Brown, C.C., 70 F. 967, United States District Judge Hallett held that an action for damages for personal injuries does not survive to and against executors and administrators by virtue of \u00a7 154, ch. XC, Rev. Stat.Colo. 1868.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-15\">It is significant that \u00a7 247, supra, as first enacted, was embraced in a chapter on wills, executors, and administrators, that when reenacted in 1903, it was embraced in a chapter on wills-estates, and that it was carried forward into the 1935 Colo.Stat.Ann. in the chapter on wills and estates. We are of the opinion that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>declares the public policy of Colorado to permit the prosecution of certain causes of action against the executor or administrator of the wrongdoer after his death, but to exclude therefrom causes of action for injuries to the person.</p>\n<p id=\"a0m-dedup-0\">Foreign law will not be enforced in the courts of a state under the doctrine of comity where it is contrary to the pub-lie policy of such state.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AOs\">A state may deny a remedy in its courts upon a tort arising in another jurisdiction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A6z\">In Stanley v. Petherbridge, 96 Colo. 293, 42 P.2d 609, it was expressly held that \u00a7 247, supra, does not offend the provision of Art. 2, \u00a7 6, of the state Constitution which provides that \u201cCourts of justice shall be open to every persdn, and a speedy remedy afforded for every injury to person, property or character.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"aqq-dedup-1\">We conclude that the plaintiffs could not maintain actions m Colorado against the administratrix for personal injuries and that the motion as to those claims was properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"arm-dedup-0\">The plaintiff, H. S. Gray, however, asserted two claims, one for personal injuries in the sum of $3,000, and one for damages to his automobile in the sum of $1,050. The claims were properly joined. Rule 18, Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c. An action for damages to the automobile could be prosecuted against the adminis-tratrix. See Mumford v. Wright, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"AdDC\">The jurisdictional amount is the sum of all the claims which are properly joined.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The test of jurisdiction is the amount claimed in good faith and not the actual amount determined to be in controversy.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There can be no doubt that both claims were asserted by H. S. Gray in \u00a3ood faith and that combined they exceed, exclus,lve \u00b0f \u201cterest and costs,_ the sum or vaIue.of $3.\u2019000- 0ther Jurisdictional Prerequisites being; present, it follows that *e. court e\"ed \u201c dismissing the comPlamt as t0,the claim of H. S. Gray for damages to Ins automobile,</p>\n<p id=\"AIn5\">The judgment is affirmed as to the plaintiffs Margaret Gray and H. S. Gray, as next fr\u00a1end of John Herbert Q and p G The jud t is reversed as tQ R s_ G and the cause \u00a1s remand. ed w\u00a1th instructions t0 overrule tfle mo. tion as to the claim of H. S.

Stern, 264 N.Y. 379, 191 N.E. 23, 24, 25, certiorari denied 293 U.S. 597, 55 S.Ct. 112, 79 L.Ed. 690; Woollen v. Lorenz, 68 App.D.C. 389, 98 F.2d 261; In re Killough\u2019s Estate, 148 Misc. 73, 265 N.Y.S. 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">In Herzog v. Stern, supra, action was brought in New York to recover for personal injuries alleged to have been sustained by the plaintiff through the negligence of the defendant\u2019s testator in an automobile accident which occurred in Virginia. Both plaintiff and the testator were residents of New York at the time of the accident and when the action was brought the testator\u2019s estate was being administered in New York. In the opinion the court said [264 N.Y. 379, 191 N.E. 24]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-13\">\u201cThe question, however, is not whether the cause of action created by the laws of the state of Virginia survives the death of the wrongdoer, but whether the law of this state permits the representative of the deceased wrongdoer to be sued on such a claim. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-14\">\u201cThis state has undoubted power to determine the devolution of the property of a deceased resident and how such property shall be administered. It determines upon what claims a suit may be brought against the representatives of the decedent, and payment be enforced out of the assets of the estate. A transitory cause of action may constitute a property right. It. may' even be regarded as a vested right against the wrongdoer. There can, however, he no vested right to enforce a claim for damages out of the property of a deceased resident of this state unless there is a law which permits the property of such a decedent to be applied upon the claim. At common law a claim for personal injury did not survive and could not be enforced out of the property or against the personal representatives of the deceased wrongdoer. The common law has in this regard not been changed by the Legislature. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9F\">\u201cWhere neither common law nor a statute permits the bringing of an action against executors or administrators of a deceased resident, the courts of this state are without jurisdiction to pass upon such a cause of action. There is here no room for speculation as to whether the cause of action against the representatives of the deceased wrongdoer created by the laws of the state of Virginia offends our public policy. The rights and obligations of executors and administrators appointed by our courts are defined by our law, and our courts are without jurisdiction to grant a judgment binding on the executors or administrators appointed here unless our law makes provision for such actions against executors and administrators. Each state may define the rights and obligations of those who come within its territorial bounds, and comity will ordinarily cause the sister states to permit the enforcement of such rights and obligations against their residents by resort to their courts, but no state has any power to provide that such rights and obligations may be enforced out of the property of a deceased wrongdoer in the possession of executors</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-16\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>or administrators appointed by the courts of another state. Here comity does not determine the jurisdiction of the courts of the decedent\u2019s domicile. The courts are without jurisdiction, because neither common law nor statutory law provides for the maintenance of any action for personal injury against the executors or administrators of a deceased wrongdoer.\u201d Compare Chubbuck v. Holloway, 182 Minn. 225, 234 N.W. 314, 868; Kert-son v. Johnson, 185 Minn. 591, 242 N. W. 329, 85 A.L.R. 1.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b761-18\"> See Munal v.
