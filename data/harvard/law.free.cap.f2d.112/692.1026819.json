The contract in part provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b755-19\">\u201cNo moneys, payable under contract, or any part thereof, except the estimate for the first month or period, shall become due and payable if the Commission so elects, until the Contractor shall satisfy the said Commission that he has fully settled or paid for all materials and equipment used in or upon the work and labor done in connection therewith, and the Commission, if it so elects, may pay any or all such bills, wholly or in part and deduct the amount or amounts so paid from any monthly or final estimate, excepting the first estimate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-20\">Joyce, as principal, and Standard Accident Insurance Company of Detroit, Michigan, hereinafter called Standard, as surety, executed two bonds conditioned that Joyce would faithfully perform the terms of the construction contract and would pay for all labor and materials. By the provisions of \u00a1he application for the bonds Joyce agreed that Standard, as surety, should be subrogated to all the rights, privileges and properties of Joyce, as principal, in the construction contract, and assigned, transferred, and conveyed to Standard all the deferred payments and retained percentages, and all moneys and properties that might be due and payable to Joyce at the time of a breach or default by Joyce, or that might thereafter become due and payable on account of the contract. The application for the bonds stated that payments were to be made on monthly estimates, 90 per cent thereof to be paid and 10 per cent retained.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>Joyce entered into the performance of the contract. The Federal National Bank of Shawnee, Oklahoma, hereinafter called the Bank, advanced moneys to Joyce and as security therefor, on May 18, 1937, took an assignment from Joyce of Estimate No. 1. Estimate No. 1 amounted to $1,776.51.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">On July 27, 1937, the Commission declared Joyce in default in performance of the contract. At the time of the default, Joyce owed labor and material bills aggregating $2,707.85. Standard completed the performance of the contract at a cost of $8,500. It also paid the bills for labor and materials and took assignments thereof. The estimates other than the first were paid to Standard. It suffered a net loss of $1,-783.07 in carrying out the contract. Standard brought this action against Joyce, the Commission, the Bank, and others claiming subrogation to the funds in the hands of the Commission covering Estimate No. 1. The Bank set up its assignment and alleged that it was filed with the Commission and accepted by it on June 21, 1937.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">From a judgment denying Standard\u2019s claim of subrogation and awarding the Bank judgment against the Commission for $1,776.51, Standard has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-24\"> To constitute a novation the creditor must unconditionally release the original debtor and accept a third person in his stead.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Clearly, the assignment did not effect a novation. It was taken as collateral security and the Bank did not discharge Joyce from its obligation to pay the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-25\">On completion of the construction contract and the payment of claims for labor and materials by Standard, it was subrogated to all the securities and remedies which the Commission was capable of asserting against Joyce.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-26\">Where a surety of a construction' contractor, upon the contractor\u2019s default, completes the contract, and the contractee has funds in his hands earned by the contractor, the surety is entitled to be subrogated to the rights which the contractee, upon the contractor\u2019s default, could assert against such funds, to the extent necessary to reimburse the surety for the outlay made to complete the contract. This right to the funds embraces not only retained percentages,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but other funds earned by the contractor remaining in the hands of the contractee.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It extends to any earned funds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>held by the contractee because, on default by the contractor, the contractee upon completion of the contract itself, could recoup its loss from any funds in its hands earned by the contractor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"aqx-dedup-0\">While the breach by Joyce was subsequent to the assignment to the Bank and notice thereof to the Commission, the right to claim damages for breach of the contract existed at the time the contract was made and the Commission would have been entitled, as against the Bank, to withhold the funds in its hands, earned by Joyce, to recoup the state\u2019s loss.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\"> While this right of subrogation accrued when Standard fully performed the construction contract, it related back to the date it entered into the contract-of surety-ship.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Hence, it was prior in time and right to the rights of the Bank under its assignment, and it could not be cut off by an intermediate assignment of Joyce to the Bank.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AqA7\">The equities of Standard are superior to the Bank\u2019s not only because Standard\u2019s right to subrogation is prior in time, but' also because it acted under compulsion of its contractual obligations and the Bank acted voluntarily in advancing the funds,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and notice of the suretyship contract was imputed to the Bank. It is charged with knowledge that public contractors are required to give bond conditioned for the performance of their contracts by \u00a7 10095, O.S.1931, 69 Okl.St.Ann. \u00a7 48.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-35\">This right to subrogation is not dependent upon the contractual provisions found in the application for the bond. It arises independently of contract by operation ol law under familiar principles of equity.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-36\">It follows that the rights of Standard are superior to those of the Bank and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>was entitled to the funds retained by th Commission covering Estimate No. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"ajy-dedup-0\">The judgment is reversed and the caus is remanded with instructions to enter judgment adjudging that Standard's dat to Estimate No. 1 is prior and superior t the Bank's claim under its assignment, an awarding Standard its costs against th Bank. The costs in this court will be as sessed against the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"ASl\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Tile assignment was duly filed with the Commission. On June 21, 1937, it placed the following notation thereon: \u201cThis is to certify that the above de-. scribed claim has been audited, approved and allowed by the Oklahoma State Highway Commission. Warrant, when payable, will be issued direct to Assignee.\u201d Estimate No. 1 has not been paid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b756-7\"> Standard Sanitary Mfg. Co. v.
