Code, \u00a7 811(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-24\">William Bueknell, a resident of Pennsylvania, died testate in 1890. He bequeathed to his daughter, Harriet M. Hopper, a share of the income for life from a trust fund with a general power of appointment by will as to a proportionate share in the corpus of the trust. In default of appointment by Mrs. Hopper, the trustees were to assign and convey the share of principal in the trust upon her death to her children in equal shares and to the children of any deceased child of hers, per stirpes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>\u2022 Harriet M. Hopper, the daughter, also a resident of Pennsylvania, died May 11, 1934. By her last will, she devised and bequeathed the property, over which she had a power of appointment under her father\u2019s will, in trust with directions to her trustees to divide the income therefrom into a sufficient number of equal shares to pay one share to each of her children surviving her or to the issue of any deceased child, per stirpes, and one share to her surviving grandchildren and the issue of any deceased grandchild. Her will further provided that this distribution of income should continue until the death of her last surviving child, at which time the principal of the trust was to be divided equally among her then surviving grandchildren per capita and the surviving issue of any deceased grandchild per stirpes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mrs. Hopper left surviving her four children and no issue of any deceased, child. By the limitations of her will, each of her four children took a one-fifth interest for life in the income from the trust and her grandchildren, as a class, took the remaining one-fifth of the income for the duration of the trust and the whole of the corpus in remainder as already stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">The executors of Mrs. Hopper\u2019s will filed a federal estate tax return in which they included in her gross estate the full value of the property over which she had a general power of appointment and paid the federal tax on the corresponding net estate. Thereafter, the executors filed a claim for refund, alleging that the value of the beneficial interests which Mrs. Hopper\u2019s children took in the Bucknell property as restricted by the appointment in her will was improperly included as a part of her gross estate for federal estate tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">The claim for refund having been rejected, the executors of Mrs. Hopper\u2019s will instituted suit in the court below against the Collector for the recovery of the portion of the tax alleged to have been improperly assessed and collected. The plaintiffs\u2019 claim did not seek a refund of the tax paid in respect of the interests of Mrs. Hopper\u2019s grandchildren under her appointment, either as to their share of the income from the trust or the corpus in remainder. The amount of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim is not in dispute but merely then-right to any refund. For want \u00f3f a sufficient affidavit of defense, the court below entered judgment in favor of the executors for the amount of their claim with interest. From that judgment, the Collector took the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">The executors contend that, because of the devise over to the Hopper children under the will of William Bucknell in default of appointment by their mother, what the children received after the limitation placed upon the disposition of the property-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>by the will of Mrs. Hopper, passed to them from the will of the donor and is, therefore, not to be included as a part of the donee\u2019s gross estate in determining her estate\u2019s liability for federal estate tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">Section 302 of the Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 70, as amended, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 811, which prescribes the basis for determining the value of the gross estate of a decedent for federal estate tax purposes, provides, inter alia, that there shall be included the value at the time of death of all property, real or personal, \u201c * * * (f) To the extent of any property passing under a general power of appointment exercised by the decedent (1) by will, * *</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">In Helvering v. Grinnell, 294 U.S. 153, 55 S.Ct. 354, 79 L.Ed. 825, where the donee exercised a general power of appointment by appointing to the same persons who, as the remaindermen under the donor\u2019s will, would have taken the property in the same estates and interests had the power not been exercised, and where the appointees also elected to reject the donee\u2019s appointment, the Supreme Court held that nothing had passed in virtue of the exercise of the power within the meaning of \u00a7 302 (f) of <em>the </em>Revenue Act of <em>1926 </em>and <em>that </em>the property so appointed was, therefore, not to be included in the gross estate of the donee.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">The appellant argues that the decision in the Grinnell case, supra, depends upon the fact that the appointees there rejected the donee\u2019s appointment, as they were permitted to do under the law of New York (Matter of Lansing's Estate, 182 N.Y. 238, 74 N.E. 882) which governed the question of title in that case. Grinnell v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 2 Cir., 70 F.2d 705, 706. While the appointees\u2019 renunciation of the donee\u2019s bequest was of importance in doubly assuring that the property had not passed under the power, we think it is implicit in the opinion of the Supreme Court that, had the appointees in the Grinnell case not taken occasion to reject the appointment, the decision would have been the same because of the property law of New York governing the question of title. In Matter of Lansing\u2019s Estate, supra, which both the Supreme Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit cite and quote from with approval in the Grinnell case, the New York Court of Appeals said, at page 243 of 182 N.Y., at page 884 of 74 N.E., that \u201cThe attempt to execute the power was not effective, because it did nothing,\u201d and that it was \u201ca mere form, with no substance\u201d. See 294 U.S. at page 157, 55 S.Ct. at page 355, 79 L.Ed. 825 and 70 F.2d at page 707 (Grinnell cases). If, therefore, the donee\u2019s exercise of the power was ineffectual, it can hardly be that the appointees\u2019 rejection of the donee\u2019s useless action was of controlling effect in determining whether the property passed in virtue of the donee\u2019s exercise of the power. The local law ruled the question as to the passage of the title regardless of the appointees\u2019 rejection of the donee\u2019s bequest.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">As we view it, the thing of general and fundamental importance under the decision in the Grinnell case is whether the donee, in the exercise of a general power of appointment, appoints to the same persons who are the remaindermen under <em>the </em>donor\u2019s will in default of appointment where, under local law, property so appointed passes under the donor\u2019s will and not under the appointment. This conclusion, we believe comports with the decision of the Supreme Court in the Grinnell case, particularly in the light of the prior conflicting decisions among the courts of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">It had been held by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia in Lee v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 61 App.D.C. 33, 57 F.2d 399, that a donee\u2019s appointment of property by will, in the exercise of a general power of appointment, to the same persons who would have taken the property under the will of the donor had the power not been exercised, constituted a \u201cpassing\u201d of property within the meaning of \u00a7 402(e) of the Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 278 (similar to \u00a7 302 (f) of the Revenue Act of 1926) and that, accordingly, the property so appointed was to be included in the gross estate of the donee for the purpose of determining the federal estate tax. There was no rejection by the appointees of the donee\u2019s bequest in the Lee case.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">Several years later, in Wear v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 3 Cir., 65 F.2d 665, this court, under testamentary circumstances substantially similar, held to the same effect as the ruling in the Lee case, with respect to \u00a7 302 (f) of the Revenue Act of 1926, notwithstanding that, by the law of Pennsylvania (the situs of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>the property), the appointees took a vested remainder by the devise over under the donor\u2019s will in default of appointment, subject to its being divested by the donee\u2019s exercise of the power. Freeman\u2019s Estate (No. 1), 35 Pa.Super. 185, 189, approved by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in Freeman\u2019s Estate, 281 Pa. 190, at page 194, 126 A. 270; see, also, Potter\u2019s Estate, 13 Pa.Dist. &amp; Co.R. 667, 669. The appointees in the Wear case likewise made no effort to elect as between the appointment and the devise over in default of appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Then followed Grinnell v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 70 F.2d 705, where the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in recognized disagreement with the decisions in the Wear and Lee cases, supra, held that the donee\u2019s bequest, in the exercise of a general power of appointment, to the same persons who would take as remaindermen under the donor\u2019s will in default of appointment did not constitute a passing of the property under the power within the meaning of \u00a7 302 (f) of the Revenue Act'of 1926, the appointees also having rejected the donee\u2019s bequest.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Upon a writ of certiorari the foregoing conflict was resolved in favor of the decision in the Grinnell case, the Supreme Court saying at page 158 of 294 U.S., at page 356 of 55 S.Ct. 79 L.Ed. 825: \u201cWe granted the writ of certiorari in this case * <em>* </em>* because of an alleged conflict, with Wear v. Commissioner [3 Cir.], 65 F.2d 665, and Lee v. Commissioner, 61 App.D.C. 33, 57 F.2d 399. The reasoning and conclusions of those courts and of the court below cannot be reconciled. We are of opinion that, to the extent of the conflict, the view of the former is wrong and that of the court below is right, and we hold accordingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">If the appointees\u2019 rejection of the donee\u2019s bequest was of controlling importance to the decision in the Grinnell case, as the Collector argues, then the conclusions of the Circuit Courts of Appeals in the Wear and Lee cases, where the appointees did not reject, could have been reconciled with the conclusion of the Circuit Court of Appeals in the Grinnell case, where the appointees did reject; and the fact that the Supreme Court found the respective conclusions to be irreconcilable clearly implies that the question as to the incidence of the appointees\u2019 title depended for its solution upon the effect of the donor\u2019s and donee\u2019s wills under local law rather than upon the voluntary act of the appointees in receiving the property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">In the Wear case, in addition to concluding that Congress had the constitutional authority to tax the exercise of a general power of appointment even though under local law the property passed under the donor\u2019s will and not under the power, this court gave as its opinion with respect to \u00a7 302 (f) of the Revenue Act of 1926 that Congress \u201cintended the tax should be laid, not on property and therefore not to be bound by state rule of property, but on an event arising upon the death of the donee, that is, the exercise of a power of appointment effective on his death\u201d. [65 F. 2d 667.] It is thus apparent that the reasoning of this court\u2019s opinion in the Wear case was concerned primarily with the power of Congress to tax the transfer because a general power of appointment has been exercised rather than with the question whether the property actually passed by reason of the exercise of the power. And, the same may be said for the opinion in the Lee case. In direct opposition to this view the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said in the Grinnell case [70 F.2d at 708], \u2014 \u201cWe need not differ with the conclusion [in the Wear case] that it might be taxed, but we think it was not taxed by an act directed only at property \u2018passing under a general power of appointment\u2019 because there-was no such property here. The appointees not only declined to take the gift, but <em>the appointment when exercised in favor of the same persons who would take irrespective of it was ra mere form with no substance\u2019 which the law of New York that regulates the passage of title has refused to recognise.\u201d </em>(Italics supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b824-11\">In affirming the decision in the Grinnell case, the Supreme Court said, at page 155 of 294 U.S., at page 354 of 55 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>S.Ct. 79 L.Ed. 825, with respect to the scope of \u00a7 302 (f) of the Revenue Act of 1926, that \u201cThe crucial words are \u2018property passing under a general power of appointment exercised by the decedent by will\u2019 \u201d. And in answering the contention of the government, the Supreme Court further said, at page 156 of 294 U.S., at page 355 of 55 S.Ct. 79 L.Ed. 825, that \u201cThe tax here does not fall upon the mere shifting of the economic benefits in property, but upon the shifting of those benefits by a particular method, namely, by their <em>\u2018passing </em>under a general power of appointment,\u2019 and not otherwise. Acceptance of the government\u2019s contention would strip the italicized word of all meaning\u201d. It seems to us that it is hardly open to question any longer that where, under local law, appointed property does not pass by reason of the exercise of the power but passes under the will of the donor, \u00a7 302 (f) of the Revenue Act of 1926 does not require that the value of such property be included in the gross estate of the donee for the ascertainment of the property subject to the federal estate tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\"> It is clear that under the law of Pennsylvania, which governs the question of title in the instant case (Restatement of the Law, Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 283), a devisee over under a donor\u2019s will in default of appointment who is also an appointee under the donee\u2019s will in the exercise of the power takes from the will of the donor and not from tlie donee. The law of Pennsylvania in such regard is similar to the law of New York by which the question of title was determined in the Grinnell case supra, 70 F.2d 705, 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">The reason supporting this rule of property was set forth in Freeman\u2019s Estate, supra, where the Pennsylvania Superior Court, in an opinion later expressly approved by the Supreme Court of the State, said that, \u2014 \u201cIn the absence of an expressed contrary intention a legacy bequeathed in default of appointment, vests in the legatee on the death of the testator, subject to be divested by the exercise of the power of appointment: 4 Kent\u2019s Com., 324; Fearne on Remainders, 226; Perry on Trusts, sec. 250; Cunningham v. Moddy, 1 Vesey, 174. This is so because the power of appointment does not create an estate, nor hold it in abeyance. Its effect is to divest an estate which, but for the exercise of the power, would remain in the devisee or legatee.\u201d See, also, Potter\u2019s Estate, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">What therefore, of the devise over in default of appointment, remains undivested after the donee\u2019s exercise of the power passes under the will of the donor. As the whole includes all of its parts so does a fee embrace all of the estates that may be carved therefrom. Consequently, the effect of Mrs. Hopper\u2019s appointment to her children of an undivided one-fifth interest to each in the equitable estate in the property for life instead of an undivided one-fourth to each in the legal estate in fee, which they would have enjoyed had the power not been exercised, was merely to limit and thus reduce the extent of her children\u2019s already vested estates under the will of their grandfather and from whose will they derived their title. In substantially similar circumstances, it was held in Freeman\u2019s Estate, supra, that \u201cAs much of the estate bequeathed to the grandchildren under the [donor\u2019s] will as was not disposed of by [the donee] under the power, remained vested in his children, and is distributable according to the provisions of the will of [the donor].\u201d Thus, as to the passing of title, an appointment to the same persons who would take as remaindermen in default of appointment is of no effect to the extent that the gift over in default of appointment continues undisturbed in the remaindermen.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-10\">It is, therefore, our opinion that the beneficial interests in the Bucknell property that the I lopper children took, as limited by the will of their mother, passed to them under the will of their grandfather, the donor, and not in virtue of their mother\u2019s exercise of her power. Consequently, the value of the property so appointed should not have been included in Mrs. Hopper\u2019s gross estate for federal estate tax determination. To the extent of the effect of its erroneous inclusion, the federal estate taxes on Mrs. Hopper\u2019s estate were overpaid. Accordingly, the judgment for refund was properly entered.</p>\n<p id=\"pAph\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b821-19\"> The material provisions of William Buoknell\u2019s will are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-20\">\u2018\u2022\u25a0fth.
