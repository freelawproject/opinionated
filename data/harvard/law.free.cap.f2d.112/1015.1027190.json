Bailey.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-20\">The interference is between appellee\u2019s application No. 39,010, filed June 23, 1925 (renewed April 6, 1931), and appellants\u2019 application No. 192,836, filed May 20, 1927.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-21\">Although there are some differences in the counts in issue, we think count 3 sufficiently defines the involved invention. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-22\">\u201c3. Steam boiler apparatus comprising; in combination; an inner structure consisting of a row of aligned tubes conducting a fluid past a heating zone wherein the fluid receives heat transmitted from the burning fitel through the tube walls; and an outer composite structure consisting of flat and wide longitudinal fins arranged <em>on </em>opposite sides of each tube with the adjacent ends of the fins on adjacent tubes in proximity so as to delineate with the tubes a wall structure for the furnace, separate metallic projections joined with the tubes and the fins and distributed over and around the furnace sides of said parts, and refractory material extending across the spaces between the projections to form a shield between the tubes and the burning fuel, the projections acting as supports or anchors to hold the refractory in operative position, said refractory and the lubes absorbing a preponderance of heat on one side of the row.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1077-23\">It appears from the record that ordinarily the combustion chamber of a boiler is rectangular in shape, the.walls being composed of vertical boiler tubes spaced apart and provided with longitudinal flanges spanning the spaces between the tubes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-24\">The involved invention differs from the prior art in that the water tubes are provided with projections over substantially the entire area thereof, which projections act as a support for a curtain of refractory material.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-25\">An interesting feature of the involved invention is that the refractory material may be applied in the form of a \u201cplastic\u201d prior to the operation of the furnace, or it may, in some instances depending upon variable conditions (which need not be set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>forth here hut which are set forth in the stipulated testimony of appellants\u2019 witness Jay A. Freiday), be deposited as an ash as the result of the burning fuel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">Appellants allege conception of the involved invention on or about March 20, 1923, and, although relying to some extent on an application, No. 642,725, filed June 1, 1923, which matured into patent No. 1,-746,711, February 11, 1930 (reissued February 28, 1933, Re. 18,748), rely mainly on application No. 720,734, filed June 18, 1924, which matured into patent No. 1,746,272, February 11, 1930, and reissued December 3, 1935 (Re. 19,782) for constructive reduction to practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">It appears from the record that counsel for appellants rely upon the testimony of the witness John H. Lawrence and the corroborating stipulated testimony of the witnesses Jay A. Freiday, Henry F. Kuntz-mann, and A. V. A. McHarg for the purpose of establishing conception of the invention defined in the involved counts on or about March 20, 1923. There is nothing, however, in the testimony of those witnesses to indicate that appellants ever constructed a device in accordance with the invention defined in the counts in issue, unless such a structure is disclosed in appellants\u2019 reissue patents Nos. Re. 18,748 and Re. 19,782.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-6\">In its decision, the Board of Appeals, after accurately describing the structures disclosed in figures 1, 2, and 3 in appellants\u2019 patent No. Re. 19,782, stated that there was no teaching in that patent that \u201cthe flanges on the rods are intended to retain or will retain a curtain of ash on the tubes and thereby prevent beating the tubes excessively or of insulating the tubes so as to prevent cooling off of the water wall. The teaching of the patent is to provide means for increasing the amount of heat absorbed and transmitted to the tubes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-7\">It is contended here by counsel for appellants that figure . 3, fully described in the board\u2019s decision, will inherently act to retain ash and form a refractory curtain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-8\">In its decision, the Board of Appeals called attention to the fact, however, that appellants\u2019 application filed January 30j 1932, for the reissue of appellants\u2019 patent No. 1,746,272, contained claims, as stated by counsel for appellants, \u201ccommensurate with those here involved,\u201d and that it was held by each of the tribunals of the Patent Office and by this court in. the case of In re Murray, 77 F.2d 651, 22 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1196, that such claims contained new matter which was not allowable in appellant\u2019s reissue application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-10\">Each of the tribunals of the Patent Office called attention to the fact that the only reference to the idea of a refractory layer on the water tubes of a furnace in appellants\u2019 application No. 642,725, filed June 1, 1923, which matured into patent No. 1,-742,711, February 11, 1930, was not contained in the application as filed but was inserted therein by amendment on' August 1, 1927, long subsequent to the filing of ap-pellee\u2019s involved application \u2014 June 23, 1925.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-11\">But one other question remains for our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-12\">It is contended by counsel for appellants that appellee\u2019s application -became forfeited; that the claims constituting the counts here in issue are for a different invention from those standing allowed in appellee\u2019s application at the time of its forfeiture ; and that, therefore, appellee is not entitled to a constructive reduction to practice of the invention defined in the involved counts prior to the filing of his renewal application \u2014 April 6, 1931.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-13\">Counsel for appellants rely upon our decision in the case of In re William Kaisling, 44 F.2d 863, 18 C.C.P.A., Patents, 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-14\">It appears from our decision in that case that the patent application of the appellant Kaisling as finally allowed by the Patent Office tribunals covered claims for a lock per se. Thereafter, appellant\u2019s application became forfeited. In his renewal application, appellant cancelled the claims for a lock per se, and, according, to our decision, inserted claims for a different invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-15\">It is obvious that our decision in that case is not- applicable to the issues herd involved, although it is true that the claims constituting the counts here in issue are not identical in language with the claims appearing in appellee\u2019s application at the time it became forfeited. However, the difference between the claims constituting the counts in issue and those in appellee\u2019s abandoned application is one of terminology and scope rather than one of invention. See Murphy v. Thompson, 46 App.D.C. 515; Wells et al. v. Honigmann, 50 App.D.C. 99, 267 F. 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-16\">We have given careful consideration to the arguments presented here by counsel for appellants, but are of opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>that the tribunals of the Patent Office reached the right conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-4\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
