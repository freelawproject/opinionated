(Further details of appellant\u2019s advertising need not be stated here, as it clearly appears from the record that appellant\u2019s trade-mark and its goods are well and favorably known throughout the United States.)</p>\n<p id=\"b877-22\">It further appears from the record that the goods of the respective parties are competitive; that they are sold at retail in drug stores to the purchasing public; that,</p>\n<p id=\"AXB\">\u201cREX-</p>\n<p id=\"b877-24\">in addition to the trade-mark SELTZER,\u201d here involved, appellee is the owner of trade-mark registration No. 352,229, issued November 23, 1937, on an application filed June 17, 1937, for a trade-mark, comprising the terms \u201cRexall\u201d and \u201cA.B.C. Seltzer,\u201d for use on \u201cGranular Effervescent Analgesic Preparations,\u201d the word \u201cSelt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>zer\u201d being disclaimed apart from the mark as shown; that appellee has used its registered trade-marls: on its granular effervescent analgesic preparations since long prior to the use by appellant of its involved trade-mark \u201cAlka-Seltzer\u201d on its goods; that appellee has employed the term \u201cRex,\u201d sometimes as a prefix and sometimes as a suffix, in several different trade-marks, which trade-marks are now, and for many years prior to the adoption and use by appellant of its trade-mark \u201cAlka-Seltzer\u201d have been, used by appellee on medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations; and that a number of those trade-marks have been registered in the United States Patent Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">It is contended by counsel for appellant that the term \u201cSeltzer\u201d is not descriptive of appellant\u2019s goods, but rather is the dominant feature of appellant\u2019s mark and indicates origin in appellant of effervescent analgesic alkalizing preparations in <em>ksklet </em>form; that it appears from, the record that appellee was motivated by the desire to trade on the good will established by appellant; that appellee\u2019s \u201cfirst step was to duplicate the article (tablet), new in the packaged medicine field; then to offer the tablets in bottles of the same size, design, and shape as those of opposer, having caps that are interchangeable, and in packages, containing 8 and 25 tablets each; then to use the word \u2018Seltzer\u2019 in reverse printing with a hyphen (-) preceding the word \u2018Seltzer,\u2019 placed in the lower portion of op-poser\u2019s design, namely, the blue retangular design, and last to fall back on its adopted policy to use the word Rex either as a suffix or prefix\u201d; and that the composite marks of the parties, when considered as a whole, are similar in sound and significance, and are confusingly similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">In holding, in the case of Miles Laboratories, Inc., v. Pepsodent Company, 104 F. 2d 205, 26 C.C.P.A., Patents,. 1272, that the trade-mark \u201cPepso-Seltzer,\u201d used by the Pepsodent Company on an \u201ceffervescent alkalizing preparation,\u201d was not confusingly similar with the trade-mark \u201cAlka-Selt-zer,\u201d used by the Miles Laboratories, Inc. (the. appellant company in the case at bar), on similar goods, this court stated that the term \u201cSeltzer\u201d in the marks of the parties was descriptive of the character of the goods on which the marks were used; that it would not indicate to the purchasing public the origin of such goods; and that \u25a0the terms \u201cAlka\u201d and \u201cPepso,\u201d in the marks there involved, were the dominant portions thereof. It is here suggested by counsel for appellant that our holding in that case that the term \u201cSeltzer\u201d in appellant\u2019s mark is descriptive of appellant\u2019s effervescent analgesic alkalizing tablets and does not indicate origin in appellant be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">We have carefully considered our decision in the case of Miles Laboratories, Inc., v. Pepsodent Company, supra, in the light of the evidence in the instant case and the arguments presented here by counsel for appellant, and are of opinion that the views there expressed are sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">In the instant case it clearly appears from the testimony of two of appellant\u2019s witnesses that the term \u201cSeltzer\u201d as applied to appellant\u2019s goods is descriptive of the character or quality of such goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">Appellant\u2019s witness, Charles S. Beardsley, vice president of the appellant company and in charge of sales and advertising, stated that appellant\u2019s disclaimer of the term \u201cSeltzer\u201d in its application for the registration of its trade-mark \u201cAlka-Seltzer,\u201d registration No. 283,831, was probably due to the fact that the term \u201cSeltzer\u201d is \u201ca noun in common use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">Appellant\u2019s witness, J. Maurice Treneer, chief chemist in the employ of the appellant company, stated that the term \u201cSeltzer,\u201d whether applied to a tablet, a liquid, or a granule, usually indicates that the preparation is effervescent.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-11\">Relative to the claim made here by counsel for appellant that, in the selection of its trade-mark, appellee was motivated by the desire to trade on the good will established by appellant, it is sufficient to say that the term \u201cRex,\u201d which is clearly the dominant portion of appellee\u2019s trade-mark, has, as hereinbefore stated, been used by appellee for many years, either as a prefix or as a suffix, in many of appellee\u2019s trade-marks for use on medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations ; that, although both the bottles and the containers therefor in which the goods of the respective parties are sold are of practically the same size and shape, the labels on the bottles used by the respective parties are wholly dissimilar in appearance and the containers for such bottles differ in color and in other material respects; and that the color schemes used by the parties, for both the labels on the bottles and the containers for such bottles, differ, in that appellant\u2019s is of a comparatively light blue and white and appellee\u2019s is of a dark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>blue and yellow. It may be said furthermore that the containers for appellee\u2019s bottles are similar, both in color and in the arrangement of the printed matter appearing thereon, to the containers in which many of its other medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations are, and for many years have been, sold to the general public under various of its trade-marks of which \u2022 the term \u201cRex\u201d is a part.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Appellee introduced other evidence relative to its reasons for adopting its trade-</p>\n<p id=\"ANf9\">\u201cREX-</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">marlc SELTZER\u201d for use on effervescent analgesic alkalizing tablets. That evidence, however, need not be set forth nor discussed here. It is sufficient to say that we are unable to hold that the evidence of record warrants the conclusion that, in the adoption</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">\u201cREX-</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">and use of its trade-mark SELTZER,\u201d appellee was motivated by the desire to trade upon the good will established by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">As hereinbefore stated, it appears that in advertising its trade-mark and its goods appellant has emphasized the term \u201cAlka\u201d in its trade-mark for the purpose of indicating to the public that its tablets possess alkalizing properties, one of its advertising slogans being \u201cAlkalize with Alka-Seltzer,\u201d and that, as stated by the witness Charles S. Beardsley, appellant has \u201cled the public to believe\u201d that its goods possess alkalizing properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\"> We are of opinion that the dominant portion of appellant\u2019s mark is the term \u201cAlka\u201d; that the dominant portion of appellee\u2019s mark is the term \u201cRex\u201d; and that appellant is not entitled to the exclusive use of the word \u201cSeltzer.\u201d Accordingly, if the term \u201cRex\u201d in appellee\u2019s mark is sufficiently dissimilar from the term \u201cAlka\u201d in appellant\u2019s mark so that, when considered in their entireties, the marks of the. parties are not confusingly similar, appellee is entitled to have its mark registered. Miles Laboratories, Inc., v. Pepsodent Company, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">We have given careful consideration to the evidence of record, and to all of the arguments presented here by counsel for appellant in support of their contention that the marks of the parties are confusingly similar and that appellant will be damaged by the registration of appellee\u2019s mark, but are of opinion that the marks, considered in their entireties, are sufficiently dissimilar so that their concurrent use on the goods of the parties is not likely to cause confusion in trade or deceive purchasers, and that appellee is entitled to have its mark registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-14\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-16\">GARRETT, Presiding Judge, took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
