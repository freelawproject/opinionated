Appellant<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> petitioned for the writ on June 23, 1939. The writ was issued forthwith. It was directed to appellee,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in whose custody the petition alleged appellant was detained. The writ commanded appellee to make return thereof on June 27, 1939, and at the same time to bring the body of appellant before the judge<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> who had granted the writ. Appellee made return of the writ as commanded, but did not produce the body of appellant. The return stated: \u201c * * * I [appellee] am unable to produce the body of Marcus Graham [appellant] for the reason that said Marcus Graham is not in my custody. * * * Marcus Graham is now in the custody of the United States Marshal, having been convicted and sentenced by the Honorable Harry A. Hollzer, Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, Central Division, on the 26th day of June, 1939.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>* * * </em>[Appellee] denies each and every allegation in the petition for the writ.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b971-25\">Thus, in effect, the return stated that appellant was not in appellee\u2019s custody on June 23, 1939, when the petition was filed, nor on June 27, 1939, when the return was filed, but was, on the latter date, in custody of the marshal. The return was not traversed. Consequently, on June 27, 1939, an order was entered discharging the writ. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-26\">The record on appeal consists of an agreed statement prepared and signed by the parties and approved by the District Court, pursuant to Rule 76 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As prepared by the parties, the statement recited, inter alia, (1) that \u201cit was [on June 27, 1939] agreed between the parties and their counsel * * * that the petition for writ of habeas corpus should be deemed a traverse of the writ,\u201d and (2) that \u201cthe court [on June 27, 1939] informed counsel for [appellant] that the court had lost jurisdiction.\u201d These recitals were not approved by the court, but were expressly disapproved,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and are, therefore, no part of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-29\">In his statement of points<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and in his brief, appellant asserts that the District Court erred \u201cin ruling that its jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>* * * which it acquired by service of the writ of habeas corpus * * * was lost by the subsequent order of commitment issued by another judge of the same court.\u201d There was no such ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">Also, in his statement of points and in his brief, appellant asserts that the District Court erred \u201cin refusing to consider on the merits the validity of [appellant\u2019s] detention by the Immigration authorities and by the United States Marshal.\u201d Appellant\u2019s petition did not allege that he was detained by the marshal or by any \u201cauthority\u201d other than appellee. The writ of habeas corpus was directed to appellee and to no one else. Appellant\u2019s detention \u2014 -if he was detained \u2014 by anyone other than appellee was not a matter which could properly be considered in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">The alleged detention of appellant by appellee was denied by the return, which, not being traversed, was conclusive on the court. Crowley v. Christensen, 137 U.S. 86, 94, 11 S.Ct. 13, 34 L.Ed. 620; Stretton v. Rudy, 5 Cir., 176 F. 727, 730; United States v. Day, 2 Cir., 20 F.2d 302, 303. There being no detention of appellant by appellee, the writ was properly discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b971-13\"> Marcus Graham, alias Fred S.
