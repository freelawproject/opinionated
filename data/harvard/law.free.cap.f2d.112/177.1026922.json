The decree required him to pay her $60 per month permanent alimony. Before, it was entered he secured a Mexican divorce, characterized by appellant, as a \u201cmail order\u201d one. Shortly thereafter he married another woman. He left the District December 20, 1934, as lie claims with the intention of residing elsewhere permanently.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-15\">July 29, 1938, appellant filed her petition herein. She claimed that appellee was $160 in arrears in alimony payments, had reduced them to $40 per month in violation of the order and refused to pay more than that amount, In addition to other income, she alleged he receives $100 per mouth from appellee insurance company as disability benefit payments under two policies of insurance. She asked for sequestration of bis property, its conversion into cash and application of the proceeds to pay arrears and future monthly instalments of $60 in alimony. Injunctions were sought to restrain the husband from receiving property or funds due him and the insurance company from paying over to him the disability benefits or other sums payable under the policies. The company, a foreign corporation alleged to be doing business in the District, was made a party defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-17\">July 30, 1938, a rule issued to appellees to show cause why payments under the policies should not be sequestered and paid to appellant in accordance with her claim. Service of process was made on the company. On August 30, 1938, the individual appellee filed his \u201cSpecial Appearance and Return,\u201d the first paragraph of which was in part as follows: \u201cComes now the defendant * * *, appearing specially and reserving his objections to the jurisdiction of this Court, and makes this return to the rule to show cause <em>* </em>* *, <em>and answers and moves to dismiss the petition </em>of the plaintiff * * *; and as grounds therefor defendant shows to the Court as follows: * * * \u201d (Italics supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b241-19\">The \u201creturn\u201d alleged that appellee\u2019s dom-icil was then and had been since February 2, 1935, in California; that he was not then and had not been \u201csince long prior to the institution of this sequestration proceeding, within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court; that he does not now submit to the jurisdiction of this Court, but appears herein specially only, and submits this return, answer and motion to dismiss with full reservation of his objections to the jurisdiction of this Court of this proceeding or over his person.\u201d It then pleaded to the merits of the petition, admitting or denying substantive allegations and setting up new matter. It admitted receipt of the disability payments under the policies, and alleged that they did not constitute \u201cdebts\u201d due appellee or \u201cincome\u201d and that they are exempted specifically from process under Section 16a ol the Life Insurance Act for the District of Columbia, Act of Congress of June 19, 1934, c. 672, 48 Stat. 1175, D.C.Code (Supp. IV 1938) tit. 5, sec. 220p. It asserted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>further that the disability payments \u201care not in any event, even when and if they accrue and become debts owed to defendant, payable to defendant in the District of Columbia and that they will not be debts due the defendant in the District of Columbia, but that, under the express provisions of the policies, such payments will become payable at the Home Office [Newark, New Jersey] of the Company.\u201d \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"AQT\">Special grounds stated to support the motion to dismiss the petition were that it was \u201cfatally defective\u201d in failing to state facts tending to show that there was property of the appellee located within the District or the court\u2019s jurisdiction; in failing \u201cto allege that any debt is owed to this defendant in the District of Columbia\u201d by the insurance company or others; for showing \u201con its face * * * that the sums sought to be reached by sequestration and injunction are mere future contingencies, which may or may not ripen into debts owed to this defendant,\u201d and that they are \u201c \u2018disability benefit payments,\u2019 which are specifically exempted from the process of this Court by statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The \u201creturn and answer\u201d was supported by appellee\u2019s affidavit tending to show establishment of his residence and legal dom-icil in California in 1935 and continued maintenance of them there since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The insurance company answered the petition, setting forth facts, among others, concerning the issuance of the policies to appellee, and their terms, including the disability provisions; alleging that the policies provide for continuance of disability payments and waiver of premiums only during appellee\u2019s total and permanent disability and upon his making periodic proof that it continues; and asserting that such payments are not subj ect to sequestration herein: (1) because specifically exempted by statute; (2) \u201cfor the reason that said payments are not assets in existence at the time of the attempted sequestration,- but on the contrary, that the obligation of making such payments is conditioned upon the compliance by the said Wallace Clayton Schlaefer with the conditions of the said policies;\u201d and (3) because \u201cthis Court has. no jurisdiction over such disability payments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">' On consideration of \u201cthe motion * * * to dismiss the petition * * * \u201d and of \u201cthe returns to the rule to show cause,\u201d the court found that the object of the proceeding was to sequester the disability payments and that they were \u201cmonies paid or agreed to be paid \u2018on account of the disability from injury or sickness of any insured person,\u2019 within the meaning of\u201d Section 16a. Its conclusions of law were that: \u201c1. This proceeding is barred by Section 16a of the Life Insurance. Act for the District of Columbia;\u201d and \u201c2. The petition should be dismissed for the want of jurisdiction to grant the relief prayed, and the rule to show cause should be dismissed by the Court.\u201d Accordingly, the petition was \u201cdismissed\u201d and the rule discharged. From this action the present appeal is brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">I. The principal issues relate to the jurisdiction of the court and the applicability of Section 16a. It is not clear whether the court found itself lacking in jurisdiction of the persons of the defendants or in jurisdiction of the subject matter of the suit or in both.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-12\">We think the court had jurisdiction in both respects. No pretense is made that it failed to acquire jurisdiction of the person of the insurance company. It was \u201cdoing business\u201d in the District, subject to process therein and properly served. As to the person of appellee Schlaefer, we think he has submitted to the court\u2019s jurisdiction by his voluntary appearance herein. It is true this was denominated in the caption \u201cSpecial Appearance and .Return,\u201d and that it specifically asserts that appellee appears only \u201cspecially * * * and with full reservation of his objections to the jurisdiction of this Court of this proceeding or over his person,\u201d as well as that \u201che does not now submit to the jurisdiction of this Court.\u201d Despite the \u201creservations\u201d and denial of the court\u2019s power, the pleading went on to answer the allegations of the petition upon the merits, both as to matters of fact and matters of law, and moved for its dismissal. Allegations of the petition were admitted or denied and new matter was introduced in defense of appellee\u2019s reduction of the monthly payments. Special grounds were stated in support of the motion to dismiss, as set forth above. The alleged \u201cSpecial Appearance and Return,\u201d therefore, attempted to combine in one pleading the following functions: (1) A special appearance in objection to the court\u2019s jurisdiction of .the defendant\u2019s person; (2) an objection to the court\u2019s jurisdiction of the subject matter of the cause; (3) a return to the rule to show cause; (4) a motion to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>miss the petition; and (5) an answer to the petition on the merits, both as to fact and as to law.</p>\n<p id=\"A9q\">Prior to September 16, 1938, when the new Federal Rules of Civil Procedure became effective, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, it was established clearly in this jurisdiction that a defendant, by pleading to the merits before the court had ruled on his special appearance in objection to its jurisdiction of his person, waived his objection to the jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Likewise, it was well established in other jurisdictions that where pleadings or motions relating to the merits were mingled with the plea to the jurisdiction, the latter was waived and a general appearance resulted. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This rule received our approval in relation to actions at law in Manning v. Furr, 1933, 62 App.D.C. 281, 66 F.2d 807. But in Herzog v. Hubard, 1938, 68 App.D.C. 383, 98 F.2d 255, we reaffirmed our previous decision in Ryan v. McAdoo, 1917, 46 App. D.C. 117. In these cases we held that in proceedings in equity a rule should be applied which is different from that applicable at law under Manning v. Furr. Specifically the ruling was that a special appearance is not waived under former Equity Rule 29, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723, by mingling with it defenses \u201cin point of law arising upon the face of the bill.\u201d Neither case, however, extended the rule to a pleading which combines a special appearance with defenses not of that character. Objections of law arising on the face of the bill were required to be taken, under that rule, by motion to dismiss, others by answer. The purpose of the rule was to simplify the procedure and expedite the litigation in equity causes by requiring the defendant to make all of his objections in these two types of response. It was intended to get rid of demtirrers, pleas in abatement, etc., by successive filing of which the defendant could string out the litigation in a series of preliminary objections, generally of jurisdictional character, before reaching the merits. This was accomplished by requiring that all such objections be raised in a single motion to dismiss, leaving meritorious defenses to be raised by answer. Obviously this could not be done if the previously prevailing rule were retained that mingling a special appearance with other preliminary objections of this sort waived it. But there was no such necessity concerning objections proper to be made by answer under the rule. And none of the cases cited applied or purported to apply to such objections. We think therefore that the previously prevailing rule continued in force as to objections properly raised by answer, and consequently that the rule of Ryan v. McAdoo and Herzog v. Hubard has no application to this case. As we have said the \u201creturn\u201d here combines not only a special appearance and other jurisdictional objections, properly to be taken by motion to dismiss, but also others appropriate to be taken only by answer, both by way of denial and by allegation of affirmative matter. As the pleading combines the functions of a return to the rule, a motion to dismiss and an answer, it falls within the rule of Manning v. Furr, find not within that of Herzog v. Hubard and Ryan v. McAdoo. Ap-pellee Schlaefer\u2019s appearance was filed August 30, 1938. In view of what has boen said, the court then acquired jurisdiction of his person under the law prevailing at that time. It was complete in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">However, the new Rules of Civil Procedure provide: \u201cNo defense or objection is waived by being joined with one or more other defenses or objections in a responsive pleading or motion.\u201d Rule 12(b). The provision appears to be applicable, in terms, as well to objections to the court\u2019s jurisdiction, whether of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>person, or of the subject matter, as to others. Id.; 1 Moore, Federal Practice (1938) 639, 649; (1940) 53 Harv.L.Rev. 493. But the rules did not take effect until September 16, 1938. Rule 86. It is provided further that the rules shall \u201cgovern all proceedings in actions brought after they take effect and also all <em>further </em>proceedings in actions then pending, except to the extent that in the opinion of the court their application in a particular action pending when the rules take effect would not be. feasible or would work injustice, in which event the former procedure applies.\u201d (Italics sup-lied) Id. <em>\u201cFurther </em>proceedings\u201d clearly means those occurring after the effective date. To whatever extent the rules may be applicable in actions pending when they took effect, we do not believe the provision last quoted was intended to authorize or permit retroactive ouster of jurisdiction previously established and made complete., Such a construction not only would make Rule 12(b) a trap for unwary litigants, but would raise serious question as to its validity in such an application. The interest of a plaintiff, situated as appellant was here, in the court\u2019s maintenance of the jurisdiction of the defendant\u2019s person-, once that is established in accordance with existing law, is sufficiently substantial to make it at least questionable whether an infringement of it would not go beyond the function of merely changing procedure. The act authorizing the 'formulation and promulgation of the rules provides that they \u201cshall neither abridge, enlarge, nor modify the substantive rights of any litigant.\u201d Act of June 19, 1934, c. 651, \u00a7 1, 48 Stat. 1064, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 723b, 28 U.S.C. A. \u00a7 723b. We need not consider to what extent changes in existing law concerning acquisition of jurisdiction of the person of a defendant may be \u201cmerely procedural\u201d or \u201csubstantive\u201d in wholly prospective operation. But when the effect of the change is to nullify, retroactively a jurisdiction perfected and complete in accordance with existing law, and possibly in circumstances such that it could not be reestablished by subsequent action, we think the application goes beyond the purpose and intent of the rule, and possibly of the statute which underlies it. Cf. also Rule 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">We think therefore that the court acquired complete jurisdiction of the persons of both defendants, appellees here, and that this has been affected in no respect by the subsequent taking effect of the Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">III In -our judgment this also disposes of the question concerning the court\u2019s jurisdiction of the subject matter of the suit. We are not required to determine whether a sequestration proceeding, such as the present one, intended to reach money owing from one defendant to another, would be without the court\u2019s jurisdiction if neither of the defendants were personally within the court\u2019s power; or if the creditor defendant were not so, the debt being payable to him by, and at the home office of, a foreign corporation brought within the court\u2019s authority solely by virtue of its \u201cdomestication\u201d in the sovereignty of the, forum. Neither case is presented by the facts. The argument seems to be that because the creditor defendant is a non-resident and his debtor a foreign corporation, the debt being payable at its home office, the court is without power to reach the debt by its process. It amounts practically to a contention that the debt has-an exclusive situs at the place designated for payment, similar to that of real estate or to that commonly attributed to tangible personalty for taxation and other purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">It is true that \u201csitus\u201d is attributed even to intangible personalty for many legal purposes, such as taxation and distribution of decedents\u2019 estates. Likewise, the relation of debtor and creditor has been fixed geographically for purposes of attachment, garnishment, sequestration and the like, despite its traditionally transitory character in the common law. <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But the purpose of these efforts to conjoin the relation with particular geographical and governmental units has been to extend rather than to restrict the enforceability of the debt. And the analogy of the proceeding in rem has been applied specifically for the purpose of making possible application of the proceeds of one debt to the payment of another, when the intermediate debtor-creditor could not be reached, but his debtor could be brought personally within the power of the court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Harris v. Balk seems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>designed to extend jurisdiction to the very case with which we would have been confronted, had the individual appellee not brought himself within the court\u2019s jurisdiction by the nature of his appearance. If the case were in that status, it might be necessary for the appellant to perfect the court\u2019s jurisdiction by giving published notice in accordance with D.C. Code 1929, tit. 24, \u00a7 378, in order to bring the case within the principle of Harris v. Balk. But even so, she should not be deprived of the opportunity to do this by premature dismissal of the suit such as was had here. However, whatever the case may have been at the beginning, it is now the simple one of a suit upon a valid personal obligation (the decree for alimony) against the obligor to reach money due the latter from another, both debtors being personally within the jurisdiction of the court. Whatever may be the need and the limits for application of theories of \u201csitus\u201d in other situations, the traditional and unimpaired transitory character of personal obligations dispenses with the need for such theories here, where all of the parties, creditor, debtor and debtor\u2019s debtor are before the court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> .In such circumstances full justice can be done to all of them without depriving any of procedural or substantive rights whether in the proceeding or by the court\u2019s decree. That the debt sought to be sequestered is payable elsewhere or that the debtor who owes it is a foreign corporation is of no moment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">III. The question remains whether the disability payments have been exempted by Section 16a or otherwise from application to appellant\u2019s claims for alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-13\">Apart from the statute, no sufficient reason sustains such an exemption. Appellees apparently contend that the obligation to make these payments does not constitute a \u201cdebt,\u201d since it is not payable absolutely but only upon the contingency of and during the insured\u2019s total and permanent disability. Therefore, it is said, it cannot be reached by sequestration. The implicit assumption is that the obligation must be technically a \u201cdebt\u201d in order to be sequestered. No authority is cited to sustain this view. However appellees rely upon an asserted analogy to McGrew v. McGrew, 1930, 59 App.D.C. 230, 38 F.2d 541, certiorari denied, 1930, 281 U.S. 739, 50 S.Ct. 349, 74 L.Ed. 1153, wherein we held that the unearned salary of a government employee is not subject to attachment, garnishment or other order of court requiring him to pay it over to his judgment creditor as earned. The decision rested chiefly on two grounds, the principle of governmental immunity and the fact that the salary had not been earned. Only the latter has semblauce of pertinence here, and it has merely that. The contingency upon which the employee\u2019s salary was to become payable had not taken effect. He had not given the employer quid pro quo and might never do so. There was no presently existing obligation or claim, but merely the possibility that one would be created in the future. The opposite is the case here. The consideration for the insurance has been paid to the insurer. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>disability has taken place and is now existing. Moreover, it is \u201ctotal and permanent\u201d by the admissions of both appellees. There is a presently existing, though continuing, liability of the insurer to the insured, not a mere contingency that one may be created in the future. True, there is the improbable possibility that the insured may recover from the disability,' despite its \u201ctotal and permanent\u201d character. In that event or on the death of the insured, the payments are to cease. But these are not conditions precedent to accrual of the insurer\u2019s liability as is the earning of wages to that of an employer or as was the occurrence of the disability here. They are rather in the nature of conditions subsequent, whose part, if and when they materialize, is to put an end to a liability already existing. Futhermore, they are likely to occur (except the death of the insured) only in remotely, not to say merely mathematically, possible circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">It is to be emphasized that the present proceeding is one in sequestration, not technically in attachment or garnishment. Although there are similarities common to all of these proceedings, <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the statute of the District, D.C.Code 1929, tit. 14, \u00a7 70, empowers the court to \u201cenjoin any disposition of the husband\u2019s <em>property </em>to avoid the collection of said allowances [of alimony], and * * * sequestrate his <em>property </em>and apply the income thereof to such objects.\u201d (Italics supplied) The act does not define \u201cproperty.\u201d It is fairly to be implied from its purpose, however, that the term was not used narrowly. The making of provision for the wife\u2019s sustenance requires a liberal interpretation, to the extent, perhaps, of including all assets of the husband not otherwise specifically and clearly exempted from her claim. The Congress hardly can have intended to keep the wife alive if the husband has real estate, but allow her to starve if he owns only money or obligations. Nor does it violate the statute\u2019s language or purpose that the payments are and will continue to be made in instalments. Until the payments are due, they cannot be collected by the creditor or one claiming through him. But that does not prevent the court (sitting in equity as here) from directing that payment, when due, be made not to the creditor but to one whom it adjudges to have a superior right to the fund. We find nothing in' the nature of the property or the husband\u2019s interest which requires that it be put beyond the reach of the wife\u2019s claim. Nor do we see that the insurer has any other interest than to apply the payments so that it will be relieved of further liability on account of them. Its sole duty is to pay, when the conditions for its doing so have taken place. Although the policies designate the payments as \u201cdisability benefits,\u201d this does not make the insurer a trustee to see that the funds are applied to particular purposes by or for the benefit of the insured. It merely describes the condition upon which the payments are to be made, leaving the insured free to use them for paying expenses of illness or living ortfor squandering in whatever manner may please him.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">The remaining question concerns the applicability of Section 16a, the exemption statute. It is as follows: \u201cExemption of disability insurance from execution. \u2014 No money or other benefit paid, provided, allowed, or agreed to be paid by any com-pany on account of the disability from injury or sickness of any insured person shall be liable to execution, attachment, garnishment, or other process, or to be seized, taken, appropriated or applied by any legal or equitable process or operation of law, to pay any debt or liability of such insured person whether such debt or liability was incurred before or after the commencement of such disability, but the provisions of this section shall not affect the assignability of any such disability benefit otherwise assignable, nor shall this section apply to any money income disability benefit in an action to recover for necessaries contracted for after the commencement of the disability covered by the disability clause or contract allowing such money income benefit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">The act has not been construed heretofore in relation to a claim for alimony or support money. Nor have we found construction in this respect elsewhere of. an identical statute. Appellees rely largely upon the language of the section, claiming it is clear and plain, allowing no room for interpretation. They assert also that the policy of the act would be defeated by a. construction favorable to appellant since-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>that, it is said, would open the door to the possibility of the disabled person\u2019s becoming a public charge. To the contrary, appellant says that the very purpose of the exemption is \u201cto secure a debtor the means of carrying on in times of unfortunate circumstances the main consideration being, it seems, for the protection of the family, wife and children.\u201d She asserts also that her claim is for \u201cnecessaries\u201d within the statutory exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">The basic issue boils down to whether Congress intended to relieve the disabled insured to the. extent of his disability payments from legally enforceable obligation to support his family and those legally dependent upon him. So far as general creditors are concerned the purpose is clear, with the exceptions stated, to make the disposition of these funds a matter solely for his judgment. Congress regarded it as better for the creditors to go unpaid than to deprive the debtor and his dependents of this means of support when earning capacity would be cut off. Hence it used broad language prohibiting recourse to the fund by legal process. By removing it absolutely from the reach of such claims, to this extent it protected the insured from want during disability and-the public from danger of his becoming a public charge. In ordinary circumstances also the exemption works a like protection of his dependents and of the public from tlieir pauperization by his loss of earning power.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\"> In determining whether the insured\u2019s legal dependents are to be classified, lor purposes of the statute, with strangers holding claims hostile to his interest and tlieir own or as being within its protective purpose, wc may take into account the nature of the fund exempted, the purposes for which it ordinarily is created, the circumstances in which it becomes available to the insured and the uses normally made of it in those conditions. It is reasonable to assume that Congress had such things in mind when it created the exemption. The words \u201cany debt or liability\u201d are to be construed in the light of these factors, particularly when account is taken of the statutory exceptions for assignments and contracts for necessaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">An important, often the primary, motivation for taking out disability insurance is protection of the family, not merely of its supporter. As has been said, the funds are not earmarked for limited and particular purposes. They are derived normally from the insured\u2019s earning power. They constitute a substitute for it when it is gone. By law and the most sacred contract he is obligated to employ it, while it exists, for dependents\u2019 support. Disability does not relieve him of that obligation, though it may affect the extent to which he can perform it. The obligation which he assumes upon marriage operates \u201cin sickness and in health.\u201d Though he may not be able to work, if he has other means he is required to apply them equitably in the discharge of this duty. For the head of a family, the essentials of sustenance for his dependents remain \u201cnecessaries\u201d as much when he is disabled as when he is well and employed. His disability does not terminate the wife\u2019s power to pledge his credit for them, whether for her own or for his children\u2019s support. Claims so created prior to any award of alimony or support <em>money</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>appear 'to fall squarely within the letter and the purpose of the statutory exemption. An award of alimony or support money may destroy this power by giving her a substitute for it. But it does not destroy, on the contrary it enforces, the obligation from which the power is derived. It would be incongruous if the very act of enforcement should not only cut off her power to create in others legally enforceable claims for necessaries supplied to her, but also deprive her of any substitute for that power.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Furthermore, the usual purpose of exemptions is to relieve the person exempted from the pressure of claims hostile to his dependents\u2019 essential needs as well as his own personal ones, not to relieve him of familial obligations and destroy what may be the family\u2019s last and only security, short of public relief. The exemption, as contended for here, is not one which should be favored in legislation or in judicial construction. It can operate only in favor ox a head of a family who appropriates to his exclusive sustenance or pleasure income received in times of adversity. That the disability income may be generous only goes to make the purpose of exemption less plausible. That it may he meager does not establish such purpose.

Under the authorities cited and discussed, it does not appear that the distinction is material, except to make the result more clear and the reasons for it more positive,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and possibly to change the result when the exemption is of a homestead and the wife\u2019s effort to reach it is made subsequently to an award for support which creates no specific lien on the property. Supporting the view that alimony creates a duty of more compelling character than mere \u201cdebt\u201d or civil liability for tort are other considerations of policy than mere reparation for civil injuries. Among these are the interest of the public that the cast-off wife not become a public charge, the release of the husband from the wife\u2019s power to pledge his credit for her sustenance, and her surrender of rights in the nature of dower. Except the last, and not always excluding it, these considerations apply with equal or greater force when the divorce is, as here, a limited, not an absolute one. In such a case the bond of marriage is not dissolved and the award is, therefore, closely akin to one solely for support money. <footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">As the record stands, the status of the parties has not been altered by any occurrence subsequent to the decree rendered in the District Court. We do not pass upon the validity of the Mexican divorce or of appellee\u2019s subsequent remarriage. Those questions are not now before us. Neither could we assume their legal effectiveness as against appellant\u2019s claim, if that were material. The case presented, therefore, is one in which we must regard the legal relation of husband and wife as continuing at least until the contrary is shown, for whatever force that may add to the appellant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-14\">The order is reversed and the cause remanded'to the trial court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-15\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b243-8\"> Orinoco Co. v.

The defendant had remarried following an absolute divorce from the plaintiff, and the majority opinion was based expressly upon the interest of the second wife and family in support from the husband\u2019s earnings, upon analogy to certain rulings relating to homestead exemption (cf. note 12, infra), not on the view that the exemption is intended for the benefit of the insured to the exclusion of his dependents.

See Notes (1921) 11 A.L.R. 123; (1937) 106 A.L.R. 669. But when the claim is asserted subsequently and \u00bfgainst a husband who remains or again becomes the head of a family following the divorce, the usual result is to the contrary. Id. Obviously this is due to regard for the remaining or newly acquired dependents of the husband, not to concern for his personal freedom from enforcement of the wife\u2019s claim, since that does not exist when he has no other dependents. Whether the exclusion of the divorced wife under these circumstances from the class of dependents for whose benefit the homestead exemption is granted is consistent with her inclusion among those not barred by an exemption of wages from \u201cdebts,\u201d etc. (cf. note 10, supra), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>need not be determined. The analogy of the latter to disability insurance certainly is not more remote than that of the homestead. Cf. Yager v.
