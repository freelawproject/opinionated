The subpoena required appellant to attend and testify before an immigrant inspector before whom investigations were being conducted in the Southern District of California. Appellant responded to the subpoena, but refused to answer questions put to him before the inspector. Thereafter, on November 23, 1937, the District Court issued' an order requiring appellant to answer the questions. Appellant failed to obey the order and, being charged with contempt, defended on the ground, among others, that his answers, if he had answered the questions, would have tended to incriminate him under federal statutes, <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that, therefore, his refusal to answer was privileged under the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-24\">The District Court held the Fifth Amendment inapplicable<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and, therefore, refused to consider whether appellant\u2019s answers, if he had answered the questions, would or would not have tended to incriminate him. Appellant was adjudged guilty of contempt and was sentenced. We reversed the judgment and remanded the case with directions to determine \u201cwhich questions, if any, put to appellant before the immigrant inspector * * * would tend to incrim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>inate him under a possible prosecution for violation of the federal criminal statutes cited by appellant;\u201d allow appellant \u201cto purge himself of contempt * * * by answering all the questions * * * held by the court not to be self incriminating;\u201d and thereafter \u201cimpose such sentence for contempt, if the court adjudges the [appellant] guilty thereof, as the court may determine to be just and proper.\u201d Graham v. United States, 9 Cir., 99 F.2d 746, 750.</p>\n<p id=\"a0o-dedup-0\">Our mandate was obeyed. At a hearing on June 26, 1939, the District Court determined that the following questions put to appellant before the .immigrant inspector could be answered by appellant without self-incrimination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-7\">\u201cWhat is your true and correct name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-8\">\u201cHave you brought your passport?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-9\">\u201cWhere were you born ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-10\">\u201cOf what country are you now a citizen ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-11\">\u201cWhat is your father\u2019s name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-12\">\u201cWhat is your mother\u2019s maiden name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-13\">\u201cIs your father living?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-14\">\u201cIs your mother living?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-15\">\u201cFrom what country did you come at the time of your first arrival in the United States ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-16\">\u201cHave you ever been convicted of any crime involving moral turpitude since your entry into the United States, and of which there is a public record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-17\">\u201cAt the time of your first entrance into the United States were you a polygamist?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b970-18\">Appellant was present at the hearing, but did not'testify or offer any evidence. He stated to the court that he thought the above-quoted questions would incriminate him, but he did not state, much less prove, any fact warranting such a conclusion, nor does the record disclose any such fact. Compare Miller v. United States, 9 Cir., 95 F.2d 492, 494. Having determined that appellant\u2019s answers, if he answered the questions, would not tend to incriminate him, the court, pursuant to our mandate, gave him an opportunity to purge himself of contempt by answering the questions on June 26, 1939. Appellant refused, was thereupon .adjudged guilty of contempt, and has appealed.,</p>\n<p id=\"b970-19\">There are five assignments of error, so-called. Assignments 1, 2, 3 and 4 are assignments of error in name only. They do not assert that any error was committed. They do not mention or refer to any ruling of the court or any act or thing done or omitted by the court. Such assignments present nothing for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-25\">Assignment 5 is that the court erred in refusing to postpone the hearing (on June 26, 1939) until another case \u2014 a habeas corpus proceeding<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2014 was determined. The refusal was not excepted to and was, therefore, not assignable as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-26\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b969-18\"> Marcus Graham, alias Fred g.
