No pleadings, evidence or exhibits are before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-11\">' The ' statement asserts that app\u00e9llees sought, by a \u201cbill of complaint\u201d, a \u201cdecree\u201d adjudicating their ownership of patent No. 1,947,493, the validity thereof, and an injunction restraining infringement thereof by appellant; and that appellant\u2019s answer alleged lack of invention and public use \u201clong prior to July 17, 1931,' the date when the alleged patent was applied for\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-12\">The trial court found that the. patent in question was issued to appellee Rose-Engle Company on February 20, 1934; that -the same was not anticipated by any of some 17 patents and that it was not anticipated by 2 years\u2019 public use. Judgment was entered for appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-13\">Other than as. above stated the statement of the case merely states that ap-pellees \u201cproduced evidence and testimony\u201d of the existence of .certain facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-14\">Appellant argues five points which may be summarized as follows: (T) the patent was anticipated by prior patents; (2) the patent was anticipated by 2 years\u2019 public, use;' (3) the process of the patent was not the exercise of inventive skill but a practice which would readily- occur to one skilled in the aft. \u2018</p>\n<p id=\"b776-15\">The record is not sufficient to enable us to pass on any of these points. We could not determine whether the patent in question was anticipated by either prior patents, or by public use, or whether it involved invention, without knowing what the patent is. It is not before us, so we do not know what it discloses or what it claims. Likewise, to determine whether the patent in question is anticipated by prior patents, we would have to know what the prior patents disclose. Such prior patents are not before us. Likewise to determine whether the patent was anticipated by prior public use, we would have to have the evidence to determine whether the trial court\u2019s finding on that issue is \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d. No evidence is before us. Under these circumstances, we think the judgment should be and it is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
