Sheridan, Charles Sherwin, William M. Fidroeff and Harry W. Arnold were indicted for violating \u00a7 215 of the Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 338.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The indictment was in ten counts. Counts 1 and 2 charged that, having devised a scheme to defraud,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> defendants, for the purpose of executing the scheme, placed in post offices of the United States,1 *3 to be sent and delivered by the post office establishment, two letters described in those counts. Counts 3 to 10, inclusive, charged that, for the purpose of executing the scheme, defendants knowingly caused to be delivered by mail,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> according to the directions thereon, eight letters described in those counts. Defendants were arraigned and pleaded not guilty. Arnold obtained a severance. Sheridan, Sherwin and Fidroeff were tried together. Sheridan and Sherwin were convicted and sentenced \u2014 Sheridan on counts 4, 5 and 6, Sherwin on counts 3, 5, 6 and 9 \u2014 and have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">There are fourteen assignments of error. Assignment 1 is that the court erred in denying appellants\u2019 motion, at the close of appellee\u2019s evidence in chief, to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to sustain any count thereof. Appellants waived the motion by introducing evidence in their own behalf. Baldwin v. United States, 9 Cir., 72 F.2d 810, 812. Hence, denial of the motion was not assignable as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-12\">Assignment 2 is that the court erred in denying appellants\u2019 motion, at the close of all the evidence, to dismiss the indictment and to direct a verdict of acquittal on the ground that there was no substantial evidence to support the charges made in the indictment. The denial of the motion was not excepted to and was, therefore, not assignable as error. Muyres v. United States, 9 Cir., 89 F.2d 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-13\">Assignment 3 is that \u201cCounsel for [appellee] committed prejudicial error in his closing argument to the jury by grossly misquoting the evidence and by commenting on the prior convictions of one of the defendants.\u201d The assignment does not say that the court committed any error. It, therefore, presents nothing for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-14\">Assignment 4 is that the court erred \u201cin commenting on the failure of certain defendants to take the witness stand to testify.\u201d Actually, all defendants on trial, including appellants, took the witness stand and testified. There was no failure to take the witness stand, no comment on such failure and, therefore, no basis for the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-15\">Assignment 5'is that the court erred in sustaining appellee\u2019s objection to the following question which, on re-direct examination, appellants\u2019 counsel propounded to appellant Sherwin: \u201cMr. Sherwin, in regard to this personal correspondence that you had in your possession, what was the purpose of that correspondence that you brought to California in the fall of \u201933?\u201d There was no evidence that Sherwin brought any correspondence to California in the fall of \u201933. The objection was properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-18\">Assignment 6 is that the court erred in stating to the jury that the court was satisfied that all the evidence had been presented, so far as the defendants on trial were concerned, and that if the jury could, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>good conscience, agree on a verdict, they should do so. The statement was part of an instruction which the court gave the jury after they had deliberated for several hours without result. There was no exception to this or any part of the instruction. It was, therefore, not assignable as error. Levine v. United States, 9 Cir., 79 F.2d 364, 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">Assignment 7 is that the court erred in admitting in evidence, over appellants\u2019 objection, appellee\u2019s Exhibit 62. This was the letter the mailing of which constituted the crime charged in count 2 of the indictment. The assignment states that the letter, was dated \u201clong after the time said crime is alleged to have been consummated,\u201d and that it was, therefore, incompetent. Appellants are mistaken. The letter was dated September 17, 1935. The crime \u2014 the mailing of the letter \u2014 was alleged to have been consummated on or about September 18, 1935. The letter was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Assignment 8 is that the court erred in admitting in evidence, over appellants\u2019 objection, appellee\u2019s Exhibit 71. This exhibit is not in the record. The bill of exceptions speaks of it as a post card, but does not disclose its <em>contents nor state </em>the substance or effect thereof. Hence, the question of its admissibility cannot be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Assignments 9 and 10 are that the court erred in admitting in evidence, over appellants\u2019 objection, appellee\u2019s Exhibits 1 find 2. These exhibits are not in the record. The bill of exceptions describes Exhibit 1 as an application \u2014 also as a petition \u2014 filed with the California 'Corporation Department on June 3, 1932. The bill states: \u201cSaid petition is sworn to by William Fidroeff, secretary of Ray-O-Vision [Corporation], and petitions tlie Department for permission to sell 6,500 shares of stock in Ray-O-Vision Corporation.\u201d The bill describes Exhibit 2 as \u201ca permit to sell stock issued by the California Division of Corporations to Ray-O-Vision Corporation on June 22, 1932.\u201d The bill states that the permit grants the corporation the right to sell 9,135% shares of stock to the public. Appellants objected to the admission of Exhibits 1 and 2 on the ground that they were \u201cincompetent, irrelevant and immaterial.\u201d There was no merit in the objection. The exhibits tended, with other evidence, to show the existence and character of the scheme charged in the indictment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They were clearly admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">Assignments 11, 12, 13 and 14 are that the court erred in admitting' in evidence appellee\u2019s Exhibits 3, 72, 76 and 94. These exhibits were admitted without objection. Their admission was, therefore, not assignable as error. Lynch v. United States, 9 Cir., 80 F.2d 390, 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">Judgments affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-9\"> \u201cWhoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises * * * shall, for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice * * * place, or cause to be placed, any letter *' * * in any post office * * * of the United States * * * to be sent or delivered by the post office establishment of the United States * * * or shaE\u2019 knowingly cause to be deHvered by maU according to the direction thereon * * * any such letter * * * shaE be fined not more than $1,000, or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b566-20\"> This was a scheme to seE stock\u2019 of Ray-O-Vision Corporation and other corporations and to obtain payment therefor, by making false and fraudulent pretenses, representations and promises to purchasers thereof, thereby defrauding such purchasers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b566-21\"> In the Southern District of CaHfor-nia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b567-29\"> See footnote 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
