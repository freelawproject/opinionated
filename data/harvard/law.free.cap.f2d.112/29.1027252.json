The trial court, upon \u00e1 motion of the appellee, dismissed the complaint upon the grounds that it raised a political question over which the court had no jurisdiction, that it showed insufficient interest in the plaintiff to warrant equitable intervention, and that it stated no controversy between the parties. From the order of dismissal this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-24\">As a foundation for the relief sought the appellant\u2019s complaint alleged that, under the statute by virtue of which the Commonwealth came into existence\u2014 the Independence Act of March 24, 1934 (48 Stat. 456), 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1231 et seq., under the Constitution of the Commonwealth and of the Ordinance appended thereto, and under \u201cChapter 390, Section 4, 48 Stat. 879,\u201d 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1091, the Resident Commissioner to the United States must be a bona fide elector of the Commonwealth, must owe allegiance to the United States, be more than thirty years of age, able to read and write the English language, and must be appointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>by tlie President of the Commonwealth with the consent of the Commission on Appointments, a body created by the Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The complaint charged that the appellee does not possess the qualifications mentioned and in particular that the Commission on Appointments had not given its consent to his appointment. Therefore, it was asserted, the exercise by the appellee of the powers or the enjoyment of the privileges or immunities of the office in question would be a usurpation and an encroachment upon the right of the citizens of the Commonwealth to be represented by a Resident Commissioner possessing the requisite qualifications. x\\nd it was further charged that at tlie time of the commencement of the action the ap-pellee was purporting to be the Resident Commissioner of the Commonwealth to the United States, and it was alleged that, unless it was judicially determined that he had not the lawful right to hold and exercise the office of Resident Commissioner, the appellee would, upon the convening of the United Slates Congress in January of 1939, attempt to take a seat in the House of Representatives, to participate in the debates of the House, and to enjoy the privileges and immunities ordinarily attaching to the office of a member of the House.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The Independence Act provides, in paragraph 5 of Section 7;</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">\u201c(5) The government of the Commonwealth of the Philippine Islands shall provide for the selection of a Resident Commissioner to the United States, and shall fix his term of office. He shall be the representative of the government of the Commonwealth of the Philippine Islands and shall be entitled to official recognition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>as such by all departments upon presentation to the President of credentials signed by the Chief Executive of said government. He shall have a seat in the House of Representatives of the United States, with the right of debate, but without the right of voting. His salary and expenses shall be fixed and paid by the government of the Philippine Islands. ...\u201d [48 Stat. 462] And the Ordinance appended to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of the Philippines provides, in Section 2:</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\u201cSec. 2. Pending the final and complete withdrawal of the sovereignty of the Unitr ed States over the Philippines, there shall be a Resident Commissioner of the Philippines to the United States who shall be appointed by the President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines with the consent of the Commission on Appointments. The powers and duties of the Resident Commissioner shall be as provided in section seven, paragraph five of Public Act Numbered One hundred and twenty-seven of the Congress of the United States, approved March twenty-four, nineteen hundred and thirty-four, together with such other duties as the National Assembly may determine. The qualifications, compensation, and expenses of the Resident Commissioner shall be fixed by law.\u201d [Ordinance Appended to the Constitution of the Philippines (Manila Bureau of Printing, 1935), p. 32]</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The theory of the appellant\u2019s complaint is that since under Newman v. United States ex rel. Frizzell, 1915, 238 U. S. 537, 35 S.Ct. 881, 59 L.Ed. 1446, an action at law, in quo warranto, against the putative incumbent of a public office, may not be maintained in the District of Columbia, and since \u2014 as the appellant contends\u2014 the Congress has no power, the appellee not being a member of Congress, to judge of his qualifications, it necessarily follows that there is a remedy, in equity, to determine whether or not the appellee possesses the qualifications legally requisite to the office of Resident Commissioner, and to oust him from office if the determination is in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">But we think that the appellant\u2019s theory overlooks the proposition that \u201cin order to entitle the party to the remedy, a case must be presented appropriate for the exercise of judicial power; the rights in danger . . . must b\u00e9 rights of persons or property, not merely political rights, which do not belong to the jurisdiction of a court, either in law or equity.\u201d State of Georgia v. Stanton, 1867, 6 Wall. 50, 76, 18 L.Ed. 721. We think that the trial court properly dismissed the complaint upon the ground that it presented a political, not a judicial, question and one therefore of which the court had no jurisdiction. The other grounds of dismissal it is not necessary to discuss.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">Courts have no jurisdiction to decide political questions. These are such as have been entrusted by the sovereign for decision to the so-called political departments of government, as distinguished from questions which the sovereign has set to be decided in the courts. Even under a government where there is no express constitutional delegation of powers, this limitation upon judicial authority has long been recognized. It was suggested in The Duke of York\u2019s Claim to the Crown, 5 Rotuli Par. 375 (House of Lords, 1460), Wambaugh, Cases on Constitutional Law (1915) 1, 3, where, in respect of the claim of the Duke of York, the \u201cKyngs Justices\u201d decided that they \u201cdurst not enter into eny communication thereof, for it perteyned to the Lordes of the Kyngs blode . . \u2019. .\u201d <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>And in Nabob of the Carnatic v. East India Company, 1 Ves.Jr. 371 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>(1791), 2 Ves.Jr. 56 (1793), in which stems a series of authorities in England (see West Rand Central Gold Mining Company, Ltd. v. The King, [1905] 2 K.B. 391), the distinction between judicial and political power was recognized. See also Penn. v. Lord Baltimore, 1 Ves.Sen. 444 (1750). In the United States as early as Ware v. Hylton, 1796, 3 Dall. 199, 260, 1 L.Ed. 568, it was held \u201cincompetent to the examination and decifion of a Court of Juftice\u201d to determine whether a treaty between England and the United States had been broken by one of the parties to it. And from that day until the present time, the decisions in the Federal courts recognize and apply this principle of judicial self-limitation in so-called political cases. Thus courts have refused to: Determine whether or not the constitutional guaranty to every state of a republican form of government has been satisfied;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or determine the conditions of peace or war;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> determine the beginning and end of war;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or determine whether or not aliens shall be excluded or expelled;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or determine governmental title to or jurisdiction over a territory;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or determine the status of</p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Indian tribes;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or recognize the existence of states or governments ;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or enforce the provisions of a treaty when the sovereign chooses to disregard them;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or determine whether a treaty has been terminated;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or inquire into the constitutional powers of representatives of foreign nations.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> While the boundaries of the field of de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>cisi\u00f3n which lies outside the authority of the courts are not wholly definite \u2014 this because the question to which department a power has been delegated is often a difficult problem of interpretation \u201cAccording as the commission is precise\u201d or \u201cis inexact\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u2014 it is not necessary in the instant case to attempt to mark out with precision all points on the boundary, because. the instant case clearly falls well within the field of political, rather than judicial action. The Resident Commissioner partakes in part of the characteristics of a diplomatic representative of a foreign power and in part of those of a delegate from a territory. And the determination of the qualifications of .such officers lies obviously outside judicial authority and within the field of political action.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">As will have been noted from the provisions of the Independence Act which have been set out above, the Resident Commissioner \u201cshall be the representative of the government of the Commonwealth of the Philippine Islands and shall be entitled to official recognition as such by all departments upon presentation to the President of credentials signed by the Chief Executive of said government. . Iiis salary and expenses shall be fixed and paid by the government of the Philippine Islands.\u201d Moreover the political organization which the Resident Commissioner represents itself presently partakes \u2014 during the interim period between the coming into existence of the Commonwealth and the date when it may in the manner provided in the Independence Act acquire complete independence<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u2014 in some part of the characteristics, under international law, of a state.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It has a people per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>manently occupying a fixed territory, bound together by common laws into a body politic, with an organized government exercising powers within the territory and capable, subject to limitations mentioned below, of entering into relations with other states. See 1 Hyde, International Law (1922) \u00a7 7; 1 Moore, International Law Digest (1906) \u00a7 3. The Commonwealth does not fully satisfy the definition of a state at international law because it does not possess independent treaty making power by virtue of which it may enter into direct relations with other pow-ers.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> But to the extent that the Commonwealth is like a foreign state, its Resident Commissioner is like a diplomatic representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">But the Resident Commissioner partakes also of the characteristics of a delegate from a dependent territory. By virtue of paragraph 5 of Section 7 of the Independence Act, above set forth, \u201cHe shall have a seat in the House of Representatives of the United States, with the right of debate, but without the right of voting.\u201d And although the government which he represents has, as just demonstrated, in some part the characteristics of a foreign state, it also has some of the characteristics of a dependent territory.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">The law is settled that the courts have no jurisdiction to pass upon the qualifications of a diplomatic representative of a foreign power. Section 3- of Article II of the United States Constitution express<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>ly delegates to the executive branch of the government the power to receive ambassadors : the President \u201cshall receive ambassadors and other public ministers . . . From this it follows that in him is the authority to determine the authenticity of the credentials of diplomatic representatives, and whether this government will recognize them as the qualified representatives of a foreign power.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">In Re Baiz, 1890, 135 U.S. 403, 10 S.Ct, 854, 34 L.Ed. 222, an action was commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to recover damages for the publication by one Baiz of an alleged libel. Upon the ground that this had been published in the course of his representation of the Republic of Guatemala and that in this diplomatic status he was a privileged person, Baiz applied to the Supreme Court for a writ of prohibition to restrain the District Court from exercising jurisdiction. Correspondence between Baiz and the Secretary of State of the United States showed that the State Department had refused to recognize him as an accredited representative of Guatemala. The Supreme Court held, therefore, that the District Court had jurisdiction and refused to issue the writ. It accepted as final and binding upon the courts the refusal of the State Department to recognize Baiz. The Court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">\u201cWe ought to add that while we have not cared to dispose of this case upon the mere absence of technical evidence, we do not assume to sit in judgment upon the decision of the executive in reference to the public character of a person claiming to be a foreign minister, and therefore have the right to accept the certificate of the State Department that a party is or is not a privileged person, and cannot properly be asked to proceed upon argumentative or collateral proof.\u201d [135 U.S. at pages 431, 432, 10 S.Ct. at page 862, 34 L.Ed. 222]</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Again in Agency of Canadian Car &amp; F. Co. v. American Can Co., 2 Cir., 1919, 258 F. 363, 6 A.L.R. 1182, it appeared that in 1917 the Russian government had, through officials recognized by the United States government, assigned to the plaintiff Agency all of its interest in certain claims due from the defendant American Can Company. These claims had matured and were the subject of the suit. The defendant raised, among other questions, one as to whether the officials who executed the assignment for the Russian government authentically represented it. The court held that it would not assume to examine into this question for the reason that \u201cwho represents and acts for a foreign sovereign or nation in its relation with the United States is determined, not by the judicial department, hut exclusively by the political branch of the government,\u201d and held that the authority of the officials in question was conclusively established for the court by the fact of their recognition by the United States government. This point was decided upon the authority of In re Baiz, supra. To the same effect see The Rog-day, D.C.N.D.Cal., 1920, 279 F. 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">We think it clear also that the courts have no authority to pass upon the qualifications of a delegate from a territory. Article I, section 5 of the Constitution provides that \u201ceach house shall be the judge of the elections, returns, and qualifications of its own members . . . .\u201d And the Supreme Court has recognized that although these powers are judicial, as distinguished from legislative or executive, in type, they have nevertheless been lodged in the legislative branch by the Constitution. In Barry v. United States ex rel. Cunningham, 1929, 279 U.S. 597, 49 S.Ct. 452, 73 L.Ed. 867, -an inquiry was instituted by the United States Senate, through a committee thereof, into the validity of the election of a Senator from Pennsylvania. In respect of the committee\u2019s action in ordering a witness taken into custody for contumacy, the question whether the Senate was engaged in an inquiry which it had constitutional power to make, was presented to the Supreme Court in a ha-beas corpus proceeding. The Court ruled that it was, saying:</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">\u201c. . . Generally, the Senate is a legislative body, exercising in connection with the House only the power to make laws. But it has had conferred upon it by the Constitution certain powers which are not legislative but judicial in character. Among these is the power to judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own members. Art. I, \u00a7 5, cl. 1. . Exercise of the power necessarily involves the ascertainment of facts, the attendance of witnesses, the examination of such witnesses, with the power to compel them to-answer pertinent questions, to determine the facts and apply the appropriate rules of law, and, finally, <em>to render a judgment which is beyond the authority of any other </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number><em>tribunal to review. . </em>. . \u201d [279 U.S. at page 613, 49 S.Ct. at page 455, 73 L.Ed. 867] [Italics supplied] See also the remark in Keogh v. Horner, D.C.S.D.Ill, 1934, 8 F.Supp. 933, 935, that \u201cthe power of the respective Houses of Congress with reference to the qualification and legality of the election of its members is supreme. . . . this court has no authority to be the judge of the manner in which such members were elected. . . . \u201d And see Note (1937) 107 A.L.R. 205, 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">We are cited to no cases, and we find none, in which the Federal courts have even been asked to determine the qualifications of a member of Congress. Apparently it has been fully recognized that that power is lodged exclusively in the legislative branch. Under parallel provisions in state constitutions giving state legislatures the power to determine the qualifications of their members, it is ruled that the legislative power is exclusive\u2014 that the courts have no jurisdiction. Reif v. Barrett, 1933, 355 Ill. 104, 188 N.E. 889; Greenwood v. Board of Registrars of Voters of City of Fitchburg, 1933, 282 Mass. 74, 184 N.E. 390; Dinan v. Swig, 1916, 223 Mass. 516, 112 N.E. 91; Covington v. Buffett, 1900, 90 Md. 569, 45 A. 204, 47 L.R.A. 622; Attorney General v. Board of Canvassers of Seventh Senatorial District, 1908, 155 Mich. 44, 118 N.W. 584; Dalton v. State, 1885, <em>43 </em>Ohio St. 652, 3 N.E. 685 ; and see Note (1937) 107 A.L.R. 205, 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">It is patent, of course, that the Resident Commissioner of the Philippines is not in a full sense of the term a \u201cmember of Congress.\u201d Neither, however, are delegates to Congress from the various territories. They, like tire Resident Commissioner, have some but not all of the characteristics of members, i. e., they have a seat, and they may participate in debate, but they may not vote.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In Territory ex rel. Sulzer v. Canvassing Board, 1st Div., 1917, 5 Alaska 602, there was a petition in the territorial court brought by the Territory of Alaska on the relation of one Sul-zer for an alternative writ of mandamus, to compel a Canvassing Board to reject the alleged votes from certain precincts for the office of delegate to Congress from Alaska, or to issue to Sulzer a certificate of election. The petition was granted, the court holding that mandamus was the proper remedy to compel the Canvassing Board to issue a certificate. But the court recognized that \u201cthis certificate of election is not final. The House'of Representatives is the tribunal before which the contest of election comes. . . . it is clothed with plenary power to seat whomsoever it pleases \u2014 certificate or no certificate.\u201d (5 Alaska at pages 631-632) And Congress has, in respect of persons claiming a right to sit as delegates from territories, consistently claimed .and exercised power to determine their qualifications. See for example: The Florida Election Case of David Levy, 1 Hinds, Precedents of the House of Representatives (1907) 394 (1841) ; The Utah Election Case of Campbell v. Cannon, id. at 500 (1882).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-18\">We do not assume to rule, because it is not necessary to do so, whether the action of the executive department alone is Conclusive of the qualifications of the Resident Commissioner \u2014 because he partakes in some part of the characteristics of a diplomatic representative and presents his credentials to the President; or whether the action of the legislative department alone is conclusive of his qualifications\u2014 because he partakes in part of the characteristics of a delegate; or whether the ultimate authority to determine the Resident Commissioner\u2019s qualifications is in the joint action of the two political departments. It is sufficient for the determination of this case that, under the Constitutional provisions, judicial decisions and reasoning above set forth, the power to determine the qualifications of the Resident Commissioner is exclusively in either the President or the House of Representatives, or both, as political departments of the government, and not in the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-9\"> The complaint cites \u201cChapter 890, Section 4, 48 Stat. 879\u201d as authority for its allegation that the Resident, Commissioner must be a bona fide elector, owing allegiance to the United States, over the age of thirty, and able to read and write the English language. The statute referred to is an Act of June 5, 1934, amending Section 20 of Chapter 416 of the Act of August 29, 1916, 39 Stat. Sl\u00ed). The Act of August 29, 1916, prescribes the qualifications of the Resident Commissioners under the former Philippine government, prior to the Commonwealth. The Act of Juno 5, 1934, amends the Act of August 29, 1916, only in respect of the date of the commencement of the term of office of the Resident Commissioners, changing the same from the fourth of March to the third of January. The Act of August 29, 1916, as thus amended, has been superseded by the provisions of the Independence Act and of the Ordinance appended to the Constitution of the Commonwealth, and by the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 10, First National Assembly, approved December 31, 1935 (Messages of tlie President. Vol. 1 (Revised Edition, Manila Bureau of Printing, 1938) 177). (Although the Independence Act was approved March 24, 1984, it did not take effect until May 1, 1934, the date of tlie concurrent resolution of the Philippine Legislature (Messages of tlie President, id. at 300, Appendix II) accepting the Independence Act in accordance with the provisions of Section 17 thereof; and the new Commonwealth government was not established until November 15, 1935, tlie date of the promulgation by the Secretary of War of the United States of the proclamation of tlie President of the United States pursuant to Section 4 of the Independence Act announcing the results of the election of officers provided for under the Constitution. For the text of the President\u2019s proclamation see 49 Stat. 3481; and for the text of the promulgation of the proclamation by the Secretary of 'War see Messages of the President, id. at 311, Appendix J. Until November 15, 1935, therefore, the provisions of the Act of August 29, 1916, as amended by the Act of June 5, 1934, were in effect, although the Independence Act had been approved prior to tiie date of the June 5, 1934 amendment.) Since the Act of August 29, 1916, as amended, has been superseded by tlie Independence Act and the Ordinance appended to the Constitution of the Commonwealth, and by the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 10, above referred to, it obviously has nothing to do with the qualifications of any Resident Commissioner representing the present Commonwealth government.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">Under the pertinent provisions of the Independence Act and of the Ordinance appended to the Constitution of the Commonwealth and under the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 10, the Resident Commissioner to the United States must possess the following qualifications: he must be appointed by the President of the Commonwealth with tlie consent of the Commission on Appointments of the National Assembly; ho must have been a citizen and resident of the Philippines for five years before his appointment, and must he thirty years of age or over and a qualified elector of the Philippines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b94-7\"> \u201cThe matter was thus: On October 16, 1460, the counsel of the Duke of York brought into Parliament a written claim to the crown, desiring speedy answer thereto.

Eor as the United States guarantee to each State a republican government, Congress must necessarily decide what government is established in the State before it can determine whether it is republican or not. And when the senators and representatives of a State are admitted into the councils of the Union, the authority of the government under which they are appointed, as well as its republican character, is recognized by the proper constitutional authority. And its decision is binding on every other department of the government, and could not be questioned in a judicial tribunal. It is true that the contest in this case did not last long enough to bring the matter to this issue; and as no senators or representatives were elected under the authority of the government of which Mr. Dorr was the head, Congress was not called upon to decide the controversy.

Wesion lists the following considerations influencing judicial negation of power: <em>\u201c(a) </em>The fundamental powers and duties in question have distinctly not been delegated to the courts by the Constitution, but rather to the other departments. (6) These fundamental powers and duties are of the sort ordinarily performed by what we understand as political rather than judicial action. The process of legislation is assertion, not decision; foreign affairs are conducted by negotiations, not by pleading and proof; political integrity is maintained by diplomacy or arms, not by injunctions. (o) From another aspect, these powers and duties relate, not to the ordinary matters of law which form the main bulk of controversy between private persons, not to the incidence of the police power upon the workaday world, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>but to ths maintenance, furtherance, and funcitoning of government, to the exigencies of the state\u2019s existence, external and internal, <em>(d) </em>In every instance where a question of fact is to be decided, it is one which the persons executing the power or performing the duty must decide as the very basis of their own not merely ministerial conduct, (e) In those matters which relate to foreign affairs and to military action abroad and at home, the circumstances will often be such as to leave no chance to await the result of test litigation, while the consequences of the action may be so far-reaching that any uncertainty as to its validity becomes intolerable. (/) Other practical considerations come to the fore, which we cannot assume were not adverted to by the framers of the Constitution and which are indicated upon the face of that instrument itself. Unity; certainty; respect and orderliness; efficiency ; all are <em>desiderata.\u201d </em>38 Harv.L.Eev. at 327-8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b97-8\"> \u201cAccording as the commission is precise. there is less room for a confusion of the various senses of \u2018judicial\u2019 or \u2018political\u2019 in connection with any given problem of the division of power. According as the commission is inexact, there is more opportunity for such confusion, but the confounding is none the less unjustified in legal thought. Judicial questions, in what may be thought the more useful sense, are those which the sovereign has set to be decided in the courts. Political questions, similarly, are those which the sovereign has entrusted to the so-eallcd political departments of government or has reserved to be settled by its own extra-governmental action. As to the courts, the question is always the same, whether the method has been that of clear express delegation at the outset of a court\u2019s creation, or that of obscure delegation through a centuries-long process, in part of authority given in advance, and in part of approval, express or tacit, given in arrears of jurisdiction already assumed. . . . The problem is one of interpretation in a very well understood sense, and it is only the factors of interpretation which will be for the moment in doubt. . . .\u201d Weston, Political Questions, id. at 301.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b97-10\"> gee. 10.
