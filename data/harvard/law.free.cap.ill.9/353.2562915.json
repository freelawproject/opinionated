The proceeding resulted in a judgment in favor of the collector for costs. From that judgment, the county prosecuted an appeal, which the appellee now moves to dismiss. The motion must be sustained. The ordinary mode of removing cases into this Court is by writ of error. The forty seventh section of the eighty third chapter of the Revised Statutes declares that, \u201cappeals from the Circuit Courts to the Supreme Court shall be allowed in all cases where the judgment or decree appealed from be final, and shall amount, exclusive of costs, to the sum of twenty dollars, or relate to a franchise or freehold.\u201d This provision does not embrace the present case. The subject matter of the suit does not relate to a franchise or freehold, nor does the judgment below amount to twenty dollars. The remedy of the county is by a writ of error, and not by an appeal.</p> <p id=\"b362-5\" pgmap=\"362\">Appeal dismissed.</p> <footnote label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b361-21\" pgmap=\"361\">Wilson, C.
