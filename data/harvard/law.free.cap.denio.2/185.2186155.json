But <em>mesne </em>process against the person returnable out of term is void <em>Per </em>Bhonbon,C. J.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-7\">The plaintiff was nonsuited on the trial of an action of ejectment: he made a bill of exceptions which was settled and signed; but not having obtained an order to stay proceedings, the defendant perfected a judgment for costs. An alias <em>ca. sa. </em>was issued on the judgment to the sheriff of Oswego, tested the first Monday, and made returnable the eleventh day of January last, which was <em>Sunday. </em>The defendant\u2019s attorney fell into the error by consulting a counting house almanac in which the eleventh day of January was put down as being <em>Suturday. </em>The plaintiff was arrested on the <em>ca. sa., </em>and gave bail for the jail limits.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-8\"><em>A.

He said that the writ, being returnable on Sunday, was void, and was not amendable. He cited <em>Grah,. Pr. </em>118; 2 <em>R.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEf\">The writ was irregular in consequence of the mistake in the return day; but it is amendable. The distinction is between mesne and final process. Mesne process against the body, returnable out of term, is void, and cannot be amended. <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>4 <em>Cowen, </em>504. <em>And see Chandler </em>v. <em>Brecknell, id. </em>49.) But final process against the body, returnable out of term, is voidable only, and may be amended. <em>(Cramer </em>v. <em>Van Allstyne, </em>9 <em>John. </em>386.) The legislature has made the same distinction. (2 <em>R. S. </em>424, \u00a7 1 to 3.) If there were nothing else in the case, the defendant would be allowed to amend on payment of the costs of the motion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>But the plaintiff wants' relief; and on grounds which it is unnecessary to mention, the <em>ca. sa. </em>will be set aside, and the limit bond ordered to be given up, on the plaintiff\u2019s stipulating not to bring any action; and the costs of the motion will be left to abide the event of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Ordered accordingly</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
