Error to the recorder\u2019s court of the city of Buffalo. Hodges sued \u201c The City of Buffalo \u201d in <em>assumpsit </em>and counted for the use of certain rooms in his hotel, for meat, drink and refreshments furnished, and the attendance of his servants, &amp;c. at the request of, and for the defendant. <em>Non assumpsit </em>was pleaded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-10\">The plaintiff proved that the common council of the city on the 14th day of June, 1838, passed a resolution appointing a committee of three aldermen \u201c on the part of the corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>to co-operate with our citizens generally, for making proper arrangements for the celebrating in a suitable manner the coming anniversary of our national independence.\u201d This committee associated themselves with certain other persons appointed on the part of the citizens, and they together (the three aldermen expressly assenting,) contracted with the plaintiff, a hotel keeper, to furnish an entertainment and ball at his hotel for the citizens and certain military guests who were expected from Detroit and Rochester, on the evening of the 4th of July ensuing, for which he was to be paid $1200. The entertainment and ball were given, the plaintiff fully performing on his part. The plaintiff had received from sources other than the corporation the amount agreed to be paid, excepting a balance of principal and interest amounting to $355,11, for the recovery of which this suit was brought. The court below, on the motion of the defendant, nonsuited the plaintiff, who excepted. Judgment was rendered against the plaintiff for costs and he brought error to this court on a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b111-5\"><em>J L.

The corporation of Buffalo had no authority to enter into this contract either by express grant or as an incident to any power directly given, <em>(Angel &amp; Ames on Corp. </em>239.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number><em>By the Court, </em>Jewett, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ao\">The determination of this cause depends upon the question, whether the corporation of the city of Buffalo- had' power to contract the debt claimed. Such- power must, be- conferred by statute.. It cannot be. taken by implication. Corporations have no other powers than such as are expressly granted, or- such as, are necessary to carry into effect the powers expressly conferred. All corporations, possess the powers enumerated in 1 <em>R. S. </em>599, \u00a7 1; but the authority to enter into this, contract is not found there. No corporation possesses any powers, not, conferred- by this section or- by its act of incorporation, 11 except such as shall be necessary to the exercise of the powers so .enumerated and given.\u201d <em>(Id.. </em>\u00a7 3.) The act to incorporate the city of Buffalo contains no provision which countenances the claim now set up as appertaining to the. city corporation. The inhabitants are made a corporation and as such are authorized to be represented in- courts, to have a common seal and to purchase and convey real estate. <em>(Laws </em>1832, <em>p. </em>297, \u00a7 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The common council are authorized to manage the finances and the corporate property, and they may- make by-laws, for certain specified purposes. (\u00a7 31.) They may also make and change such ordinances, by-laws, and- police regulations \u201cfor the <em>good government </em>and order of the said city, and the trade and commerce thereof as may be necessary to carry into effect the powers given, to said council.\u201d (\u00a7 33.) They have power to raise $8000 a year by tax for lighting the streets, supporting a night watch, making and repairing roads and bridges, and \u201cto defray the-contingent and other expenses of the city.\u201d (\u00a7 38.) Power is conferred upon the common council to- do-certain acts which require the expenditure of money, and' which are properly chargeable as contingent expenses upon the fund so to-be raised by taxation, but there is nothing which authorizes them to provide entertainments upon any occasion whatever. '</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel failing to find express authority to make expenditures for this purpose, insists that- the claim can he sustained: on the- ground-that the plaintiff having furnished this entertainment, the corporation has received the considera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>tion, and is bound to pay although the'engagement was-made without legal authority. It is said to be analogous to a subsequent ratification by a corporation of the unauthorized act of its agent. I cannot concur in this view of the case. The doctrine referred to assumes that the principal had power to confer the requisite authority in the first instance. It cannot be maintained that a corporation can by a subsequent ratification make good an act of its agent which it could not; have directly empowered him to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The power attempted to beconf\u00e9rred by the common council upon this committee was unauthorized, and the acts of the committee were void so far as they assumed to bind the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
