The action was on a money bond. The defendants demurred to the declaration, and the plaintiffs thereupon amended under the rule allowing amendments as of course. The defendants did not plead to the amended declaration, arid the plaintiffs took judgment by default. The plaintiffs taxed their costs by items, instead of taxing a gross sum under the act of 1844. Among other items the taxing officer allowed counsel fee $5,00, brief and copies $3,00, drawing and copies of the amended declaration, and other charges connected with the same $6,75 : drawing bill of costs $1,00, and 2 copies $1,00\u00a1</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b186-10\"><em>S.

He insisted that the plaintiffs were only entitled to a gross sum for attorney and counsel fees under the act of 1844.

In this action, there was no such assessment of damages; and consequently the case did not come within the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">But there were some improper allowances. As no issue of law or fact had been joined, a retaining fee of counsel should not have been taxed; <em>(Stat. </em>1840, <em>p. </em>327, \u00a7 2;) and for the same reason, the charges for a brief were improper.

That is charging the expenses of their own error in pleading upon the opposite party. The general rule authorized them to amend as of course, and without costs; but it did not give them costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">As there was no trial or argument, the drawing of the bill of costs should have been taxed only fifty cents, and the copies at twenty-five cents.
