The plaintiffs demurred to the special pleas, and gave notice of bringing on the argument on the ground of the frivolousness of the pleas; and at the last January term they obtained judgment on the demurrer by default.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"pARjq\"><em>J. Edwards, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9s\">read affidavits excusing the default, and asked to have the same set aside, to the end that the demurrer might be argued.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b200-7\"><em>J.

But it is not. The matters s\u00e9t \u00fap in the special pl\u00e9as may be given in evidence under the general iss\u00fa\u00e9; and I think we ought not to interfere. Setting aside the default, \u00e1nd allowing an argument on the Sufficiency of the sp\u00e9cial pleas, would only caus\u00e9 d\u00e9lay, wi\u00ed\u00edi\u00f3\u00fat answering any valuable eiid to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
