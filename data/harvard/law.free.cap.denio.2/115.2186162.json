The: plaintiffs,' as trustees of the creditors of Joseph and Andrew Brown, appointed pursuant to proceedings' by attachment instituted against them as nonresident debtors on the 9th day of November, 1836 under- the provisions of \"the' revised statutes, sued the- defendants <em>in case </em>for an alleged violation \"of duty as the agents in New-York\" of the Planters\u2019 Bank of Tennessee, in' refusing' to \u2022 permit a transfer to the plaintiffs on the transfer book of the Planters\u2019 Bank kept by them, of two - hundred and eighty-one shares of the capital stock of that bank alleged to belong to the plaintiffs -in their character of trustees. The declaration alleged that the defendants were-a banking corporation organized under their charter and transacting business in the city of New York, and that the Planters\u2019 Bank was a corporation\" created by the legislature of Tennessee with a capital off $2,000,000, divided into shares \"of $100 each. It then averred that the defendants at the several times 'afterwards mentioned, \u201c were the agents in the said city of New-York \"of the said Planters\u2019 Bank of Tennessee for the registration arid transfer of the stock of such bank and the payment of dividends thereupon in said city, and did during all the time last aforesaid keep at their said banking house in the city of New York, a set of books for the registration and transfer \"of the said stock of the said Planters\u2019 Bank of Tennessee,\u201d to wit, &amp;c. It then stated with particularity the title of the trustees to the shares claimed by them, which was substantially as follows: the Browns, prior to the attachment against them, were the owners of the stock, and held two certificates, \u00e9ach for separate portion^ of it, issued by the defendants as the lawfully authorized agents of the Planters\u2019 Bank, signed by the cashier and by a clerk of the defendants under the corporate seal of the Planters\u2019 Bank, which certificates stated that the Browns were entitled to the shares mentioned in the certificates- respectively, which were declared to be \u201ctransferable only at the bank'of the said defendants on the surrender of the certificate.\u201d On the 12th day of December, 1837, A.

Crockett and. Park, with a power of attorney contained in it .to a clerk of the defendants, who was named, to. surrender the certificates and execute, a formal transfer, Crockett and Park, a few days afterwards, executed a like conveyance of the stock to the. plaintiffs, as trustees as aforesaid, with a power of attorney in blank. The declaration thereupon. avers that it became and was the duty of the defendants upon the production and surrender of the certificates, \u201c to suffer, and permit \u201d the stock to be regularly transferred upon the transfer books kept at the defendants\u2019 bank to, the .plaintiffs as truste.es under the .act; and that the plaintiffs, to. wit, on.the 29.thof \u25a0 September, 1838, &amp;c. exhibited to the defendants these evidences of their right to the stock, and also a letter from the cashier of the Planters\u2019 Bank to the cashier of the defendants\u2019 company requesting that such .transfer might be made, and offered to fill up the blank in the last mentioned conveyance with the name, of a clerk of the defendants\", and to do all necessary acts, &amp;c, and requested the defendants to permit the transfer .to be made; yet that the defendants, not regarding their duty, &amp;c. but contriving and fraudulently intending, &amp;c. Would hot suffer or permit the stock to \"be transferred to the plaintiffs on the books so kept, by them, &amp;c. whereby the plaintiffs have been unable to. obtain a sufficient title to the stock and have been prevented from, selling and disposing of it, whereby it has become of no Value, to the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-5\">The foregoing is.the substance of the first count.

If the plaintiffs have a cause of action against any one, it is not against the defendants, but against the Planters\u2019 Bank of Tennessee. The defendants were not the agent of the plaintiffs and owed them no duty. They were the agent of the Planters\u2019 Bank; and for a neglect to discharge their agency, they are answerable to their principal and to no one else. If third persons are injured by the neglect of a known agent, the rule is <em>respondeat superior, </em>and generally the action must be brought against the principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Judgment for defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
