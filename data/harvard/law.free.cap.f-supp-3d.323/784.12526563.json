Ellis, III, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff, a Virginia limited liability company engaged in the business of buying and selling houses, brings this action against defendant, a Texas corporation engaged in the same business, seeking cancellation of defendant's two trademarks, \"We Buy Houses\" and \"Webuyhouses.com\" (\"the Marks\"), on the grounds that both marks are generic and undeserving of trademark protection. In response, defendant has counter-claimed that plaintiff has infringed on the Marks and falsely designated the origin of plaintiff's services. Both parties have moved for summary judgment on plaintiff's claim and defendant's counterclaims. This memorandum opinion addresses whether the Marks are generic, and therefore ineligible for trademark protection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because there are no disputed issues of material fact with respect to this question, plaintiff's motion for summary judgment must be granted in part and defendant's cross-motion for summary judgment must be denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Given that summary judgment is appropriate only where there are no genuine disputes of material fact, Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, the first step in the analysis is to identify the record facts as to which no genuine dispute exists. In this regard, Local Rule 56(B) directs a movant for summary judgment to include in its submission a separately captioned section listing in numbered-paragraph form all material facts as to which the movant contends no genuine dispute exists. The nonmovant must then respond to each numbered paragraph, either admitting or contesting the putative undisputed fact and citing admissible record evidence to establish a genuine dispute of material fact. The nonmovant's failure to respond to a fact listed by the movant constitutes an admission that\n   the fact is undisputed. R. 16(B) Scheduling Order \u00b6 13. Where, as here, both parties have moved for summary judgment, each party submitted its own statement of material facts as to which that party contends there is no genuine dispute. In this case, both parties have complied with the order and local rule. Accordingly, the facts recited here are derived from the parties' lists of material facts and their respective responses.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \u2022 Plaintiff Express Homebuyers (EHB) is a limited liability company organized under Virginia law with its principal place of business in Springfield, VA.

For example, Gordon stated that he acquired the Marks\n   so others could not prevent him and his companies from using the \"we buy houses\" phrase to describe their services. Gordon Dep. 136-40.

Gordon Dep. at 218-19. In other words, the prior owners of the Marks used \"we buy houses\" to refer to the real estate purchasing services that they and their licensees provided.

Chandler testified that he uses the phrase \"we buy houses\" to refer to the home-buying services that EHB provides-that is, to \"tell the consumer what it is that [EHB] do[es].\" EHB Dep. 227:3-4. And there is also significant evidence that the \"we buy houses\" label identifies \"real estate investors who buy houses\" as a category of a type of service-provider and not to identify any particular provider as a source of those services.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 201:1-8.

The overwhelming and unrefuted evidence in this case shows that there is no genuine dispute of material fact as to the determination that the Marks at issue are generic, and accordingly, summary judgment cancelling the marks is appropriate. This result is logical; when asked what services they provide, EHB, WBH, and other competitors would naturally answer \"we buy houses.\" And allowing one member of the industry to trademark the phrase \"we buy houses\" would be the equivalent of allowing a professional football team to trademark \"we play football\" or a fast-food chain to trademark \"we sell burgers.\" Those phrases are not distinctive identifiers of a source of goods or services. They\n   merely describe the kind of services or goods provided by a business, and accordingly those phrases cannot be trademarked. The same is true of \"we buy houses.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Seeking to avoid this conclusion, WBH argues that even if the phrase \"we buy houses\" is generic, defendants are not using the phrase generically with respect to their business, which Brandt describes as \"provid[ing] educational and instructional materials to home buyers and sellers.\" Brandt Decl. \u00b6 13. In essence, defendants argue that the fact that they connect their network of real estate investors to sellers to purchase homes and do not themselves buy homes transforms the use of \"We Buy Houses\" from generic to descriptive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Fourth Circuit considered and rejected a similar argument in\n   <em>\n    Retail Services.\n   </em>\n   There, the defendants contended that their use of the term \"freebies\" was descriptive because they provided \"information about no-cost or low cost promotional offers\" as opposed to the generic use of the term which connoted the giving away of products for free.\n   <em>\n    Retail Servs.\n   </em>\n   , at 547.
