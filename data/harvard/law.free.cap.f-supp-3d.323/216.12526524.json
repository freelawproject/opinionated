Pending before the court is defendant 27 Bridge Street, LLC's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. Given the instant motion's striking similarity to several analogs that recently foundered before other courts in this district, I have difficulty discerning its good faith basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marradi v.

He uses a wheelchair for mobility, and is substantially limited in performing one or more major life activities, including walking, standing, grabbing, grasping and pinching. Defendant Karoska Landing, Inc., operates a franchised 7-Eleven convenience store located at 29 Bridge Street in Dedham, Massachusetts (\"Facility\"). Defendant 27 Bridge Street, LLC owns the building that leases space to the Facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff was unable to patronize the Facility because physical barriers prevented him from obtaining access in his wheelchair. Visiting both for personal reasons and as a \"tester\" for the purpose of discovering and documenting noncompliance with the ADA, plaintiff identified at least ten violations. Although he \"intends to visit the Facility again in the near future,\" Compl. \u00b6 15, he expects such efforts will be frustrated unless and until defendants remove the alleged physical barriers and dangerous conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In October 2017, plaintiff filed a complaint alleging violations of Title III of the ADA. In January 2018, defendant 27 Bridge Street, LLC filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant contends that plaintiff's claim is not justiciable because he has not established the \"injury in fact\" necessary to establish standing. A plaintiff invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing standing by showing an injury in fact, causation, and redressability.\n   <em>\n    Lujan v.
