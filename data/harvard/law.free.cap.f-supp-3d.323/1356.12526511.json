DALTON JR., United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before the Court is Plaintiffs' Motion to Strike Expert Report and to Exclude Testimony and Opinions of Barbara K. Mueller. (Doc. 311 (\"\n   <strong>\n    Motion\n   </strong>\n   \").) Defendant opposes. (Doc. 314.) On review, the Motion is due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case asks whether Defendant properly classified analysts processing disability claims as administratively exempt from overtime wages under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"\n   <strong>\n    FLSA\n   </strong>\n   \"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 1, 11, 202.) To that end, the Court has conditionally certified a national class of \"Analysts\" who claim that Defendant willfully misclassified them as exempt and failed to pay them overtime compensation to which they were entitled. (Doc. 163.) Defendant disputes any wrongdoing, claiming that the \"Analysts\" met the administrative exemption because their primary duty included the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance. (Docs. 170, p. 2; 203, p. 2.) To bolster its defense, Defendant proffers the expert report, testimony, and opinion of Barbara K. Mueller on the duties and requirements of Long-term Disability Analysts (\"\n   <strong>\n    LTD Analysts\n   </strong>\n   \") and what it takes to process disability claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 311-1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 314.) Plaintiffs argue Ms. Mueller's report, opinion, and testimony is inadmissible under Federal Rules of Evidence 702 and 403, arguing: (1) it constitutes an improper legal conclusion and goes to ultimate issues of fact; (2) it will not assist the factfinder; and (3) any probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 311, pp. 2-8.) Briefing complete, the matter is ripe. (Docs. 311, 314.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In its gatekeeping role, a district court is tasked to ensure that juries only hear \"expert\" opinions that satisfy the following requirements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Qualifications\n   </strong>\n   -a witness that is \"qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education\" may testify as to his opinions of scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge ( Fed.

R. Evid. 702, Advisory Committee Notes). If the proponent does so, then the court should open the gate by permitting the proponent to elicit testimony from the expert witness concerning his or her reliable opinions and by allowing the jury to fulfill its role of determining the weight to accord such testimony. Indeed, the Court's limited gatekeeping role \"is not intended to supplant\" presentation of contrary evidence to the jury or the practice of cross-examination in a courtroom.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Power Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703028\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/1278/#p1282\">\n    730 F.3d 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1282-85 (11th Cir. 2013). Accordingly, once the proponent satisfies the minimum threshold for admissibility, the parties' remaining reliability and relevance disputes must be decided by the jury-preferably based on the litigants': (1) presentation of contrary evidence, such as testimony from the litigant's own expert witness providing both contrary opinions and criticism of-among other things-the opposing expert's qualifications and the inaccuracy or unreliability of his or her opinions; and (2) use of cross-examination and appropriate legal argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703028\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/1278/#p1282\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Costa v.

Mar. 29, 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   From Plaintiffs' Motion, neither the Qualification Requirement nor the Reliability Requirement are at issue. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 311.) Instead, the Motion focuses on the Helpfulness Requirement: that Ms. Mueller will not assist the jury because an LTD Analyst's job duties are easily understandable. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 311, pp. 3-8.) Furthermore, the Motion argues that Ms. Mueller's expert report offers a legal conclusion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201069189\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) On review, the Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   First, although undisputed, the Court finds both the Qualification Requirement and Reliability Requirement met for Ms. Mueller. As explained in her Report, Ms. Mueller has vast experience in the disability insurance industry that includes managing disability insurance claims. (Doc. 311-1, pp. 4, 11-13.) To reach an opinion here, she reviewed internal company documents, deposition transcripts from the named plaintiffs, and additional filings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) From this review, combined with her education, training, and experience, she formed the opinion that the Analysts here are like other LTD Analysts, \"responsible for exercising discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of great significance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) With this, the Court finds Defendant has carried its burden to show Ms. Mueller is qualified and employed sound methodology to reach her opinion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Benavides v. City of Austin\n   </em>\n   , No. A-11-CV-438-LY, 2012 12883179, at *4 (W.D. Tex. July 2, 2012) (finding expert testimony admissible in FLSA exemption case where methodology involved reviewing the plaintiffs' depositions and employer's documents). Thus, the Court turns to Plaintiffs' arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that Ms. Mueller's opinion constitutes an improper legal conclusion since determining whether the Analysts met FLSA's administrative exemption involves evaluating how much discretion and independent judgment they exercised for matters of significance. (Doc. 311, p. 4.) Indeed, proposed expert testimony that offers a legal conclusion is inadmissible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10541143\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/898/1537/#p1541\">\n    898 F.2d 1537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1541 (11th Cir. 1990). But the legal question here is whether Plaintiffs met FLSA's administrative exemption.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Benavides\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%2012883179\">\n    2012 WL 12883179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. \"This determination requires the fact-finder to evaluate the nature and terms of Plaintiff[s'] employment, draw inferences from\n   these facts, and apply the regulations and interpretations promulgated under section 213(a)(1).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%2012883179\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As such, the underlying factors-including how much independent judgment and discretion was exercised-are factual issues for the factfinder, not the ultimate legal conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *2-3. Were Ms. Mueller to go beyond her explanation of LTD Analysts job duties to state an opinion on whether Plaintiffs were properly categorized as exempt, that would be an impermissible legal conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. As it stands, however, the scope of Ms. Mueller's proposed testimony is perfectly admissible.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. All Am. Check Cashing, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:13-CV-270-WHB-RHW,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2011120670\">\n    2015 WL 11120670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-3 (S.D. Miss. Mar. 12, 2015) (granting in part motion to strike expert testimony that the plaintiff met FLSA's administrative exemption but allowing expert to testify on issues that did not bear on the legal question of the administrative exemption). Hence, the Court rejects Plaintiffs' first argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs seek exclusion of Ms. Mueller's testimony and report on the grounds that the issues involved here do not require specialized knowledge and are well within the province of the jury, such that having an expert testify would be unhelpful and prejudicial. (Doc. 311, pp. 5-8.) The Court disagrees. This case envisages a searching inquiry into the world of processing disability insurance claims-an industry unfamiliar to the average layperson. Not only must the factfinder learn about this industry, it must also understand the ins and outs of how processing these claims works. To top it off, the factfinder must then decide what level of discretion and independent judgment, if any, such processing requires. Such concepts are unfamiliar to most who haven't interacted with the world of disability insurance, yet understanding them is crucial to this case. Having someone like Ms. Mueller, who is intimately familiar with this business, to break down the industry, the role of LTD Analysts, and their job duties would undoubtedly benefit the factfinder navigate this case. What is more, the global perspective and overview Ms. Mueller seeks to provide is not available through testimony from Plaintiffs or Defendant's employees alone. Thus, the Court finds that Ms. Mueller's opinion and testimony will assist the factfinder in evaluating the facts, making the necessary inferences from those facts, and applying the regulations at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Benavides\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%2012883179\">\n    2012 WL 12883179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 311, pp. 7-8.) Any lingering gripes about Ms. Mueller's position may be addressed on cross-examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Accordingly, it is\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED AND ADJUDGED\n   </strong>\n   that Plaintiffs' Motion to Strike Expert Report and to Exclude Testimony and Opinions of Barbara K.
