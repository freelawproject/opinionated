Lawrence, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, DC, for Navy Chaplaincy\n </attorneys>\n <p id=\"p-6\">\n  <em>\n   <strong>\n    MEMORANDUM OPINION\n   </strong>\n  </em>\n </p>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   JOHN D. BATES, United States District Judge\n   More than a decade ago, these consolidated cases were brought by a group of Protestant U.S. Navy chaplains who allege that the Navy has discriminated against them in various ways because of their faith. Though plaintiffs' consolidated complaint runs over one hundred pages and asserts eighteen separate counts, prior rulings in this case have whittled their claims down to nine, six of which are currently before the Court on cross-motions for summary judgment. Each of these claims relates to the so-called \"selection boards\" that the Navy uses to select chaplains (and all other commissioned officers) for promotion and, in some cases, for involuntary retirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Plaintiffs' primary claim is that, until 2002, the Navy maintained an unconstitutional policy of placing at least one Roman Catholic chaplain on every selection board, which resulted in Catholic chaplains being promoted at a disproportionately high rate compared to other religious groups. Plaintiffs also challenge a host of other allegedly unconstitutional selection-board policies and procedures-some of which, plaintiffs claim, continue to this day. Finally, plaintiffs challenge a statute that privileges selection-board deliberations from disclosure in litigation, arguing that it is unconstitutional as applied to their case because it denies them access to information that they need to prove their constitutional claims. To redress these wrongs, plaintiffs-each of whom was either passed over for promotion or selected for early retirement by a board that was allegedly tainted by one or more of the challenged procedures-seek an order directing the Navy to reinstate them to active duty, if necessary, and to convene new, properly constituted selection boards to reconsider the personnel actions taken against them. Alternatively, plaintiffs ask the Court to permit them to take further discovery to prove their claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   To a considerable extent, the result in this case is dictated by prior rulings of both the D.C. Circuit and this Court. The legal standards applicable to plaintiffs' challenges to the selection-board policies and procedures were laid out several years ago by the D.C. Circuit in this very litigation. Consequently, there is little left to do here but to apply those standards to the evidence adduced by the parties on summary judgment-which, as explained below, does not even come close to showing the degree of discrimination required for plaintiffs' challenges to succeed. Likewise, this Court has already twice considered and twice rejected plaintiffs' constitutional challenge to the statutory privilege for selection-board proceedings, and plaintiffs offer no persuasive reason to reach a different conclusion this time around. Plaintiffs' motions for summary judgment as to these claims will therefore be denied, and the Navy's will be granted. Finally, because plaintiffs have had ample opportunity to conduct discovery previously in this litigation, and because they would be unlikely to prevail on their claims even if they were permitted to take further discovery, plaintiffs' requests for additional discovery will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

SECNAVINST 1401.3, Encl. 1 \u00b6 1(c)(1). The Navy would then seek to fill the remaining seats, to the extent practicable, with \"a mix of qualified and available chaplains from the different Faith Group Categories.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Captain Stephen B. Rock (\"Rock Decl.\") [ECF No. 281-2] \u00b6 8.

At the time, a federal statute provided that, \"[e]xcept as authorized or required by this section, proceedings of a selection board convened under [ 10 U.S.C. \u00a7] 611(a)\"-that is, selection boards for promotions but not for early retirement-\"may not be disclosed to any person not a member of the board.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20618\">\n    10 U.S.C. \u00a7 618\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). Nevertheless, Judge Urbina granted the plaintiffs' motion, concluding that \u00a7 618(f) did not apply in litigation because it \"does not contain specific language barring discovery\" and \"because of the circuit's emphasis on providing litigants full access to relevant information.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v.

The D.C. Circuit also rejected plaintiffs' reliance on the Supreme Court's statement in\n   <em>\n    Webster v.

Hence, the court concluded, \u00a7 618(f)\"applies to block civil discovery of\n   <em>\n    promotion\n   </em>\n   selection board proceedings in civil litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1181 (emphasis added). But because the statutory language referred only to \" section 611\n   <em>\n    (a)\n   </em>\n   \" of Title 10, which governs the convening of promotion boards, while the convening of selective early retirement boards is governed by \u00a7 611\n   <em>\n    (b)\n   </em>\n   of that title, the D.C. Circuit remanded for the district court to consider in the first instance whether \u00a7 618(f) applied to the proceedings of selective early retirement boards.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1181-82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On remand, plaintiffs argued not only that \u00a7 618(f) was inapplicable to selective early retirement boards, as the D.C.

The Navy's Board-Staffing Policies Were Facially Neutral.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The parties do not dispute that until late 2002, the Navy staffed chaplain selection boards with one or two (or at most three) non-chaplain officers and filled the remaining seats with chaplains.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Decl. of Killian Kagle (\"Kagle Decl.\") [ECF No. 47-9] at 35-46 (listing the denominational affiliation and faith group category of every member of every promotion selection board convened between 1988 and 2002 and every selective early retirement board convened between 1991 and 2002); SECNAVINST 1401.3, Encl. 1 \u00b6 1(c)(1) (providing that \"[a]t least one member shall be a [non-chaplain] officer\" and that \"[t]he remaining members should be [chaplains]\"). The record is also clear that every promotion board convened between 1988 and 2002 had between four and seven chaplains and that, with one exception, at least one of those chaplains was Catholic.\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Kagle Decl. at 35-46. Plaintiffs contend that this fact alone demonstrates that the Navy had a \"policy\" of placing at least one Catholic chaplain on every board, and that this policy triggers strict scrutiny because it was facially discriminatory.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    The Navy's evidence tells a different story. According to the Navy, during the relevant time period, chaplain selection boards were staffed with chaplains from a \"mix\" of faith group categories-including Catholics-as part of a larger effort to ensure selection-board diversity.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Rock Decl. \u00b6 5-8 (testimony of former Navy personnel officer that selection boards \"represented, to the extent possible, the different experiences of the many chaplains within the Chaplain Corps,\" including \"east-coast chaplains, west-coast chaplains, Navy chaplains, Marine Corps chaplains, Coast Guard chaplains, and chaplains from each faith-group category\"). Thus, of the 202 chaplains staffed on the forty-two chaplain\n    promotion boards convened between 1988 and 2002, sixty-six were liturgical Protestants, sixty-nine were non-liturgical Protestants, forty-eight were Catholic, eighteen fell in the Special Worship faith group category, and one was unknown.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Kagle Decl. at 35-44. Similarly, of the twenty-seven chaplains staffed on the twelve selective early retirement boards convened between 1991 and 1998, ten were liturgical Protestants, ten were non-liturgical Protestants, four were Catholic, and two were Special Worship.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 45-46. Among the four faith groups, then, the Navy's policies hardly resulted in outsized representation for Catholics.\n    <footnotemark>\n     18\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    The Navy also points to its own regulations, which represent the only written evidence of its board-staffing policies during the relevant time period. Far from directing selection boards (or those responsible for convening them) to discriminate against non-liturgical Protestants, those regulations expressly prohibited discrimination on the basis of religion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    SECNAVINST 1401.3 \u00b6 4(a) (\"Exclusion from board membership by reason of gender, race, ethnic origin, or religious affiliation is prohibited.\"); SECNAVINST 1401.3, Encl. 1 \u00b6 (1)(c)(1)(e) (stating that members of chaplain selection boards \"shall be nominated without regard to religious affiliation\"). Moreover, a federal statute requires selection board members to swear an oath to act \"without prejudice or partiality and having in view both the special fitness of officers and the efficiency of [the Navy].\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20613\">\n     10 U.S.C. \u00a7 613\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

At most, the presence of one Catholic on each selection board suggests that the Navy's facially neutral board-staffing policies may have resulted in disproportionate representation among denominations.

For example, the motion asks the Court to consider evidence that purportedly shows a \"culture\" within the Navy of discouraging servicemembers from reporting misconduct by their superiors-evidence that includes, among other things, statements made to counsel during a medical appointment with his personal doctor, an Army physician who never responded to counsel's request for a formal declaration.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 4-6. The motion also asks the Court to consider the fact that Rear Admiral Brent Scott, who will be the first member of a certain non-liturgical Protestant denomination to assume the position of Chief of Chaplains, will also be the first Chief of Chaplains not to be promoted to the two-star rank of Rear Admiral (upper half).\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 6-7. This evidence is even further afield from the selection-board policies that plaintiffs challenge here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    In sum, plaintiffs' July 2018 discovery motion relies on evidence whose relevance to this case is tangential at best and that, for the most part, could have been presented much earlier in the litigation.
