From a more earthly vantage, it involves the clash between a criminal defendant's interest in being free on the one hand from undue oppression by the State, and on the other, the Sovereign's interest in pursuing just punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   To begin: Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 23(b)(2) permits a criminal jury trial to continue to a verdict with fewer than twelve jurors only with consent of all parties (and the court's approval), while the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, among its other limitations on the power of the State, provides that \"nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life of limb.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As will be explained, despite the simplicity of its wording, the Double\n   Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment has many facets. It protects a defendant not only from being subjected to multiple trials and multiple punishments for the same offense; it also preserves a defendant's \"valued right to have the trial concluded by a particular tribunal,\"\n   <em>\n    Arizona v.

Over the weekend preceding what was expected to be the last day of evidence in a multi-week trial involving four alleged co-conspirators in a scheme to deprive a stock proxy tabulation firm of the honest services of one of its employees, the twelfth remaining juror was excused after his wife was stricken with a grave medical emergency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The government initially agreed to go forward with eleven jurors, but then added the condition that it would only agree if all four co-defendants also agreed. Three of the co-defendants did so, but one declined. After much back-and-forth over the weekend, the government and the fourth co-defendant refused to relent (positions iterated on Monday morning), leaving the court with no practicable option under the plain text of Rule 23 but to declare a mistrial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   And so the question under the peculiar facts of this case is this: Does the Double Jeopardy Clause bar the government from retrying the three defendants -- Charles Garske, Richard Gottcent, and Michael Sedlak -- who sought to proceed to a verdict validated by eleven jurors? While the answer is a difficult one, the court concludes that it does, for reasons that will be explained, necessarily at some length.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   FACTS AND OVERVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This case arose out of an investigation involving an alleged bribery scheme affecting the proxy solicitation industry. Defendants were employees of Georgeson, Inc., a firm that specializes in advising clients on positions that institutional investors are likely to take in voting their proxies on the governance proposals offered by corporate management and shareholders. To enhance the quality of their predictions to their clients, defendants are alleged to have corrupted an insider at Institutional Shareholder Services, Inc. (ISS), a proxy advisory firm, by plying him with meals and tickets to sporting events and concerts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The object was to gain access to the proxy voting advice that ISS was giving to its institutional clients. The indictment was handed up on July 11, 2016. The court ruled on various pretrial motions, including, most notably for present purposes, two unsuccessful attempts by defendant Donna Ackerly to sever her trial from that of her three co-defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt # 235 (Nov. 14, 2017), Dkt # 331 (Feb. 21, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial began on February 26, 2018, with fourteen jurors impaneled. As previously noted, on March 1, 2018, the remaining alternate juror was excused for cause. In granting the excusal, the court, in an\n   exercise of misplaced optimism, observed that \"under the ... rules, 11 is sufficient for a jury, 10 if everyone consents to it. So I think we'll be okay.\" Tr. Mar. 1, 2018, 163:8-10. Despite four interruptions caused by snow emergencies, the trial progressed to what proved to be its penultimate day on Friday, March 16, 2018. At a conference held after the jury had been excused for the weekend, defendants' counsel informed the court that they did not intend to call any witnesses, meaning that the case would go to the jury the coming Monday or Tuesday.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The precipitating event leading to the mistrial came on the evening of Friday, March 16, 2018. Juror No. 12\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   contacted the Chief Law Clerk to report that his wife had just been diagnosed with a brain tumor and required immediate surgery. The juror, who was in a state of shock and understandable anguish, stated that he had an urgent need to attend to his wife and children and was unable to continue his jury service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The next morning, Saturday, March 17, I instructed the Chief Clerk to email the parties and inform them of the turn of events. I also asked her to relay my observation that Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 23(b)(2)(B)\"allows a reduction to 11 jurors with the written consent of the parties and the judge,\" and to advise the parties that I was \"prepared to make the necessary finding of good cause and [that I] look[ed] to the parties to agree.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt # 416-2. At 10:32 a.m. she did so. Counsel for defendant Gottcent replied at 10:38 a.m. stating that his client was prepared to go forward with eleven jurors. Dkt # 416-3. The government replied at 12:18 p.m. stating that it consented to \"proceed with 11\" jurors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt # 416-5. At 2:44 p.m., counsel for defendant Sedlak agreed to proceed with eleven jurors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt # 416-6. The government then sent an email at 2:52 p.m. to all parties \"clarifying\" its original assent and announcing that \"the government's consent is conditioned on all four defendants consenting.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt # 416-7. Counsel for Garske forwarded her client's consent at 3:06 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The bump in the road was felt at 4:15 p.m., when counsel for Ackerly wrote to all parties stating that his client was \"not comfortable consenting to go with only 11 jurors.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt # 416-9. The email referenced Ackerly's previous attempts to have her case severed from her three co-defendants, arguing that the government's remaining witnesses would \"not offer any evidence against her,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189962\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/456/667/#p672\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , and that the evidentiary record was complete with respect to her planned motions for a directed verdict, or alternatively, to exclude certain of the out-of-court statements of her alleged co-conspirators pursuant to\n   <em>\n    United States v. Petrozziello\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"993348\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/548/20/\">\n    548 F.2d 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Cir. 1977). She requested a hearing on these motions the following Monday morning. The government responded thirteenminutes later, objecting to the assertion that the record as it pertained to Ackerly was complete and stating that it was \"puzzled by [Ackerly's] reference to severance. Certainly it would be terribly inappropriate to use this circumstance in an attempt to achieve that result.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt # 416-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The court denied Ackerly's request to be heard on the directed verdict and\n   <em>\n    Petrozziello\n   </em>\n   motions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt # 416-11, and then explained to the parties that, in light of \"the government's second email [from 2:52 p.m.,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt # 416-7] that they only consent if all four defendants consent ... the court feels it has no other choice than to declare a mistrial on Monday morning.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt # 416-12. The following day, Sunday, March 18, 2018 at 12:36 p.m., counsel for Ackerly wrote in an email (purportedly on behalf of all four defendants) that \"the\n   Government's change in position that it will refuse to proceed with the trial against the three defendants if Ackerly exercises her right to a jury of 12, will create a double jeopardy problem that would prevent the retrial of the other three defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt # 416-13. In that email, Ackerly again requested a severance and proposed that the \"three other defendants and the government should be ready to proceed with trial at 9 am tomorrow [Monday].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"993348\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/548/20/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Counsel for Garske replied to the email, stating that Ackerly \"does not speak for defendants Garske, Gottcent and Sedlak,\" and emphasizing that these three defendants \"have consented to a jury of eleven ... and their decisions were made without regard to [Ackerly's] possible course of action.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt # 416-14. The court responded that it understood the parties' respective positions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt # 416-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Court convened Monday morning, March 19, 2018, without the jury present. The Chief Law Clerk summarized her conversations with Juror No. 12. I then explained to the parties that \"consistent with [Fed. R. Crim. P.] Rule 26.3,\" I had considered other possibilities than a mistrial, but the \"only alternative I can think of is to just indefinitely postpone the trial and try to resume at some point in the future.\" Tr. Mar. 19, 2018, at 6:1-3. However, I further explained that because there was no way of knowing when Juror 12's wife's \"operation will take place, or even what its outcome will be, and the likelihood, it being brain surgery, of extended convalescence,\" I did not believe that the court was in a position to \"keep tabs on the remaining ten jurors and everyone else in a fashion that would actually allow the trial to be concluded in an orderly fashion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:6-12. As I deemed Rule 23 to be \"as clear as a rule could be\" in requiring the consent of all parties to go forward with less than twelve jurors, and since the government and Ackerly remained at loggerheads, there was \"no power that I see, or discretion that I have, under the rule to force a different result.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:15, 19-21. I invited the parties to suggest other ideas, but none were forthcoming. Counsel for the three defendants who were willing to proceed -- Gottcent, Garske and Sedlak -- iterated their desire to proceed with eleven jurors, while stating on the record that they would be raising a double jeopardy bar in the event of a retrial. Hands tied, I declared a mistrial and discharged the jury.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    The prohibition against double jeopardy is recognized as a \"universal maxim of the common law.\" 4 William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England *335 (Claitor's ed., Baton Rouge, LA 1976).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    The trial had begun with fourteen jurors.

Jury Size\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    The jury of twelve is a vestige of English common law that carried over into the colonial and later the American legal system more as a matter of tradition and habit than of\n    <em>\n     opinio juris sive necessitatis\n    </em>\n    . The Sixth Amendment, while guaranteeing the common-law jury trial right, is silent on the question of how many persons need be present to constitute a constitutionally acceptable jury. The Supreme Court in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries articulated the view that the jury of twelve, perhaps by adverse possession, had found its way into the United States Constitution.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Patton v.

Florida\n    </em>\n    , in which the Supreme Court concluded that \"the fact that the jury at common law was composed of precisely 12 is a historical accident, unnecessary to effect the purposes of the jury system and wholly without significance 'except to mystics.' \"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168686\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/78/#p102\">\n     399 U.S. 78\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 102,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168686\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/78/#p102\">\n     90 S.Ct. 1893\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168686\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/78/#p102\">\n     26 L.Ed.2d 446\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1970) (quoting\n    <em>\n     Duncan v.

The Court found that while the jury should be \"large enough to promote group deliberation, free from outside attempts at intimidation, and to provide a fair possibility for obtaining a representative cross-section of the community,\" there was \"little reason to think\" that the grand purpose of committing decisions of life, liberty, and property to the verdict of the community, was \"in any meaningful sense less likely to be achieved when the jury numbers six, than when it numbers 12 - particularly if the requirement of unanimity is retained.\"\n    <em>\n     Williams\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168686\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/78/#p102\">\n     399 U.S. at 100\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168686\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/78/#p102\">\n     90 S.Ct. 1893\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . \"To read the Sixth Amendment as forever codifying a feature [12 jurors] so incidental to the real purpose of the Amendment,\" the Court concluded, \"is to ascribe a blind formalism to the Framers which would require considerably more evidence than we have been able to discover in the history and language of the Constitution or in the reasoning of our past decisions.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168686\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/78/#p102\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168686\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/78/#p102\">\n     at 102-103\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168686\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/78/#p102\">\n     90 S.Ct. 1893\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    <em>\n     B. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 23\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    Notwithstanding the lack of any mooring in the Constitution, the jury of twelve is enshrined in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure as the presumptive minimum.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Crim. P. 23(b)(1) (\"A jury consists of 12 persons unless this rule provides otherwise.\"). The Rule further provides that \"[a]t any time before the verdict, the parties may, with the court's approval, stipulate in writing that: (A) the jury may consist of fewer than 12 persons; or (B) a jury of fewer than 12 persons may return a verdict if the court finds it necessary to excuse a juror for good cause after the trial begins.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 23(b)(2). The plain text of the Rule establishes that all parties must consent to a jury of less than twelve in federal criminal trials. There is one exception: where a case has been submitted to the jury for a verdict, the \"court may permit a jury of 11 persons to return a verdict, even without a stipulation by the parties, if the court finds good cause to excuse a juror.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 23(b)(3). However, the Rules do not permit a trial judge to force a non-consenting party to proceed with a jury of less than twelve prior to the commencement of deliberations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    The government, in other words, under the plain text of the Rule, was within its rights to refuse consent to proceed to a verdict with only eleven jurors. The moving defendants argue, however, that by conditioning its consent on the reciprocal consent of all four co-defendants, and then by refusing to proceed to verdict with a jury of eleven against the three consenting defendants, the government in effect \"caused the mistral.\" Defs.' Mem., Dkt # 417 at 12. In support of that argument, defendants rely on\n    <em>\n     United States v. The Larouche Campaign\n    </em>\n    , a First Circuit case written by then-Judge Breyer, in which the court held that the defendants' refusal to go forward with a jury of ten \"differ[ed] in no significant way from a case in which a defendant says the words 'I want a mistrial,' and we must treat it similarly.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10528876\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/866/512/#p514\">\n     866 F.2d 512\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 514 (1st Cir. 1989). There is, however, a significant factual dissimilarity between that case and this one: in\n    <em>\n     Larouche,\n    </em>\n    the defendants had affirmatively requested the excusal of five jurors on hardship grounds and then, once the request was granted by the trial judge, reneged by refusing to proceed with the ten jurors that remained.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Here, by contrast, the juror's excusal was caused by a\n    <em>\n     force majeure\n    </em>\n    beyond the control of the parties and the court.

And it is here that the rule comes up against the right. Were the issue to turn solely on the operation of Rule 23, it would be difficult to imagine a necessity more manifest: the Rule plainly dictates that in circumstances like these, a trial cannot proceed with less than twelve jurors without the consent of\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    parties, and that includes the government.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    But the issue is more complex than a strictly rule-based analysis would suggest. While the Rule may excuse the trial judge for declaring a mistrial (at least where there is no practical or feasible alternative), the doctrine also implicates the decision-making of the government.\n    <em>\n     Arizona v. Washington\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185127\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/497/#p505\">\n     434 U.S. 497\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185127\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/497/#p505\">\n     98 S.Ct. 824\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185127\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/497/#p505\">\n     54 L.Ed.2d 717\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1978), is instructive. In\n    <em>\n     Washington\n    </em>\n    , the trial judge granted the government's motion for a mistrial based on an improper and prejudicial opening statement by defense counsel. The Supreme Court found no abuse of discretion on the trial judge's part, as his was the superior position from which to determine \"the likelihood that the impartiality of one or more jurors may have been affected by\n    the improper comment.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185127\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/497/#p505\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185127\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/497/#p505\">\n     at 511\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185127\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/497/#p505\">\n     98 S.Ct. 824\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Court did not, however, stop there. \"In view of the importance\" of the double jeopardy rights of the accused, the Court continued, \"and the fact that it is frustrated by any mistrial, the prosecutor must shoulder the burden of justifying the mistrial if he is to avoid the double jeopardy bar. His burden is a heavy one. The prosecutor must demonstrate 'manifest necessity' for any mistrial declared over the objection of the defendant.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185127\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/497/#p505\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185127\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/497/#p505\">\n     at 505\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185127\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/497/#p505\">\n     98 S.Ct. 824\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In other words, because the double jeopardy right belongs to a criminal defendant, where the prosecutor plays a prominent role in bringing about the necessity of a mistrial, the \"manifest necessity\" standard applies to the government's decision-making with the same force as it does to the actions taken by the trial judge.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    So the issue boils down to this. Can the government, in the circumstances of this case, point to a \"manifest necessity\" for the withholding of its consent to a verdict by a jury of eleven one day before a month-long trial was coming to an end? Phrased differently, is it the case that \"the ends of public justice would otherwise [have been] defeated,\"\n    <em>\n     Perez\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1421261\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/22/579/\">\n     22 U.S. at 588\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , had the government proceeded to a verdict with eleven jurors as the three consenting defendants (and the court) desired?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    In balancing the interests at stake, two factors seem to me to have particular importance. The first is a temporal consideration: a mistrial declared on the first day of a jury trial is a far less onerous imposition on the rights of a defendant than a mistrial declared after a defendant has endured the ordeal of a multi-week trial. In\n    <em>\n     Gori\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Somerville\n    </em>\n    , for example, in contrast to this case, the mistrial decision came on the very first day of trial. To the extent that \"the defendant has a significant interest in the decision whether or not to take the case from the jury when circumstances occur which might be thought to warrant a declaration of mistrial,\"\n    <em>\n     Jorn\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12047837\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/470/\">\n     400 U.S. at 485\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12047837\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/470/\">\n     91 S.Ct. 547\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , this interest would seem weightiest after a defendant has undergone the full gauntlet of a criminal trial, and after he has likely shown his hand to the prosecution.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    A second consideration, although not dispositive, is whether the government stands to gain (or extract) some \"benefit\" from the declaration of a mistrial.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v. Glover\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"124100\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/506/291/#p297\">\n     506 F.2d 291\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 297 (2d Cir. 1974) (\"[W]here the mistrial is not motivated for the benefit of the defendant, and the defendant has done nothing himself to create the problem, he is entitled to his double jeopardy protection.\").\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Gori\n    </em>\n    , 367 U.S. at 366,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1785585\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/367/364/\">\n     81 S.Ct. 1523\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Suffice that we are unwilling, where it clearly appears that a mistrial has been granted in the sole interest of the defendant, to hold that its necessary consequence is to bar all retrial.\");\n    <em>\n     cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Jorn\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12047837\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/470/\">\n     400 U.S. at 483\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12047837\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/470/\">\n     91 S.Ct. 547\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (extending\n    <em>\n     Gori\n    </em>\n    and concluding that \"a limitation on the abuse-of-discretion principle based on an appellate court's assessment of which side benefited from the mistrial ruling does not adequately satisfy the policies underpinning the double jeopardy provision.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    From all appearances, the government's decision to withhold consent was influenced by a desire to submit all four defendants to the jury for a verdict, most probably in the belief that a conviction of all four would be made more likely by the jury's collective consideration. It appears also to be the case, as defendants speculate and the government more or less concedes, that it was determined to prevent Ackerly from succeeding in her quest for a severance of her case from the others. Whatever the explanation, it is clear that the three consenting defendants stood to gain nothing from a mistrial, while the\n    government accomplished at least one, and possibly two, of its objectives.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    It is true, as the government insists, that a defendant's \"valued right\" to have his trial completed by the first impaneled tribunal, \"must in some instances be subordinated to the public's interest in fair trials designed to end in just judgments.\"\n    <em>\n     Hunter\n    </em>\n    , 336 U.S. at 689,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3939222\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/336/684/\">\n     69 S.Ct. 834\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Washington\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185127\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/497/#p505\">\n     434 U.S. at 506\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185127\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/497/#p505\">\n     98 S.Ct. 824\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (A defendant's double jeopardy rights are \"sometimes subordinate to the public interest in affording the prosecutor one full and fair opportunity to present his evidence to an impartial jury.\"). But while the principle is sound, the government fails to demonstrate how the public's interest in just punishment would have been threatened had the government agreed to proceed to a verdict against Garske, Gottcent, and Sedlak, and then retried a shorter and simpler case against Ackerly, rather than undertaking another month-long trial against all four defendants.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Here, in withholding consent, the government assumed the risk that the consenting defendants' double jeopardy claim would have merit, as I find it does.
