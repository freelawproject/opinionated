COOKE, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In 1990, Congress passed the Americans with Disability Act to protect people with disabilities from discrimination in places of public accommodation. Since then, a bevy of administrative orders and court decisions have helped businesses understand how to apply the ADA to their brick-and-mortar stores. But as more and more people take their shopping online, regulations have fallen further and further behind. Unsurprisingly, this imbalance results in businesses and their disabled customers disagreeing over what the ADA requires. This case is an example of that. More specifically, this case is about whether and to what extent the ADA applies to websites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Currently pending before the Court are Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 18) and Plaintiff's Motion to Exclude the Testimony and Opinions of Paul Dolegowski (ECF No. 57). For the reasons stated below, Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Plaintiff's Motion to Exclude are both\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n    <em>\n     in part\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Andres Gomez is legally blind. Compl. \u00b6 1, ECF No. 1. To access the internet, Gomez uses a screen reading software program called Job Access With Speech or JAWS. Compl. \u00b6 24. Screen readers work best when websites are designed to be compatible with them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the summer of 2017, Gomez visited the website of Defendant General Nutrition Company (\"GNC\"), a place of public accommodation. Pl. Stat. of Mat. Facts \u00b6 4, ECF No. 19. The Website allows customers to purchase GNC's goods and services and view any promotions and deals offered at that time. Gomez Dep. 68:16-19. Additionally, the Website provides a store locator. Compl. \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When Gomez visited the Website, however, he could not access many of its features. Compl. \u00b6 2. Gomez could not add items to his online shopping cart, access the store locator, or read the deals and promotions. Gomez Dep. 67-69. This difficulty was due, at least in part, to the mislabeling of the online content. McCaffrey Dep. 172:1-8, ECF No. 52-1. Because the website's content was not labeled properly, Gomez's screen reader did not work correctly. Pl.'s Stat. of Mat. Facts \u00b6 10. Though the Website did not include a statement regarding GNC's commitment to ADA compliance, the Website did include a link to the terms of conditions. Def.'s Suppl. Resp. in Opp. to Pl.'s Stat. of Mat. Facts \u00b6 14-17, ECF No. 51. In turn, the terms and conditions provide a phone number for customers to call if they need additional assistance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   GNC regularly updates the Website with the latest deals and promotions. Smith Aff. \u00b6 10, ECF No. 27. Gomez admits he has not been back to the Website since 2017 but representatives from both parties have tested the Website for accessibility as recently as June 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dolegowski Dep., Ex. 2 and 3, ECF No. 52-3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   McCaffrey Dep. 170:7-9.

The Website facilitates the use of the physical stores by providing a store locater. Moreover, the ability to purchase products remotely is, in and of itself, a service of the physical stores. By providing information about promotions and deals in addition to information about store information, the Website operates as a gateway to the physical stores.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In other words, GNC provides a basket of services. One of the services is the ability to use the Website to purchase products, learn about sales, and find nearby stores. The inaccessibility of the website amounts to a denial of that service to blind individuals. And denying service to the blind violates the discrimination provisions of ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     GNC's Website has not Remedied the Violations of the ADA\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The parties offer competing expert testimony on whether the Website still presents barriers to access.

Because he is not at least minimally qualified to opine on web accessibility, Dolegowski does not satisfy the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Dolegowski's opinions cannot pass muster under the reliability prong. Dolegowski bases his opinions not only reliable principles or methods but on \"the input that he's received from people over 20 plus years of just interaction.\" Dolegowski Dep. 10:14-11:25. Dolegowski's network-based \"expertise\" cannot be tested or peer-reviewed, has no known rate of error, and GNC has put forth no evidence that this technique is accepted in the relevant scientific community. For this reason, Dolegowski does not satisfy\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   's second prong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Third, and in despite of the above, the Court acknowledges that testimony on website accessibility would be helpful in deciding this case. However, Dolegowski's lack of experience in web accessibility and the unreliability of his opinions outweighs any potential helpfulness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   And so, Plaintiff's Motion to Exclude Opinions and Testimony of Paul Dolegowski is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n    <em>\n     in part\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and the Court excludes Dolegowski's opinions on website accessibility. To the extent Dolegowski's testimony and opinions are relevant to another issue here, Plaintiff's Motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   and he may testify to those things.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The remaining evidence suggests the Website still violates the ADA.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   With the foregoing in mind, the remaining evidence in the record suggests that the Website is inaccessible. Michael McCaffrey-Gomez's expert-tested the Website and found it had 77 percent and 64 percent compliance on success levels AA and A, respectively. McCaffrey Dep. 170:7-9. What's more, McCaffrey opines that these errors could prevent a user from selecting a product and completing a purchase.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Purchasing a product online is a service that, in part, forms the nexus between the Website and GNC's physical stores. The record shows that accessibility issues prevent Gomez from purchasing products. Because the inaccessibility of the Website prevents Gomez from fully enjoying a service of the physical store, GNC is discriminating against Gomez and violating the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     The Court Cannot Grant Summary Judgment as to remedy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   GNC argues-correctly-that Gomez has provided no support than WCAG 2.0 is an appropriate remedy. Even if WCAG 2.0 is the appropriate standard, the record is silent on which success level is most appropriate. Therefore, the Court cannot grant motion for summary judgment as to remedy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In light of the foregoing, it is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    ADJUDGED\n   </strong>\n   as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   1.
