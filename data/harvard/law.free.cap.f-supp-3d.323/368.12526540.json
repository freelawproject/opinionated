Conclusion...393\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   I. Introduction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Terrorism in support of ideology is not unknown in American history.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , David S. Reynolds,\n   <em>\n    John Brown, Abolitionist\n   </em>\n   11 (Alfred A. Knopf 2005) (\"Whitman sought to provide America with healing and reconciliation through poetic language ... Brown ... resorted to terrorist tactics to disrupt the South's peculiar institution.\"). Nor is the history of export of American volunteer fighters to foreign wars unusual: we need only recall American individuals' aid to civil wars in Greece, Israel, Italy, Spain, Sri Lanka, the Soviets, and Nazi Germany.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The general cruelty of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (\"ISIS\") is as particularly shocking and dangerous as any throughout history; it is denounced by humanity and anathema to the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The question before the court is how can the sentencing of an American citizen, who traveled to Syria to fight for ISIS, and then returned to the United States four months later, be sensitive to the unique nature of the defendant's story, the need to protect the public from any further crimes of the defendant, and the required general deterrence of others who might help ISIS here or abroad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On June 12, 2014, John Doe (\"Doe\" or \"defendant\"), a 29-year-old naturalized American citizen-whose name is withheld so that he can assist American authorities while minimizing risks to self and family-boarded a flight from John F. Kennedy International Airport (\"JFK\") to Turkey. Eventually he made his way into ISIS controlled territory in Syria. Between June and November 2014, he served ISIS in an administrative role. But, he was present in at least one battle, he received military training, he carried firearms, and he was introduced to explosive belts used to blow up civilians.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Despite his expectations of an Islamic utopia, the reality that he encountered was not like what he envisaged. Doe was unprepared for the unrestrained brutality of ISIS. He felt betrayed by the group's false representations of his Muslim faith. In October 2014, while in Syria, defendant sent an email message to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") identifying himself and offering assistance to the United States government. He sought FBI help in returning home to New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Doe escaped from ISIS. He found his way to Turkey and into United States custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendant then began four years of full cooperation with United States law enforcement. At a time when the inner workings of ISIS were not well understood in the United States, he provided valuable detailed information on ISIS's activities. He also helped deter others from joining ISIS and similar terrorist groups.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Doe was charged with providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339B, and receiving military-type training from a foreign terrorist organization, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339D. He pled guilty on November 26, 2014. And he was sentenced on June 28, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendant's good personal history and the dangerous nature of his conduct present the court with a variety of sentencing issues: (1) the need to address the seriousness of his terrorism-related crimes, punishing and specifically deterring him, and generally deterring others; (2) the historical and contemporary context of citizens who travel abroad to aid foreign enemies of this and other countries; and (3) the legal requirements that a court evaluate defendant's individual circumstances, risk of recidivism, potential for rehabilitation, and culpability when crafting a sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Above all, the court must consider how best to protect the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   It should avoid needlessly destroying a defendant, but do what it can to encourage him to live a life within the law.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. C.R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186512\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/792/343/#p511\">\n    792 F.Supp.2d 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 511 (E.D.N.Y. 2011), vacated and remanded sub nom.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Defendant's Childhood and Upbringing\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendant was born in Bangladesh in 1989. Pre-Sentence Report (\"PSR\") \u00b6 36. He and his parents legally immigrated to the United States when he was one year old.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41. As naturalized American citizens, he and his family set their roots in Brooklyn, where he spent his childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood, as part of a middle-class family.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   His father is a retired electrician; his mother remained inside the home.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   By all accounts, defendant had a normal childhood: he engaged in sports, attended public school, and practiced the Muslim faith of his parents, attending religious classes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4. In high school, and initially in college, he underperformed academically because of common teenage distractions: social pressures, family strife, and immaturity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 5, 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   He was particularly affected by the sudden illness of his sister, at the time seven months pregnant, culminating in the death of her and the unborn child.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5. His deceased sister, a successful civil engineer, had been a devoted Muslim who wore a burqa. Hr'g Tr. 10:19-11:18, June 28, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendant has three surviving siblings, two older and one younger. PSR at \u00b6 37. His older brother is married with children and works as a salesman.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   His older sister works as an interior designer and his younger brother is a college student.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They all reside in New York City.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   B. College Experience and Path towards ISIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Doe's response to his sister's death altered the course of his life. He committed himself to academic success with the aim of becoming a good provider for his family; he also devoted himself to his religious faith, embracing a more disciplined social and religious life.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6. He attended community college, earned the respect of his teachers for his academic ability and potential, and transferred to a four-year college.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 6, 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Doe faced increased pressure from a variety of academic and social sources, at a particularly vulnerable and impressionable time in his life.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7. As is typical with many college students, he smoked marijuana and drank alcohol socially.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   He was confronted with representations of his Islamic faith that did not comport with his vision of his own religious identity. One particularly resonant moment for defendant was being unexpectedly confronted with a provocative film called \"Submission,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   as part of a class covering different perspectives on Islam.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7. The film had been produced by a European filmmaker as a commentary on certain controversial aspects of Islam and featured a nude woman in a transparent burqa with Koranic verses written on her body. PSR at \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The defendant explained at sentencing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   I've always thought [the burqa] was a nice thing ... I've always saw my sister as like a really strong character in terms of how she wore the burqa herself. She was very successful. She was our oldest sibling and she gave a lot of pride to my father and our family and she decided to wear the burqa one day and even though she got a really good job in a really big firm and she was very successful and she was wearing a burqa at the time. It was amazing to see someone who is so successful at the same time also very I guess you might say conservative on some other sides... It was heartbreaking to see someone think of this thing that's was so beautiful that my mom wore and my sister wore and that other family members growing up in the tri-state area I have seen and Muslims of this character and good nature like this. I just feel it was heartbreaking to see that. That's generally why it hurts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Hr'g Tr. 10:25-11:18, June 28, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In response to the film and to other perceived criticisms of Islam, Doe began to embrace an increasingly right-wing view of his religious obligations. PSR at \u00b6 8. He abandoned his education and increasingly participated in an online world filled with religious debate and ISIS propaganda.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9. Faced with a growing sense that his religious beliefs were irreconcilable with the environment in which he was living, he began to communicate directly with religiously radical individuals and groups through social media.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Defendant's online activity caught the eye of investigators from the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force (\"JTTF\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. Investigators visited defendant at his family home in Brooklyn and warned him not to pursue a relationship with ISIS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   During the interview, he admitted that he was interested in events in Syria and generally supported \"rebel groups\" who were fighting against the Syrian government; he stated, however, that he lacked the resources to travel to Syria and indicated that he would not know what to do if he were to travel there.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Alarmed by the investigator's visit and fearing the possibility of arrest, he boarded a flight a few days later, flying from JFK to Turkey.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He then made his way into Syria and ISIS controlled territory using social media connections.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   C. Time in Syria and ISIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   It does not appear that Doe's trip to Syria to join ISIS was motivated by a desire to commit acts of violence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. Instead, given his increasing disassociation with American culture, he seems to have been motivated by ISIS's purported aspirations to create an Islamic utopia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   [M]y ... goal at the time was seeking out a place I could live [where] basically Islamic law or Islamic morals were easy to follow. I guess the most basic way I can explain it was I wanted an environment where I can -- being or living towards halal, as you know halal and haram means something that's permissible and not permissible.... H]aphazardly ... I bought the ticket to go and I didn't have much planning. All I knew on the news was there was a town north of Raqqa where the borders cross. That's all I knew in terms of a plan to go there... From there I made personal contact on how to get to Raqqa.... I don't know how to say it, literally stupid what I am doing, it seems I'm scared\n   and I want to live in what I thought would be an ideal society.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Hr'g Tr. 12:1-13:21, June 28, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Even before stepping foot in one of its camps, defendant experienced regret about his decision to join ISIS.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   Right before going across the border ... I was beat up by border patrol. I've never been in a real fight ever ... I remember ending up on my back on the ground and I felt oddly enough some kind of relief. Okay, now I'm going to go back home. I'm in way over my head. But then we were forced to go past the border and I ended up across the border and then we ended getting picked up by ISIS people, ... I ended up in this town, in this small little place, this holding facility where they kept all these younger guys ... my glasses had broken at some point and I saw somebody who had a similar like power [glasses]. I asked if I could borrow [them] to get a good look of what's going on and I went to like a higher elevation to see where I am and get[ ] an idea. I put on the glasses and I remembered feeling complete hopelessness. I saw desert, endless desert, empty desert.... I just felt where am I, what am I doing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14:8-15:2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The real ISIS was quite different from the utopian Islamic environment that Doe had contemplated. He was confronted with the brutality of ISIS and its dubious religious pronouncements, which were inconsistent with his own Muslim faith. PSR at \u00b6 11. He struggled to reconcile ISIS's enthusiasm for suicide bombing attacks with his own beliefs about peaceable Koranic teachings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. ISIS clerics acknowledged that suicide bombing was not sanctioned by the Koran, but, nevertheless, supported it. Hr'g Tr. 15:13-23, June 28, 2018. He was pressured into denouncing his parents as heretics.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15:6-13. He recalled the horror he felt the first time he saw a suicide belt, slowly backing away in fear as the other ISIS members gravitated towards it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16:2-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Defendant concluded: \"It was ... senseless. These people [,ISIS members,] are liars. These people are not Muslim. That's not how Islam is or the Koran.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15:22-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   He exaggerated his technical capabilities to obtain administrative duties and avoid serving as a front line fighter or suicide bomber. PSR at \u00b6 12. He was present for one battle with Kurdish forces.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. He received military training and carried firearms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Typically, defendant provided administrative, logistic, or support services, or served as a guard at an ISIS organizational headquarters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   D. Escape from Syria and Arrest\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   After several months in an ISIS camp, Doe escaped. He was able to gain access to an electronic communications device. Ltr. from Prob. Dep't at 2 (Dec. 11, 2017) (\"Prob. Ltr.\"). In October 2014, in hopes of returning home to New York, he sent an email message to the FBI identifying himself, referencing his meeting with JTTF investigators in New York, and offering assistance to the United States government.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The email stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   I'm an American who's trying to get back home from Syria. The FBI has a file on me and I can verify who I am with random information you ask me.... I've coordinated a way to get to the border ... in Turkey and near ...

If someone can pick me up safely from across the border before [Kurdish forces] get to me, then I'II be 100% in the right hands.... Please help. I had a week [sic] thought out letter, but it's too risky to have it saved\n   on my device. I'll try to write to you soon in full explanation. But right now my window is closing. I have information on IS movements, locations, heads, systems, and some specific files .... If you guys can get me I will give as much information as I possibly can. From my time here, I've learned a lot, and I just want to get back home. All I want is this extraction, complete exoneration thereafter, and have everything back to normal with me and my family.... Please help me get home.... I have gathered a lot of info I really want to give. I'm fed up with this evil.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Compl., ECF No. 1 (Nov. 3, 2014). Before leaving ISIS territory, he collected some ISIS papers to enhance his value to the FBI.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. 43:1-6, June 27, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Shortly after this communication, defendant made his escape.

He negotiated his way across the Syrian border into Turkey, where he contacted United States authorities and was debriefed about his ISIS activities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Immediately, he provided government officials with intelligence information, which included sensitive documents garnered during his escape. Hr'g Tr. 43:1-6, June 27, 2018. Following debriefing, he was flown back to the Eastern District of New York where he was arrested. Prob. Ltr. at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Doe explained that his decision to defect from ISIS was motivated in part by the wanton cruelty he witnessed living and working in the terrorist group:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   \"My first realization is how do I get home? How do I get home? How do I get to the border? ... [H]ow do I get away from these people? ... I grew up here [in America]. I grew up with good people and when I saw over there ...

Ltr. from United States Attorney, ECF No. 47 (June 8, 2018) (\"5K1.1 Ltr.\") at 8.

The government explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   In the fall of 2014, the government had limited visibility into the activities of ISIS and Syria, and was in the midst of\n   responding to a substantial number of ISIS-direct and inspired threats, both at home and abroad. Because the defendant was cooperating with the government within hours of leaving an ISIS camp in Syria, he was uniquely situated to inform the government of ISIS strategies, tactics, techniques, procedures, personnel and logistical operations.

One is the defendant voluntarily left the terrorist organization. He turned himself in to law enforcement.

However, there are certain factors that need to be I guess in place and that includes psychosocial services being provided to the individual on a continual basis as well as community driven sort of approaches that focus on healing trauma that the individual has either caused or he has or she has been through. Similarly providing that person with an avenue in order to have a positive outlet, give back to the community and a network of outside of government services and out of the government agencies that provide positive mentorship throughout that process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-204\">\n   Q And on --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-205\">\n   A But every individual case again is different....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-206\">\n   Q If you were looking at facts leading up to an individual let's say deciding to travel to join a group, are there relevant - are there any factors that you would consider to be relevant factors in trying to assess motivation in that time frame?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-207\">\n   A So there are a number of sort of internal and external push and pull factors that can compel an individual to I guess join an extremist organization. In terms of the individual, and they vary between every person, push factors include grievances such as issues around status in regards to feeling of persecution, perceived grievances in regards to socioeconomic status sometimes are involved. Similarly mental health on some levels as well as the need for a purpose sort of driven life significance. Sometimes it's been called the quest for significance I believe as well as a sense of community and identity. A lot of individuals are sort of dealing with identity issues. These are push factors and extremist groups are able to manipulate those issues and exploit them through narratives that speak specifically to those issues and frame them within a\n   religious framework to make them seem bigger and more important than it is.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-208\">\n   Q In circumstances where an individual leaves a group, an extremist group, are there any particular factors that you consider relevant to be assessing motivation or predictors in the circumstances under which an individual leaves the group, for example, whether it's voluntary or nonvoluntary?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-209\">\n   A Yes. I think there's different sort of factors there. Again, it's based on the individual case. There are a number of sort of studies that have looked at, autobiographical accounts of extremists and their disengagement points. Things like dissolution with leadership, dissolution with group objectives, violence, not being able to actually deal with violence as a solution. Things of that nature that lead people to disengage ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20:9-22:17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   He opined that he was not in a position to make an individualized assessment of defendant's risk of recidivism because he had not met defendant prior to the sentencing hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26:8-10.

Conditions of Supervised Release\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Expert Hughes recommended several approaches that could help mitigate defendant's risk of recidivism: (1) requiring counseling and mentoring support to the defendant; (2) limiting and monitoring defendant's online activities; (3) restricting defendant's interaction with known or suspected terrorists unless sanctioned by law enforcement; and (4) implementing various \"tripwires,\" such as online monitoring and systematic check-ins/threat assessments in the supervised release process that would alert law enforcement to Doe's possible regression into radical beliefs.

AYAD: Because I thought maybe this was a conversation, in regards to just building on what Mr. Hughes said, developing an almost like a referral board system is vital.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-218\">\n   COURT: What is the term you used?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-219\">\n   MR. AYAD: Like a referral board that would work hand in hand with services and with authorities in regards to developing milestones, looking at incidents with the individual as they progress, if\n   the decision is to have some sort of supervised release.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27:1-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   The court questioned the experts on whether further incarceration would be useful in defendant's rehabilitation and in reducing the risk of recidivism. Hughes expressed concern about the potential for former extremists to be re-radicalized in prison and commented on the lack of de-radicalization programs currently in place in America's prison systems.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 27:21-30:3. He concluded that supervised release, rather than incarceration, would increase defendant's chances to be rehabilitated.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-222\">\n   COURT: Well, can that system [of reducing the risk of recidivism] be best developed during supervised release or during incarceration?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-223\">\n   MR. HUGHES: Your Honor, I'm not aware of any systematic approach for individuals in jail with these charges. In fact, in many ways individuals I've interviewed that have been in jail essentially go back to the same networks and extremist beliefs. There the Bureau of Prisons officials are struggling with that question. Do you spread these individuals out into different prisons where they potentially could radicalize others or do you put them altogether? If you put them all together what does that mean for relapse and removal from radical beliefs. If the court were to consider those two options, we need to weigh those two and require some level of monitoring and social services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-224\">\n   COURT: Well, considering this defendant alone, but with the background that you both have, extensive background in these fields, does the kind of supervision and assistance in rehabilitation require -- I'm not asking you to make the sentence but just to give me your expert opinion -- does that kind of case that we have before us require incarceration?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-225\">\n   MR. AYAD: I can't -- I don't know if I can make that judgment based on the information that I have. But my understanding is that if everything in regards to the disengagement, the working with authorities, being a public face is very important as well, publicly countering the group's ideology, which the defendant has done through media appearances is also somewhat of a factor to take into account. Incarceration in the United States depending on just as Mr. Hughes alluded to, there is no specific set of programming that can assist individuals in developing resilience to falling back into extremist sort of beliefs. If anything, sometimes the system pushes individuals further -- they feel persecuted, solidifying some of their beliefs. I can't make that judgment call.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-226\">\n   COURT: With respect to this issue of persecution as a feeling, would that inhibit the reentry into a legal life?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-227\">\n   MR. AYAD: The feeling of persecution inhibits an individual from being released or being reintegrated into society? I think on every level individuals have a feeling of persecution, a feeling as if the world is coming down on them. Other individuals have a heightened sense of persecution, in which the government is out to get me and people like me, which allows them to latch on to beliefs that provide solutions to those issues. Technically it depends. It needs to be assessed is what I am saying.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-228\">\n   THE COURT: What's your view of this issue, Mr. Hughes?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-229\">\n   MR. HUGHES: I would share many of my colleague's views on this. The question on sentencing, I would defer to the wisdom of the court. The question is both justice and deterrence. But\n   <em>\n    on the narrow question of rehabilitation I think a lot of those issues could be achieved primarily through supervised\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    release\n   </em>\n   .

Some of the situations he was involved in are not required by the terms of his cooperation agreement. His cooperation agreement did not require him to go on television. His cooperation agreement did not require him to do an intervention with a juvenile in Brooklyn. Nor did it require him to meet with numerous members of the U.S. government and outside academics and other experts. We've watched him closely and we've developed over time and with great caution and I really need to emphasize that, with great caution, we have developed trust in him over time that has been tested to some degree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-245\">\n   No one can predict the future.

Every decision that we have made in this case has been focused on an end of public safety. He's a sympathetic defendant. The government's position is not based on sympathy for this defendant.

Other Nations' Approach to ex-ISIS Adherents\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   The hazards of the destabilization of the Middle East and the rise of ISIS are not\n   unique in the United States. Following ISIS's 2014 capture of large portions of Iraqi territory, western European countries have experienced a significant increase in Islamist attributed terrorist attacks.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., 2015 Paris Terror Attacks Fast Facts\n   </em>\n   , CNN, https://www.cnn.com/2015/12/08/europe/2015-paris-terror-attacks-fast-facts/index.html (last updated May 2, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   The recent, drastic decrease in ISIS-controlled territory has created a rush of foreign fighters returning to their home countries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Meleagrou-Hitchens et al.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 71. The Hague's International Centre for Counter-Terrorism report indicates that an average of 30% of foreign fighters have returned to their counties of departure since 2012. Berenice Boutin et al.,\n   <em>\n    The Foreign Fighters Phenomenon in the European Union\n   </em>\n   , The Hague at 4 (Apr. 2016). Many countries in Western Europe and the Middle East share the significant security threat of substantial numbers of returning ex-foreign-fighters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   It is worth considering whether this problem requires uniformity across the various countries whose citizens may be returning from service with ISIS. Punishment and reintegration into society can be expected to be treated in different ways in these countries and within the United States. The reasons are partially because of the large difference in number of ex-ISIS fighters expected to be returning to the various countries. In addition, penological and correctional approaches in different countries widely vary. Nevertheless, it might be useful for these countries to consult with each other over what may be a substantial problem across the world-controlling defeated ISIS members as they return to their native countries. Set out below are some of the approaches in the various countries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   Western European countries have adopted laws similar to America's material support statutes to aid in the prosecution of former ISIS members. France approved a law in December 2012, which allows for prosecution of French nationals who attend terrorist training camps in other countries. Amanda Goodman,\n   <em>\n    Blocking Pro-Terrorist Websites: A Balance Between Individual Liberty and National Security in France\n   </em>\n   , 22 Sw. J. Int'l L. 209, 217 (2016). The French penal code prosecutes the participation in any terrorist group with up to ten years in jail. Code P\u00e9nal [C. P\u00e9n] [Penal Code] Art. 421-5. In 2014, for example, a returnee from Syria was convicted and sentenced to seven years in jail, after reportedly only spending twelve days in Syria.\n   <em>\n    Frenchman Flavien Moreau jailed for Syria jihad\n   </em>\n   , BBC News (Nov. 13, 2014), https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-30043965. French President, Emmanuel Macron, is taking a hard line approach on this issue, promising that returning male foreign fighters will be tried and imprisoned, while women and children will be treated on a \"case-by-case\" basis.

Nature of the Offense and Characteristics of the Defendant\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-279\">\n   There is no doubt that defendant committed a serious offense.

He remained with ISIS for four months. There he received military training and was present in at least one battle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   The seriousness of defendant's offense must be weighed against his extraordinary cooperation with law enforcement over the past four years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part II.F,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . The government reports that defendant's cooperation has been critical in several ISIS-related prosecutions and has supported numerous investigations and counterterrorism measures by the United States and its allies. Defendant's cooperation has come at significant risk to his own and his family's safety, a danger that he will continue to face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   In addition to providing material support to United States' ongoing counterterrorism efforts, Doe has shown a willingness to speak openly about his experience in ISIS in order to educate the public about the terrorist group and counter ISIS's false messages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part II.F,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .

He is a 29-year-old naturalized American citizen with no criminal history. He grew up in a supportive, middle-class family in Brooklyn where he enjoyed a stable childhood typical of many American adolescents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   The death of his sister and her unborn child changed the course of defendant's life. He responded by adopting a renewed commitment to his faith with increasingly violent religious views.

Doe's decision to travel to Syria was primarily motivated by a desire to live in a utopian Islamic environment, rather than a desire to commit violence on the group's behalf. He was immediately disillusioned with the group and escaped after just four months in ISIS camps, surrendering to United States authorities and beginning a four-year period of cooperation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   Since his release from prison, defendant appears to be on a path towards reintegration: living with his parents in Staten Island, reestablishing his good relationships with his siblings, graduating from a City College with a finance degree, working for a neighbor as an electrician, and dreaming of settling down one day soon and starting a family of his own.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part II.G,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   B.

The sentence imposed must not only provide adequate deterrence for the defendant, but for others with similar urges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-287\">\n   The court has the responsibility for designing a sentence that encourages cooperation with law enforcement.

Risk of Recidivism\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   The court has given serious consideration and weight to defendant's risk of recidivism, as well as to the possibility that defendant may be a \"quisling,\" a loyal soldier of the enemy who is lying in wait, prepared to commit a violent act on behalf of ISIS or another terrorist organization when called upon to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-290\">\n   Assurances have been sought that the defendant will not fall back into his former pattern. Two experts provided insight into the various factors in the defendant's history that suggest that he is not likely to reoffend. Noting the lack of data on terrorist recidivism rates, the experts stressed that any prediction of a former extremist's likelihood for recidivism is highly individualized and should be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Hughes Report at 8-9; Hr'g Tr. 20:15-21:4, June 27, 2018;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Nicole Hong,\n   <em>\n    Terrorists' Lives After Jail in Focus\n   </em>\n   , Wall Street J., Apr. 25, 2018 (\"[W]ith\n   limited data on recidivism for terrorism-related crimes, experts say the current system is inadequate in assessing how much of a risk these defendants pose.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   Mr. Hughes pointed to several factors that mitigated defendant's risk of recidivism: (1) his desire to live an Islamic utopia was what apparently drove him to joining ISIS; (2) his decision to voluntarily leave the terrorist organization and turn himself in to law enforcement; (3) his significant cooperation with the government; and (4) his participation in speaking to a young man who appeared to be going down the same dangerous path as Doe had, and his willingness to speak publicly with academics, journalists, and researchers about his experiences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hughes Report at 1-2; Hr'g Tr. 11:3-23, June 27, 2018. Expert Ayad's testimony echoed Hughes in concluding that defendant's voluntary surrender, cooperation with the government, and willingness to publicly denounce ISIS were relevant factors mitigating the risk of recidivism. Hr'g Tr. 23:12-20, 28:17-23, June 27, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   Expert Hughes included an assessment of defendant's current attitudes towards jihadism in his report, concluding that: \"Doe now appears to have rejected the zealous idealism that drove him to leave his home in the first place. As he told me, 'All the [expletive] I've been through, I don't care anymore. America is my home.' \" Hughes Report at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-293\">\n   While no one can ever be sure, the court believes that defendant has recognized the severity of his crimes and is not likely to move towards violent extremist behavior. No evidence has been presented that Doe has acted violently or expressed an intention to commit a violent act or otherwise support a foreign terrorist organization since his return to the United States. He appeared credible and forthright at sentencing about his intention to leave his radical past behind and his desire to live a normal life. The support he is currently receiving from his family will be critical in defendant's long-term reintegration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Raafia Raees Khan &amp; Feriha Peracha,\n   <em>\n    Deradicalization, Rehabilitating, and Reintegrating Violent Extremists\n   </em>\n   , 238 U.S. Inst. of Peace 1, 4 (Nov. 2017) (\"Familial involvement in the [deradicalization] process has consistently proven a determinant factor in a person's overall progress. Individuals whose families visited frequently tended to adapt more quickly to their reintegrated alternative lifestyles (typically within one to three years) than those with limited familial support.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-294\">\n   D. Rehabilitation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   A weighty consideration is whether defendant's rehabilitation requires further incarceration. A lengthy prison sentence increases the risk that defendant will become embittered and regresses into radical beliefs. The prison system can be a breeding ground for radicalization. Islamic extremists often use \"prisons to recruit new followers, reinforce the commitment of existing extremists and to network and exchange ideas with like-minded individuals.\" James Brandon,\n   <em>\n    The Danger of Prison Radicalization in the West\n   </em>\n   , 12 Combating Terrorism Ctr. Sentinel 1, 1 (Dec. 2009);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Hughes Report at 8.

Other countries have addressed this problem by adopting policies that separate radicalized inmates from the general population.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Adam Nossiter,\n   <em>\n    France Toughens Stance in Combating Radicals in Prisons and School\n   </em>\n   , NY Times, Feb. 23, 2018 (\"[P]erhaps the greatest menace is in the country's prisons, and it is there that the government of President Emmanuel Macron [of France] is concentrating its fire with the changes announced on Friday aimed at isolating hundreds of radicalized inmates.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   Further incarceration will inhibit defendant's reentry into lawful life and could encourage defendant to re-engage with violent extremism. Rehabilitation will more likely be achieved through a long term of supervised release, where he will be closely monitored by the Probation Department and can continue his cooperation with the United States government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   VI. Sentence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   Defendant is sentenced to time served of almost two years, and ten years of supervised release. No fine is imposed because of his inability to pay one. A $200 special assessment is imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-300\">\n   The sentence balances the serious nature of defendant's crime with his unique personal story, including his substantial assistance to law enforcement for the past four years. Further imprisonment will not serve any legitimate penological goal; neither retribution, rehabilitation, deterrence, nor recidivism justify sentencing defendant to an additional term of incarceration. He has already served 21 months in prison, in addition to his almost two years of close supervision by Pretrial Services while released on bail. A longer term of incarceration risks stirring up defendant's feeling of persecution and inhibiting his ability to become a lawful and productive member of society.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-301\">\n   The sentence imposed is in the best interest of the public's safety. Based on his individual characteristics,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Part II.A-G,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , and expert testimony,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Part II.I,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Doe's background does not reveal a substantial risk of recidivating.
