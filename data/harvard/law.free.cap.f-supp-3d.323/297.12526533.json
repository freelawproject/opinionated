In March 2018, the Court ordered the FDIC-R to confirm whether \"Banco Popular de Puerto Rico ha[d] acquired the note and loan and, if so, whether this Court ha[d] jurisdiction over the subject matter of this case.\" (Docket No. 13.) In response to the Court order, the FDIC-R filed a motion to dismiss the defendants' counterclaims for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because the defendants \"failed to submit [their claims] to the FDIC for consideration by the claims bar date.\" (Docket No. 18 at p. 2.)

The FDIC-R's Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The FDIC-R argues that the defendants' counterclaims should be dismissed for failure to comply with the review process. (Docket No. 23 at p. 4.) The FDIC-R contends that \"all courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over claims asserted against the FDIC as receiver unless such claims have been timely submitted and exhausted through the administrative claims process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 7 (citing cases).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The FDIC-R concludes that because the review process is mandatory, the defendants' noncompliance warrants dismissal of the counterclaims. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Bl\u00e1zquez's Counterclaim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The FDIC satisfied its statutory duties both to notify Bl\u00e1zquez of its receivership and to process Bl\u00e1zquez's claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201821\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the FDIC assumed its position as receiver to Doral on February 27, 2015 and sent notification to the defendants \"sometime around May of 2015,\" the FDIC complied with the 90-day publishing requirement pursuant to \u00a7 1821(d)(3)(B)(i).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 23 at p. 2;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201821\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3)(B)(i).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The FDIC then mailed Bl\u00e1zquez the disallowance letter on November 13, 2015, complying with the 180-day period after reviewing Bl\u00e1zquez's proof of claim, which she submitted on June 4, 2015.

(Docket No. 25 at pp. 3-4.) Bl\u00e1zquez relies on section 1821(d)(5)(iii), which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The requirements of clause (i) shall be deemed to be satisfied if the notice of any determination with respect to any\n   claim\n   <em>\n    is mailed to the last address of the claimant\n   </em>\n   which appears-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (I) on the depository institution's books;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (II) in the claim filed by the claimant; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (III) in documents submitted in proof of the claim.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201821\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(5)(iii). Bl\u00e1zquez argues that notice was insufficient because the FDIC mailed the disallowance letter to \"the address of the mortgaged property not defendants' address of record.\" (Docket No. 25 at p. 4.) She maintains that \"a quick search on the United States Postal Service website does not show a status for the certified mail number shown on the [disallowance] letter.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201821\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201821\">\n    at p. 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Pedreira's Counterclaim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The defendants' arguments regarding Pedreira's counterclaim are similarly unpersuasive. The defendants contend that Pedreira's claim is entitled to judicial review notwithstanding his failure to submit a timely proof of claim. (Docket No. 25 at p. 4.) The defendants assert that they \"have one claim that accrues to the benefit of the conjugal partnership and that [f]iling two independent proof of claim [sic] with respect to the same cause of action would only benefit redundancy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 4. It follows, the defendants argue, that Bl\u00e1zquez's proof of filing covers Pedreira's counterclaim. \"\n   <em>\n    [A]ll\n   </em>\n   parties asserting claims against failed institutions,\" however, must comply with the review process.\n   <em>\n    Marquis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525987\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/965/1148/#p1154\">\n    965 F.2d at 1151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Pedreira failed to comply with the review process, the Court has no jurisdiction to hear his counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the FDIC-R's motion to dismiss the counterclaims (Docket No. 23) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . The counterclaims are\n   <strong>\n    dismissed with prejudice\n   </strong>\n   . Judgment shall be entered accordingly.
