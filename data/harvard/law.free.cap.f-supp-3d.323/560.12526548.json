PAULEY III, Senior United States District Judge\n  BHH, LLC d/b/a Bell + Howell and Van Hauser LLC (collectively, \"BHH\") move for summary judgment in this class-action lawsuit for fraud, breach of warranty, and violations of the California Legal Remedies Act (\"CLRA\"). For the following reasons, BHH's motion is denied, except that the parties are directed to propose subclasses to address the varying statutes of limitations.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This class-action lawsuit involves ultrasonic pest repellers manufactured and sold by BHH and purchased by Plaintiffs (the \"Repellers\"). Despite nearly 200 pages of Rule 56.1 statements, this case is simple and the disputed issues of material fact are stark. Plaintiffs claim the Repellers are completely ineffective and that BHH committed fraud. BHH counters that its Repellers are effective under certain circumstances and that nothing in its marketing is fraudulent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   But it is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words. And, in this case, three photographs from a study conducted by Plaintiffs' expert are worth even more.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As the photographs show, mice can apparently relax comfortably under a Repeller and even appear to be so drawn in by its siren song that one would scale a wall just to snooze on it. That leaves this Court wondering how BHH can argue that there is no disputed issue of material fact as to efficacy. Further details regarding the Repellers' efficacy can be found in this Court's Opinion &amp; Order dated July 19,\n   2018. But some background is still warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The crux of this dispute is how effective BHH represented the Repellers to be. Plaintiffs contend that BHH made \"3 Common Representations\": that the Repellers (1) are ultrasonic pest repellers, (2) repel ants, roaches, spiders, mice, and rats, and (3) will drive pests out of one's home. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. of Law in Opp. to Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 149 (\"Opp.\") at 3; Order dated July 7, 2017, ECF No. 93 (\"July 2017 Order\") at 15; First Am. Class Action Compl., ECF No. 62, \u00b6 67.) BHH counters that their disclaimers represented that the Repellers are not completely effective in the presence of furniture, carpeting, and other household objects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This Court has reviewed numerous examples of the Repellers' packaging. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Yitzchak Kopel, ECF No. 151 (\"Kopel Decl.\") Ex. 21.) While not all packages are alike, they generally make the same representations. For instance, the packages say \"Pest Repeller,\" \"Ultrasonic,\" and \"Plug It In ... Drive Pests Out!\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Kopel Decl. Ex. 21 at BHH, LLC 006642-44.) They also contain images of various insects and rodents encircled in a \"no\" symbol. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Kopel Decl. Ex. 21 at BHH, LLC 006642-44.) BHH's catalogue listings contain even more specific language. For instance, one catalogue says the Repellers \"help[ ] rid your home of all kinds of creepy crawlies!\" (Kopel Decl. Ex. 22.) Another two claim that you can \"[g]et rid of ants, spiders, mice, roaches, rats and other pests.\" (Kopel Decl. Exs. 23 &amp; 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Some packaging contains a disclaimer, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-16\">\n   Ultrasonic signals will lose intensity as it travels. It is also absorbed by soft objects such as carpeting and is reflected by hard surfaces, such as furniture. Ultrasonic signals cannot reach nesting or feeding places behind walls, under floors, or within cracks. Multiple devices may be necessary for larger rooms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Kopel Decl. Ex. 21 at BHH, LLC 006653.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   But whether this disclaimer puts consumers on notice is a jury question. As discussed in this Court's July 2017 Order, Plaintiffs maintain that the Repellers do not work, and BHH does not disclaim all effectiveness. (July 2017 Order at 7.) BHH's motion papers buttress this view: \"A reasonable consumer, in the context of [the disclaimer], would understand that ultrasonic technology\n   <em>\n    has limitations\n   </em>\n   , and would expect that the [R]epeller's effectiveness\n   <em>\n    would be reduced\n   </em>\n   \" when faced with hard objects or carpeting. (Mot. at 10 (emphases added).) Notably, BHH does not say that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   effectiveness would be lost.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs also offer evidence that BHH may have known the Repellers were ineffective before marketing them. For instance, BHH concedes that the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") issued multiple letters to, and instituted several actions against, manufacturers and retailers of ultrasonic pest repellers, though BHH disputes whether it received these notices. (Defs.' Resp. to Pls.' Statement of Additional Material Facts that Present a Genuine Issue for Trial, ECF No. 157 (\"Defs.' Rule 56.1 Resp.\") \u00b6 33; Kopel Decl. Ex. 30 (\"Staff of the Federal Trade Commission's Division of Enforcement today announced that they have sent warning letters to more than 60 manufacturers and retailers of ultrasonic pest-control devices, stating that efficacy claims about those products must be supported by scientific evidence.\").) Moreover, Plaintiffs append a cavalcade of studies published before 2011, which they contend demonstrate that ultrasonic repellers are generally ineffective. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Kopel Decl. Exs. 46-51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Summary judgment is proper only where \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Dec. 12, 2017) (similar elements). To prevail on a claim under the CLRA, Plaintiffs must prove that BHH \"represent[ed] that goods ... have ... characteristics ... uses, [or] benefits ... that they do not have,\" or \"advertis[ed] goods ... with intent not to sell them as advertised.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201770\">\n    Cal.

In addition, one of the CLRA claims and the fraud claim require BHH to have known that its representations were false when made or to have had an intent to sell a product not as advertised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Here, \"there is a genuine issue for trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p249\">\n    477 U.S. at 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p249\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and quotation marks omitted). First, the FTC letters and numerous studies cited by Plaintiffs demonstrate that BHH may have been on notice that ultrasonic repellers were generally ineffective. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Rule 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 33; Kopel Decl. Ex. 30; Kopel Decl. Exs. 46-51.) Second, as discussed in this Court's July 2018 Order, Plaintiffs vigorously dispute the credibility of BHH's pre-market testing. While this Court declined to preclude testimony from experts who rely on those tests, a rational trier of fact could find that those tests-which BHH knew about before selling its Repellers-demonstrate that BHH's representations and warranties were knowingly false. In other words, while the tests themselves may not have been junk science, their applicability may have been so limited that BHH knew that its representations could not be met. Third, questions of intent are \"notoriously inappropriate\" for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Leberman v. John Blair &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540253\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/880/1555/#p1559\">\n    880 F.2d 1555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1559-60 (2d Cir. 1989) (\"[It] is notoriously inappropriate for determination of claims in which issues of intent, good faith and other subjective feelings play dominant roles.\" (quotation marks and citations omitted) );\n   <em>\n    SEC v. First Jersey Sec., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7644216\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/101/1450/#p1467\">\n    101 F.3d 1450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1467 (2d Cir. 1996) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Celestica Inc.

Aug. 20, 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Finally, BHH's argument that Plaintiffs seek to employ a non-existent \"real world effectiveness\" standard for breach of warranty is of no moment. Plaintiffs contend that the Repellers do not work\n   <em>\n    at all\n   </em>\n   , even when not blocked by furniture or carpeting. Plaintiffs' arguments regarding the Repellers' \"real-world\" effectiveness are not at odds with this theory. At bottom, Plaintiffs contend not that there is a \"real world\" standard of effectiveness, but that BHH sells a product that cannot work in any place it would be used, rendering it completely ineffective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Statute of Limitations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   BHH sets forth various statute-of-limitations arguments. However, none of those arguments seek to bar claims completely-they merely limit the date from which certain Plaintiffs may recover. Plaintiffs make no counterargument as to whether some of their claims are time-barred. Rather, Plaintiffs argue that subclasses should be created so that this Court can address any time-barred claims separately. BHH agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   District courts have discretion to create subclasses in view of statute-of-limitations issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jermyn v. Best Buy Stores, L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4244671\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/256/418/#p431\">\n    256 F.R.D. 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 431 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) ; Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(5). Accordingly, and in view of the parties' agreement regarding the applicability of various statute-of-limitations issues, the parties are directed\n   to submit proposed subclasses to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, the parties disagree about the date this action commenced for statute of limitations purposes. BHH maintains that it should be June 19, 2015, the date the complaint was filed. Plaintiffs counters that \"cross-jurisdictional class-action tolling\" applies, and the action should thus be deemed commenced on April 16, 2015, when a similar action was filed in Ohio. Because \"a federal court evaluating the timeliness of state law claims must look to the law of the relevant state to determine whether, and to what extent, the statute of limitations should be tolled by the filing of a putative class action in another jurisdiction,\" this Court looks to the law of New York.\n   <em>\n    Casey v.
