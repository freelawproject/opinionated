YARBROUGH, UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE, Sitting by Consent\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   THIS MATTER comes before the Court on the parties' cross-motions for declaratory judgment. Docs. 16, 17. Plaintiff filed her Complaint for Declaratory Judgment, Breach of Contract, and Negligence in New Mexico state district court on January 6, 2017. Doc. 1-1. Defendant removed the action to federal court on February 28,\n   2017. Doc. 1. Plaintiff's claim for declaratory judgment is premised on allegations that Defendant refused to negotiate settlement of Plaintiff's claim for underinsured motorist (\"UM\") coverage pursuant to her insurance policy with Defendant. Defendant denied Plaintiff's claim for UM coverage due to Plaintiff's failure to timely make a claim for UM coverage pursuant to the terms of the policy. Having reviewed the briefing, the relevant law, and being otherwise fully advised, the Court will grant Plaintiff's Motion in part and deny Defendant's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. PRELIMINARY PROCEDURAL MATTERS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before getting into the substance of the parties' arguments, the Court will first address whether the state or the federal declaratory judgment act applies. Second, the Court then considers what type of relief is available under the Declaratory Judgment Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   First, some confusion exists among the parties as to whether the Court's consideration of Plaintiff's claim for declaratory judgment is controlled by the federal Declaratory Judgment Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 2202, or New Mexico's Declaratory Judgment Act, NMSA 1978 \u00a7 44-6-1 to -15. Importantly, Defendant's removed this case to federal Court on the basis of the Court's diversity jurisdiction. A federal court exercising jurisdiction over a case based on diversity of citizenship looks to federal procedural law and to state substantive law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10687\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/304/64/#p72\">\n    304 U.S. 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 72,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10687\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/304/64/#p72\">\n    58 S.Ct. 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10687\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/304/64/#p72\">\n    82 L.Ed. 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1938). The federal Declaratory Judgment Act is procedural.\n   <em>\n    Farmers Alliance Mut. Ins. Co. v. Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"918001\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/570/1384/#p1386\">\n    570 F.2d 1384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1386 (10th Cir. 1978). It \"does not create substantive rights for parties ... [but] merely provides another procedure whereby parties may obtain judicial relief.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"918001\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/570/1384/#p1386\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, while New Mexico law will control the substantive issues of the case, the federal Declaratory Judgment Act will control the procedure governing Plaintiff's claim for declaratory judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Second, although the parties have filed cross-motions for declaratory judgment, the Court clarifies that the Declaratory Judgment Act does not contemplate \"motions for declaratory judgment.\" Under the Act, a court \"may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such a declaration\" where a party files \"an appropriate pleading.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The Federal Rules \"govern the procedure for obtaining a declaratory judgment under [the Act].\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 57. As such, \"the requirements of pleading and practice in actions for declaratory relief are exactly the same as in other civil actions.\"\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

When faced with a motion for declaratory judgment, courts therefore often construe the motion as a motion for summary judgment on a declaratory judgment action.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kam-Ko Bio-Pharm Trading\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3433156\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/560/935/#p943\">\n    560 F.3d 935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 943 (9th Cir. 2009) (upholding the district court's decision to construe a motion for declaratory judgment as a motion for summary judgment);\n   <em>\n    Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters v.

D.N.M.LR-Civ. 56.1(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When reviewing a motion for summary judgment, the court should keep in mind three principles. First, the court's role is not to weigh the evidence, but determine whether a genuine issue exists as to material facts requiring a trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Liberty Lobby\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 249,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p256\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, the court must resolve all reasonable inferences and doubts in favor of the non-moving party, and construe all evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunt v.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Unless otherwise noted, the following are the undisputed material facts. In November 2011, Defendant issued Plaintiff an automobile insurance policy. Defendant's Ex. C, Doc. 16 at 20. The policy was issued by an Ohio insurance agent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p256\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The policy indicates that Plaintiff resided in Ohio and that the vehicle would be garaged in Ohio.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p256\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It is therefore undisputed that the policy was issued in Ohio. This is material because the policy included a choice of law provision stating that the policy should be \"construed and interpreted in conformity with the laws of the state in which it was issued.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39. The policy included a limitation on the timeframe for which Plaintiff could bring a claim for UM coverage. Specifically, the policy stated that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Any claim for Uninsured Motorist Coverage must be brought within three (3) years of the date of the accident causing \"bodily injury\" or one (1) year after the date the liability insurer of the \"uninsured motor vehicle\" becomes insolvent, whichever is later.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On June 1, 2012, Plaintiff was involved in a motor vehicle accident in Taos, New\n   Mexico. Doc. 17 at 2, \u00b6 1; Doc. 19 at 1, \u00b6 1. The driver of the other vehicle, Stephen Salandre, was insured by GEICO with liability limits of $25,000 for bodily injury. Doc. 17 at 2, \u00b6 2; Doc. 19 at 2, \u00b6 2. Approximately one day after the accident, Plaintiff notified Defendant of the accident and on June 4, 2012, Defendant took Plaintiff's recorded statement regarding the incident. Doc. 17 at 2, \u00b6 4; Doc. 19 at 2, \u00b6 4. Though largely immaterial to the present issues, Defendant and GEICO subsequently engaged in a protracted disagreement as to who was at fault for the accident. Their disagreement was ultimately submitted to arbitration and the arbitrator determined that GEICO was not liable for Plaintiff's injuries and that Defendant was 100% liable for damage to Salandre's vehicle. Doc. 17 at 3, \u00b6 8; Doc. 19 at 2, \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Of greater relevance, after the arbitrator's decision, Plaintiff personally sought relief against GEICO and filed suit against Salandre on July 8, 2014. Doc. 17 at 3-4, \u00b6 10; Doc. 19 at 3, \u00b6 10. On October 15, 2015, GEICO offered to settle the case for Salandre's policy limit of $25,000. Doc. 17 at 4, \u00b6 13; Plaintiff's Ex. J. Plaintiff contends that GEICO attached a certified copy of the policy when it made its offer and that this was the first time that Plaintiff became aware of the other driver's policy limits. Doc. 17 at 2, \u00b6 1. Plaintiff's insurance policy required her to obtain written consent from Defendant prior to entering into any settlement agreement with the opposing driver or his insurance company. Doc. 17 at 4-5, \u00b6 16; Doc. 19 at 3, \u00b6 16. Defendant, on other hand, contends that Plaintiff had previously received a copy of an affidavit from GEICO disclosing Salandre's policy limits in July 2014. Doc. 16 at 2, \u00b6 2. Regardless, on October 22, 2015, Defendant gave Plaintiff consent to settle with GEICO. Doc. 17 at 5, \u00b6 18; Doc. 19 at 4, \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On May 25, 2016, Plaintiff submitted a claim for underinsured motorist coverage to Defendant. Doc. 17 at 5, \u00b6 20; Doc. 19 at 4, \u00b6 20. On September 26, 2016, Plaintiff's counsel corresponded with Defendant regarding the status of her claim. Plaintiff's Ex. 6, Doc. 17-26; Doc. 17 at 5, \u00b6 21. According to Plaintiff's affidavit, on October 4, 2016, Defendant responded with language in Plaintiff's insurance policy stating that Plaintiff was required to bring any claim for underinsured motorist coverage with three years of the date of the accident or one year after the date the liability insurer of the uninsured motor vehicle became insolvent, whichever was later. Plaintiff's Ex. 1, Doc. 17-1; Doc. 17 at 5-6, \u00b6 22; Doc. 19 at 4, \u00b6 22. Defendant accordingly took the position that Plaintiff's claim was nineteen months too late and therefore untimely. Doc. 16 at 3, \u00b6 11. After various correspondence between Plaintiff's counsel and Defendant, Defendant offered to settle Plaintiff's claim. Doc. 17 at 6, \u00b6 24; Doc. 19 at 4, \u00b6 24. Plaintiff ultimately rejected Defendant's offer and filed the present suit on January 6, 2017. Doc. 17-1; Doc. 17 at 6, \u00b6 25; Doc. 19 at 5, \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The issues raised by the parties' cross-motions are largely similar. First, Plaintiff and Defendant agree that in this diversity action, the Court is to apply New Mexico choice of law rules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tucker v. R.A. Hanson Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519705\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/956/215/#p217\">\n    956 F.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 217 (10th Cir. 1992) (\"When deciding diversity cases, federal courts apply the law of the state in which they are sitting.... This includes applying the state choice of law rules.\"). The parties disagree, however, as to whether New Mexico's choice of law jurisprudence mandates application of New Mexico or Ohio law to their present dispute. Plaintiff contends that the three year\n   time-to-sue provision for UM claims in her insurance contract violates New Mexico public policy and therefore precludes application of Ohio law and renders the provision void and unenforceable. Plaintiff alternatively argues that Defendant should be equitably estopped under New Mexico law from enforcing the provision due to its failure to comply with its duty to disclose. For these reasons, Plaintiff contends that New Mexico's six year statute of limitation period for asserting UM claims applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant, on the other hand, contends the time-to-sue provision does not violate New Mexico public policy and, therefore, Ohio law governs the parties' present dispute. Defendant further contends that contractual provisions limiting an individual's ability to bring UM claims to three years from the date of the accident are valid and enforceable under Ohio law. Plaintiff, assuming for purposes of argument that Ohio law applies, contends that by not raising the time-to-sue provision with Plaintiff during the course of its communications with Plaintiff, Defendant waived the three year time-to-sue provision. Doc. 17 at 16-18. Plaintiff further argues that her reasonable interpretation of the insurance contract precludes application of the time-to-sue provision. Doc. 17 at 19. Finally, Plaintiff contends that the time-to-sue provision is unreasonable and unenforceable under Ohio law. Doc. 17 at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court notes that in cases arising under diversity jurisdiction, the Court's task is not to reach its own judgment regarding the state law at issue, but simply to \"ascertain and apply the state law.\"\n   <em>\n    Wade v. EMCASCO Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5743502\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/483/657/#p665\">\n    483 F.3d 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 665-66 (10th Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Where no controlling state law exists, the federal court must endeavor to predict what the state's highest court would do if it were faced with the same facts and issues.\n   <em>\n    Stickley v.
