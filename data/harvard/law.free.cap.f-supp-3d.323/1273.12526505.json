Browning, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court on: (i) the Restricted Motion to Obtain Physical and Mental Health Records, filed March 27, 2018 (Doc. 1985)(\"Health Records Motion\"); and (ii) the Motion in Opposition to Disclosure of the Defendant's Redacted Mental and Physical Health Records to Third Party Co-Defendants, filed April 25, 2018 (Doc. 2161)(\"Motion in Opposition\"). The primary issue is whether several cooperating witnesses' health records, which the New Mexico Corrections Department (\"NMCD\") maintains, are in Plaintiff United States of America's \"possession, custody, or control.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(E). The Court concludes that federal regulations restricting the NMCD's ability to share those health records with the United States mean that the United States does not possess those records notwithstanding the NMCD's close cooperation with the United States in this case. Consequently, the Court denies the Health Records Motion and grants the Motion in Opposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In the Health Records Motion, Defendant Edward Troup and Defendant Billy Garcia ask the Court to order the United States \"to disclose the New Mexico Corrections Department's physical and mental health records\" of thirteen of its witnesses. Health Records Motion at 1. Troup and B. Garcia argue that the United States must disclose its witnesses' health records under rule 16(a)(1)(E) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, because those records are \" 'material to preparing the defense,' \" and are in the United States' \" 'possession, custody, or control.' \" Health Records Motion at 3-4 (quoting Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(E) ). Troup and B. Garcia assert that those records are material to their defense, because \"[t]he government's case hinges heavily on the testimony of cooperating witnesses\" and mental health records impact those witnesses' credibility. Health Records Motion at 4-5. Troup and B. Garcia contend that the United States has possession, custody, or control over those records even though the United States cannot get those records without going through the NMCD, because the \"Court has previously found that NMCD is 'closely aligned with this prosecution' given the government's concession that this case has involved a 'joint investigation' with the 'STIU,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   NMCD, [and] the FBI.' \" Health Records Motion at 4 (alteration in the original)(quoting Memorandum Opinion and Order at 104,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202271430\">\n    2017 WL 2271430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *49, filed February 8, 2017 (Doc. 907)(\" MOO\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Troup and B. Garcia also argue that the United States must disclose its witnesses' health records under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Health Records Motion at 8-11. Troup and B. Garcia explain that, under\n   <em>\n    Giglio v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11721534\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/150/#p153\">\n    405 U.S. 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 153,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11721534\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/150/#p153\">\n    92 S.Ct. 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11721534\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/150/#p153\">\n    31 L.Ed.2d 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972), the United States must disclose \"evidence that is useful to the defense in impeaching government witnesses, even if the evidence is not inherently exculpatory.\" Health Records Motion at 8. Troup and B. Garcia concede that the Due Process Clause does \"not require the government to provide information which it does not possess,\" but they repeat their contention that the United States possesses those records by virtue of its relationship with the NMCD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   According to Troup and B. Garcia, they cannot \"effectively cross-examine the government's central witnesses\" without access to their health records. Health Records Motion at 11. Again, according to Troup and B. Garcia, that inability implicates their \"rights to confrontation and a fair trial under the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\" Health Records Motion at 11. Troup and B. Garcia conclude by observing that producing the health records of the United States' witnesses do not violate those witnesses' rights under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-191,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20Stat.%201936\">\n    110 Stat. 1936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"HIPAA\"), because HIPAA permits disclosure in accordance with a court order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Health Records Motion at 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   To get the adversarial process going, the Court granted the Health Records Motion in part, and directed Troup and B. Garcia to \"contact the attorneys for the witnesses and [to] see if there is any objection to the production\" of their health records\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   the Court ordered the United States to disclose those records, \"if the witnesses or their attorney[s] consent to their disclosure.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Order at 2, filed April 5, 2018 (Doc. 2075)(\"Order\"). On April 17, 2018, the United States notified the Court that it contacted Sammy Griego and that he \"opposed the release of any of his mental health records in possession by the NMCD and any subsequent disclosure.\" United States' Sealed Notice Objecting to the Release of Sammy Griego's Medical Records, filed April 17, 2018 (Doc. 2128). On April 23, 2018, Defendant Javier Alonso, who has pled guilty and is now one of the United States' witnesses, notified the Court that he objects to his health records' disclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Objection at 1, filed April 23, 2018 (Doc. 2145). Two days later, Defendant Federico Munoz notified the Court -- via the Motion in Opposition -- that he does not consent to his health records' disclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion in Opposition at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In the Motion in Opposition, Munoz argues that, under HIPAA, the NMCD cannot disclose his health records to Troup and B. Garcia without his consent unless the Court orders that disclosure or the NMCD \"receives satisfactory assurance from the party seeking the information [Troup and B. Garcia] that reasonable efforts were made to obtain a qualified protective order.\" Motion in Opposition at 3-4. According to Munoz, \"[n]either has been done.\" Motion in Opposition at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Munoz also argues that Troup's and B. Garcia's \"Sixth Amendment right to confrontation will not be violated by this Court's denial of\" their health records request. Motion in Opposition at 5 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v. LaVallee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"31268\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/439/670/\">\n    439 F.3d 670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2006) ). Munoz supports that argument by quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. LaVallee\n   </em>\n   at length:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \"[C]onfrontation is a trial right, designed to prevent improper restrictions on the types of questions that defense counsel may ask during cross-examination. The ability to question adverse witnesses, however, does not include the power to require the pretrial disclosure of any and all information that might be useful in contradicting unfavorable testimony. Normally the right to confront one's accusers is satisfied if defense counsel receives wide latitude at trial to question witnesses. In short, the Confrontation Clause only guarantees an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Motion in Opposition at 5 (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote omitted\n   by Munoz)(quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. LaValle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"31268\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/439/670/\">\n    439 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   692 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, Munoz argues that Troup and B. Garcia \"are not entitled to an exhaustive list of every medical record for any type of mental and/or physical ailment,\" even if they are entitled to receive some of Munoz' health records. Motion in Opposition at 4 (citing\n   <em>\n    Brigham v. Coyler\n   </em>\n   , No. CIV 09-2210,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%202131967\">\n    2010 WL 2131967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (D. Kan. May 27, 2010) (Waxse, M.J.) ). Accordingly, Munoz asks:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   that if the Court does enter a disclosure order, that the disclosure order (a) limit access to MR. MUNOZ'S relevant medical records, (b) specifically identify the specific medical information are sought, [sic] (c) limit access to MR. MUNOZ'S medical records to those falling within a relevant time period, (d) require the requestors to advise MR. MUNOZ'S counsel of the materials sought and the information's relevancy, and (e) require the requestors to advise the treating physician of his or her right to decline to participate in any ex parte communications and to provide the treating physician with a copy of the disclosure order stating this fact.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Motion in Opposition at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In its MOO, the Court stated that if the United States \"can pick up the telephone and get information from a third-party, the documents are effectively\" in the United States' possession, custody, or control. MOO at 105,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202271430\">\n    2017 WL 2271430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *50. The Court observed that \"[t]he New Mexico Corrections Department is jumping at the chance to help the prosecution.\" MOO at 105-06,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202271430\">\n    2017 WL 2271430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *50. The United States probably would not have brought this case if several Defendants had not tried to kill two NMCD officials, then-New Mexico Corrections Secretary Gregg Marcantel and then-STIU Director Dwayne Santistevan. Once the United States became involved, NMCD was willing to do what it takes to help the United States do what state officials have been unwilling or unable to do: take the SNM down. The Court accordingly determined that it could \"confidently say that the New Mexico Corrections Department's records, under the unique facts of this case, are under the [United States'] control.\" MOO at 106.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   That analysis -- which largely employed a legal fiction for discovery expedition that was, in this unique case, reality -- does not apply, however, to inmate health records that the NMCD possesses. Under HIPAA regulations, disclosing those health records requires a court order or patient consent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, the United States cannot obtain health records that NMCD possesses by picking up the\n   telephone, so those records are not within the United States' \"possession, custody, or control.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(E). Accordingly, those records are not discoverable\n   under rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Likewise, the United\n   States has no obligation to provide those records to Troup and B. Garcia under the Due Process Clause, because the United States does not possess those records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MOO at 104,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202271430\">\n    2017 WL 2271430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *49. Finally,\n   <em>\n    United States v. LaVallee\n   </em>\n   indicates that Troup's and B. Garcia's rights under the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution do not demand disclosure of the health records that they seek.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   The Confrontation Clause is not a \"constitutionally compelled rule of pretrial discovery.\"\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania v.

In rejecting the defendant's claim that the trial court's refusal to permit discovery of privileged communications by his accuser to be used during cross-examination violated his right to confront witnesses against him, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Ritchie\n   </em>\n   stated:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   [T]he right to confrontation is a\n   <em>\n    trial\n   </em>\n   right, designed to prevent improper restrictions on the types of questions that defense counsel may ask during cross-examination.

There is no indication in this case that the Appellants did not have the opportunity to cross-examine Ms. Gutierrez effectively.

Similarly, \"much of the desirable evidence to which litigants seek access ... is unlikely to come into being\" without the psychotherapist privilege, because \"confidential conversations between psychotherapists and their patients would surely be chilled,\" but that reasoning does not apply to communications that patients are willing to make even when they know that those communications are not private.\n    <em>\n     Jaffee v.

First, when considering whether the psychotherapist privilege applies, the Court sometimes uses waiver terminology.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Dorato v. Smith\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338735\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/163/837/#p886\">\n     163 F.Supp.3d at 843\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (concluding that, \"although there is a federal psychotherapist-patient privilege, Smith waived that privilege as to both records and examinations which he knew would be disclosed to others\");\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338735\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/163/837/#p886\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338735\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/163/837/#p886\">\n     at 886\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (stating that \"a party waives the privilege if he or she\" has no reasonable expectation that a communication will remain private\"). Strictly speaking, however, the psychotherapist privilege never applies to communications made in a non-confidential setting, so it is impossible to waive,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , relinquish or abandon, the privilege vis-\u00e0-vis those communications.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Waiver,\n    <em>\n     Black's Law Dictionary\n    </em>\n    (10th ed. 2014)(\"The voluntary relinquishment or abandonment -- express or implied -- of a legal right or advantage.\"). Nevertheless, the term waiver is apt when someone deliberately reveals an initially confidential communication.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Waiver by Subsequent Disclosure,\n    <em>\n     Black's Law Dictionary\n    </em>\n    (10th ed. 2014)(\"A person's waiver of a previously privileged communication by later actions that are inconsistent with maintaining the privilege.\"). Second, while asking whether a document was \"generated at the direction of and for the benefit of\" a third party is often analytically helpful when analyzing whether a communication is confidential, the ultimate touchstone is always whether the patient had a reasonable expectation of privacy.\n    <em>\n     Dorato v.

To illustrate, when an employer provides mental health services to its employees as part of their compensation, the employer does so for its own benefit,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , to attract and retain desireable employees. No one believes, however, that the psychotherapist privilege ceases to apply just because an employer foots a therapist's bill.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Dorato v.
