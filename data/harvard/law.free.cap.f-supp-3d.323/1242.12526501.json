Concerning the Drug Distributor's duty to not ship suspicious orders, McKesson does not argue that the FCSA itself imposes such a duty. Rather, according to McKesson \"[t]he source of the asserted legal duty to suspend shipments of suspicious orders\" arises from an interpretation of the FCSA by the DEA in the 2006 and 2007 letters.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201301.74\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201301.74\">\n    \u00b6 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . McKesson argues that although Plaintiff's claims are packaged as state law negligence, fraud, public nuisance, unfair practices, and racketeering claims, each claim is predicated upon disclosure and shipping duties arising only under federal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. to Mot. to Remand, p. 8 (\"the Complaint repeatedly restates the same federal question: did the Distributor Defendants violate the DEA's suspicious order-reporting requirement,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201301.74\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1301.74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), and a related DEA 'shipping requirement' [i.e. the 2006 and 2007 DEA letters].' \") McKesson thus argues that this Court has subject matter jurisdiction because Plaintiff pleads facially federal claims in Counts I-VII, and that all of Plaintiffs claims depend on a substantial federal question-namely, the meaning and application of the FCSA, its implementing regulations, and the DEA letters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEEDINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the background of this case is a Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) that formed a multidistrict litigation (MDL) arising from nationwide lawsuits addressing similar issues raised in this case. On December 7, 2017 the JPML centralized proceedings in the United\n   States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio before the Honorable Dan A. Polster. On April 26, 2018, the day after McKesson filed its Notice of Removal, Defendant Cardinal Health Entities filed a tag-along notice with the JPML requesting that this case be transferred to the MDL proceedings in the Northern District of Ohio. Plaintiff objected to transfer before the JPML, and the parties will finalize arguments and briefing before the Panel on June 12, 2018. McKesson has advised this Court that the Distributor Defendants expect that, as a matter of course, in two or three months the JPML will issue an order conditionally transferring this case to the MDL proceeding, and therefore request a stay of all proceedings in this Court until the JPML makes a decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his first Case Management Order, Judge Polster placed a moratorium on various motions, except for State remand motions. McKesson argues that Plaintiff will have a federal forum before Judge Polster to argue its motion to remand, and therefore Plaintiff would not be prejudiced by staying proceedings until this case is transferred as a matter of course to Ohio. Plaintiff counters that Judge Polster has yet to develop a procedure addressing State remand motions, and that \"bounc[ing]\" this case \"between federal courts lacking subject matter jurisdiction\" would result in needless delay and waste judicial resources.

In\n   <em>\n    Merrell Dow\n   </em>\n   , in two state tort law actions, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants misbranded a drug in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which created a rebuttable presumption of negligence under Ohio law. Thus, within a state law negligence claim was a federal issue about the interpretation and application of the FDCA. The defendant removed the actions, but the Supreme Court held the removal improper because the case did not arise under federal law within the meaning of \u00a7 1331. The plaintiffs' right to relief did not necessarily depend on a resolution of federal law, the Court held, since the \"[p]laintiffs' causes of action referred to the FDCA merely as one available criterion for determining whether Merrell Dow was negligent. Because the jury could find negligence on the part of Merrell Dow without finding a violation of the FDCA, the plaintiffs' causes of action did not depend necessarily upon a question of federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    Merrell Dow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213698\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/804/#p813\">\n    478 U.S. at 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213698\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/804/#p813\">\n    106 S.Ct. 3229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Gunn\n   </em>\n   , the Court readdressed somewhat similar issues raised in\n   <em>\n    Merrell Dow\n   </em>\n   -namely, whether a state law tort action in which the defendant's negligence turned on an issue of federal law conferred federal jurisdiction. The federal law in\n   <em>\n    Gunn\n   </em>\n   was patent law. The plaintiff sued for patent infringement, lost, and then sued his lawyer for legal malpractice in Texas state court for mishandling the patent case. Because his legal malpractice claim was predicated on the underlying patent case, the plaintiff argued that his case should have been brought in federal rather than state courts (because federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over patent law under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201338\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ). A unanimous Supreme Court disagreed. The plaintiff's malpractice claim-although it would necessarily require a state court to examine federal patent law-was not substantial to the federal patent law system as a whole since a state court's analysis of federal patent law would not bind federal courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In contrast to\n   <em>\n    Merrell Dow\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gunn\n   </em>\n   , the Court's case in\n   <em>\n    Grable\n   </em>\n   fell within the \"slim category\" of cases where the Court upheld removal jurisdiction over a state law claim that incorporated a federal element because that element implicated substantial\n   federal interests-namely, the federal tax code. In its state law quiet title action, the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Grable\n   </em>\n   alleged that it had superior title to real property that the Internal Revenue Service had seized to satisfy a tax delinquency because the IRS failed to follow the federal notice statute before the seizure. Because the plaintiff's claim of superior title turned on whether it was given adequate notice, the federal notice statutes were \"an essential element of its quiet title claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Grable\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209152\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/308/#p312\">\n    545 U.S. at 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209152\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/308/#p312\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, federal jurisdiction embraced the plaintiff's state law quite title action because the embedded federal element was substantial to the federal system as a whole: \"[t]he meaning of the federal tax provision\" and the government's interest in satisfying its tax claims and to provide secure title to purchasers at tax sales.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209152\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/308/#p312\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The IRS agency action presented \"a nearly pure issue of law, one that could be settled once and for all and thereafter would govern numerous tax sale cases,\" and thus \"sensibly belonged in federal court.\"\n   <em>\n    Empire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276298\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/677/#p701\">\n    547 U.S. at 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276298\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/677/#p701\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Thus, McKesson argues that \"[f]ederal question jurisdiction is independently proper in this case because the Complaint facially pleads a cause of action under the federal CSA.\" Def.'s Resp. 24. However, Plaintiff's Complaint does not allege a federal cause of action under the FCSA-nor could it have because the FCSA provides no federal cause of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zink v.

Because Plaintiff's Complaint has not pleaded a non-existent federal cause of action under the FCSA, federal jurisdiction will lie only if the state law claims implicate substantial federal issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grable\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209152\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/308/#p312\">\n    545 U.S. at 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209152\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/308/#p312\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Whether Plaintiff's Complaint Raises a Substantial Federal Issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Thus, in order to establish removal jurisdiction Defendants must satisfy the four-prong test in\n   <em>\n    Grable\n   </em>\n   . Turning to the second prong first, in its briefing Plaintiff made no substantive arguments about whether the federal issues in its Complaint are \"actually disputed,\" and thus the Court presumes the parties agree the second factor is met. But the parties do quarrel about whether the other three factors derived from\n   <em>\n    Grable\n   </em>\n   are satisfied, so the Court will analyze those components. The first factor that Defendants must show is that a federal issue is \"necessarily raised\" in Plaintiff's Complaint, meaning that \"the issue is an 'essential element' of a plaintiff's claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Gilmore v. Weatherford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3523362\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/694/1160/#p1173\">\n    694 F.3d 1160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1173 (10th Cir. 2012). McKesson argues that all of Plaintiff's claims depend necessarily on a purportedly federal issue-whether the Distributor Defendants violated the DEA's suspicious order-reporting requirement (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201301.74\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1301.74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ), and related DEA shipping requirement as spelled out in the 2006 and 2007 DEA letters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court first addresses McKesson's arguments concerning the DEA letters. As noted earlier, McKesson locates\n   the source of a duty to suspend shipments not in the FCSA itself, but in interpretations of the FCSA by the DEA in the 2006 and 2007 letters. Those letters are cited in Plaintiff's Complaint, and Plaintiff relies on them to show that the DEA \"warned\" and \"reminded\" distributors to not fill suspicious orders. In a recent opioid related lawsuit brought by the State of West Virginia, McKesson unsuccessfully removed the State's case to federal court on the basis that these same DEA letters alone imposed a duty on it to not fill suspicious orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State of West Virginia ex rel. Morrisey v. McKesson Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-1773,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20357307\">\n    2017 WL 357307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (S.D.W. Va. Jan. 24, 2017). The court called into question whether these letters had \"any binding effect upon distributors,\" especially since McKesson itself \"concede[d] that [they] were not binding.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8. The court noted that whatever relevancy the letters had, \"their guidance may of course be marshalled in support of particular allegations,\" but that the State's claims did not necessarily hinge on any putative duty owed under the letters since the State alleged numerous other state law duties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Here, Plaintiff's Complaint cites the DEA letters to show that the DEA reminded and warned the Distributor Defendants of their statutory duties. However, like West Virginia's complaint in\n   <em>\n    Morrisey\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff's claims stretch beyond the DEA letters to include state law duties applicable to prescription drug distributors-for instance to \"report any theft, suspect theft, diversion or other significant loss of any prescription drug\" to the New Mexico Board of Pharmacy,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Code%20R.%20%C2%A7%2016.19.8.13\">\n    N.M. Code R. \u00a7 16.19.8.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (F), and to \"provide effective controls and procedures to guard against theft and diversion of controlled substances.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Code%20R.%20%C2%A7%2016.19.20.48\">\n    N.M. Code R. \u00a7 16.19.20.48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A). McKesson argues that these two regulations in particular contain no requirement compelling the Distributor Defendants to halt suspicious orders on which Plaintiff's claims are allegedly based. However, Plaintiff's claims are not predicated exclusively on a duty to halt suspicious orders. The Complaint alleges that the Distributor Defendants had a duty also to monitor, detect, investigate, and refuse suspicious orders of opioids.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 175, 177-78. There is no reason to believe that the New Mexico regulations cited above, which require the Distributor Defendants to report on and guard against diversion of controlled substances could not include the Complaint's allegations that Defendants unlawfully distributed prescription opioids in New Mexico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Two federal courts have recently granted attorney general motions to remand that presented nearly identical issues, and both courts held that state law language similar to New Mexico's imposed duties on McKesson and other defendants to not fill suspicious orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morrisey,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20357307\">\n    2017 WL 357307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   *8 (West Virginia's requirement that \"[a]ll registrants shall provide effective controls and procedures to guard against theft and diversion of controlled substances\" could support theory to not fill suspicious orders.);\n   <em>\n    State of Delaware, ex rel.

Purdue Pharma L.P., et al.\n   </em>\n   , 1:18-383-RGA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201942363\">\n    2018 WL 1942363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (D. Del. Apr. 25, 2018) (holding that Delaware's requirement that distributors \"maintain 'effective controls against diversion [into illegitimate] channels' \" supported theory that defendants created a public nuisance by not reporting suspicious orders.) Whatever putative duty exists under the DEA letters, McKesson has not shown that Plaintiff's claims are predicated solely on obligations under federal\n   law because the Complaint identifies other duties implicated by state law. As in\n   <em>\n    Morrisey\n   </em>\n   , removal jurisdiction is lacking because Plaintiff's Complaint alleges \"specific state-law causes of action\" implicating state law duties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morrisey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20357307\">\n    2017 WL 357307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (stating that \"[f]ederal jurisdiction is disfavored for cases ... which involve substantial questions of state as well as federal law.\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bender v.

Cir. 2010) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Thus, contrary to McKesson's claim that Plaintiff can prevail only by showing that Defendants violated the FCSA, it appears that Plaintiff could show that Defendants violated state law duties to control, report and guard against the diversion of prescription drug orders, meaning that the federal statute is not necessarily raised. While a determination of a duty and violation of that duty under the FCSA will likely occur in examining Plaintiff's claims, so also will examination of New Mexico common law, statutes, and promulgated rules to determine Defendants' duty, if any, to prevent \"diversion\" of prescription drugs into illicit channels. And to the extent, if any, that Plaintiff's claims are \"partially predicated on federal law, federal law would still not be necessarily raised.\"\n   <em>\n    Manning v.

Thus, as in\n   <em>\n    Merrell Dow\n   </em>\n   , the Complaint refers to the FCSA, its regulations, and the DEA letters as \"available criter[ia] for determining whether\" Defendants are liable, but their liability, if any, does not hinge\n   <em>\n    exclusively\n   </em>\n   on federal law, as McKesson argues.\n   <em>\n    Merrell Dow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213698\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/804/#p813\">\n    478 U.S. at 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213698\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/804/#p813\">\n    106 S.Ct. 3229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Nor are the federal issues raised in the Complaint \"substantial\" under the third\n   <em>\n    Grable\n   </em>\n   factor in that they are not important \"to the federal system as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Gunn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407443\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/251/#p256\">\n    568 U.S. at 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407443\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/251/#p256\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
