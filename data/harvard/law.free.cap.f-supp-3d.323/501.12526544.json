At issue is whether the administrator's refusal to cover a prescription for fentanyl violates the mandates of ERISA, Title VII and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, the Equal Pay Act, and the Affordable Care Act. Before the Court are Defendants' Motions to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint pursuant\n   to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. As explained in detail below, Plaintiffs have failed at every juncture to articulate how Defendants have discriminated against women on the basis of sex under the law. Thus, Defendants' Motions to Dismiss are GRANTED WITH PREJUDICE without leave to replead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Factual History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the purposes of the Motions to Dismiss, the Court assumes as true the factual allegations in Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint (hereinafter \"Complaint\" or \"Compl.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff David M. Weinreb is an employee of Conduent HR Consulting, LLC, formerly a subsidiary of Xerox Corporation (\"Employer\"). (Compl. \u00b6 3.) Mr. Weinreb is a participant in the Xerox Business Services, LLC Health and Welfare Plan (the \"Plan\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Plan, an employee welfare benefit plan as defined by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , provides medical and prescription insurance coverage to its participants and beneficiaries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) The Employer is a Plan sponsor and fiduciary within the meaning of ERISA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-7 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201000\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (16)(B); \u00a7 1002(21).) Though the Plan is self-funded (i.e. - it pays for prescription drugs out of its own assets rather from a separate insurance company), the Plan employs a third-party administrator, Caremark PCS Health LLC (\"Caremark\"), to make eligibility and coverage determinations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) The Plan grants discretionary authority to Caremark to make such determinations and handle appeals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff Rebecca Weinreb, David Weinreb's wife, is a beneficiary of the Plan. Ms. Weinreb has been ill for seventeen years with an orphan disease\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   known as Global Diffuse Adenomyosis (\"GDA\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) Adenomas are benign tumors that are inoperable because they secrete hormones that cause the body to continuously contract as if it were active labor, without an epidural. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) GDA only affects women. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ms. Weinreb's body is riddled with adenomas that originated in her uterus and have now spread to other organs. She suffers \"constant[,] excruciating pain with no let up and her pain levels are 'astronomical.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She contracted the disease shortly after she underwent a caesarian section to deliver her fourth child on July 11, 2001. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ms. Weinreb's physician, Dr. Gordon Freedman, experimented with several drug combinations in an effort to provide her with pain relief. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) After Morphine, Oxycontin, and \"numerous other\" drugs proved ineffective, he prescribed Actiq, a stick lozenge form of the potent pain-relief opioid fentanyl.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) Actiq included sugar in its formula, however, which caused Ms. Weinreb's teeth to dissolve and her gums to bleed and become infected. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After four years on Actiq, Dr. Freedman transitioned Ms. Weinreb to newly available tablet and spray forms of fentanyl, known as Fentora and Subsys. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   From January 2009 through January 2014, Medco/Express Scripts was the administrator of Xerox's prescription drug benefit Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) Though Medco required Ms. Weinreb to receive prior authorization to receive these drugs, \"[s]he was always granted approval by Medco at the First Tier Appeal Level for the quantity that she needed fairly quickly and easily.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, \"[a]ll this changed on January 1, 2014, when Caremark took over the administration of the drug plan from Medco.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) Plaintiffs allege that Caremark rescinded Medco's annual prior authorization approvals midway through 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-24.) Plaintiffs claim Caremark refused to reinstate coverage for Fentora at all, and only agreed to approve a small amount of Subsys every 25 days. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-28.) This provided less pain relief to Ms. Weinreb and increased the amount of time she would have to wait for refills. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.) Dr. Freedman wrote Caremark that Ms. Weinreb's prescriptions were \"medically necessary\" to treat her \"extremely high level of pain\" and irregular flare ups. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 29, 2015, Plaintiffs claim Ms. Weinreb received a telephone call from a Caremark representative, Sally, who advised her that Caremark would be denying her Subsys and any other fentanyl drug going forward. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) Sally allegedly explained that \"she retroactively withdrew Ms. Weinreb's Prior Authorizations for fentanyl drugs claiming that fentanyl is approved only for cancer patients with malignant tumors but not for individuals such as Ms. Weinreb suffering from a non-cancer illness.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) Nonetheless, Dr. Freedman thereafter applied for prior authorization of Ms. Weinreb's initial fentanyl drug, Actiq, which \"Caremark approved only the tragically laughable amount of 120 lozenges per month, although Dr. Freedman issued a prescription indicating that Ms. Weinreb needed 24 lozenges per day, 720 units, for each three week period.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45-48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Since 2014, Plaintiffs claim Ms. Weinreb \"has become a ghost of her former self, hardly able to move from one room to the next. She has been paralyzed in pain for hours each day ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs assert Ms. Weinreb exhausted her internal administrative appeals for the denial of her \"fentanyl medication.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Caremark denied Ms. Weinreb's appeals because her requested prescription coverage was outside the terms of the Plan: the Plan only provides coverage for fentanyl prescriptions if they are \"medically necessary.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58-69.) As explained in more detail below, the Plan defines \"medically necessary\" fentanyl prescriptions as prescribed \"only for the management of breakthrough cancer pain in patients.\" Because Ms. Weinreb does not suffer from cancer or cancer pain, her appeal was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Plan Documents and Medical Necessity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   For certain medications, such as Actiq and other fentanyl medications, the Plan requires a beneficiary to obtain prior authorization from Caremark. (Administrative Record (\"AR\") at 980.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Caremark provides prior authorization for a prescription\n   drug only if it is \"medically necessary.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Plan provides a Summary Plan Description (SPD) to all participants and beneficiaries. The SPD defines medical necessity as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Medically necessary or medical necessity: Health care or dental services, and supplies or prescription drugs that a physician, other health care provider or dental provider, exercising prudent clinical judgment, would provide to a patient for the purpose of preventing, evaluating, diagnosing or treating an illness, injury, disease or its symptoms. The provision of the service, supply or prescription drug must:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 Be in accordance with generally accepted standards of medical or dental practice,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 Be clinically appropriate, in terms of type, frequency, extent, site and duration, and considered effective for the patient's illness, injury or disease,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 Not be primarily for the convenience of the patient, physician, other health care or dental provider, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 Not be more costly than an alternative service or sequence of services at least as likely to produce equivalent therapeutic or diagnostic results as to the diagnosis or treatment of that patient's illness, injury or disease.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 For these purposes \"generally accepted standards of medical or dental practice\" means standards that are based on credible scientific evidence published in peer-reviewed literature generally recognized by the relevant medical or dental community, or otherwise consistent with physician or dental specialty society recommendations and the views of physicians or dentists practicing in relevant clinical areas and any other relevant factors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Medical necessity is determined by the medical or dental plan administrator in accordance with its clinical guidelines.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (AR 1155-56 (emphasis added).) The SPD itself does not mention fentanyl prior authorizations specifically.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The SPD states that the Plan's clinical guidelines are available to anyone by visiting Caremark's website and that if a participant or beneficiary has any questions, they may visit the website or call a toll-free number and request a copy of the guidelines. (AR 999; AR 1022.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The guidelines state: \"Abstral, Actiq, Fentora, Lazanda, Onsolis, and Subsys are indicated ONLY for the management of breakthrough cancer pain in patients with malignancies who are already receiving and who are tolerant to around-the-clock opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain.... Actiq is indicated in patients 16 years of age or older; Abstral, Fentora, Lazanda, Onsolis, and Subsys are indicated in patients 18 years of age and older.\" (AR 893.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As Plaintiffs acknowledge in their Complaint, this guideline is consistent with the Food and Drug Administration's approved \"label\" for Actiq.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration Label, Actiq, http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/1998/20747lbl.pdf (Nov. 4, 1998) (\"Actiq is indicated only for the management of breakthrough cancer pain in patients with malignancies who are already receiving and who are tolerant to opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain.\");\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 65. When the FDA approves a drug, it is based on clinical trials and research for one type of use and/or for one condition. When a doctor prescribes such a drug in accordance with the use performed at trial, that is called \"on-label\" use. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 65-67.) However, once the\n   FDA approves a drug, healthcare providers may still prescribe the drug for an \"unapproved\" use if they deem it medically appropriate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration,\n   <em>\n    Understanding Unapproved Use of Approved Drugs \"Off Label\"\n   </em>\n   , https://www.fda.gov/forpatients/other/offlabel/default.htm (last updated February 5, 2018.) This is called \"off-label\" use. According to Plaintiffs, \"it is [not] illegal for a doctor to prescribe the drug for an off-label use. All that non-labeling means is that the FDA has not performed the tests it would need to conduct to confirm that fentanyl is effective to provide relief to patients suffering from breakthrough pain on account of GDA.\" (Compl. \u00b6 66.) Plaintiffs assert further that \"the FDA does not test the effectiveness of every drug for every possible use. In fact, in the case of a rare disease, such as GDA, it is unlikely that the FDA would conduct the tests it would need to determine the effectiveness of fentanyl to treat the breakthrough pain caused by the GDA ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On August 30, 2016, Plaintiff Rebecca Weinreb filed a Complaint against Xerox Business Services, LLC Health and Welfare Plan bringing a single claim pursuant to ERISA \u00a7 502(a). (Dkt. 1.) Xerox Business Services, LLC Health and Welfare Plan answered the initial Complaint on October 24, 2016. (Dkt. 13.) The Parties then cross-moved for Summary Judgment on January 5, 2017 and stipulated to an administrative record. (Dkts. 20-41.) On April 13, 2017, the Court ordered the Parties to brief \"whether and to what extent Defendants denial of Plaintiff's claims implicates Title VII, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, and/or Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act.\" (Dkts. 42.) The Parties briefed the issue on May 12, 2017 and June 12, 2017. (Dkts. 43-44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff then sought leave to amend her Complaint a first time, seeking to add new Defendants Caremark Mail Pharmacy and CVS Caremark, as well as add new claims for sex discrimination under the New York State Human Rights Law, New York City Human Rights Law, and the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination. The Court granted Plaintiff leave to amend on August 3, 2017. (Dkt. 46.) Plaintiff then filed the First Amended Complaint on August 28, 2017. (Dkt. 47.) By allowing Plaintiff to file an Amended Complaint adding new claims and Defendants, the Court treated as moot Ms. Weinreb's and Xerox Business Services, LLC Health and Welfare Plan's original Motions for Summary Judgment of January 5, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On October 24, 2018, Defendants Xerox and Caremark both moved to dismiss the First Amended Complaint. (Dkts. 58-61.) Rather than oppose the Motion to Dismiss the First Amended Complaint, Plaintiff sought leave to amend and file a Second Amended Complaint to cure any deficiencies with the First Amended Complaint. Defendants consented. The Court granted leave on January 3, 2018, and Plaintiff filed the Second Amended Complaint the same day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkts. 65-69.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Second Amended Complaint, the operative Complaint at issue, is brought on behalf of Rebecca Weinreb and David M. Weinreb against Xerox Business Services, LLC Health and Welfare Plan (the \"Plan\"), Conduent HR Consulting, LLC, (the \"Employer\") and Caremark PCS Health LLC. (\"Caremark\"). (Dkt. 67 (\"Complaint\").)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Complaint alleges: (i) a claim against the Plan and Caremark under ERISA \u00a7 502(a); (ii) a claim against the Employer for violations of Title VII and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act; (iii) a claim against the Employer for violations of the Equal Pay Act; and (iv) a claim against Caremark under Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act.

Plaintiffs opposed all Motions on March 19, 2018. (Dkts. 75-81.) Defendants replied on April 9, 2018.

Moreover, since Caremark's decision to deny Ms. Weinreb coverage for fentanyl was dictated by the clear and unambiguous terms of the Plan, it was not arbitrary and capricious under ERISA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Employer's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Title VII, PDA, and EPA claims is also GRANTED. Plaintiffs have been given two opportunities to amend their Complaint and adequately allege claims for sex discrimination. At every juncture, Plaintiffs have failed to meet the pleading standards for Title VII, the PDA, and the EPA. Plaintiffs do not articulate how the terms of the plan discriminate against women on the basis of sex. Rather, Plaintiffs make conclusory claims alleging that\n   the Plan somehow discriminates against heterosexual males, without any support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Finally, Caremark's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Affordable Care Act claims is GRANTED because Plaintiffs do not plead facts sufficient to support an inference that Caremark intentionally discriminated against Ms. Weinreb, nor that the discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in Caremark's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Because Plaintiffs fail to state a claim on\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of their causes of action under ERISA, Title VII and the PDA, the Equal Pay Act, and the Affordable Care Act, their Complaint is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE in its entirety against all Defendants, without leave to replead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss Legal Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   For a complaint to survive a motion brought pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the plaintiff must have pleaded \"enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl.

Mr. Weinreb has not alleged discriminatory intent in his Complaint. He does not allege, for example, that the Plan guidelines were adopted to apply to males or females only, or to discriminate against him or males generally. Nor has he specifically alleged that a female employee of Conduent has ever received fentanyl coverage for a female-specific illness that is not cancer. In fact, a plain reading of the SPD and guidelines would infer that the administrator would deny off-label coverage regardless of sex and regardless of whether the beneficiary were an employee or a spouse. For example, female employees with female spouses who suffer from GDA and sought fentanyl coverage would be denied under the Plan, just as male employees with male spouses who suffer from non-cancer pain would be denied fentanyl coverage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is the off-label use that is problematic, not the sex of the beneficiary.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Saks v.

Both men and women experience cancerous pain. Both men and women also experience sex-specific cancers. The plan would presumably provide fentanyl coverage for sex-specific cancer treatment because that treatment is on-label and in accordance with the guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The administrator's refusal to cover fentanyl had nothing to do with the fact that Mr. Weinreb is a male employee and his wife is female: Caremark's differentiation between cancer and non-cancer patients is wholly unrelated to sex. Unfortunately, because Mr. Weinreb has only alleged that the Employer treated male employees with female spouses differently from female employees with male spouses - tying his sex-discrimination claim to the gender of a hypothetical heterosexual employee - he failed to state a disparate treatment claim in his Complaint.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mario v.
