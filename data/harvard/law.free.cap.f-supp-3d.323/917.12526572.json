Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After Carhartt, Inc. found out that its fire resistant garments containing Innovative\n   Textiles, Inc.'s (\"ITI\") fire resistant fabric were not actually fire resistant, Carhartt sued ITI. Carhartt brings claims for breach of contract, negligence, and other theories against ITI, alleging that ITI's decision to change the fibers it incorporated into its fire resistant fabric from an industry standard fiber to a new, untested competitor caused the defect in Carhartt's products. ITI then filed a third-party complaint against Gentry Mills, Inc. (\"GMI\"), a subcontractor involved in ITI's fabric production business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   ITI alleges that GMI is responsible for the defects in the products that it sold to Carhartt because \"[a]ll of the fabric Carhartt contends was defective was dyed, treated, finished, and tested by GMI before it was ultimately supplied to Carhartt.\" (Dkt. 8 at 3.) ITI brings five counts against GMI: breach of contract (Count I), breach of express warranty (Count II), breach of implied warranty (Count III), common law indemnity (Count IV), and implied contractual indemnity (Count V).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   GMI now moves to dismiss the third-party complaint. This matter was fully briefed by the parties, and, pursuant to Local Rule 7.1 the Court determines that no hearing is necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Where the parties have not agreed upon the applicable law, \u00a7 188 dictates that courts apply \"the local law of the state which, with respect to that issue, has the most significant relationship to the transaction\n   and the parties.\" Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 188(1) (1971) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chrysler Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2039330\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/448/113/#p124\">\n    448 Mich. at 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=528%20N.W.2d%20698\">\n    528 N.W.2d 698\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The state with the most significant relationship to the transaction and parties is determined by looking to \"(a) the place of contracting, (b) the place of negotiation of the contract, (c) the place of performance, (d) the location of the subject matter of the contract, and (e) the domicil, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the parties.\" Restatement \u00a7 188(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Though this action is in a Michigan federal court, North Carolina has the most significant relationship to the transaction and the parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both parties are North Carolina corporations, and they each maintain their principal place of business there. (Dkt. 8 at 1-2.) Though the third-party complaint does not contain detailed factual allegations about the interactions between the parties, it is reasonable to assume that because they are both headquartered in North Carolina, \"the place of contracting, place of negotiation of the contract, place of performance, and location of the subject matter of the contract\" are all North Carolina.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement \u00a7 188(2)(a)-(d) (internal formatting altered).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In addition, none of the \u00a7 188 factors indicate that Michigan has an interest in applying its law to this case. This action is in Michigan court by operation of a choice of forum clause in the agreement between Carhartt and ITI. (Dkt. 1-2 at 15.) That clause has no bearing on the relationship between ITI and GMI, and there is nothing else about the parties' relationship that indicates they would reasonably expect to litigate pursuant to Michigan law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   For these reasons, North Carolina law applies to the allegations in the third-party complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

First and foremost, ITI does not allege the existence of a contract. The third-party complaint's only mention of a contract between ITI and GMI is the language quoted above, alleging that \"GMI breached its contractual obligations to ITI.\" (Dkt. 8 at 3.) There is no explanation, for example, of when the contract was formed, who the parties are, or whether it was oral or written. Absent such information, the third-party complaint contains only \"labels or conclusions,\"\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    550 U.S. at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , insufficient to state \"a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Second, even if this mention of a contract between the parties were a sufficient allegation of the existence of a contract, the third-party complaint says nothing about the obligations of the parties under the contract, or how GMI breached those obligations. ITI argues the third-party complaint \"included allegations that [ITI] contracted with [GMI] to 'dye[ ], treat[ ], finish[ ] and test[ ]' the fabric it subsequently provided to Carhartt.\" (Dkt. 29 at 15.) However, there are no allegations of a\n   contract for those services in the complaint. ITI cites \u00b6 7 of the complaint as a description of the parties' contractual obligations, but that paragraph only describes the services GMI provided ITI. It does not mention a contract, nor does it state what the contract required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Third, if the Court were to assume that the contract obligated GMI to \"dye[ ], treat[ ], finish[ ] and test[ ]\" ITI's fabric, the complaint still does not explain how GMI breached the contract. ITI alleges that GMI serviced \"[a]ll of the fabric Carhartt contends was defective\" and that it \"was relying on GMI's skill and judgment to select and furnish goods and services suitable for ITI's fabric.\" (Dkt. 8 at 3.) But these allegations are not sufficiently specific to \"give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Twombly,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    550 U.S. at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The third-party complaint does not apprise GMI of what it did to cause the fabric to be defective, or even if the defect was caused by GMI's services. Instead, the complaint only informs GMI that it treated the defective fabric.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Because the third-party complaint fails to allege the existence of a contract, the terms of the contract, and the manner in which it was breached, the third-party complaint contains only \"a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action\" for breach of contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    550 U.S. at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It alleges that if ITI is found liable to Carhartt, GMI breached both express and implied warranties. GMI allegedly breached an express warranty that the \"fabric [GMI] dyed, treated, finished, and tested met industry standards, including flammability specifications.\" (Dkt. 8 at 4.) It allegedly breached an implied warranty of \"merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose by provid[ing] goods and services that were neither merchantable nor fit for their particular purpose.\" (Dkt. 8 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    i. Breach of Express Warranty\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   GMI argues that ITI's breach of express warranty count should be dismissed because the third-party complaint contains insufficient factual allegations to state a claim, and, even if it did, GMI only provided services to ITI, not goods. ITI responds by arguing that ITI provided goods and pleaded sufficient facts to state a claim for breach of express warranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Under North Carolina law, a breach of express warranty claim requires the plaintiff to demonstrate \"(1) an express warranty as to a fact or promise relating to the goods, (2) which was relied upon by the plaintiff in making his decision to purchase, (3) and that this express warranty was breached by the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Hall v.

In the third-party complaint, ITI alleges that \"GMI knew ITI was relying on GMI's skill and judgment to select and furnish goods and services suitable for ITI's fabric,\" that \"GMI expressly warranted that the fabric it dyed, treated, finished, and tested met industry standards, including flammability specifications,\" and that if \"Carhartt's principal allegations are found to be valid, then GMI breached its express warranties.\" (Dkt. 8 at 3, 5.) These allegations recite the elements of breach of express\n   warranty, but, as with ITI's contract claim, fail to apprise GMI how, exactly, it created or breached the warranty. Specifically, the complaint contains no allegation regarding what statement or contract clause created the warranty, nor does it contain an allegation concerning what defect in GMI's product caused ITI's liability. It is not enough for ITI to state that GMI handled the allegedly defective products; it must state what aspect of that handling breached the warranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In addition, an express warranty claim only attaches where there has been a sale of goods, and the third-party complaint contains no facts indicating that GMI sold ITI goods.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8524055\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/71/101/#p104\">\n    71 N.C.

Moreover, the complaint makes no mention of the chemical sales that ITI contends is the \"predominant factor\" of the parties' agreement. The only reference to goods in the complaint is that \"GMI knew ITI was relying on GMI's skill and judgment to select and furnish goods and services suitable for ITI's fabric.\" However, this statement provides no information about what goods GMI actually sold to ITI, and, accordingly, is not more than the mere \"labels and conclusions\" rejected by the Supreme Court as insufficient to satisfy Fed.

As explained above, the complaint does not specify with any particularity what goods ITI purchased from GMI, and instead alleges a relationship based on the provision of services. Accordingly, ITI failed to state a claim for breach of implied warranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   For these reasons, Count III of the third-party complaint is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Indemnification\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   ITI's last set of claims is for indemnification.

However, because \"federal courts sitting in diversity 'apply state substantive law and federal procedural law,' \" ITI's third-party complaint is evaluated against the federal pleading standard set forth in Fed.

ITI suggests that indemnification implied-in-law actions can arise out of contractual liability as well as tort liability, and there is some support for that position in case law.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Cox v.

However, ITI does not identify any cases in which a court actually found indemnity implied-in-law based on contractual liability, and the Court is not aware of any such cases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Assuming North Carolina courts recognize claims for indemnity implied-in-law arising solely out of contract claims, ITI could not recover from GMI on these grounds. Carhartt alleges that ITI breached the contract between it and Carhartt by selling Carhartt fabric that did not meet the specifications for fire resistance in the contract. ITI's fabric allegedly failed to meet those specifications because ITI changed the fibers it used to make the fabric from a type widely accepted within the industry to a different, less well-known type. According to the complaint, after it discovered the fiber change, Carhartt tested the pre-change fabric against the post-change fabric and found the pre-change fabric to be in compliance. (Dkt. 1 at 12.) The third-party complaint at issue here only alleges that GMI \"dyed, treated, finished, and tested\" the fabric before delivery. (Dkt. 8 at 3.) It does not contain any allegations about GMI's role in the fiber switch that would expose ITI to contract liability, the time periods GMI participated in ITI's fabric production (e.g. pre-switch, post-switch, or both), or whether GMI tested the fabric for flame resistant qualities. Absent any allegations to these effects, there is nothing in the complaint to indicate that GMI caused ITI to breach its contract with Carhartt, and, thus, ITI is not entitled to indemnification implied-in-law for any contractual liability it may incur.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
