After the Court granted Plaintiff Peoples Gas System's Unopposed Motion for Extension of Time to Respond (Docs. 14; 15), Plaintiff filed a Request for Judicial Notice (Doc. 16) and Response to Posen's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 17) on March 27, 2018. These matters are now ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is an action under Florida's Underground Facility Damage Prevention and Safety Act, Fla. Stat, \u00a7\u00a7 556.101 -106 (the \"Act\"). Peoples Gas System (\"PGS\") owns\n   and maintains natural gas distribution facilities throughout Florida, including a natural gas pipeline in Lee County. (Doc. 1 at 2). Posen is a road construction contractor. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .). In 2009, the Lee County Board of County Commissioners solicited bids for a lane expansion/drainage system project in east Fort Myers, Florida. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). Posen submitted a bid and was awarded general contractor of the project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). Construction began in August 2009. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   PGS maintained the pipeline underneath the project, which provided natural gas to Lee County residents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). This was a \"critical line\" and required caution when working around it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). PGS marked the pipeline with flags and paint and installed testing stations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5). As the project continued, the parties learned that, at certain locations, construction would be impossible unless PGS removed the pipeline ahead of Posen's work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In October 2010, Posen submitted a request to Sunshine One, which is a notification system by which excavators obtain the location of underground utilities before excavating. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20556.101\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 556.101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2). PGS alleges that Posen's request violated the Act because it failed to describe the specific areas for excavation, as required by the statute. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9). In November 2010, Posen's roadway superintendent, Greg Menuez, directed his subordinate, Mark Santos, to dig and till the ground located at testing stations 452-456 with a Bomag mixer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). PGS alleges that Menuez knew that the gas main was not properly marked. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10). When Santos operated the mixer, he struck and ruptured the pipeline, which caused a natural gas fire. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10). Santos suffered severe injuries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This incident triggered several years of litigation. First, in 2011, Santos sued PGS and Posen in Florida state court. (Docs. 1 at 12; 11-1). Several years later, Santos voluntarily dismissed Posen as a defendant to the action. (Doc. 11-3). In 2017, Santos and PGS ultimately settled. (Doc. 1 at 12). Around the same time Santos filed his state action, PGS sued Posen in federal court for the same incident, seeking damages for the cost to repair its pipeline and facilities under claims of negligence. (Doc. 11-4). In response, Posen filed counterclaims against PGS. (Doc. 16-1). The parties ultimately settled and stipulated for dismissal with prejudice. (Doc. 16-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Now, PGS sues Posen under \u00a7 556.106(2)(a) and makes an alternative claim for statutory indemnity under the Act. (Doc. 1). In essence, Posen asserts both counts are duplicative because, under both counts, PGS relies on the Act to receive the same remedy: indemnification for the settlement amount it paid to Santos (Docs. 1 at 12-13; 10 at 7). Posen moves to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, and both parties move the Court to take judicial notice of court filings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docs. 10; 11; 16). For the reasons set forth below, Posen's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 10) is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the court must accept all factual allegations as true and view them in a light most favorable to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

This preferential standard of review, however, does not permit all pleadings\n   adorned with facts to survive to the next stage of litigation. The Supreme Court has been clear on this point-a district court should dismiss a claim where a party fails to plead facts that make the claim facially plausible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    550 U.S. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 570,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    167 L.Ed.2d 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). A claim is facially plausible when the court can draw a reasonable inference, based on the facts pled, that the opposing party is liable for the alleged misconduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(Doc. 10 at 6-13). First, it argues that the damage PGS seeks is not a \"loss\" under the statute. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-13). Second, it asserts there is no statutory right to indemnification under the Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-10). PGS avers that it has a right to indemnification under the broad language of the statute. (Doc. 17 at 12-14). For the reasons stated below, the Court agrees with Posen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As a preliminary matter, Florida substantive law binds the Court on these state law issues. The Eleventh Circuit summarized the precedent:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   In rendering a decision based on state substantive law, a federal court must decide the case the way it appears the state's highest court would. Where the state's highest court has not spoken to an issue, a federal court must adhere to the decisions of the state's intermediate appellate courts absent some persuasive indication that the state's highest court would decide the issue otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Ernie Haire Ford, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9499785\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/260/1285/#p1290\">\n    260 F.3d 1285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1290 (11th Cir. 2001) (internal citation and quotations omitted) ). The Court turns to Florida precedent to decide the issues before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Act was enacted, in part, to \"aid the public by preventing injury to persons or property and the interruption of services resulting from damage to an underground facility caused by excavation or demolition operations.\" \u00a7 556.101(3)(a). Excavators are required to notify member operators (utilities) of their activities so operators can identify the locations of their underground utility lines and prevent damage to their lines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 556.105. If damage occurs despite the lines being properly marked, the Act creates a rebuttable presumption of negligence and the excavator is liable \"for the total sum of the losses to all member operators involved as those costs are normally computed.\" \u00a7 556.106(2)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Here, the parties disagree on the definition of the words \"losses\" and \"costs\" under the statute. Unfortunately, these terms are not defined under the Act, and state and federal courts have grappled with their definitions.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    A &amp; L Underground, Inc. v.

A plain reading of the statute supports no claim for indemnification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In addition, other sections of the Act do not support PGS' interpretation. PGS argues that because \u00a7 556.106(2)(c) provides liability for injuries, it can recover the amount it paid to Santos to settle his personal injury claim. (Doc. 17 at 12-14). However, PGS conflates a claim\n   <em>\n    for\n   </em>\n   personal injury with an indemnification claim\n   <em>\n    based\n   </em>\n   on a personal injury. Here, PGS is not claiming it suffered a personal injury as a result of Posen's breach of duty under the statute. Rather, it makes a claim for indemnity based on a previous personal injury suit. PGS interpretation mischaracterizes the statutory language. While the statute provides liability for bodily injuries, the plain language creates no duty to indemnify a member operator for money it paid during the settlement of a third-party bodily injury claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Last, the Court finds that PGS' interpretation of the statute would force it to infringe on the duties and powers of the Florida legislature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hill v. Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7023976\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/70/572/#p575\">\n    70 So.3d 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 575 (Fla. 2011) (\"Courts are without power to construe an unambiguous statute in a way which would extend, modify, or limit, its express terms or its reasonable and obvious implications. To do so would be abrogation of legislative power.\") (internal citations and quotations omitted) ). Here, the Florida legislature provided no language in the statute that created an obligation of indemnification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court finds two Florida statutes illustrative here. First, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20607.0850\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 607.0850\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3), the Florida legislature created an express statutory right to indemnification for corporate officers, directors, and employees who, acting in good faith, are sued as a representative of a corporation. There is no such express statutory language here. Second, there is no indirect language creating an obligation of indemnification, such as in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2030.2905\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 30.2905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which provides: \"Any such public or private employer of a deputy sheriff shall be responsible for the acts or omissions of the deputy sheriff while performing services for that employer while off duty, including workers' compensation benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martinez v. Miami-Dade Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4234362\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/975/1293/#p1297\">\n    975 F.Supp.2d 1293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1297 (S.D. Fla. 2013) (holding that, although not expressly stated, the language in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2030.2905\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 30.2905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   created an indirect right to statutory indemnification). Because the Act does not include express-or indirect-indemnification language, the Court cannot extend its express terms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hill,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7023976\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/70/572/#p575\">\n    70 So.3d at 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, for the reasons stated, the Court finds the plain language of the Act includes no obligation of indemnification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In sum, PGS seeks a remedy under the Act that does not exist based upon the plain language of the statute. Because Posen has met its burden of establishing that\n   PGS has no right to indemnification under the Act, Counts I and II are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Accordingly, it is now\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   1.
