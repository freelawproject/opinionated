According to the Government, \"[t]he conviction resulted from a protracted trial where the United States presented overwhelming evidence to show that Rivera-Ortiz lied as to a material fact in his applications for OWCP and SSA disability benefits filed in 2005.\" (Docket No. 269 at 2). Defendant, on the other hand, accuses the Government of \"attempt[ing] to mislead the Court by arguing that the offenses for which Mr. Rivera was convicted constitute continuing offenses dating back to 2005.\" (Docket No. 274 at 2). On June 8, 2018, the Court\n   ordered the parties to submit briefs regarding restitution, posing three questions, including whether it should consider amounts since 2005 or 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court asked the parties to submit briefs answering three questions. First, whether for the purposes of restitution, the fact that a fraud is committed at any point requires that the entire amount be restituted or a percentage. Second, whether the Court should adopt a comparative fault type of analysis to determine restitution. And third, whether the Court, as a matter of law, based on the conviction, be required to hold an evidentiary hearing and to what extent, and to what extent not, and any other relevant issues that the Court should address. (Docket No. 266).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After reviewing the parties' submissions, the Court holds that Defendant's restitution must be limited to the timeframe covered by the charged conduct (2012-13) because a scheme was not an element of the convicted offenses. It also holds that it cannot adopt a comparative fault analysis and is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing. However, it orders the Government to revise its proposed restitution amount in accordance to the Court's holding, and subsequently authorizes Defendant to respond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Calculation of Restitution\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The main issue is whether Defendant, charged with making false statements, embezzling Social Security funds, and concealing his ability to work to the SSA in 2012 and 2013, must restitute the amounts earned from engaging in this fraudulent conduct since 2005. The Government argues that Defendant should pay restitution for OWCP and SSA disability benefits since 2005 because Defendant's \"counts of conviction resulted from one continuous crime.\" (Docket No. 269 at 7). Defendant disagrees, and argues that the Court must only consider the 15-month period prior to the filing of each OWCP form (1032 form). (Docket No. 267 at 2). The Court holds that Defendant cannot be ordered to pay restitution for amounts beyond the indictment's allegations because he was not charged with a \"scheme\" to defraud the Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (MVRA) \"compels a sentencing court to order a defendant convicted of certain crimes, including crimes against property, to make restitution to his victim.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

If so, then it can consider conduct not alleged in the indictment that falls within the scheme Defendant was convicted for. When considering such conduct, the Court must look at the indictment and consider the totality of the circumstances. Here, the Government fails the first part of the test. Although it argues that the charged conduct \"were acts taken to conceal the fraudulent scheme commenced in 2005,\" a scheme is not an element of the convicted offenses. (Docket No. 269 at 2).

As the indictment makes clear, Defendant was charged and convicted for making materially false statements under (a)(2) on three occasions.

Section 641, in relevant part, states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Whoever embezzles, steals, purloins, or knowingly converts to his use or the use of another, or without authority, sells, conveys or disposes of any record, voucher, money, or thing of value of the United States or of any department or agency thereof, or any property made or being made under contract for the United States or any department or agency thereof.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20641\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant was charged and convicted because he \"knowingly and willfully embezzled, stole, and converted to his own use or the use of another, money of the Social Security Administration ... to which he knew he was not entitled, having a value of approximately $6,209.70.\" (Docket No. 143-1 at 9-10). According to the indictment, the offense occurred on or about July 22, 2013, and continued through on or about August 30, 2013. As it did regarding section 1001, Government also argues here that Defendant should pay restitution for conduct preceding 2013 because embezzlement constitutes a \"continuing crime.\" Yet as the Court discussed regarding section 1001, that argument fails. Since a scheme is not an element of the convicted offense, the Court must impose restitution only for the amount embezzled on or about July 22, 2013, and continuing through on or about August 30, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    3.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20408\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(4)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A scheme is not an element of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20408\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4). Section 408(a)(4) punishes whoever:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   having knowledge of the occurrence of any event affecting (1) his initial or continued right to any payment under this subchapter, or (2) the initial or continued right to any payment of any other individual in whose behalf he has applied for or is receiving such payment,\n   <em>\n    conceals or fails to disclose such event with an intent fraudulently to secure payment either in a greater amount than is due or when no payment is authorized\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20408\">\n    42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   According to the indictment, Defendant \"having knowledge of the occurrence of an event affecting his continued right to OWCP payments, concealed and failed to disclose such event with the intent to deceive the Social Security Administration, and to fraudulently secure payments when no payments were authorized.\" (Docket No. 143-1 at 10). The charged conduct occurred between on or about July 22, 2013, and August 30, 2013.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20408\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Like the other statutes at stake, a \"scheme\" is not an element of the offense in a section 408(a)(4) violation. The Government does not argue it is either. In fact, it does not even argue it is a continuing offense, as it did for sections 1001 and 641 - 42. All the Government has stated is that the charged conduct \"were acts taken to conceal the fraudulent scheme commenced in 2005.\" (Docket No. 269 at 2). \"It is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to do counsel's work, create the ossature for the argument, and put flesh on its bones.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Because a \"scheme\" was not an element of the offense, Defendant must only restitute the amounts obtained in violation of section 408(a)(4) as a result of his concealment on or about July 22, 2013 and continuing through on or about August 30, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Comparative Fault\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The parties offer no authority indicating that the Court must consider comparative fault in assessing restitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant argues that the Court should consider \"evidence regarding the USPS, DOL-OWCP and SSA's knowledge of Mr. Rivera's work activities for the APWU during the relevant time periods or negligence in their administration of the agency and/or benefit programs.\" (Docket No. 267 at 7). He further argues that the Court \"must also evaluate the victim's reasonable opportunity and failure to take action to prevent losses, as well as how its negligence contributed to such harm.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526539\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/895/1/#p17\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   His reasoning stems from the fact that restitution must be \"based upon losses directly resulting from [Defendant's] conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Quillen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1533896\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/335/219/#p226\">\n    335 F.3d 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 226 (3rd Cir. 2003). If the Government knew of Defendant's conduct and failed to react, Defendant argues, then the losses did not \"directly result\" from Defendant's conduct. But neither\n   <em>\n    Quillen\n   </em>\n   nor any authority cited by the parties has held so. As the First Circuit explained in the context of a different criminal statute, \"[t]hese are criminal statutes, not tort concepts.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
