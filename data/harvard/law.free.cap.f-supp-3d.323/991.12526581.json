For the reasons stated below, Plaintiff's motion [8] is respectfully denied. This case is set for further status on September 13, 2018 at 9:00 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 15, 2018, Plaintiff D.C., by and through his mother Felicia Cheatham (\"Plaintiff\"), filed a Complaint against Defendant Abbott Laboratories, Inc. (\"Defendant\") in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois. [See 1, Ex. 1(A).] In this complaint, Plaintiff brings claims against Defendant for strict products liability, negligence, gross negligence, breach of implied warranty, breach of express warranty, misrepresentation by omission, fraud and misrepresentation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Plaintiff specifically alleges that he suffers from various birth defects caused by his mother's ingestion of Defendant's product Depakote during pregnancy. According to Plaintiff, Depakote is defectively designed, inadequately tested, dangerous to human health, and lacked proper warnings as to the true danger associated with its use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the same day that Plaintiff filed the complaint in state court, a summons was issued to Defendant. [See 1, Ex. 1(B).] However, on June 18, 2018, before being served with the complaint, Defendant removed the action to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction because there is complete diversity of citizenship and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. [See 1.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff quickly moved to remand this case to state court, and requests expedited consideration of this motion. [See 8.] Plaintiff argues that this case must be remanded based on the \"forum defendant rule,\" which provides that \"[a] civil action otherwise removable solely on the basis of jurisdiction under section 1332(a) of this title may not be removed if any of the parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the State in which such action is brought.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). Because Defendant is an Illinois citizen, and thus an in-forum defendant, Plaintiff argues that this rule prevents Defendant's removal of this case to federal court. Defendant argues that this rule is inapplicable based on the plain language of the statute; the statute only prohibits a properly joined\n   <em>\n    and served\n   </em>\n   forum\n   defendant from removing a case, and Defendant was not served with the complaint prior to removal. [14, at 3-4.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"The federal removal statute permits a defendant to remove a civil action from state court when a district court has original jurisdiction over the action.\"\n   <em>\n    Micrometl Corp. v.

The party invoking federal jurisdiction has the burden of establishing that it exists. See\n   <em>\n    Schimmer v. Jaguar Cars, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9182312\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/384/402/#p404\">\n    384 F.3d 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 404 (7th Cir. 2004) (a removing defendant must demonstrate \"reasonable probability\" that subject-matter jurisdiction exists). In evaluating whether to remand a case, a plaintiff's choice of forum is presumed valid, and the Court must resolve any doubts about jurisdiction in favor of remand. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Schur v. L.A. Weight Loss Ctrs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041934\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/577/752/#p758\">\n    577 F.3d 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 758 (7th Cir. 2009) ;\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Ill. 2002) (\"Generally, the removal statute is strictly construed, with an eye towards limiting federal jurisdiction.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant has removed this case on the basis of the diversity jurisdiction statute. [See 1.] It is uncontested that the statutory requirements for such jurisdiction are met here. Section 1332 provides that \"[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and is between citizens of different States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Plaintiff and his mother are citizens of Louisiana, and Defendant is a citizen of both Delaware and Illinois. [1, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12; 1, Ex. 1(A), \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.] Plaintiff does not challenge that the $75,000 jurisdictional minimum requirement is easily met in this case. [1, \u00b6\u00b6 18-22.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff instead moves to remand the case based on the forum defendant rule because Defendant is an Illinois citizen. The forum defendant rule bars removal based on diversity jurisdiction under \u00a7 1332(a)\"if any of the parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the State in which such action is brought.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). The parties' dispute turns on the \"properly joined and served\" language in the statute. Plaintiff argues that, although Defendant was not properly served before removing the case, this statute should not be read in a hyper-technical way that would be contrary to Congressional intent behind the forum defendant rule. Plaintiff challenges Defendant's conduct-monitoring the public docket and immediately removing the action once it was filed and before Plaintiff could possibly have served the only defendant with the Complaint-as an improper and strategic \"snap removal\" that seeks to evade the forum defendant rule through gamesmanship and essentially nullifies Congressional intent behind the rule. [8-1, at 2-3.] According to Defendant, however, the plain language of the forum defendant rule only prevents properly joined\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   served forum defendants from removing a state court case to federal court. Because Defendant was not yet served with the Complaint when it filed its notice of removal, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's motion to remand should be denied. [14, at 2.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   There is no Seventh Circuit precedent on the question of how to interpret the forum defendant rule, as \"failure to comply with the forum defendant rule is, indeed, a defect in the removal that bars\n   [appellate] review.\"\n   <em>\n    Holmstrom v. Peterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3507394\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/492/833/#p838\">\n    492 F.3d 833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 838 (7th Cir. 2007). District courts within the Seventh Circuit and around the country faced with this question have disagreed on the correct interpretation of the statute. See\n   <em>\n    Graff v. Leslie Hindman Auctioneers, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524269\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/299/928/#p934\">\n    299 F.Supp.3d 928\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 934 (N.D. Ill. 2017) (\"District courts are divided on whether the forum defendant rule bars pre-service removal to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction.\");\n   <em>\n    Estep v. Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re Testosterone Replacement Therapy Prods. Liab. Litig.\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4193438\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/67/952/#p958\">\n    67 F.Supp.3d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 958 (N.D. Ill. 2014) (noting that \"there is a split in authority on the issue\"). Some courts have looked to the forum defendant rule's underlying purpose and granted motions to remand involving unserved in-forum defendants in order to give effect to this purpose; others have instead applied the plain language of the statute, which prevents removal only if the forum defendant is both properly joined\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   served, and thus denied remand motions in cases involving unserved forum state defendants. The Court considers both interpretations of the statute below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. \"Purpose\" Interpretation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The \"purpose\" interpretation of the forum defendant rule focuses on the purpose for which the rule was enacted, specifically \"to preserve the plaintiff's choice of a (state) forum, under circumstances where it is arguably less urgent to provide a federal forum to prevent prejudice against an out-of-state party.\"\n   <em>\n    Hurley v. Motor Coach Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11241014\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/222/377/#p380\">\n    222 F.3d 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 380 (7th Cir. 2000). According to this reasoning, allowing a forum defendant to circumvent this rule and remove a case before service in a \"snap removal\" fashion \"would frustrate the consistent efforts of both Congress and the courts to determine diversity jurisdiction based on the genuine interests of the parties to the controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    Vivas v. Boeing Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4084308\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/486/726/#p734\">\n    486 F.Supp.2d 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 734 (N.D. Ill. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff's remand motion relies primarily on Judge Kennelly's decision adopting this purpose interpretation in\n   <em>\n    Estep v. Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Co., Inc. (In re Testosterone Replacement Therapy Products Liability Litigation)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4193438\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/67/952/#p958\">\n    67 F.Supp.3d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Ill. 2014). In\n   <em>\n    Estep\n   </em>\n   (which also involves the same Defendant as this case), the forum defendant removed the case to federal court on the same day that it was filed. Judge Kennelly considered the different approaches district courts have taken in interpreting the forum defendant rule and concluded that cases looking beyond \u00a7 1441(b)(2)'s language to its purpose were more persuasive \"because they seek to fulfill the principle animating the plain language rule and are therefore faithful to Congressional intent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4193438\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/67/952/#p958\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4193438\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/67/952/#p958\">\n    at 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because Congress \"could not have foreseen or intended this outcome,\" Judge Kennelly granted the plaintiff's motion to remand.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4193438\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/67/952/#p958\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4193438\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/67/952/#p958\">\n    at 962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Other district courts similarly have granted motions to remand in \"snap removal\" situations based on the purpose of \u00a7 1441(b)'s forum defendant rule.
