(Doc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   50, Amended Complaint).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The defendants include the officer who shot Plaintiff, Daniel Aguirre; Aguirre's partner, Richard Haluska; the City itself; its Chief of Police, A.C. Roper; and numerous other City police officers and officials (collectively \"Defendants\"). The cause now comes to be heard on three pending motions: (1) Defendants' objections to Plaintiff's notice of intent to serve subpoenas and motion to quash such subpoenas, if issued (Doc. 58); (2) Plaintiff's motion to modify the Rule 16(b) scheduling order by extending discovery and other deadlines by 120 days (Doc. 60); and (3) Plaintiff's motion for an extension of time to file rebuttal experts by at least 60 days. (Doc. 66). Upon consideration, the court concludes that Defendants' objections to the subpoenas are meritorious in part and that the scope of the subpoenas' requests is due to be modified. The court will deny Plaintiff's motion to extend all discovery generally by 120 days. However, the court will order that discovery be reopened for a total of 75 days for the limited purpose of allowing rebuttal expert discovery into alleged alterations or enhancements of video recordings that Defendants have proposed to offer at trial or to use as a basis for opinions by their experts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Rule 45 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes a court to issue a subpoena at the request of a party to require a non-party to produce for inspection and copying designated documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things in the possession, custody, or control of the non-party. The scope of permissible discovery with respect to a Rule 45 subpoena is that which is set forth in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1), which provides that \"Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party's claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case....\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Greater Birmingham Ministries v.

July 7, 2017). On timely motion, the court has the authority under Rule 45 to quash or modify a subpoena \"that requires disclosure of privileged or other protected matter, if no exception or waiver applies. Rule 45(d)(3)(A)(iii), Fed. R. Civ. P. Further, under Rule 26(c), a party may move for a protective order that forbids inquiry or that limits the scope of discovery as to certain matters. Rule 26(c)(1)(D), Fed. R. Civ. P.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 21, 2017, Plaintiff served a notice of his intent to serve respective Rule 45 subpoenas on two non-party Fraternal Order of Police (\"FOP\") organizations: the Alabama State FOP and the Birmingham FOP Lodge 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 58, 58-1, 58-2). Each subpoena instructs its recipient to produce the same things, to wit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   1. Produce copies of all documents relating to each incidence wherein an FOP attorney and/or representative has appeared at a crime scene, Internal Affairs interview, personnel hearing, disciplinary\n   hearing for any City of Birmingham police officer during the ten year period prior to April 24, 2014 [the date Williams was shot].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   2. Produce documents reflecting the name, referral, and assignment of any attorney retained by the FOP on behalf of Officers Aguirre and/or Haluska relating to the police shooting of Aubrey Williams on April 24, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   3. Produce any and all surveys, audits, data, and/or reports in your possession relating to the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   a. incidents wherein any Birmingham Police Officer arrested any suspect on misdemeanor or felony charges wherein the police officer claimed to be the victim of the crime charged (i.e., assault, menacing, resisting arrest, attempted murder, etc.); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   b. incidents wherein Birmingham police officers were alleged to have falsely arrested, charged, or documented actions by suspects during the ten year period prior to April 24, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 58-1, 58-2). Defendants have objected to the issuance of both subpoenas and have moved to quash them, if issued, on several grounds. (Doc. 58). Plaintiff has filed an opposition (Doc. 64), to which Defendants have replied. (Doc. 65). The parties' arguments on the motion are addressed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants first argue that the subpoenas' requests for FOP documentation on prior incidents involving the City's police officers are \"overly broad in time and scope\" (Doc. 65 at 3). Defendants do not dispute that, as a general proposition, knowledge attributable to the City with respect to similar incidents of misconduct may be relevant to Plaintiff's \u00a7 1983 claims alleging a failure to train and a failure to supervise, which are asserted in Count Seven of the Amended Complaint. That is so because to hold a municipality liable under \u00a7 1983 for a failure to train or supervise its employees, such failure must rise to the level of \"deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the [untrained employees] come into contact.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Canton, Ohio v.

Defendants emphasize, however, citing\n   <em>\n    Mercado v. City of Orlando\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8975067\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/407/1152/\">\n    407 F.3d 1152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2005), that such incidents, to be relevant, must evidence employee misconduct arising out of facts that are \"substantially similar to the case at hand.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8975067\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/407/1152/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8975067\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/407/1152/\">\n    at 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants further contend, relying on\n   <em>\n    Brooks v. Scheib\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1689656\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/813/1191/#p1193\">\n    813 F.2d 1191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1193 (11th Cir. 1987), that for incident complaints to establish knowledge of a need for further training on the part of the City, Plaintiff must also show that such complaints were, in fact, valid. Defendants thus suggest that while Plaintiff might properly \"request complaints involving the use of excessive force via shootings, which were sustained, against Officer Aguirre,\" Defendants argue that Plaintiff's subpoenas\n   to the FOPs instead \"request broad, irrelevant categories of documents.\" (Doc. 58 at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Answering Defendants' relevancy objection on the merits\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   , Plaintiff insists that all his subpoena requests for documentation on prior incidents are within the scope of discovery permitted under Rule 26(b)(1). (Doc. 64 at 2-5). He argues that Defendants' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Mercado\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   is misplaced because those decisions address whether a plaintiff had presented sufficient admissible evidence of prior similar incidents to create a disputed issue of fact at summary judgment with respect to a local government's awareness of a need for further training, not whether or to what extent the plaintiff was entitled to conduct discovery into prior incidents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). Plaintiff also seems to take the position that prior incidents and complaints are relevant to the City's knowledge so long as they implicate the use of \"excessive force\" by the City's police of any sort, whether or not they involved a shooting. In support, he identifies six opinions from this court holding that plaintiffs had presented sufficient evidence at summary judgment to indicate that City police officers had applied unconstitutionally excessive force through various different means.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nevels v.

Ala. 2012) (shooting). \"All in all,\" Plaintiff concludes, \"[the] requests to the FOP[s] are narrowly tailored, the relevancy of the requested materials is high, and the question of admissibility can be resolved on a later day.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As a threshold matter, the court would recognize that Plaintiff's subpoenas are not at all limited to seeking information on incidents that are even arguably \"similar\" under any commonly-understood definition of that word. Plaintiff says that his subpoena requests are \"narrowly tailored\" to obtain materials \"the relevancy of [which] is high.\" (Doc. 64 at 4). To be\n   frank, however, that characterization could hardly be less apt. In particular, the initial request of each subpoena asks the target FOP to produce \"all documents relating to each incidence wherein [an FOP] attorney and/or representative has appeared at a crime scene, Internal Affairs interview, personnel hearing, disciplinary hearing for any City of Birmingham police officer during the ten year period prior to April 24, 2014.\" (Doc. 58-1 at 5; Doc. 58-2 at 5). On its face, that request might encompass all documentation for every incident in which any FOP attorney or representative was involved in any material capacity with any City police officer, in connection with any allegation of misconduct regardless of its nature or severity. Thus, as Defendants submit, the request would comfortably encompass documents on charges of malfeasance by officers as far afield from Plaintiff's claims as illegal drug use, domestic violence, and sexual harassment to insubordination and working unauthorized overtime. Plaintiff offers no explanation or authority supporting why he might be entitled to discovery approaching that breadth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Likewise, another one of Plaintiff's subpoena requests asks for FOP documentation on all \"incidents\" in which \"any [City] Police Officer arrested any suspect on misdemeanor or felony charges wherein the police officer claimed to be the victim of the crime charged,\" as for \"assault, menacing, resisting arrest, attempted murder, etc.\" (Doc. 58-1 at 5; Doc. 58-2 at 5). That request also goes far beyond the scope of Plaintiff's claims and seeks irrelevant information. A prior incident may be relevant to a municipality's knowledge of the need for further training and supervision only insofar as the incident gave rise to a similar constitutional violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weiland v. Palm Beach Cty. Sheriff's Office\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054943\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/1313/\">\n    792 F.3d 1313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1328 n. 21 (11th Cir. 2015) (allegations that there had been \"thousands of contacts\" between sheriff's deputies and mentally ill people and \"numerous police shootings\" of the mentally ill in the jurisdiction could not give rise to knowledge that existing training was inadequate absent further allegations that such shootings gave rise to \"similar constitutional violations\");\n   <em>\n    Whitaker v. Miami-Dade Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6826288\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/126/1313/#p1324\">\n    126 F.Supp.3d 1313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1324 (S.D. Fla. 2015) (allegations that there had been four prior police shooting incidents over a year period did not support that the defendant county was on notice that its existing training was inadequate, insofar as the plaintiffs had not alleged \"that these shootings were deemed unjustified, unconstitutional, or were anything other than legitimate, self-defense shootings.\"). However, the fact that an officer made an arrest based on a claim that he was himself the target of threatened or actual physical force or resistance has no tendency at all to suggest wrongdoing by the officer, never mind the existence of a constitutional violation. Thus, a broad request for all such \"incidents\" is improper.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Joseph v. Las Vegas Metro. Police Dep't\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%205136010\">\n    2010 WL 5136010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (D. Nev. Dec. 10, 2010) (disallowing discovery into \"any and all shootings\" by all department officers on the ground that it \"far exceed[ed] the scope\" of the plaintiff's claims alleging racial profiling and excessive force and \"would necessarily include information about wholly unrelated matters, such as accidental shootings\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Based on the above, the court concludes that it is necessary to modify the scope of the subpoenas to the extent they seek documentation in each FOP's possession on prior incidents and complaints against\n   City police officers. The question is how to modify the subpoenas and to what extent. At the outset, the court agrees with Defendants that, under\n   <em>\n    Mercado\n   </em>\n   , for other incidents and complaints to be relevant in the context of municipal liability under \u00a7 1983 for a failure to train or supervise, they must involve \"factual situations that are substantially similar to the case at hand.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8975067\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/407/1152/\">\n    407 F.3d at 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff is correct that the Eleventh Circuit's discussion of similar incidents in\n   <em>\n    Mercado\n   </em>\n   addressed whether the record contained sufficient evidence to create an issue of fact at summary judgment with respect to the municipality's knowledge of the need for additional training.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8975067\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/407/1152/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As such, that case does not purport to delineate the scope of evidence of prior incidents that is even admissible at trial, never mind subject to pretrial discovery, which might at least in theory be somewhat broader.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 26(b)(1), Fed. R. Civ. P. (\"[I]nformation ... need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable.\"). Nonetheless,\n   <em>\n    Mercado\n   </em>\n   is instructive on the scope of discovery because the decision bears on the nature of prior incidents that allow a plaintiff to establish an awareness of a need for more training, thereby suggesting what evidence of prior incidents is, in fact, relevant to the Plaintiff's claims. Plaintiff says that \"question[s] of admissibility can be resolved on a later day.\" (Doc. 64 at 4). Ultimately, however, he fails to explain and the court does not otherwise discern why evidence of prior incidents that are not at least arguably similar to Plaintiff's case would be relevant for purposes of either trial or discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barrett v. City of New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3826416\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/237/39/#p40\">\n    237 F.R.D. 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 40 (E.D.N.Y. 2006) (holding in civil rights suit alleging false arrest, illegal strip search, and fabricated evidence that complaints concerning defendant police officers submitted to civilian review board containing allegations of excessive force or \"discourtesy\" of officers only were \"wholly unrelated\" to the plaintiff's claims and thus not subject to discovery).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The parties also have quite different ideas about what prior incidents might qualify as \"similar\" enough to be relevant and discoverable, although the court does not find either side's conception to be entirely correct. In particular, with regard to Plaintiff's \u00a7 1983 training and supervision claims associated with his being shot, Defendants suggest a very narrow approach that would treat prior incidents as relevant and discoverable only if they involved a complaint of unconstitutionally excessive force arising out of a shooting by the same officer who shot Plaintiff,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Aguirre. By contrast, Plaintiff seems to assume in his brief that discovery is proper as to prior incidents involving any allegation of excessive force, regardless of the means or instrumentality employed (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , use of a firearm, Taser, night stick, pepper spray, handcuffs, choke-hold, punch, etc.). Plaintiff also says he is entitled to discovery into such incidents involving\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   City police officers, not just Aguirre. As explained below, the court agrees with Defendants that information on prior incidents is discoverable only where there is an allegation that an officer-involved\n   <em>\n    shooting\n   </em>\n   violated a citizen's constitutional rights, but the court sides with Plaintiff on the issue of whether such incidents are relevant if they involved City police officers\n   <em>\n    other than\n   </em>\n   Aguirre or any other individual officer named as a defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Supreme Court has recognized that \"the identified deficiency in a city's training program must be closely related to the ultimate injury.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Canton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p388\">\n    489 U.S. at 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p388\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Without notice that a course of training is\n   deficient\n   <em>\n    in a particular respect\n   </em>\n   , decisionmakers can hardly be said to have deliberately chosen a training program that will cause violations of constitutional rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Connick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5958866,12457892\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/51/\">\n    563 U.S. at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5958866,12457892\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/51/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Taking the latter argument first, the court finds that it does not entitle Defendants to any relief.

However, aside from their objection to the subpoenas' requests for documents identifying any attorney that the FOP may have\n   assigned or referred to Officer Aguirre or Haluska, a matter discussed below, Defendants do not identify what species of privilege is supposedly applicable, nor do they offer any detailed argument or citation to authority. Accordingly, the court finds that Defendants' generalized objections based on \"privilege\" and \"confidentiality\" are due to be rejected as insufficient as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendants do specifically identify the attorney-client privilege as protecting from disclosure documents showing the \"name, referral, and assignment\" of any attorney retained by the FOP to represent Aguirre or Haluska in relation to the incident involving Plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 58 at 5-6; Doc. 65 at 3-4). However, Defendants again cite no authority to support that claim of privilege. Indeed, the \"great weight of authority ... refuses to extend the attorney-client privilege to the fact of consultation or employment, including the component facts of the identity of the client and the lawyer.\"\n   <em>\n    Howell v.

Indeed, it is not apparent to the court how the identity of legal counsel that either FOP entity might have assigned or referred is particularly relevant, and Plaintiff has offered no explanation. As Defendants suggest, private communications between Aguirre, Haluka, and attorneys with whom they might have consulted about the case after having been referred by either of the FOPs would generally be protected by the attorney-client privilege.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 60, 66). Because those motions are intimately related, the court addresses them together in this section. In his first motion, filed on October 6, 2017, Plaintiff asks the court to extend the respective deadlines to complete discovery (October 13, 2017), to file dispositive motions (November 13, 2017), and for subsequent trial-related matters, all by 120 days. (Doc. 60). In his second motion, filed October 29, 2017, he asks for an extension of the deadline to submit rebuttal expert reports by at least 60 days. (Doc. 66;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Docs. 70, 72). Both motions are opposed by Defendants. (Docs. 62, 67, 71).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In a related vein, while these motions by Plaintiffs were pending, and with the then-existing dispositive motion deadline looming, Defendants filed their own motion for an extension of that same deadline. (Doc. 68). In particular, Defendants asked that the court, if it were to deny Plaintiff's requested extensions of discovery, extend the dispositive motion deadline to two weeks after the date that the court denied Plaintiffs' motions to extend. On the other hand, Defendants asked that, if the court were to grant an extension of discovery upon Plaintiff's motion, the dispositive motion deadline likewise be reset to 30 days past the new-established close of discovery. That motion by Defendants was unopposed, and the court has granted it. (Doc. 69).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Turning back to Plaintiff's motions, he initially asked for an extension of unexpired deadlines generally by 120 days, including those governing the close of discovery and the filing of dispositive motions, on three grounds. First, Plaintiff asserts he needs additional time to conduct discovery in light of an audiotape he described as \"recently obtained\" and as \"present[ing] strong indications of a conspiracy to cover up the false arrest and malicious prosecution in this case.\" (Doc. 60, \u00b6 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 66 at 3 (wherein Plaintiff asserts that the audio recording \"proves almost unequivocally that there has been a malicious prosecution\") ). Second, Plaintiff contends he needs additional time to follow up on\n   supplemental disclosures served by the City on September 29, 2017, which contained 242 documents not previously disclosed or produced. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5). Plaintiff states that \"[t]he majority\" of these documents \"consist of the City's rules, regulations, directives and policies relating to the use of force, officer training, fire arms training, etc.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 n. 5). And third, Plaintiff invokes his outstanding subpoenas to the FOPs that were addressed previously in this order, which Plaintiff offers will necessitate additional discovery as well. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendants filed a \"Response in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion to Modify the Scheduling Order.\" (Doc. 62). Defendants first broadly argue that any and all further discovery Plaintiff might wish to pursue has been rendered \"irrelevant\" because, Defendants sweepingly insist, \"this action should be dismissed with prejudice.\" (Id. at 2). In support, Defendants point to a new, \"slow motion version\" of the police dashcam video recording that captured the shooting incident underlying Plaintiff's claims. Defendants suggest that new version, was generated with the \"benefit of expert video analysis technology\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) by one of their experts, Barry Dickey, who Defendants disclosed, along with the video, on September 29, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants say that Dickey \"slowed down the video and enhanced the clarity of the images\" (Doc. 67 at 3, \u00b6 3) such that it now \"clearly shows that Plaintiff pointed a gun at ...Officer Aguirre\" immediately before Aguirre shot Plaintiff. (Doc. 62 at 2). Defendants maintain that the new version of the video thus vindicates Aguirre and exposes Plaintiff as a perjurer who is due to face renewed charges for attempted murder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants further offer that \"yet another reason that Plaintiff's claims should be dismissed with prejudice\" is that only the district attorney, not Defendants, had the legal authority to file the criminal charges against Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants thus say that, because they were not responsible for prosecuting Plaintiff, he cannot maintain his claims for malicious prosecution or false arrest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants then focus more narrowly by arguing that none of the items cited by Plaintiff's motion, namely, (1) the audiotape, (2) the newly-produced documents in the City's supplemental disclosure, nor (3) the FOP subpoenas, justifies an extension of discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiff responded with a consolidated filing that includes both (a) a reply in support of his first motion to extend deadlines by 120 days and (b) a second motion to modify the scheduling order, specifically to \"extend the rebuttal expert deadline by 60 or more days.\" (Doc. 66 at 1). The essence of that filing is an attack on Dickey's new version of the dashcam video recording. Plaintiff decries it as a fake, ginned up version created via the use of \"photo-shop type\" software to alter the original video in which, Plaintiff says, no gun can be seen in his hand. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). Plaintiff further states that Defendants have thus far denied his requests to produce, prior to any deposition of Dickey, the \"native format\" of both the original recording that Dickey received and the \"modified or enhanced files\" he received or created, as well as the name and version of the software he used in his analysis. Plaintiff therefore asks the court to extend the time\n   for expert discovery by at \"least an additional 60 days\" to allow him to name a rebuttal expert, produce a report, depose Dickey, and otherwise investigate the bona fides of the video. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendants oppose Plaintiff's motion to extend the rebuttal expert deadline. (Doc. 67). Indeed, Defendants first argue that Plaintiff's motion is due to be denied because, Defendants emphasize, the court's scheduling order includes no provision for rebuttal experts at all, so there really is no \"rebuttal expert deadline\" to \"extend.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1). Defendants further contend that Plaintiff will not suffer unfair prejudice if he is denied an opportunity to employ a rebuttal expert both because (1) Plaintiff could have hired his own expert initially concerning the enhancement of the original video but chose not to do so and (2) Plaintiff had an opportunity to depose Dickey to cross-examine him about how he made the enhanced video. Pushing back against Plaintiff's attacks on the reliability and genuineness of Dickey's video itself, Defendants characterize it is merely the original dashcam video \"only slowed down and focused.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6). Furthermore, Defendants insist that, contrary to Plaintiff's assertion, the original \"unenhanced\" video also does, in fact, show Plaintiff holding a gun in his right hand. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiff replied with a \"supplement\" to his motion to extend the rebuttal expert deadline. (Doc. 70). There Plaintiff claims that another of Defendants' experts, Ronald Kiker, slated to give opinions on police practices, testified at his then-recent deposition that he too had \"altered\" the original dashcam video and that he planned to testify that his altered video shows a gun in Plaintiff's hand. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1). As such, Plaintiff argues, he now needs an opportunity to have one or more rebuttal experts address the opinions of both Dickey and Kiker with respect to their respective alterations of the original video. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). Defendants, however, deny that Kiker testified to having made \"any enhancements/alterations\" to the original video. (Doc. 71). Rather, Defendants quote Kiker's deposition testimony in which he recites that he used a software program called \"VideoCleaner\" to view the video frame-by-frame but that he \"didn't attempt any enhancements.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). To that Plaintiff replies that, even if Kiker did not \"enhance\" the original video, his deposition testimony supports that he nonetheless \"altered\" it, if only by using a software program to \"convert\" the original video from \"NP4\" format into \"AVI\" format, which he then viewed through VideoCleaner. (Doc. 72 at 1-2). More importantly, Plaintiff argues, even if Kiker testified he did not perform any enhancements or alterations, Plaintiff \"does not have to take his word for it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). Rather, Plaintiff says, he is entitled to conduct discovery on what Kiker did to the video, even if perhaps unknowingly, and a rebuttal expert is needed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Under Rule 16(b), Fed.

That is so whether Defendants' argument relies on the \"original\" recording, Dickey's \"enhanced\" or \"focused\" slow motion version, or any other. In short, Defendants here effectively seek entry of summary judgment in their favor on all claims, based solely on the video. However, Defendants have not filed anything that even resembles a formal motion under Rule 56, Fed. R. Civ. P.; that at all acknowledges the legal standards applicable to such a motion; or applies those standards to each of the particular claims in the Amended Complaint. Rather, Defendants' arguments urging dismissal based on the video are all presented in the guise of merely opposing Plaintiff's motions for a modification of the scheduling order. As such, without considering the merits of the parties' underlying arguments about the video, it suffices to say that the court simply declines, in its discretion, to treat Defendants' opposition filings as tantamount to a motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The court also will not deny Plaintiff's motions to extend deadlines based on Defendants' contention that \"Plaintiff's claims should be dismissed with prejudice\" because it is the district attorney, a non-party, rather than any of the Defendants, who has the legal authority to determine whether to prosecute Plaintiff on a criminal charge. (Doc. 62 at 2). This argument also suffers from the same basic flaw as the one just considered. That is, Defendants are, as a practical matter, asking the court to grant summary judgment or a dismissal for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. P., as to some or all of Plaintiff's claims without either type of motion ever having been filed by Defendants. Rather, Defendants have, again, made this argument only in an opposition to a motion for relief filed by Plaintiff, with no acknowledgment or analysis by Defendants of any applicable legal standards, nor any citation to authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The court next considers Plaintiff's initial claim that he is entitled to an extension of deadlines by 120 days to conduct additional discovery to follow up on three specific items, to wit: (1) an audiotape recording that Plaintiff says confirms the validity of his claim for malicious prosecution; (2) documents included in the City's supplemental disclosure on September 29, 2017; and (3) the FOP subpoenas previously discussed. Defendants oppose any extension based on any of these items. They are considered in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   First, Plaintiff asserts he needs additional time to conduct discovery in light of an audiotape he describes as \"recently obtained\" and as \"present[ing] strong indications of a conspiracy to cover up the false arrest and malicious prosecution in this case.\" (Doc. 60, \u00b6 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 66 at 3 (wherein Plaintiff asserts that the audio recording \"proves almost unequivocally that there has been a malicious prosecution\"). Defendants respond that Plaintiff's counsel had the audiotape recording in\n   their possession by no later than early August 2017, as evidenced by a motion they filed concerning it on August 9, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 37). Therefore, Defendants point out, Plaintiff had more than two months between then and the close of discovery on October 13, 2017, to conduct additional investigation and discovery regarding the recording. Plaintiff, however, has not specifically identified what additional discovery he might intend to perform with regard to the audiotape or why he could not have done it by the close of discovery established by the Rule 16(b) order. The court agrees with Defendants, therefore, that Plaintiff has not shown that he could not meet the discovery deadline in the exercise of due diligence as it relates to the audiotape recording.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Second, Plaintiff claims he is entitled to additional discovery time to follow up on supplemental disclosures served by the City on September 29, 2017, which contained 242 documents not previously disclosed or produced. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5). Plaintiff states that \"[t]he majority\" of these documents \"consist of the City's rules, regulations, directives and policies relating to the use of force, officer training, fire arms training, etc.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 n. 5). Again, however, Plaintiff has not identified any particular additional discovery that he proposes to conduct with respect to these documents. Moreover, while Plaintiff laments that the City produced these documents only two weeks before the close of discovery on October 13, 2017, Plaintiff does not claim that the City was actually due to produce them any earlier, including because they fell within a request for production served on City. Rather, Defendants produced the documents as part of a supplemental disclosure only because they were reviewed by their experts. Again, the court finds that Plaintiff has not exhibited sufficient diligence to warrant an extension of discovery based on the need to further investigate these documents. That is so in no small part because Defendants have asserted, and Plaintiff has not specifically disputed, that Plaintiff failed to request the City's relevant police policies and procedures in the almost one year provided for discovery in this action. It is simply unclear to the court why, given the nature of the documents as Plaintiff himself describes them and the nature of Plaintiff's claims seeking to impose municipal liability, Plaintiff did not long ago, indeed, near the outset of the case, serve requests for production encompassing such documents under Rule 34, Fed. R. Civ. P.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Similar concerns lead the court to find that Plaintiff also is not entitled to extended discovery to follow up any documents returned in response to the FOP subpoenas. Plaintiff did not serve his notices of intent to serve those subpoenas until September 21, 2017, approximately three weeks before the close of discovery. As Defendants argue, however, those subpoenas are related principally to establishing Plaintiff's claims of municipal liability against the City based on an alleged custom or policy that causes its police officers to employ excessive force or make false arrests, claims and issues that have been in this case from the very beginning. As such, there is no reason why Plaintiff could not have sought to serve the FOP subpoenas within the time limit for discovery set by the scheduling order in the exercise of due diligence. Plaintiff's original motion to extend discovery generally and all other deadlines by 120 days is due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The final matter to be considered by the court is Plaintiff's motion \"to extend\n   the rebuttal expert deadline by 60 or more days.\" (Doc. 66 at 1). To be clear, it undisputed that the court's Rule 16(b) order (Doc. 30), which is based on the report of parties' planning meeting (Doc. 28), makes no provision for rebuttal expert disclosures by any party. Defendants argue that such omission implies that Plaintiff's motion is due to be summarily denied. Not so says Plaintiff, pointing to Rule 26(a)(2)(D), Fed. R. Civ. P., which provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   (D) Time to Disclose Expert Testimony. A party must make these disclosures at the times and in the sequence that the court orders. Absent a stipulation or a court order, the disclosures must be made:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   (ii) if the evidence is intended solely to contradict or rebut evidence on the same subject matter identified by another party under Rule 26(a)(2)(B) [governing experts who must provide a written report] or (C) [governing experts who need not provide a formal report], within 30 days after the other party's disclosure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiff interprets the above to establish a \"default rule\" whereby rebuttal expert disclosures are due within 30 days after the expert disclosure made by the opposing expert whose opinion is to be rebutted. Defendants reject that reading, highlighting that Rule 26(a)(2)(D) expressly states that it is effective \"absent a stipulation or court order.\" According to Defendants, the fact that the court's Rule 16(b) order in this case contains no provision for rebuttal expert disclosures trumps any provision for a 30-day rebuttal expert disclosure deadline in Rule 26(a)(2)(D). Neither side supplies the court with any caselaw in support of its interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Ultimately, the court concludes that it need not decide whether Rule 26(a)(2)(D)(ii) technically applies. That is so because the court generally agrees with Plaintiff that, under the particular circumstances of this case, good cause exists to modify the scheduling order under Rule 16(b)(4). In particular, the court finds good cause to allow Plaintiff to conduct rebuttal expert discovery with respect to any \"enhancement\" or \"alteration\" of the \"original\" dashcam video recording that has found its way into the version of the videos that Defendants' experts, Dickey and Kiker, intend to use as the basis of opinions to be given at trial. The dashcam video of the subject incident is obviously one of the most important pieces, if not the singular most important piece, of evidence in this case. And for all of Defendants' insistence that the original version of the recording shows Plaintiff holding a gun, it would seem that it is, at the very least, not unambiguously so. If it were so clear, why did Defendants feel the need to hire an expert, Dickey, who Defendants seem to acknowledge has done\n   <em>\n    something\n   </em>\n   to \"enhance\" or \"alter\" the video in a way that makes it more likely for those watching it to believe they see Plaintiff holding a gun? There is also, of course, the matter of the district attorney's office, despite having the original video, ultimately deciding to drop the attempted murder charges that had been pending against Plaintiff for over a year based on the incident. Thus, exactly what changes were made to the recording and how they were done is paramount. Fairness dictates that Plaintiff be given a reasonable opportunity to investigate those matters, including through the use of his own expert to rebut opinion testimony by Defendants' experts reached after considering enhanced or altered video images.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The court is not swayed from that determination by Defendants' arguments that Plaintiff would not suffer unfair prejudice\n   if he were denied a rebuttal expert. Defendants first say that Plaintiff could have hired his own expert initially concerning the enhancement of the video but chose not to. However, the issue, to the court's mind, is not whether Plaintiff could have or should have hired his own expert to do his\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   enhancement of the video. Indeed, it appears even now that Plaintiff is content to rely on the original version of the video to establish his claims. That is, the court does not understand Plaintiff to be asking for a chance to have his own expert create a competing enhanced video that would shows more clearly that Plaintiff was not holding a gun. Rather, Plaintiff is asking for an opportunity to use a rebuttal expert to discredit the accuracy and reliability of any altered videos that Defendants' experts propose to use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Defendants also contend that Plaintiff would not suffer unfair prejudice because he would have had an opportunity to depose Dickey to cross-examine him about how he made the enhanced video. However, there are at least two flaws with this argument. One, it would appear that Dickey's report does not include information on the name and version of software he used to enhance the video and exactly how he did so. That information would seem to be critical to understanding the basis of any opinions he reached based on such video as well as necessary for meaningful cross-examination on the issue. Defendants seem to acknowledge, however, that they also unwilling to grant Plaintiff's request for that information in advance of Dickey's deposition. And two, given that the video evidence and any enhancements or alterations are of the utmost importance, the court finds it appropriate for Plaintiff to have a chance to present his own affirmative evidence rebutting the testimony of Defendants' experts, not merely try to poke defensive holes in that testimony through cross-examination alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The court will therefore grant Plaintiff's motion to modify the scheduling order with respect to rebuttal experts as follows: Plaintiff shall have until May 4, 2018, to serve any rebuttal expert report(s) relating to any enhancements or alterations to the dashcam video recording that Defendants intend to offer at trial or are considered by Defendants' experts. The parties shall then have an additional 45 days to complete any associated expert depositions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the court hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERS\n   </strong>\n   as follows: Defendants' objection to the Plaintiff's FOP subpoenas and motion to quash (Doc. 58) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   ; Defendants subpoenas are modified to allow discovery of documents related to prior incidents, occurring up to five years prior to April 24, 2014, involving (1) the discharge of a firearm by any City police officer against a citizen accompanied by a complaint or allegation of unconstitutionally excessive force; (2) allegations that a City police officer violated the Fourth Amendment rights of a pedestrian by conducting a stop without reasonable suspicion or by making an arrest without probable cause; and (3)an allegation of that any City police officer deliberately fabricated inculpatory testimony or evidence or deliberately destroyed or concealed exculpatory evidence and thereby caused a citizen to be arrested, imprisoned, and/or prosecuted.
