Hood, Senior U.S. District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   While most people were busy celebrating the 2016 New Year, police in Lexington were investigating a homicide. The first shooting victim of the year had arrived at University of Kentucky Chandler Hospital on January 1. And before the sun\n   set on that first day of the year, UK Police learned from Lexington Police that someone connected to the shooting-be it another victim, a suspect, or a witness-could show up at Chandler. So Lexington police asked UK officers to give them the heads up if anything of interest occurred at the hospital. And in the wee morning hours of January 2, 2016, Darrell Leath walked through the door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Leath, it turned out, was kin to the victim. He told police as much, and he begged them to let him see his cousin. But police couldn't do so-after all, it was against hospital policy, and at the time, officers did not know who Leath was. This didn't sit well with Leath. He grew angry and belligerent; police had to ask him to leave. Leath complied, albeit reluctantly and not without protest. And as Leath slowly exited UK property, police decided they had grounds to arrest him. So they put Leath in handcuffs and charged him with several misdemeanors. What transpired over the next few hours resulted in felony charges, another trip to the hospital, a trial, a conviction on some charges, acquittal on others, and now this civil-rights lawsuit. Leath claims officers and nurses (1) violated his right to refuse medical treatment, (2) fabricated charges against him, (3) used excessive force, and (4) retaliated against him. Defendants deny Leath's allegations and argue they enjoy qualified immunity. So they filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. [DE 37]. Leath responded [DE 41] and Defendants replied [DE 45], making this matter ripe for review. For the reasons stated herein, Defendants' Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    a. UK Chandler Hospital\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Darrell Leath and his father arrived in the lobby of Chandler early on January 2, 2016 hoping to see a family member. [DE 37-13, McConnell Body Camera Video]. Officer Joshua McConnell was also at Chandler as part of his duties as a UK Police officer. [DE 37-9, Dep. of Josh McConnell, pp. 18-20]. That night, Lexington Police asked UKPD to notify them if anyone came into Chandler with information about the recent homicide. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When Leath walked in and started discussing the shooting, McConnell did not know Leath's relationship with the victim. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 20]. So McConnell notified dispatch. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. When he informed Leath that no one could go back to see the victim, Leath was not happy. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; DE 37-13; DE 37-14, McConnell Body Camera Video]. By that point, backup had arrived. [DE 37-9, p. 21]. Officers Randall Webb, David Duncan, and Emily Faulkner joined McConnell and warned Leath that if he didn't \"calm down here, we are going to ask you to leave.\" [DE 37-13]. They informed Leath that they had no information, and would try to work with him, but if \"you do not lower your voice, you are going to leave or it is criminal trespassing.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Leath never did calm down. He remained agitated and upset, prompting police to ask Leath to leave. [DE 37-14]. As he walked out, police followed close behind to ensure that Leath did not linger. All the while, Leath yelled profanities and threats including telling his father \"if you touch me, I'm stomping you.\" [DE 37-14]. He also yelled that he \"wish[ed] a motherfucker would touch me.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3:16; DE 37-15, McConnell Body Camera Video at 3:03]. After a few minutes, police suspected Leath or his father intended to drive. [DE 37-2, p. 6]. Because both men appeared intoxicated, police intervened. One officer can be heard on body camera video saying \"if you want a DUI, there it is.\" [DE 37-15 at 5:07].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   That is when police decided to make an arrest. [DE 37-16, McConnell Body Camera\n   Video at 0:23]. Leath complied but continued to shout profanities and made threats regarding a lawsuit. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 0:42]. Police informed Leath that they were arresting him for alcohol intoxication and disorderly conduct. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Leath's father admitted that Leath was driving and the two had been drinking. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:00, 5:25]. With Leath in handcuffs, officers Faulkner and Webb began a routine pat-down. [DE 37-17, Duncan Body Camera Video at 2:02]. When officers told Leath to take his boots off, he refused: \"I ain't taking off a motherfucking thing ... The fuck you mean? You strip search me, you better have a warrant.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   at 2:08]. The profanities and threats continued as Faulkner executed the pat-down. At that point, Officer Webb grabbed Leath around the mouth and throat area and twice said \"look at her again like that.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:14].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Police then took Leath to the transport wagon. [DE 37-2, p. 6]. Officers claim Leath began resisting and pulled away, causing Officer Webb, who was holding Leath's arm, to feel a pop in his right shoulder and severe pain. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; DE 37-6, Dep. of Randall Webb p. 22]. Webb reported his \"whole left arm when numb and tingly\" to the point that he could not move it. [DE 37-6, p. 22]. Officers then placed Leath in the transport wagon and took him to Fayette County Detention Center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Fayette County Detention Center\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When Leath arrived at the detention center, staff nurse Sarah Rideau attempted to evaluate him. [DE 37-18, Aff. of Sarah Rideau p. 2; DE 37-2, p. 7]. Her duties required her to observe new inmates to determine whether they were medically stable enough to be admitted. [DE 37-18, p. 1]. Rideau claimed Leath was \"agitated, non-compliant, and seemed very disoriented.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2, \u00b6 5]. Rideau also noticed Leath had large pupils and froth coming from his mouth. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2]. Taken together, Leath's appearance and behavior suggested to Rideau that Leath was either under the influence of dangerous narcotics or suffering from a serious medical condition. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Rideau attempted to take Leath's vital signs to rule these out, but he refused to comply. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. So Rideau refused to admit Leath to the jail-FCDC could not accommodate any serious medical condition or narcotics that could put Leath and others in danger. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Officers faced a difficult situation: They had an arrestee, facing multiple charges, and nowhere to put him. Police asked Leath to let the jail staff take his vital signs. [DE 37-21, McConnell Body Camera Video at 1:10]. But he still refused. So police decided to transport Leath to Good Samaritan Hospital; a doctor there could take Leath's vital signs. While officers and Leath waited to leave, Leath continued his barrage of threats, \"I'm suing the shit out of y'all\" [DE 37-19, McConnell Body Camera Video at 6:19], and he challenged officers to \"take these cuffs off and see if you tough.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:40]. Leath even tried to bargain with officers: \"I can save your job now. Just let me go. Say it's a misunderstanding.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:21]. Finally, Leath indicated to police that he had a criminal history, telling police to Google him to see his rap sheet. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16:33].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Shortly after 4:00 a.m., Leath and officers climbed into the medical transport and headed to Good Samaritan Hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Good Samaritan Hospital\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Upon arrival at Good Samaritan, Leath again told officers he did not consent to giving his vital signs. Police told him at least four times to \"sit still\" and when Leath began resisting officers pleaded with Leath, \"you're going to get hurt, man, stop.\" [DE 37-20, Duncan Body Camera Video at 12:38]. As he had previously, Leath responded with profanity: \"fuck you\n   man; I'm going to sue the fuck out of you.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:54]. A nurse attempted to take Leath's blood pressure, but Leath continued to resist and he told police he would \"kick you in your motherfucking face.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:10]. Police warned Leath that if he kicked an officer \"you will be charged with assault.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   at 13:48].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   But Leath did not cooperate. Police put Leath on the ground so medical officials could take his vital signs, and Leath began thrashing. Officers placed a pillow under Leath's head and told him to stop fighting. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14:22; DE 37-23, McConnell Body Camera Video at 2:34]. During the commotion, Officer Duncan yelled that Leath bit him, and Leath repeatedly tells police to \"break my neck.\" [DE 37-20 at 14:37, 15:19]. He also told police he was \"ready to act a fool up in this motherfucker.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15:06], and that he wanted police \"to hurt me ... so I get paid.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16:22]. A nurse took Leath's vital signs using a finger clip for a pulse, an arm cuff for blood pressure, and a head-swipe thermometer. No blood was drawn. No drugs were used. No operation performed. The process lasted only a few minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Once the nurse had obtained Leath's vital signs, Leath noticed his boot came off and told police \"put my motherfucking shit on before I kick you.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16:34; DE 37-23 at 4:15]. Police told Leath he was \"going shoeless to jail\" because he had kicked people. [DE 37-23 at 5:43]. Leath was then cleared to go to jail. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:55].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Return to Fayette County Detention Center\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Back at FCDC, Leath remained upset. He told officers that he was going to \"find you\" and mouthed that he was going to \"shoot you in the face\" to officers. [DE 37-25, McConnell Body Camera Video at 2:11]. Officers then discussed the situation with jail personnel who reiterated that they were not permitted to take Leath into custody without vital signs. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:19]. But since vitals had been obtained, Leath was admitted and officials kept close observation on him based on concerns for his safety. [DE 37-18, p. 3].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    e. Criminal Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In addition to the prior misdemeanor charges, police added three felony assault counts against Leath for (1) pulling away from Officer Webb, (2) biting Officer Duncan, and (3) kicking officers at Good Samaritan. [DE 37-28]. A grand jury indicted Leath on those charges. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. At trial, a jury found him not guilty on the assault charges but guilty on three misdemeanor charges. [DE 37-29]. Because Leath could not make bail, he was held in jail before trial and sentenced to time served following his conviction. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    f. Leath Sues Officers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Leath filed this lawsuit in Fayette Circuit Court in January 2017 alleging a range of constitutional and state-law violations against UKPD officers Webb, Duncan, Faulkner, McConnell, and Flora, as well as Good Samaritan nurses Christopher Thompson and Jeffrey Jones-Ritzler. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Defendants timely removed the case to this court. [DE 1]. After discovery, Defendants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. [DE 37]. Leath responded [DE 41], and Defendants replied [DE 45], making this matter ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Group One: Unlawful Search and Seizure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In Count I, Leath alleges that the officers and a nurse violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from an unlawful search and seizure. [DE 41, p. 3]. Specifically, Leath asserts this claim against officers Webb, McConnell, Duncan, and Flora, and nurse Thompson. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. He argues that the taking of his blood pressure, pulse, and temperature violated his rights because (1) it was done with no medical purpose or probable cause, and (2) Leath had a right to refuse medical treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The basis for this claim began when Leath arrived at Fayette County Detention Center and refused to have his vitals taken. [37-18, p. 2, \u00b6 9; DE 37-19, at 3:43]. Sarah Rideau, the nurse at the jail that night, stated in her affidavit that she routinely had to determine if individuals were medically stable enough to be admitted. [DE 37-18 at \u00b6 3]. As discussed above, multiple factors led Rideau to believe that Leath was extremely intoxicated or suffering from a serious medical condition. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2]. Leath was disoriented, non-compliant, had large pupils, and froth was coming from his mouth. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 6-7]. Determining the cause of Leath's symptoms was important because the jail might not have \"been able to accommodate an immediate medical emergency.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14]. But Rideau could not even begin to evaluate Leath because he refused to comply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   That put officers in a bind. They had Leath in custody but could not admit him to jail. Sensing the problem, Leath sought to capitalize and made a proposal: If the officers let him go scot-free, he would forget\n   about his plans to sue (by this point, Leath had indicated numerous times that he was going to sue officers). [DE 37-19, at 1:21, 4:46, 6:19, 7:21, 9:31, 12:52, 14:34]. Officers had none of it. Instead, they decided that they had to obtain Leath's vitals to comply with jail policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   That's when an ambulance took Leath to Good Samaritan. There, officers held him down while nurse Thompson swiped Leath's head for a body temperature, took his blood pressure, and used a finger clip for his pulse. [DE 37-22; DE 37-23]. And taking a prisoner's vital signs is nothing new at Good Samaritan. Allison Rains, a doctor who was working that night, stated in a sworn affidavit that it was common for police to bring intoxicated people to the emergency room to be medically cleared prior to going to jail. [DE 37-22, p. 1, \u00b6 2]. Doing so rules out any preexisting condition or other serious injury. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3]. Indeed, it did so in Leath's case, and he was later admitted to jail.

Precisely. The entire point of taking Leath's vitals was to rule out a serious medical condition. [DE 37-18 at \u00b6 7].

[DE 41-6]. But the affidavit addresses only one of the three felony counts. Leath does not even mention the incident at Good Samaritan-where officers claimed two of the alleged assaults occurred. Thus, as to the alleged assaults involving Officers Duncan and McConnell, Leath's affidavit has no effect. And as to Webb, Leath merely denies he assaulted Webb. Denying he assaulted Webb does not amount to establishing that no probable cause existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   And in any event, Leath presents nothing that satisfies the\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   standard. After all, the statute under which Leath was charged requires only an \"\n   <em>\n    attempt\n   </em>\n   [ ] to cause physical injury to\" an officer. KRS \u00a7 508.025. Leath's denial does not suggest that Webb did not have reason to believe Leath attempted to cause physical injury. And Leath does not provide any other evidence that police fabricated or falsified evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277456\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/568/#p582\">\n    852 F.3d at 587-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Leath cannot rebut the probable-cause presumption merely by denying the assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The video evidence also contains nothing to suggest officers made false reports or fabricated evidence. To the contrary, the video supports the inference that officers believed Leath assaulted them. For example, at Good Samaritan, Officer Duncan\n   <em>\n    immediately\n   </em>\n   claimed Leath bit him. [DE 37-20, at 14:37]. Duncan repeated it throughout the video. Officers warned Leath that if he kicked someone, he would be charged with assault. [DE 37-23, at 0:32]. Officer McConnell then reported that Leath kicked him. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:16, 5:43]. And during the altercation, Leath himself said \"I'm about to act a fool up in this motherfucker\" and \"put my motherfucking shit on before I kick you.\" [DE 37-20 at 15:06, 17:34]. Leath's threats, coupled with the officers' instant reaction suggest officers did in fact believe Leath assaulted them. Thus, the video does not rebut the\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   presumption because \"the video does not support the inference that the officers made knowingly or recklessly false statements.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

In sum, the grand jury's probable-cause finding resolves Leath's claim. Because he cannot rebut the presumption, he cannot maintain his claim.

The elements in Kentucky are: \"1) the defendant initiated, continued, or procured a criminal or civil judicial proceeding, or an administrative disciplinary proceeding against the plaintiff; 2) the defendant acted without probable cause; 3) the defendant acted with malice, which in the criminal context, means seeking to achieve a purpose other than brining an offender to justice; and in the civil context, means seeking to achieve a purpose other than the proper adjudication of the claim upon which the underlying proceeding was\n   based; 4) the proceeding, except in ex parte civil actions, terminated in favor of the person against whom it was brought; and 5) the plaintiff suffered damages as a result of the proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

City of Riviera Beach\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612344\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1945/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 1945\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612344\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1945/\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), but \"[g]uilt of misconduct may be relevant summary judgment evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Maben v.

And here evidence of misconduct-including a grand-jury indictment-supports a legitimate basis for the felony charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment as to Count X is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Two-and-a-half years ago, Leath promised he'd sue UKPD. He claimed from the beginning that officers and nurses violated his federal and state rights. Yet for the most part, Leath fails to overcome qualified immunity or fails to establish necessary elements of his claims. On those counts, there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and no need for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   But that's not true on all claims. Leath can still pursue his excessive force (Count III), assault (Count IV), and battery (Count V) claims against Officer Webb. Accordingly,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   (1) that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment [DE 37] is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to Counts III, IV, and V against Officer Webb for the alleged throat grab;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   (2) that on all other counts, Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment [DE 37] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
