RELEVANT FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following facts are drawn from Plaintiff's complaint. Plaintiff is a sophomore at Arrowhead. As a member of the girls' soccer team, Plaintiff agreed to act in accordance with the school's Parent/Athlete &amp; Co-Curricular Code of Conduct. The code of conduct warns that a student athlete will be suspended from participation in school athletics if, among other things, the student possesses, consumes, or sells alcohol or engages in \"criminally related activity,\" including violations of state law or municipal or county ordinance. (Docket # 1-1 at 22). The code provides that for a first offense, the student will be suspended from thirty percent of the games of the current season.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During the weekend of February 10, 2018, Plaintiff invited approximately a dozen fellow students over to her home for a party. Some of them brought alcohol and consumed it at the party. Plaintiff did not possess, provide, distribute, or consume any alcohol at the party, nor did she ask anyone to bring alcohol or know that it would be brought.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Arrowhead administration officials became aware that underage drinking had occurred at Plaintiff's home. According to a transcript of a voicemail left for Plaintiff's father by school administrator Laura Myrah (\"Myrah\"), Arrowhead officials found photographs depicting Plaintiff posing with others at the party with beer cans visible in the background.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29. Additionally, interviews with other students who attended the party confirmed the presence of alcohol there.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 22, Arrowhead Activities Director Ryan Mangan (\"Mangan\") and Associate Principal Debra Paradowski met with Plaintiff to present their belief that she had hosted a drinking party and to gauge her response to the allegations. Plaintiff ultimately admitted that she hosted the party and that alcohol was present. As a result, Mangan informed Plaintiff that she was suspended from athletics and that he would contact her parents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On February 23, Mangan notified Plaintiff and her parents in writing that she had been suspended from participating in thirty percent of the soccer games that season due to her violation of the Code of Conduct. That amounted to four games' worth of suspension. Mangan's letter stated that she had been suspended for \"hosting and possessing alcohol the weekend of February 10.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. Upon receiving the letter, Plaintiff appealed the suspension in accordance with the Code of Conduct to the Appeal Committee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On March 20, the Appeal Committee held a hearing to consider Plaintiff's appeal. The school district and Plaintiff's father and her attorney presented evidence and testimony at the hearing. The Appeal Committee upheld the suspension. Plaintiff alleges that the decision was based on her hosting of the February 10 party rather than possession of alcohol, as the photographs discussed above were not submitted during that hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff then appealed the Appeal Committee's decision to the Personnel Committee. Plaintiff had the opportunity to provide written submissions to the Personnel Committee. On March 28, the Personnel Committee met to consider Plaintiff's appeal of her suspension. Plaintiff was notified by letter on April 9 that the Personnel Committee upheld the suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After receiving the April 9 letter, Plaintiff's father called Myrah to demand further explanation for the suspension decision. She left him a voicemail in response, noting that the evidence they considered included the interview with Plaintiff, interviews with other student attendees, the photograph of the February 10 party, and another photograph showing Plaintiff and another student on a separate occasion pretending to drink wine from a wine bottle. Myrah explained that the suspension was appropriate both because of the code's prohibition on the possession of alcohol and its prohibition on criminal activity, which in this case was contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Further, said Myrah, the suspension could be justified because hosting a party where alcohol was consumed by minors was unbecoming a student athlete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    3. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff advances three related constitutional claims. First, she alleges that Arrowhead's conduct during the suspension process violated her right to procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Second, applying principles of substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, she alleges that she was arbitrarily deprived of her constitutionally protected interest in participation in high school athletics. Third, she claims that Arrowhead violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause when it suspended her but not the other, similarly situated students at the party. The Court will address each claim in turn. Finally, the Court will consider Plaintiff's remaining claim under Wisconsin state law for a writ of certiorari.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    3.1 Procedural Due Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff's procedural due process claim arises under the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits state officials from depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\n   <em>\n    Colon v. Schneider\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10532288\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/899/660/#p666\">\n    899 F.2d 660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 666 (7th Cir. 1990). Such a claim requires Plaintiff to establish \"(1) a cognizable liberty or property interest; (2) the deprivation of that interest by some form of state action; and (3) the failure to employ constitutionally adequate procedures.\"\n   <em>\n    Dietchweiler by Dietchweiler v. Lucas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4335228\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/622/#p627\">\n    827 F.3d 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 627 (7th Cir. 2016). Plaintiff's case falters on the first element, as she enjoys no constitutionally\n   protected property interest in participation in interscholastic athletics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   To be entitled to due process, a plaintiff must have a liberty or property interest at stake; not every deprivation rises to the level of constitutional concern. Protectible interests \"are not created by the Constitution. Rather, they are created and their dimensions defined by an independent source such as state statutes or rules entitling the citizen to certain benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    Goss v. Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177671\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/419/565/#p572\">\n    419 U.S. 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 572-73,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177671\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/419/565/#p572\">\n    95 S.Ct. 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177671\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/419/565/#p572\">\n    42 L.Ed.2d 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1975). Further, when examining these sources for qualifying interests, the Supreme Court has instructed that \"a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for [a benefit]. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.\"\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Regents v. Roth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782964\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/564/#p577\">\n    408 U.S. 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 577,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782964\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/564/#p577\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782964\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/564/#p577\">\n    33 L.Ed.2d 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972). \"A 'legitimate claim of entitlement' is one that is legally enforceable-one based on statutes or regulations containing 'explicitly mandatory language' that links 'specified substantive predicates' to prescribed outcomes.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

Thus, it seems highly likely that the Seventh Circuit would join the majority of its sister Circuits and hold that participation in interscholastic sports does not implicate any protectible liberty or property interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To stem this tide of adverse authority, Plaintiff says that Wisconsin is unique in its creation of a protected property interest in interscholastic athletic participation.

Plaintiff leans heavily on Arrowhead's athletic code of conduct, which she reads as creating an expectation of continued participation in Arrowhead sports for players who follow the rules. But Arrowhead's code of conduct for extracurricular activities clearly states that \"[a]thletics are a\n   <em>\n    privilege\n   </em>\n   and not a right and are made available to students who abide by the rules and regulations as outlined by Arrowhead and the WIAA.\" (Docket # 1-1 at 21) (emphasis in original).

Quite unlike the student in\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   , then, here Plaintiff knew full well that athletic participation was a privilege only. To be sure, the Arrowhead handbook does not \"strongly impl[y]\" that Plaintiff need only observe the applicable rules to continue playing on Arrowhead sports teams.\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11189727\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/116/1038/\">\n    116 F.Supp.2d at 1048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In an effort to shore up the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   against\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   and the other authorities discussed above, Plaintiff\n   cites\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20118.133\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 118.133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(a), which governs participation in interscholastic athletics and other extracurricular activities by home-schooled students. It provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   A school board shall permit a pupil who resides in the school district and is enrolled in a home-based private educational program to participate in interscholastic athletics in the school district on the same basis and to the same extent that it permits pupils enrolled in the school district to participate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20118.133\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's reliance on this provision is entirely misplaced, as it says nothing about the content of the property interest at stake. It tells school districts that home-schooled students must be afforded athletic participation to the same extent as students who attend school in the district's school building. Crucially, it does not define the right to participation in athletics. As the Court has explained, none of the available sources of state law plausibly suggest that Plaintiff enjoys a legitimate expectation of continued participation in interscholastic athletics at Arrowhead. The Court would expect the same result to obtain for any similarly situated home-schooled student.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Consequently, this Court joins the majority of courts that have faced this issue and finds that Plaintiff enjoyed no protectible property interest in continued participation in Arrowhead's soccer program. Because Plaintiff has not alleged the deprivation of a constitutionally protected interest, her procedural due process claim fails without consideration of whether or what procedure she was actually afforded.\n   <em>\n    Roth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782964\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/564/#p577\">\n    408 U.S. at 570-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782964\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/564/#p577\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    3.2 Substantive Due Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff's next claim is for violation of her substantive due process rights.

Undoubtedly Plaintiff hosted a drinking party and knew that alcohol was present, whether or not she helped provide it or drank any. It is not irrational to punish more harshly one who knowingly facilitates consumption of alcohol by providing a venue. In this sense, the other attendees were less culpable.

The Seventh Circuit teaches that \"in cases where the plaintiff complains that [she] has been unreasonably deprived of a state-created property interest, without alleging a violation of some other substantive constitutional right or that the available state remedies are inadequate, the plaintiff has not stated a substantive due process claim.\"\n    <em>\n     Kauth v.

Such is the case here, as Plaintiff claims she was deprived of a state-created property interest-continued participation in Arrowhead sports-but does not successfully allege the violation of any other substantive constitutional right. Additionally, Plaintiff's complaint includes a claim for a writ of certiorari under Wisconsin common law. Certiorari is a procedure whereby Wisconsin courts can review the decisions of municipalities, administrative agencies, or inferior tribunals.\n    <em>\n     Ottman v.

Plaintiff does not suggest that the certiorari procedure is inadequate to protect her interests, and the Court does not see any infirmities in it. Consequently, the availability of state remedies stands as yet another obstacle to Plaintiff's substantive due process claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Plaintiff's complaint sets forth seven items delineated as \"claims for relief\": (1) a claim of denial of procedural due process; (2) a claim of denial of substantive due process; (3) a claim of denial of equal protection; (4) a claim of deprivation of constitutional rights under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; (5) a claim for temporary injunction; (6) a claim for permanent injunction; and (7) a claim for a writ of certiorari under Wisconsin law. The first three, as well as the last, have been expressly considered in this Order. The other three have not, as they are not actually separate claims for relief. Section 1983 is the procedural vehicle for bringing an action against a state actor for constitutional violations, and temporary and permanent injunctions are types of relief that can be awarded, not legal claims. The Court has addressed all of the proper legal claims, notwithstanding the odd structure of Plaintiff's pleading.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
