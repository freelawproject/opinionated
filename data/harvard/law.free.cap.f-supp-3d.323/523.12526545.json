Covered Employment is defined as \"employment of a Member by the Employer in one of the bargaining units subject to the Collective Bargaining Agreement or in Foreign Service.\" To be a \"Member\", one must be an Employee in one of the above-described bargaining units or an Employee of the Fund.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sections 1.13, 1.20, 1.32 and 1.35 of the Pension Plan and Sections 1.14, 1.22, 1.34 and 1.37 of the APP, copies of which are enclosed as Exhibit B.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The letter then summarizes the Trustees' \"understanding of the facts and circumstances related to Mr. Stolarik's arrangement with [t]he Times\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   \u2022 Mr. Stolarik has been providing freelance photography services for The Times for 15 years.

Under this arrangement, The Times offers Mr. Stolarik, on a project-by-project basis, the opportunity to photograph events and has no control over the manner in which he does so.

The freelance agreement expressly states in paragraph 9 that Mr. Stolarik is an independent contractor and is not eligible for benefits from the Times. Therefore, Mr. Stolarik's claim accrued on, and the statute of limitations began running no later than April 2, 2004. Even without the signed freelance agreement, as explained below, it was clear from the relationship between the Times and Mr. Stolarik that he was considered an independent contractor at all times and would not receive any employee benefits. Moreover, Mr. Stolarik has never been considered a Pension Plan (or APP Plan) participant or treated as an employee on the Times' books and records. Because the freelance agreement is subject to New York law,\n   Mr. Stolarik's claim under the Pension Plan is subject to a 6-year statute of limitations.
