William T. Lawrence, Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This cause is before the Court on the Plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction (Dkt. No. 19). The motion is fully briefed, and the Court held a hearing on the motion on July 20, 2018, after which the parties submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. The Court, having considered all of the parties' filings and the testimony presented and evidence admitted at the hearing, and being duly advised,\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the Plaintiff's motion for the reasons set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff J.A.W. is a seventeen-year-old unemancipated minor; his mother is his sole legal and physical guardian.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   J.A.W. is\n   about to enter his senior year as a student at North High School in the Evansville Vanderburgh School Corporation (\"EVSC\"). He plans to graduate in December 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   J.A.W.'s assigned gender at birth is female. His birth certificate, which was obtained in Florida where he was born, identifies his sex as female, as does his Indiana driver's license, which he recently obtained. However, J.A.W. has long identified as male. When J.A.W. was 11 years old, he first encountered the term transgender and recognized that he was transgender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   J.A.W. began to feel uncomfortable using the girls' restrooms at school in sixth grade. In eighth grade he was assigned to a physical education class and felt uncomfortable using female locker rooms to change before and after class. He and his mother spoke to a social worker at school, and his schedule was changed so that he was no longer in a physical education class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Beginning in eighth grade, J.A.W. began to present himself outwardly as a boy; he began sporting a male haircut and wearing masculine clothing. He also began to ask his teachers to address him by his chosen masculine name (J.A.W.) instead of the feminine name that was given to him at birth and to request that masculine pronouns be used to refer to him. J.A.W. was too intimidated at that time to seek permission to use the boys' restrooms at school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During his freshman year, J.A.W. attended classes at both North High School and Central High School. As he entered puberty, he suffered increasing discomfort and distress relating to what he now knows to be gender dysphoria, which is defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (\"DSM-V\") as \"[a] marked incongruence between one's experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender ....\" Dkt. No. 50-6 at 4. At that point he became extremely uncomfortable using the female restrooms at school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   J.A.W. was required to take physical education at North High School during his freshman year. Because he did not feel comfortable using the girls' locker room to change before and after gym class, he and another transgender student began using a boys' restroom for that purpose. They did not seek permission to do so, and EVSC administrators learned of the situation when a parent called to complain that there were \"two girls\" using the boys' restroom. EVSC told J.A.W. not to use the boys' restroom anymore; as an alternative, the two transgender students were told to use another girls' locker room that was not otherwise being used. For other restroom needs, EVSC told J.A.W. that he could use the girls' restrooms or a gender-neutral, single-occupancy restroom in the nurse's office at North High School. This restroom generally is not used by students unless they are visiting the nurse or the office or have been granted permission to use it on a regular basis after demonstrating that they have a reason to do so. The nurse's restroom was located far from J.A.W.'s classes and therefore was inconvenient. He tried using it a few times but found it locked, so he stopped trying to use it. J.A.W. did not make any specific request with regard to restroom use at Central High School.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   During his sophomore year, J.A.W. attended classes at both North High School and Harrison High School. Per his request, his teachers continued to address him as J.A.W. and use masculine pronouns to refer to him. Early in that school year, J.A.W. approached the principal of North High School with the \"Dear Colleague\" letter that was jointly issued on May 13, 2016, by the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, and the U.S. Department\n   of Education, Office for Civil Rights, which J.A.W. believed entitled him to use the boys' restrooms at school.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   EVSC reviewed the letter, consulted with counsel, and ultimately denied J.A.W.'s request to use the boys' restrooms. J.A.W. was instructed either to use the girls' restrooms or the gender-neutral, single-occupancy restroom in the nurse's office at North High School. J.A.W. was not informed of the availability of a gender-neutral restroom at Harrison High School; students are also required to obtain permission to use that restroom. The arrangements for J.A.W. to change before and after physical education class remained the same as the previous year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   J.A.W. began counseling in September 2016 because he wanted confirmation that he had gender dysphoria. J.A.W. has submitted the Declaration of James D. Fortenberry, M.D., M.S., the director and founder of the Gender Health Program at Riley Children's Health in Indianapolis, who explains that the standards of care for gender dysphoria\"recognize ... that the principal treatment of gender dysphoria is to allow the person full expression of his or her gender identity.\" Dkt. 50-6 at 6. This involves both \"social role transition,\" a process in which \"a person presents themselves in a manner consistent with their experienced gender, which includes name, dress, hair style, and other aspects of gender presentation,\" as well as hormone therapy to \"initiate[ ] the physiologic changes in body contour and appearance to match the experienced gender.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. The ability to use public restrooms consistent with one's gender identity \"is a prime component of gender affirmation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In June 2017, J.A.W.'s counselor wrote to his medical doctor and opined that J.A.W. met the criteria for Gender Dysphoria of Adolescence and that he would benefit greatly both medically and psychologically from hormone therapy. Based upon a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, J.A.W. was prescribed testosterone in the fall of 2017. He has been taking testosterone injections regularly since then.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In November 2016, during his sophomore year, J.A.W. sent an email to Dr. Dionne Blue, EVSC's Chief Diversity Officer, informing Dr. Blue that he was a transgender student and asking about EVSC's policy with regard to transgender students accessing restrooms and locker rooms. Dr. Blue responded that EVSC did not have an official policy, but that transgender students could use the nurse's office or other gender-neutral restrooms depending on the facilities available in the building. Dr. Blue further stated that schools would address any other needs on a case-by-case basis. J.A.W. did not follow up with Dr. Blue or make any requests of her. During his sophomore year, J.A.W. did not complain to anyone at EVSC that the gender-neutral restrooms made available to him were inaccessible or otherwise unsatisfactory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   J.A.W. did not seek permission to use the boys' restrooms during the first semester of his junior year. On January 21, 2018, early in the second semester, J.A.W.'s attorney contacted EVSC on his behalf and informed EVSC that pursuant to the Seventh Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Whitaker By Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1044\">\n    858 F.3d 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1044 (7th Cir. 2017),\n   <em>\n    cert. dismissed sub nom.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ. v. Whitaker ex rel. Whitaker\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610656,12610657,12610652,12610653,12610654,12610655\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1260/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 1260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610752,12610753,12610654,12610652,12610750,12610751\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/200/415/\">\n    200 L.Ed.2d 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), he believed that J.A.W. was entitled to use the boys' restrooms at school. The letter did not mention J.A.W.'s mother's\n   position on the issue. EVSC's general counsel responded that\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   was distinguishable on its facts, that it did not appear to represent the state of the law across the United States, and that J.A.W. would not be permitted to use the boys' restrooms at school. This lawsuit ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Prior to the institution of these proceedings, EVSC had never been made aware that J.A.W. had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, that he was undergoing hormone therapy, or that he had any complaints regarding the proximity and accessibility of the gender-neutral restroom EVSC had made available to him. However, EVSC is now aware that J.A.W. has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria and that he has been undergoing hormone therapy for almost a year. Since beginning hormone therapy, his appearance and voice have become more masculine; he has developed a patchy beard, he has lost weight, and his abdomen has developed more of a male appearance. He no longer menstruates. At the hearing, he looked and sounded like a teenaged boy; he is very unlikely to be mistaken for a girl at this point. Given these facts, EVSC's position that J.A.W. \"has merely announced to EVSC that he is male and demanded access to facilities inconsistent with the gender marker appearing on the birth certificate his mother provided to EVSC at the time of his enrollment,\" Dkt. No. 65 at 22, is simply incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   To avoid having to use restrooms at school, J.A.W. severely restricts his fluid intake in an attempt to prevent himself from having to go the bathroom while at school. This causes him pain and discomfort. On the few occasions in the past that J.A.W. could not wait, he used the girls' restrooms at school, as he did not want to be disciplined by EVSC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Using the girls' restrooms is extremely upsetting to him and makes him feel ostracized from his peers because, as he testified, it \"contradicts what I am projecting to the world of what I identify as.\" Dkt. No. 61 at 18-19. J.A.W. also testified that using the girls' restroom at school draws attention to the fact that he is transgender, and that female peers at school have expressed discomfort with him using the girls' restrooms because he appears male.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   EVSC has no written policy regarding transgender students' use of restrooms. While EVSC asserts in its surreply brief that its policy is \"to make restroom assignments based on the sex listed on the student's birth certificate or other comparable government-issued identifying documents used to enroll the student, and to consider parental requests to deviate from that default position on a case-by-case basis,\" Dkt. No. 59 at 1, the evidence of record does not support that assertion. Dr. David Smith, EVSC's superintendent, testified that EVSC does not have a formal policy at all; it has a \"practice.\" Dkt. No. 61 at 38. He further testified that EVSC's position is that J.A.W. may not use boys' restrooms because \"biologically he is female.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39. However, he also testified that if J.A.W. were to legally have his birth certificate changed so that it indicated his sex was male, then under EVSC's current, unwritten practice, J.A.W. would be permitted to use the boys' restrooms at school, because a birth certificate would be an \"objective standard\" by which to determine that it was appropriate for him to do so. He also conceded that if J.A.W. were to have his birth certificate changed but his use of the boys' restrooms nonetheless caused a \"disruption,\" EVSC could respond by again barring J.A.W. from the boys' restrooms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The issue now before the Court is a narrow one: whether J.A.W. is entitled to the preliminary injunctive relief he seeks, which is that he be allowed to use the boys' restrooms within the schools and other buildings of EVSC. A preliminary injunction is \"an extraordinary remedy\" that \"[i]s never awarded as a matter of right.\"\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1044\">\n    858 F.3d at 1044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A two-step inquiry applies when determining whether such relief is required. First, the party seeking the preliminary injunction has the burden of making a threshold showing: (1) that he will suffer irreparable harm absent preliminary injunctive relief during the pendency of his action; (2) inadequate remedies at law exist; and (3) he has a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits. If the movant successfully makes this showing, the court must engage in a balancing analysis, to determine whether the balance of harm favors the moving party or whether the harm to other parties or the public sufficiently outweighs the movant's interests.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1044\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Likelihood of Success\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In order to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits in the context of seeking a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff \"must only show that his chances to succeed on his claims are 'better than negligible.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1044\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1044\">\n    at 1046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Cooper v.

Title IX\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   J.A.W. asserts in this case that EVSC's refusal to permit him to use boys' restrooms violates Title IX,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), which prohibits a covered institution\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   from discriminating on the basis of sex. In\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit held that a transgender high school student demonstrated a likelihood of success on his claim that his school's denying him access to the boys' restroom based on his transgender status violated Title IX:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   A policy that requires an individual to use a bathroom that does not conform with his or her gender identity punishes that individual for his or her gender non-conformance, which in turn violates Title IX. The School District's policy also subjects Ash, as a transgender student, to different rules, sanctions, and treatment than non-transgender students, in violation of Title IX. Providing a gender-neutral alternative is not sufficient to relieve the School District from liability, as it is the policy itself which violates the Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1044\">\n    858 F.3d at 1049-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is equally true of EVSC's policy in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   EVSC argues that\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   \"was not ... a mandate requiring school corporations to allow unemancipated minors who profess to be transgender access to the restrooms of their choosing on the strength of nothing more than their own demands,\" Dkt. No. 65 at 20, and asserts\n   that\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from this case in several respects. First, it points to the Seventh Circuit's observation in\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   that it was \" 'not a case where a student has merely announced that he is a different gender,' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1044\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1044\">\n    858 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1050 ), and argues that this demonstrates that \"some threshold showing is required to trigger the protections for transgender students discussed in\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   , and a mere 'announcement' of one's transgender status is insufficient,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21. Thus, it argues,\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   did not hold that \"schools are prohibited from requiring a parental request prior to allowing transgender students to access restrooms in alignment with their gender identity\" or that \"schools are prohibited from requiring some evidence that access to such facilities is medically, psychologically, and developmentally necessary and appropriate for the individual student.\" Dkt. No. 65 at 21. That is true-\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   did not specifically hold either of those things. But that is irrelevant to the issue now before the Court, because EVSC has made it clear, through the testimony of Dr. Smith, that its decision to prohibit J.A.W. from using boys' restrooms was not based on either a requirement that there be a parental request or a requirement of any sort of evidence regarding what is necessary and appropriate for J.A.W. Rather, EVSC's position unequivocally is that unless and until J.A.W. obtains a birth certificate that states that his sex is male-something that appears to be legally impossible for him to do at this point in time-he will not be permitted to use the boys' restrooms. And in that fundamental sense, this case is indistinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   . In other words, there likely is a line to be drawn with regard to when Title IX requires a school to permit a transgender student to use the restrooms that coincide with his gender identity, but in this case EVSC has drawn that line in a place that the Seventh Circuit has already indicated is likely unacceptable. Therefore, the Court finds that J.A.W. has sufficiently established a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits of his claim under Title IX.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    2. Equal Protection\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The court in\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   further held that the plaintiff also had a likelihood of success on the merits of his Equal Protection claim, a claim also asserted by J.A.W. As the Seventh Circuit noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike. It therefore, protects against intentional and arbitrary discrimination. Generally, state action is presumed to be lawful and will be upheld if the classification drawn by the statute is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The rational basis test, however, does not apply when a classification is based upon sex. Rather, a sex-based classification is subject to heightened scrutiny, as sex frequently bears no relation to the ability to perform or contribute to society. When a sex-based classification is used, the burden rests with the state to demonstrate that its proffered justification is exceedingly persuasive. This requires the state to show that the classification serves important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives. It is not sufficient to provide a hypothesized or\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   justification created in response to litigation. Nor may the justification be based upon overbroad generalizations about sex. Instead, the justification must be genuine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1044\">\n    858 F.3d at 1050\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The court then found that \"the School District's policy cannot be stated without referencing\n   sex, as the School District decides which bathroom a student may use based upon the sex listed on the student's birth certificate\" and thus the \"policy is inherently based upon a sex-classification and heightened review applies.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1044\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1044\">\n    at 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, the court held that the school district had not met its burden of demonstrating that its justification for its restroom policy was \"not only genuine, but also exceedingly persuasive.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1044\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1044\">\n    at 1051-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   , the asserted justification for the restroom policy was the need to protect the privacy rights of all of the students in the district. The Seventh Circuit found that privacy argument to be \"based on sheer conjecture and abstraction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1044\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1044\">\n    at 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The same is true of EVSC's stated justification for its practice in this case: \"preventing disruption and protecting the safety of all of its students, both transgender and cisgender.\" Dkt. No. 41 at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   With regard to the prevention of \"disruption,\" EVSC has presented no evidence to support this justification beyond Dr. Smith's testimony that he believes there would be \"substantial disruption\" if \"children were allowed simply to choose bathrooms based upon their subjective gender identity\" and that \"the parent body would object.\" Dkt. No. 61 at 33-34. But as the Court has already noted, at this point\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   J.A.W. is not asking to simply choose a restroom based on his subjective gender identity. He has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria and has been taking male hormones-which have altered his appearance and his voice-for almost a year. Further, EVSC has not described what form this \"disruption\" would take beyond complaints from parents, which the court found insufficient in\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1044\">\n    858 F.3d at 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that the receipt of one complaint from a parent and the fact that some parents and other community residents had spoken out in opposition-including at a school board meeting-to the plaintiff using the boys' restrooms insufficient to support the school district's position). In fact, when asked whether there had been any complaints from parents or students \"as it relates to bathroom usage in transgender,\" Dr. Smith related the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Well, as recently as last month, in speaking to an administrator at-the day after the Monday after I was deposed, she referenced two situations that had occurred in the building where she is principal; had a parent, a mother, that called that was extremely upset because the daughter had been exposed to a transgender man that had gone into the restroom and she felt very-I think the words were scared, vulnerable and terrified.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Dkt. No. 61 at 33. But that anecdote supports J.A.W.'s position. Under EVSC's policy, J.A.W.-a transgender male-is supposed to use the girls' restrooms. Thus EVSC's own policy has apparently caused the sort of \"disruption\" that EVSC is trying to avoid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In any event, the practice identified by EVSC-determining which restroom a student may use based upon the student's birth certificate-is inconsistent with the articulated reason for the policy. As Dr. Smith conceded at the hearing, whatever hypothetical disruption that might occur if J.A.W. were to use the boys' restrooms at school would not be caused by what J.A.W.'s birth certificate says; it is unlikely that those causing the disruption would be aware of the content of his birth certificate\n   or that their opinion that J.A.W. should not be using the boys' restrooms would change simply because a different box was checked on that document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   With regard to the need to protect its students' safety, EVSC points to J.A.W.'s testimony that \"transgender people sometimes face safety issues in public restrooms and that he feels safer using single-occupancy restrooms.\" Dkt. No. 65 at 13 (citing Dkt. No. 61 at 17-18). However, on cross-examination, J.A.W. further testified that now that his outward appearance is masculine, there are safety issues associated with using the girls' restrooms at school. Dkt. No. 61 at 21. The record before the Court does not support a finding that either student safety or the need to prevent \"disruption\" is an exceedingly persuasive justification for EVSC's transgender restroom policy. Accordingly, the Court finds that J.A.W. has met the \"low threshold\" of demonstrating a probability of success on his Equal Protection Claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Inadequate Remedy and Irreparable Harm\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   A plaintiff seeking preliminary injunction \"must show that [he] has no adequate remedy at law and, as a result, that [he] will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not issued.\"\n   <em>\n    Foodcomm Int'l v.

In addition, using the nurse's restroom is not a satisfactory option, both for practical reasons-i.e., its location-and because it forces him to have different restroom arrangements than his peers, undermining his social role transition.

As discussed above, however, EVSC has not demonstrated that permitting J.A.W. to use the boys' restrooms would be less safe than his use of the girls' restrooms, and locker room use would not be implicated by the preliminary injunction sought by J.A.W. There is certainly no evidence that J.A.W. poses any threat to any other student, regardless of which restroom he uses. Finally, while EVSC mentions privacy in addition to safety, privacy was not mentioned in its brief, and the only testimony EVSC offered with regard to privacy is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   [T]here are privacy concerns.
