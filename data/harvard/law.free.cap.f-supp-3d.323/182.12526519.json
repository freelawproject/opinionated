Gen. Laws c. 93A, and fraud. This Court adopted the magistrate judge's recommendation that the case be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff then filed suit against Defendants in the Suffolk County Superior Court (\"Superior Court\") on May 15, 2014 (the \"State Action\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Plaintiff alleged the following counts in the State Action: commercial disparagement of intellectual property (Count I); breach of contract (Count II); breach of implied contractual duty of good faith and fair dealing (Count III); fraud (Count IV); violation of Chapter 93A (Count V) and; declaration of ownership rights of a testing method used in the experiments (Count VI).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After the parties submitted and argued their respective motions for summary judgment, the Superior Court judge granted the Defendants motion and denied the Plaintiff's partial motion for summary judgment in part because the Plaintiff failed to show sufficient evidence of damages. Judgment was entered in favor of the Defendants in the State Action on July 28, 2016. After the Superior Court denied the Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration, he appealed, and the Massachusetts Appeals Court (\"Appeals Court\") affirmed the Superior Court's decision and denied the Plaintiff's petition for rehearing. The Appeals Court held that because the Plaintiff failed to provide evidence of damages, the Superior Court's ruling on summary judgment\n   was correct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 17, 2017, the Plaintiff filed an application for further appellate review with the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (the \"SJC\"). Ten days later he filed the original complaint in the present action. On December 21, 2017, the SJC denied the Plaintiff's request for further appellate review. The Plaintiff filed an amended complaint in this case (the \"Amended Complaint\") on January 23, 2018, which mooted the Defendants first motion to dismiss. Defendants subsequently filed the instant Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint which is discussed in this Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Defendants argument is threefold: (1) this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because of the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine; (2) the Amended Complaint is barred by Res Judicata and; (3) the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over the Defendants for insufficient service of process. I find that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction and the Amended Complaint must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman Doctrine\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine stems from Congress's limitation providing only the U.S. Supreme Court with the exclusive power to act as an appellate court over state court judgments.\n   <em>\n    Federacion de Maestros de Puerto Rico v.

The Amended Complaint expressly requests this Court to enter a declaration stating that the rulings in the State Action regarding the deposition testimony and opportunity for additional discovery was wrong and to \"restore\" the State. There are no allegations of any misconduct arising from facts separate from the State Action proceedings and the Plaintiff is not seeking the same relief as in the State Action. Instead, it is clear that Plaintiff is requesting review and reversal of his unfavorable state judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Plaintiff points to the fact that he filed the original complaint before the SJC denied further appellate review. However, prior to filing the Amended Complaint, the operating document in this action, the SJC issued a formal denial of further appellate review meaning that the State Action had officially ended. Looking at the particular posture of this case, I find that to permit the Plaintiff to proceed with this action would directly conflict with the purpose of the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine prohibiting lower federal courts from reviewing and reversing final state court judgments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marciano v.

The Plaintiff concedes that \"these same claims and issues [in this action] were also raised in the state courts at the appellate level\". (Doc. No. 26; p. 6). However, it is the Plaintiff's assertion that the alleged constitutional issues here have not been fully litigated because further appeals were denied. I disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The alleged constitutional violations the Plaintiff asserts in this action arise from the granting of summary judgment in state court for failure to provide evidence of damages. The Plaintiff argues that because the Defendants failed to object to deposition testimony, the Plaintiff was denied the opportunity to lay a proper foundation for the testimony to be admissible. The Appeals Court discussed this issue noting that even with the unsupported lay deposition testimony, the evidence of damages was merely speculative and insufficient to survive summary judgment. (Doc. No. 21; exhibit C, p. 12). Further, to the extent that the Plaintiff argues that he was denied the opportunity to discover other evidence of damages, the Appeals Court noted that at no point in his opposition to the Defendants motion for summary judgment, at the oral argument, or in his motion for reconsideration did the Plaintiff argue he needed additional time for discovery and therefore, the argument was waived. The discovery issues which Plaintiffs constitutional claims arise from have already been adjudicated and he cannot re-litigate those issues by reframing them to be constitutional violations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   For these reasons, the Defendants Motion to Dismiss (Doc.
