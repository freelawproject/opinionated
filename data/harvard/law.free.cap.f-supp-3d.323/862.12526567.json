Because Rome's state law claims are preempted by ERISA, the Court grants HCC's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. ORIGINS OF THE DISPUTE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is a dispute between a former professional hockey player and a life insurance company. HCC issued a disability policy (the \"Policy\") to the National Hockey League (the \"NHL\") for the benefit of active NHLplayers. The Policy was established pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\") between the NHL and the National Hockey League Players' Association\n   (the \"NHLPA\"). Under the CBA, individual NHL club teams pay the cost of the benefits to a specific fund (the \"Fund\"). The Fund, administered by a board, then pays premiums to HCC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Aaron Rome, a former NHL player, suffered a career-ending injury while playing for the Dallas Stars. He sought benefits under the Policy, but HCC denied benefits. HCC later affirmed the denial of benefits pursuant to an administrative appeal process. Initially, Rome filed this action in Texas state court, bringing several state law claims against HCC related to improper processing of his claim. HCC, however, removed his claims before this Court. HCC argues that because the Policy is an employee welfare benefit plan under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"), federal law preempts those state law claims. Accordingly, HCC moves to dismiss Rome's state law claims or, in the alternative, seeks summary judgment on those claims. For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants HCC's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. THE RULE 12(B)(6) STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a court must determine whether the plaintiff has asserted a legally sufficient claim for relief.\n   <em>\n    Blackburn v.

Here, the Policy is an ERISA Plan because it meets the above three requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. A Plan Exists.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   - An ERISA Plan exists if a \" 'reasonable person could ascertain the intended benefits, a class of beneficiaries, the source of financing, and procedures for receiving benefits.' \"\n   <em>\n    Mem'lHosp. Sys. v. Northbrook Life Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535151\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/904/236/#p240\">\n    904 F.2d 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 240-41 (5th Cir. 1990) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Donovan v.

While an employer's purchase of an insurance plan alone does not establish that an ERISA Plan exists, the purchase of a policy or multiple policies covering a class of employees does offer substantial evidence that an ERISA Plan exists.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 242.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Per\n   <em>\n    Memorial Hospital\n   </em>\n   , the Policy constitutes an ERISA Plan. The NHL purchased the Policy for the benefit of active NHL players and maintains it pursuant to a CBA with the NHLPA. Because an employer\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   has purchased the Policy to cover a particular class of employees, that is substantial evidence that a plan exists. But the intended benefits, the class of beneficiaries, the source of financing, and the procedures for receiving benefits are also clearly ascertainable from the face of the Policy, further leading to the conclusion that a plan exists. The Policy provides specific disability benefits, medical coverage, dental coverage, life insurance and accidental death coverage, and spousal life and accidental death and dismemberment coverage to active NHL players. The Policy also recites a formula for calculating those benefits. Moreover, the Policy defines five categories of insureds who may be eligible for benefits. And finally, the Policy clearly indicates that the individual NHL club teams are responsible for paying the costs of the benefits to the Fund and that the Fund is responsible for paying\n   premiums to HCC. Therefore, the terms of the Policy are clearly ascertainable and a plan thus exists. The first requirement of an ERISA Plan is satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. The Policy Falls Outside ERISA's Safe Harbor Provision.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   - ERISA's safe harbor provision provides that a given policy is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   an ERISA Plan if the following are met: (1) neither an employer nor employee organization contributes to the policy; (2) participation in the policy is completely voluntary on the part of employees or members; (3) the \"sole functions of the employer or employee organization with respect to the [policy] are ... to collect premiums through payroll deductions or dues checkoffs and to remit them to the insurer;\" and (4) the employer or employee organization \"receives no consideration in the form of cash or otherwise in connection with the [policy], other than reasonable compensation, excluding any profit, for administrative services actually rendered in connection with payroll deductions or dues checkoffs.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202510.3-1\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2510.3-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j). All four requirements must be met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Because three of the safe harbor criteria are not satisfied here, the Policy falls outside ERISA's safe harbor Provision. The first safe harbor criterion - that neither an employer nor employee organization contributes to the program - is not satisfied. NHL club teams are employers of the NHL players, and the NHLclubs are the only entities that contribute to the Fund for premium payments. Further, the NHLPA, an employee organization, administers and maintains the plan with the NHL. Because employers contribute to the policy financially and an employee organization contributes to the policy administratively, the first safe harbor criterion is not satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The second safe harbor criterion - that participation in the program is voluntary - is also not satisfied. The bargaining parties - the NHL and the NHLPA - agreed to provide coverage to active NHL players, and the players have no option to decline. Therefore, participation is not voluntary. Thus, the second safe harbor criterion is not satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The third safe harbor criterion - that the employer's or employee organization's role is limited to collecting premiums and remitting them to the insurer - is likewise not satisfied. The NHLPA, an employee organization, and the NHL not only selected HCC as the insurer, but also negotiated the key terms of the Policy. This expands the role of the NHLPA and the NHL beyond merely collecting premiums. Thus, the third safe harbor criterion is not met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Because the Policy does not meet at least three of the safe harbor criteria - all of which must be met for a plan to fall within the safe harbor provision - it falls outside the safe harbor provision. As a result, the second requirement of an ERISA employee benefit plan is satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3.

ERISA preempts such state law causes of action because whether an individual has the right to receive benefits under the terms of an ERISA Plan is a question of exclusively federal concern.\n   <em>\n    McNeil v. Time Ins.

Rome's causes of action relate to mishandling of his claim for benefits under the Policy - an ERISA Plan. Rome has therefore not articulated enough facts to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face. Indeed, because Rome has pleaded only state law causes of action for mishandling of his claim for benefits under an ERISA Plan, he has not articulated\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   facts that would entitle him to relief. And Rome's complaint likewise does not meet the facial plausibility standard because it is not possible, let alone plausible, for Rome to recover for the state law claims pleaded. Rome's proper recourse here is, instead, to plead a claim under ERISA against a proper\n   ERISA defendant. Thus, the Court grants HCC's motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants HCC's motion to dismiss. The Court further grants Rome leave to file a claim under ERISA against a proper ERISA defendant\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   within thirty (30) days of the date of this order. If no such amended complaint is filed, the Court will dismiss this action with prejudice without further notice.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    NHL players are employed by the individual NHL club team for which they play.

Although the Court does not decide here whether MEWAs are subject to ERISA, it nonetheless concludes that Rome's argument fails. The Policy is, in fact, not a MEWA. ERISA expressly excludes from categorization as a MEWA any plan that is established or maintained pursuant to a CBA.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (40)(A)(I).
