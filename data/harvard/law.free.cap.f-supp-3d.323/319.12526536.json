Defendant now moves [Doc. # 48] for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Oral argument was held on November 21, 2017. For the reasons that follow, Defendant's Motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant manufactures, designs, and services aircraft for military and commercial operators in the United States and internationally. (Def.'s Loc. R. 56(a) 1 Stmt. [Doc. # 48-2] and Pl.'s Loc. R. 56(a)2 Stmt. [Doc. # 56] \u00b6 1 (together referred to as \"LR 56\").) Plaintiff is a deaf individual who has been a Sikorsky employee for over thirty years, working as an Electrical Installer for most of that time (including currently). (LR 56 \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, 14.) His work record, including his spotless review and disciplinary record, is generally not in dispute. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-17, 19, 21, 23, 57, 58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff's primary and preferred language is American Sign Language.

He reads and writes English at a fourth-to-sixth-grade level. (Shepard-Kegl Report at 81-82.) His ability to communicate via lip-reading varies, depending on context. (Pl.'s Depo. at 30:8-31:11.) For instance, union steward Warren makes sure to face Plaintiff and speak more slowly because \"[i]f he's deaf and he's not looking at my face, then he won't be able to read my lips.\" (Ex. 9 (Warren Depo.) to Pl.'s Opp'n [Doc. # 56-9] at 26:4-27:14.) Similarly, Plaintiff is \"a reasonably good lipreader one-on-one in well-lit and quiet settings, but cannot rely upon lipreading in the noisy environment he encounters in his workplace when interacting with peers and the people he was supervising.\" (Shepard-Kegl Report at 81-82.) Dr. Shepard Kegl concludes that Plaintiff's speech may be difficult to understand, especially for individuals not familiar with deaf speech, and may give the impression that he is less mature than he is in reality. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff's job includes participation in company-wide \"All Hands\" meetings, departmental meetings, daily \"muster\" meetings, meetings with supervisors, and various job and safety trainings. (LR 56 \u00b6\u00b6 59-61, 65, 100.) His job duties also include\n   communication with co-workers, which was particularly intensive when he was an active working leader of between two and sixteen other installers from approximately 2007 to 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LR 56 \u00b6 56; Pl.'s Depo. at 163:12-64:11, 174:8-10; 189:18-90:18.) The daily muster meetings last anywhere from 10 minutes to a half an hour or longer. (Pl.'s Depo. at 141:11-13, 163:2-7.) At these meetings, \"sometimes there are people who ask questions and, [Plaintiff doesn't] know what the answers or the questions are.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 141:19-21.) Plaintiff testified that he \"wasn't included in [the daily muster] meeting[s] because, again, no interpreter.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 163:4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Because of his communication limitations in English, Plaintiff has repeatedly requested sign language interpreters from his supervisors and managers at Sikorsky, as well as from human resources. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 252:15-273:21.) While Defendant has recently occasionally provided interpreters for company-wide \"All Hands\" meetings, and at least one training, Defendant has refused and/or failed to provide interpreters for most departmental meetings, and has never provided interpreters for daily \"muster\" meetings.

Defendant came up with a list of \"suggestions and actions\" to address Plaintiff's concerns, none of which involved providing an interpreter. (Ex. 8 (Lawrence Depo.) to Pl.'s Opp'n at 43:25-44:24.) Defendant instead provided other \"modifications\" (such as text-to-speech software, written materials, or meeting with Mr. Cadoret one-on-one after group meetings had occurred). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LR 56 \u00b6\u00b6 67-73.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since mid-to-late May 2017-long after this lawsuit was filed-Defendant has finally made interpreting services available to Mr. Cadoret via a Video Remote Interpreting service (\"VRI\"). (Ex. 10 (Plaintiff's Declaration) to Pl.'s Opp'n [Doc. # 56-10] \u00b6 2.) However, Defendant's employees do not always utilize this system, and when they do, they often do so incorrectly, leaving Plaintiff without communication access. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff is embarrassed by not being able to communicate in the workplace, and frustrated by Defendant's long delays and general failure to respond to his requests for accommodation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Brant Depo. at 31:13-32:23; Warren Depo. at 42:18-20, 53:22-54:8.) Plaintiff testified that he \"got angry\" and \"got very depressed the last few years.\" (Pl.'s Depo. at 330:8-11.) Defendant's failure to accommodate Mr. Cadoret has caused him to feel limited in the workplace and has deterred him from\n   seeking new responsibilities and opportunities for advancement.

(Pl.'s LR \u00b6 82.) Instead, and as discussed in more detail below, Plaintiff seeks access to equal benefits and privileges of his employment with Defendant, and specifically, an interpreter, so that he can participate in workplace functions including meetings and trainings, and to enable him to converse with supervisors and management. (Pl.'s Opp'n at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant never argues such claim is not cognizable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under Title I of the ADA, \"[n]o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation,\n   <em>\n    job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012112\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

On the other hand, Plaintiff points to facts in the record which support the proposition that he does need an interpreter to participate. For instance, he quotes his expert in neurolinguistics and sign language, Dr. Shepard-Kegl, who summarized that Plaintiff is\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   a reasonably good lipreader one-on-one in well-lit and quiet settings, but cannot rely upon lipreading in the noisy environment he encounters in his workplace when interacting with peers and the people he was supervising.... His speech is fluctuating in intelligibility and when intelligible has many deaf speech characteristics that may make comprehension [difficult] for individuals less familiar with deaf speech. It also come[s] across as somewhat juvenilized (rife with speech errors) that could not allow him to present himself as the mature adult he is when using ASL.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (Shepard-Kegl Report at 81.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff further contends that the departmental meetings and, crucially, the daily muster meetings, require extensive verbal communication between multiple interlocutors\n   in an interactive question-and-answer format. (Pl.'s LR 56 \u00b6\u00b6 54, 60-61 (Sikorsky's corporate representative testified that musters are \"important\" and \"a necessary intangible to build a helicopter and run a final assembly line\" because \"the supervisor needs to be able to communicate with his crew as a group or individually through a muster to make it personal\" and that musters \"wouldn't be as effective\" if done via writing.).) Here, Plaintiff has testified that he could not participate in the meetings, and that Sikorsky supervisors did not even consistently provide him with written materials during or after the meetings.

According to Defendant, one would expect that where the EEOC promulgated these very regulations and regularly pursues claims based on denials of equal benefits and privileges, it would have discussed this issue if it believed the charge presented it. (Def.'s Reply at 7.) The EEOC decision reflects its determination that Defendant had provided other effective accommodations in lieu of a full-time interpreter and therefore did not discriminate against Plaintiff. The decision also specifically stated that \"[n]o finding is made as to any other issue that might be construed as having been raised by this charge,\" recognizing the possibility that Plaintiff's charge might be read to include other issues not addressed by the EEOC in its decision.

There were no allegations regarding other circumstances requiring an interpreter. (\n   <em>\n    See Howard\n   </em>\n   Charge.) The plaintiff was unsuccessful in efforts to convince the district court that his claim actually centered on his right to equal privileges of employment because he had been denied interpreters for various safety trainings, pre-shift and large meetings, and other \"important work related functions\" such that this claim was covered by his EEOC charge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex.

The court granted summary judgment on the plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim, concluding that UPS had indeed provided him with reasonable accommodations as a matter of law, such as modifying the classroom experience and allowing him additional time to take the written examination.\n   <em>\n    Howard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4359958\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/101/343/#p347\">\n    101 F.Supp.3d at 355-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In contrast with the administrative charge in\n   <em>\n    Howard\n   </em>\n   , which covered specifically and exclusively a single instance of a denial of an interpreter for a training session, Mr. Cadoret has broadly alleged he made \"repeated requests ... to facilitate effective communication\" which were denied.

The Court concludes that the facts in Plaintiff's EEOC Charge were sufficient to put the EEOC on notice of a discrimination claim which encompassed denial of equal benefits and privileges of employment.

However, the cases Defendant cites for this proposition do not support its position. Even if Plaintiff were requesting a full-time interpreter,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   there is no binding authority\n   holding that such an accommodation is\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   unreasonable, and Defendant has not pointed to any facts mandating the conclusion that a full-time interpreter is unreasonable in this particular case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendant points to cases rejecting employees' requests for accommodation in the form of hiring another employees in order to help the plaintiff employee perform his or her job. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss at 22-23 (citing cases).) For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Fiorillo v. United Technologies Corporation\n   </em>\n   the plaintiff employee complained that she was overworked and requested as accommodation that Sikorsky hire or assign additional employees to reduce her workload.

Mar. 21, 2016). Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Hunt-Watts v. Nassau Health Care Corporation\n   </em>\n   the plaintiff podiatrist requested that the defendant hire a nurse to perform some of her job duties.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344257\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/43/119/#p133\">\n    43 F.Supp.3d 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 133-34 (E.D.N.Y. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In both of these cases, as well as the others Defendant cites, the courts found that hiring an additional employee did not constitute a reasonable accommodation. However, none of these cases involved an employee's request for an interpreter.

Defendant's VRI Accommodation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendant began providing VRI services for Plaintiff's benefit in 2017, which it contends was a reasonable accommodation and thus that it is not required to provide Plaintiff with an interpreter. This argument can be summarily disposed of because this accommodation was not made available to Plaintiff until at least April or May of 2017, while Plaintiff's Complaint, filed in September, 2015, relates to conduct which occurred long before the provision of the VRI services. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LR 56 \u00b6\u00b6 79-80.) Thus, while relevant to Plaintiff's request for injunctive relief, the VRI accommodation has no impact on whether Plaintiff might recover damages for the period prior to its availability covered in his EEOC charge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buckhannon Bd. &amp; Care Home v.

The defendant argued that those \"general allegations\" were not included in the plaintiffs EEOC complaint and therefore that he failed to exhaust his available administrative remedies.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4359958\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/101/343/#p347\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 353 n. 6. The court rejected plaintiff's argument that the general allegations should be considered because they were of the same \"nature\" as the issue regarding being denied an interpreter for the training course.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4359958\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/101/343/#p347\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The Second Circuit did not discuss the exhaustion argument, simply affirming the district court's grant of summary judgment \"for substantially ... the reasons given by the district court in its amended opinion and order.\"\n    <em>\n     Howard\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=648%20Fed.%20Appx.%2038\">\n     648 Fed.Appx. at 40\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    The district court also emphasized the factual context of the case, noting that the \"modifications were reasonable in light of the requirement of the full-time driver position, in which plaintiff would be expected to be able to communicate effectively with customers, the public, and law enforcement without the aid of an ASL interpreter.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 356.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Plaintiff's EEOC Charge alleged he was discriminated on the basis of his disability because he was denied repeated requests for an interpreter. The operative provision of the ADA specifically prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in regard to \"job, training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012112\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The broad facts Plaintiff included in his Charge could encompass several potential theories of discrimination, and the fact that the EEOC focused on one and not another does not demonstrate that Plaintiff's claim was not exhausted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The parties dispute whether in fact Plaintiff is requesting a full-time interpreter. Defendant maintains that in order to accommodate Plaintiff's desire to have interpreters at \"group meetings, important meetings with supervisors or management, and trainings,\" it would be required to hire someone full-time. (Pl.'s Sur-Reply at 15.) Whether Plaintiff's request, in effect, requires a full-time interpreter is not dispositive because even a full-time interpreter may not be an unreasonable request as a matter of law, as shown in the discussion above.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Noll\n    </em>\n    , the employer had provided the deaf employee with access to ASL interpreters as an accommodation, which the Court found was an effective, and thus reasonable, accommodation, despite not being what the plaintiff had requested.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
