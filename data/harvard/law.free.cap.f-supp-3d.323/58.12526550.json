COOPER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Last year, a group of District of Columbia residents filed suit against Laura Zeilinger, director of the department that administers the District's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (\"SNAP\"). They alleged that the District's administration of the program fails to adhere to statutory, regulatory, and constitutional requirements. Specifically, plaintiffs contend that the District (1) failed to process their SNAP benefit applications in a timely manner; (2) failed to send timely notices that their eligibility to receive benefits needed to be recertified; and (3) failed to provide any notice of benefit processing delays and the right to a hearing. The Court stayed the District's obligation to respond to the complaint pending resolution of the plaintiffs' motions on class certification and a preliminary injunction. Now that those motions have been resolved, the District has moved to dismiss the amended complaint. The Court will grant the motion in part and deny it in part, dismissing the third claim but keeping the remaining two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The District moves to dismiss each of the plaintiffs' three claims on the same three grounds: that the plaintiffs lack standing, that they have no cause of action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that, even if they met those threshold requirements, they have not stated a valid claim. The Court takes those arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Whether plaintiffs have standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In challenging the plaintiffs' standing on all three claims, the District advances the same basic argument: that the individual plaintiffs have not shown (1) an ongoing injury that is (2) traceable to the challenged conduct. As to ongoing injury, the District notes that the named plaintiffs' specific complaints about their SNAP benefits have been resolved and all are now receiving the benefits they are legally due. Def.'s Mem. P. &amp; A. Supp. Mot. Dismiss (\"Def.'s MTD\") at 11-12. As to traceability, the District argues that the named plaintiffs' delays were caused by idiosyncratic problems, not the District's challenged conduct. Def.'s Reply at 2-4. The plaintiffs respond that the District's arguments go to mootness, not standing, and that exceptions to mootness-primarily voluntary cessation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n Def.'s Mot. Dismiss (\"Pls.' Opp'n) at 11-13, but also the inherently transitory exception,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 13 n.5-apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In fact, both issues are in play here: The District's argument that any injuries the plaintiffs suffered are not traceable to the challenged conduct goes to the plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    standing\n   </em>\n   . \"[S]tanding is assessed by considering the facts at the time the complaint was filed.\"\n   <em>\n    Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. Export-Import Bank of the U.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4292810\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/85/250/#p260\">\n    85 F.Supp.3d 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 260 (D.D.C. 2015). To establish standing, a plaintiff has the burden of showing that she \"(1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4292810\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/85/250/#p260\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted). Where a plaintiff seeks injunctive relief, the plaintiff must show either an ongoing injury or a future injury.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Arpaio v. Obama\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6771912,4332161\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/797/11/\">\n    797 F.3d 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 19 (D.C. Cir. 2015). A future injury is sufficient to sustain standing only \"if the threatened injury is certainly impending or there is a substantial risk that the harm will occur.\"\n   <em>\n    Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581581\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2334/#p2341\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2341,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581581\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2334/#p2341\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On the other hand, the District's contention that the named plaintiffs cannot invoke federal-court jurisdiction because they are now receiving benefits is really about\n   <em>\n    mootness\n   </em>\n   . Just as Article III requires that plaintiffs have standing when they initiate a lawsuit, they must retain a justiciable controversy throughout the litigation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Campbell-Ewald Co. v. Gomez\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601271\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/663/#p669\">\n    136 S.Ct. 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 669,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601271\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/663/#p669\">\n    193 L.Ed.2d 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).

Cir. 2001). But there are exceptions to this general rule: for instance, a case need not be dismissed when the case becomes moot due to the defendant's voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Black Police Ass'n v.

Cir. 1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   For each claim, then, the Court will start with whether the plaintiffs had standing at the initiation of the suit and will then address, as necessary, whether their current receipt of SNAP benefits\n   moots the case and requires dismissal. Because these issues arise on a motion to dismiss, the plaintiffs need only \"state a plausible claim\" that the requirements of standing are met.\n   <em>\n    Food &amp; Water Watch, Inc. v.

In so determining, the Court \"accept[s] the well-pleaded factual allegations\" in the complaint \"as true and draw[s] all reasonable inferences from those allegations in the plaintiff's favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Arpaio v.

As to standing, individual named plaintiffs representing a class must have standing to pursue their own individual claims at the time the suit was filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1 Newberg on Class Actions \u00a7 2:3 (5th ed.).

In addition, the relief that the individual named plaintiffs have standing to pursue must be consistent with the relief sought by the class.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310324,4366222\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/808/905/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2:6.

First, the Supreme Court has recognized that if a named plaintiff's claims become moot\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   a class is certified, the Court retains jurisdiction over the case so long as other class members retain a live claim.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Genesis Healthcare Corp. v.

The Court will focus its\n   standing inquiry on the named representatives of Class 1 and Class 2: Shonice G.

According to their sworn affidavits, at the time the suit was filed the named plaintiffs were not receiving SNAP benefits they were entitled to under the law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Shonice G.

And since the plaintiffs were\n   <em>\n    at that moment\n   </em>\n   deprived of SNAP benefits, they suffered an ongoing injury as required for injunctive relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Second, despite the District's arguments to the contrary, the named plaintiffs stated an injury that was traceable to the relevant challenged conduct. As to Shonice Garnett, the remaining named plaintiff representing the class of individuals with delayed processing of initial applications, her declaration states that she filed an initial application on July 10, 2017. Decl. of Shonice G. Garnett [ECF No. 2-16], \u00b6 7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   First Decl. of Laura Zeilinger [ECF No. 31-1], \u00b6 157b. Ms. Garnett further alleges that she was not receiving benefits associated with that application as of August 24, 2017, more than 30 days after her application was filed. Decl. of Shonice G. Garnett [ECF No. 2-16], \u00b6 11. Director Zeilinger's declaration states that Ms. Garnett was provided benefits by August 31, 2017, seemingly confirming Ms. Garnett's account of events. First Decl. of Laura Zeilinger [ECF No. 31-1], \u00b6 157d. Thus, Ms. Garnett has attested that she was not receiving SNAP benefits she was due under the law because the District had failed to process her application within 30 days.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Her injury (lack of benefits) is thus traceable to the conduct she challenges (the failure to process initial applications within the mandated timelines).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The same goes for Linda Murph, one of the two named representatives for the\n   class of individuals who experienced delayed processing of recertification applications. According to Ms. Murph, she was due to recertify her eligibility in April 2017 and submitted an application then. Decl. of Linda Murph [ECF No. 27-20], \u00b6 5. She attests that she received benefits in May but did not receive any after that.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Zeilinger Declaration recounts multiple mishaps that apparently led to the termination of Ms. Murph's benefits, including inadvertently entering an incorrect recertification due date. First Decl. of Laura Zeilinger [ECF No. 31-1], \u00b6 159. But the declaration does not refute that (1) Ms. Murph submitted a recertification application in April 2017 or (2) her application was untimely processed. As such, given the standards to demonstrate standing on a motion to dismiss, the Court concludes that Ms. Murph has adequately alleged that she was not receiving SNAP benefits she was due because the District failed to process her April 2017 recertification application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   So, too, for Kathryn Harris, the other named representative for the class of individuals with delayed processing of recertification applications. Ms. Harris states in her declaration that she was due for recertification and completed a recertification application on September 14, 2017. Decl. of Kathryn Harris [ECF No. 27-6], \u00b6 5. However, her benefits were terminated at the start of October 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. The Zeilinger Declaration confirms that Ms. Harris (1) submitted a recertification application (albeit via email rather than mail or in person) and (2) was not receiving SNAP benefits during the first part of October 2017. First Decl. of Laura Zeilinger [ECF No. 31-1], \u00b6 163. Thus, Ms. Harris has adequately alleged at this juncture that she was not receiving benefits because the District failed to properly process her recertification application and, as with the other named representatives, asserted standing when she filed this suit for injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Whether plaintiffs' claims are now moot\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   That said, the three named plaintiffs discussed above are now all receiving the SNAP benefits to which they are entitled. Since the plaintiffs' injuries have been redressed, the Court confronts a question of mootness. At first blush, the answer to this question would appear to be that because the Court has certified classes already, the mooting of the named plaintiffs' claims does not moot the case.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Genesis Healthcare\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697066\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/66/#p74\">\n    569 U.S. at 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697066\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/66/#p74\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the record indicates that the named plaintiffs' claims became moot\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the Court resolved class certification. As a consequence, any mootness problem pre-dates class certification and the Court may not be able to rely on the certified classes to sustain jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Instead, the Court will consider whether any exceptions to mootness apply. Plaintiffs point to two: voluntary cessation and the inherently transitory exception. Because the Court concludes that the latter applies, it need not address the former.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The inherently-transitory exception applies when (1) \"it is uncertain that a claim will remain live for any individual who could be named as a plaintiff long enough for a court to certify the class,\" and (2) \"there will be a constant class of persons suffering the deprivation complained of in the complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Olson v. Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3523138\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/594/577/#p582\">\n    594 F.3d 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 582 (7th Cir. 2010). Both of those conditions are met here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   With respect to the first, evidence in the record suggests that when individuals' applications are delayed, they are rarely delayed more than 60 days.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Def.'s Surreply to Mot. Prelim. Inj. Ex. B [ECF No. 48-2] (FNS-366B report for first quarter 2018 showing that 4,234 total applications were approved 1-60 days late and only 90 were approved 61+ days late). Thus, most class members' claims would become moot in less than two months, hardly enough time to fully brief and address class certification let alone the merits of this complex case. In addition, since \"it is impossible to predict\" how long it will take for the District to process any one application, \"there is no way for plaintiffs to ensure that the [n]amed [p]laintiffs\" will be individuals whose \"claims will not expire within the time it would take to litigate their claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Thorpe v.

As such, at any given moment there are recipients who are not receiving SNAP benefits owed under the law because of a delay in processing their applications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525476\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/147/#p150\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   There is thus a constant class of individuals suffering the injury complained of (loss of SNAP benefits) because of the challenged conduct. Consequently, since both requirements are met, the inherently transitory exception applies here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In sum, the named plaintiffs had standing at the time the complaint (or amended complaint) was filed. And since the inherently-transitory exception to mootness applies, the Court will deny the District's motion to dismiss Claim 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    2. Claim 2\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In their second claim, the plaintiffs allege that the District is failing to send out recertification notices as required by the statute,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202020\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4). Am. Compl. \u00b6 172. This claim corresponds to the third class the Court certified: District residents who fail to receive a timely recertification notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garnett I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524382\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/301/199/#p203\">\n    301 F.Supp.3d at 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court will therefore focus its analysis on the named representatives of Class 3: James Stanley and Roderick Gaines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As with the named plaintiffs for the classes corresponding to Claim 1, Mr. Stanley and Mr. Gaines alleged that at the time they brought suit, they were not receiving SNAP benefits. Decl. of Roderick\n   Gaines [ECF No. 27-4], \u00b6 3; Decl. of James Stanley [ECF No. 27-2], \u00b6 3. They also tie this loss of benefits to the failure to receive a recertification notice. Decl. of Roderick Gaines [ECF No. 27-4], \u00b6 3; Decl. of James Stanley [ECF No. 27-2], \u00b6 5. Director Zeilinger's declaration confirms that Mr. Stanley and Mr. Gaines had their benefits terminated because they did not submit a recertification application and suggests the failure to do so was tied to a failure to receive a recertification notice. First Decl. of Laura Zeilinger [ECF No. 31-1], \u00b6\u00b6 161a, 162a. Accordingly, both stated an ongoing injury (loss of benefits) that is traceable to the challenged conduct (failure to receive a recertification notice).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   But unlike for the named representatives for Claim 1, the actual injury that Mr. Stanley and Mr. Gaines suffered is not redressable by the specific injunctive relief sought by the class they represent. The class seeks injunctive relief remedying the failure to provide notices. But ordering the District to ensure that Mr. Stanley and Mr. Gaines receive\n   <em>\n    future\n   </em>\n   notices they are due would not solve the\n   <em>\n    ongoing\n   </em>\n   injury they experienced when suit was brought; receiving the next recertification notice does nothing to resolve the currently-lost benefits. As such, with respect to the ongoing injury the named plaintiffs alleged there is a disconnect between the individual relief they would be entitled to and the class relief they seek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   This problem is not fatal, however, because the Court concludes that Mr. Stanley and Mr. Gaines also sufficiently allege a risk of future injury at this juncture-namely that they will not receive future recertification notices and therefore lose benefits once more. A plaintiff may also establish standing to seek injunctive relief based on a possible future injury, so long as she demonstrates a \"substantial risk\" that the injury will occur or that the injury is \"certainly impending.\"\n   <em>\n    Susan B. Anthony List\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581581\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2334/#p2341\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In light of the present record before the Court, plaintiffs have adequately demonstrated that they face a sufficient risk of future injury. For one, households that receive SNAP benefits are only certified for a limited period of time, typically lasting 6-12 months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20273.10\">\n    7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) (\"The certification period cannot exceed 12 months except to accommodate a household's transitional benefit period and as specified in paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2).\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20273.10\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 273.10(f)(3)(i) (\"Households should be assigned certification periods of at least 6 months, unless the household's circumstances are unstable or the household contains an [able-bodied adult without dependants].\"). Benefit recipients like Mr. Stanley and Mr. Gaines are thus required to recertify eligibility at least every 6-12 months, meaning they can regularly anticipate receiving a recertification notice. It is therefore nearly certain that Mr. Stanley and Mr. Gaines, within a year, will face the possibility of not receiving a recertification notice and losing benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In addition, the record indicates that Mr. Stanley and Mr. Gaines face a sufficiently high risk of experiencing that injury and losing their benefits as a consequence. For instance, other named plaintiffs also attested to a failure to receive a recertification notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Linda Murph [ECF No. 27-20], \u00b6 3 (failure to receive recertification notice in April 2017); Decl. of Kathryn Harris [ECF No. 27-6], \u00b6 4 (failure to receive recertification notice in September 2017). Similarly, other affidavits from class members submitted in support of the motion for a preliminary injunction attest to continuing failures to receive recertification notices leading to the termination of benefits.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Decl. of\n   Yesica Guevara [ECF No. 24-45], \u00b6 11 (failure to receive recertification notice in April 2017 led to termination of benefits); Decl. of Bruce J. Meraviglia [ECF No. 45-43], \u00b6 4 (failure to receive recertification notice in September 2017 led to termination of benefits).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Court is not relying on other class members' failure to receive notices and their resulting injury to establish plaintiffs' standing. However, the fact that the District has repeatedly failed to send notices sheds light on whether it is likely that Mr. Stanley and Mr. Gaines will again suffer a loss of SNAP benefits because of a failure to receive a notice. Though this evidence may have been insufficient to establish a systemic failure to send recertification notices as required for a preliminary injunction,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garnett II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525476\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/147/#p150\">\n    313 F.Supp.3d at 163-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it does suffice to show that Mr. Stanley and Mr. Gaines face \"a realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury\" as required for standing,\n   <em>\n    Arpaio v.

Cir. 2015) (internal quotation omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   This direct injury (the risk of losing SNAP benefits) is traceable to the challenged conduct (failure to provide recertification notices) and redressable by an injunction akin to that the class seeks (one directing the District to send the notices due under law). As such, Mr. Stanley and Mr. Gaines have established standing at this juncture as to Claim 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    3. Claim 3\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In their third claim, the plaintiffs allege that the District is failing to provide written notice of processing delays and of the right to a hearing, in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth and Fifth Amendments and the relevant statute. Am. Compl. \u00b6 173. Since this claim does not correspond to any of the classes the Court certified, it will focus on the individual standing of all the named plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As to Claim 3, the Court agrees with the District that the individual plaintiffs (and Bread for the City) have not adequately alleged standing because they fail to identify an actual injury traceable to the relevant challenged conduct or redressable by the desired relief. The named plaintiffs cannot rely on a statutory violation alone to provide injury, but rather must point to a \"concrete\" harm flowing from the statutory violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1550\">\n    136 S.Ct. 1540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1550,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1550\">\n    194 L.Ed.2d 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). While the loss of benefits (or, for Bread for the City, economic resources) is such a concrete harm, that harm is not traceable to the conduct challenged in Claim 3. The plaintiffs' failure to receive benefits (and Bread for the City's need to expend resources) stems from the District's failure to\n   <em>\n    process applications\n   </em>\n   or to\n   <em>\n    issue recertification notices\n   </em>\n   , not from any failure to provide a notice of delayed processing or of the right to a hearing. Put another way, even if the District had provided notice of any delay in processing and of the right to seek a due process hearing, that would not have altered the fact that the plaintiffs were not receiving the SNAP benefits they were due under the law and thus would not have alleviated the injury that the plaintiffs identify. Accordingly, the plaintiffs have not identified an actual injury that is traceable to the challenged conduct\n   or redressable by the desired relief and lack standing to pursue Claim 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Whether plaintiffs have a cause of action\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The District further argues that even if plaintiffs have standing, they lack a valid cause of action.
